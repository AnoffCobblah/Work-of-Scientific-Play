                               (Abstract.)
   Until quite recently our knowledge of the adventitious roots of
Caiamites was limited to their external form and position on the stem.
Though the structure of the stem itself was so well known, we
remained in complete ignorance of the internal organisation of the
roots.

2                Oh   the  Fossil Plants of the Coal-Measures.         [Nov. 15,
    M. Renault, in 1885, expressed the opinion that the fossils origin
ally described by Dr. Williamson under the name of Astromyelon,* in
which the structure is well-preserved, were the roots of Arthropitus
(our Catamites) and Calamodendron.              He has now found conclusive
proof of the truth of this hypothesis, and in his latest workt he
gives numerous figures of roots, with Astromyelon structure, arising as
appendages on the stems of Galamites, Bomia, and Calamodendron.
    It therefore became necessary to reinvestigate our English
specimens of Astromyelon Williamsonis (from which the French
fossils are said to be specifically distinct) in order to ascertain their
true nature.
    A   specimen in the Williamson collection shows clearly three ap
pendages with the typical structure of Astromyelon, arising from a
main axis which shows structural features characteristic of a
Calamitean stem.          M. Renault's conclusion may, therefore, safely be
extended to the English specimens.
    The structure of the fossils hitherto known as Astromyelon William
sonis has been examined in detail, with a view to determining their
morphological nature. It is found that they present, in all respects,
the characteristics of roots, so far as these can be recognised in fossil
plants.
    In the larger specimens, such as have been found in direct con
nection with the stem ot Galamites, there is a well-marked medulla,
 which is surrounded by a ring of primary xylem-strands, varying in
number, from twenty-five downwards.                  The development of each
xylem-straud was centripetal, for the spiral tracheides lie at the
 external angle of each strand.
    In well-preserved specimens, at an early stage of development, the
 primary phloem can be recognised, alternating with the primary
 strands of wood.        These anatomical features are characteristic of the
 roots of all vascular plants.
     The secondary wood, which has been observed at all stages of de
 velopment, agrees in structure with that of the stem of Catamites.
 In favourable cases the cambium can be seen, and secondary phloem
 has also been found.
     The mode of branching is shown to bo etidogenous.
     There is some evidence that these organs had a double endodermis,
 as is the case in tne roots of the recent Equiseta.
     At the exterior of the cortex (which always had a lacunar zone) a
  protective epidermoidal layer was formed, probably arising from the

cells next below the actual epidermis.     This feature occurs in many
recent roots.
    It is shown incidentally that the doubts expressed by Messrs.
Hick and Cash as to the identification of their " Myriophylloides"
with " Astromyelon
                     " are unfounded. A section of the
                                                            type-specimen
of "Myriophylloides''    has been re-examined, and its structure is
shown to be identical with that of the other specimens of " Astro
myelon."

have    been carefully examined. Many of these rootlets are without
any pith, but they are in other respects identical with the typical
specimens, with which they are connected by an unbroken series of
intermediate   forms.   There are also instances in which rootlets are
found inserted upon the medullate roots.                            i
    The conclusions at which the authors arrive are the following : —
    1. The fossils hitherto described under the name of Astromyelon
 Williamsonis are the adventitious roots of Catamites.
    2. Their structure is in all respects that characteristic of roots, as
is proved by the centripetal primary wood, the alternating strands of
primary wood and phloem, the endogenous mode of branching, and
the absence   of nodes.
    3. The smallest specimens, with little or no medulla, represent the
finest branches  of the same roots, of which the large medullate forms
are the relatively main axes.
    The paper is illustrated by micro-photographs from the actual
specimens, and also by camera-lueida drawings.
II. "On the Ascent of Sap."               By Henry H. Dixon, B.A.
       Assistant to the Professor of Botany, Trinity College,
       Dublin, and J. Jolt, M.A., Sc.D., F.R.S. Received October
       16, 1894.
                                (Abstract.)
    Strasburger's experiments have eliminated the direct action of
living protoplasm from the problem of the ascent of sap, and have
left only the tracheal tissue, as an orgauised structure, and the tran
spiration-activity of the leaf, wherein to seek an explanation of the
phenomenon.       The authors investigate the capability of the leaf to
transpire against excessive atmospheric pressures.       In these experi
ments the leaf was found    able  to bring forward  its water  meniscuses
against the highest pressures attained and freely transpire. Whether
the draught upon the sap established at the leaf during transpiration
 be  regarded as purely capillary or not, these experiments lead the
authors to believe that it alone is quite adequate to effect the eleva
                                                                b 2

4                         On the Ascent  of Sap.              [Nov. 15,
tion by direct tension of the sap in tall trees.    Explanations of the
lifting of the sap from other causes prove inadequate.
    A reconsideration of the principal experiments of previous observers
 and some new experiments of the authors lead to the view that the
ascent is principally in the lumen and not in the wall.
    The explanation of how the tensile stress is transmitted in the
ascending sap without rupture of the column of liquid is found in the
stable condition of this liquid. The state of stability arises from two
circumstances: — the internal stability of a liquid when mechanically
stretched, whether containing dissolved gases or not, and the addi
tional stability conferred by the minutely subdivided structure of the
  onducting tissue, which renders the stressed liquid stable even in
the presence of free gas.
    By direct experiments upon water containing large quantities of
dissolved air, the state of internal stability is investigated.    And,
further, by sealing up in the vessels, in which the water to be put
under tension is contained, chips of the wood of Taxus baccata, the
authors find that their presence in no case gives rise to rupture of
the stressed liquid, but that this occurs preferably anywhere else,
and usually on the glass walls. The establishment of tensile stress
is effected in the usual way, by cooling the completely filled vessel.
A measurement possessing considerable accuracy afforded 7i atmos
pheres as being attained in some of the experiments.
   Tbe second condition of stability arises directly from the property
of the pit-membranes to oppose the passage of free gas, whiie they are
freely permeable to the motion of a liquid.     Hence a chance develop
ment of free gas is confined in effect to the minute dimensions of the
compartment in which it is evolved, and this one lumen alone is
rendered for the time being non-conducting.       On the other hand, in
the water-filled portion of the tracheal tissue, the closing membranes,
occupying the median and least obstructive position, the motion of
the stressed sap is freely allowed.    The structure of the conducting
tissue is, in fact, a configuration conferring stability on a stressed
liquid in the presence (from various causes) of free gas. As neither
free gas nor unwetted dust particles can ascend with the sap, the
authors contend that the state of tensile stress necessary to their
hypothesis is inevitably induced.
    The energy relations of the leaf with its surroundings, on the
assumption that evaporation at capillary water-surfaces is mainly
responsible for the elevation of sap, may be illustrated by the well-
known power of the water-filled porous pot to draw up mercury in a
tube to which it is sealed.    The authors describe an engine in which
the energy entering in the form of heat at the capillary surfaces may
be in part utilised to do mechanical work : a battery of twelve small
porous pots, freely exposed to the air, keeping up the continuous

rotation of a fly-wheel.       Replacing the porous pots by a transpiring
branch, this too maintains the wheel in rotation.              This is, in fact, a
vegetable engine.        In short,  the transpiration   effects  going on at the
leaf are, in so far as they are the result of spontaneous evaporation
and uninfluenced by other physiological phenomena, of the
                                                                        " sorting

demon        class, in which the evaporating surface plays the part of a
sink of thermal energy.
     If the tensile stress in the sap is transmitted to the root, the
 authors suggest that this will establish in the capillaries of the root-
 snrface meniscuses competent to condense water rapidly from the
 surrounding soil.        They show by experiment the power possessed
 even by a root injured by lifting from the soil, of condensing water
 vapour from a damp atmosphere.             Such a state of things may be
 illustrated by a system (which the authors realised) consisting of two
 porous pots connected by a tube and all filled with water ; one, the
                                                                          "

III. " The Pigments of the Pieridse. A Contribution to                the  Study
        of Excretory Substances which function in Ornament." By
        F. Gowland Hopkins, Demonstrator of Physiology and
        Chemistry at Guy's Hospital, London. Communicated by
        Professor E. Ray Lankest¦r, F.R.S. Received October 5.
        1894.
                                   (Abstract.)
     The paper deals    with the chemistry of the wing pigments of that
group of butterflies       known    as the Pieridse,   and     demonstrates the
excretory nature of these pigments.           The 'following are the salient
facts dealt with, most of the statements being based on original obser
vations described in the paper : —
     1. The wing scales of the white Pieridse are shown to contain uric
acid, this substance bearing the same relation to the scale as do the
pigments in the coloured Pieridse, and therefore functioning prac
tically as a white pigment.
     2. The yellow     pigment which is so widely distributed in the
Pieridss (being found in the majority of the genera) is shown to be
a derivative of uric acid.
     3. The properties of this yellow       pigment are described, and the
results of its analysis are given.         The pigments of various yellow-
coloured genera are shown to be identical.
     4. It is shown that this yellow pigment may be artificially pro
 duced by heating uric acid with water in sealed tubes at high tem

peratures.      The product so obtained was originally described            by
                                      "
Hlasiwetz as " mycomelic acid ; but evidence is brought forward              to
show that the substance described and analysed by this chemist was
in reality urate of ammonium coloured by a. yellow body, probably
identical with the natural pigment.
   5. The identity of the natural and artificial products is demon
strated by the fact that both yield under like treatment a purple
derivative, which has a well-marked and easily identified absorption
spectrum.
   6. The artificial yellow product has not yet been obtained in a pure
condition, but it may be so far purified as to exhibit clearly all the
general properties of the natural pigment.
   7. The natural pigment as prepared for analysis is shown to be
almost certainly a chemical individual.           Its probable constitution is
discussed.
   8.  It   is shown that this yellow substance (denominated in the
          "
paper        Lepidotic acid "), together with a closely allied red sub
stance, will account for all the chemical pigmentation of the wing
scales of the coloured Pieridae, though modifications may be produced
by superadded optical effects. The black pigment found in the group
is not dealt with in the paper.
   9. The described uric acid derivatives, though universal in the
Pieridab, are apparently confined to this group among the Rhopalocera.
This fact enables the interesting observation to be made, that where
a Pierid mimics an insect belonging to another family, the pigments
in the two cases are chemically quite distinct.          This is well seen in
the genera Leptalis and Mechanitis respectively.
   10. The existence of pigments other than scale-pigments is for the
first time described ; substances, namely, which are found between
the wing membranes, and which, in certain genera, are the basis of
ornament.
    11. The fact that the scale-pigments are really the normal excre
tory products of the animal utilised in ornament, is emphasised by the
observation that the yellow Pierids, on emergence from the chrysalis,
are apt to void from the rectum a quantity of uric acid coloured bv a
yellow substance which exactly resembles the pigment of the wing.

                                  (Abstract.)
    This research was    originally undertaken by Professor Schuster and
Mr. H. Hadley, before the authors were aware that Mr. E. H. Griffiths
was engaged on a similar investigation.          After a number of pre
liminary    experiments, and just as the final arrangements for the
conduct     of the measurements were being definitely made, Mr.
Hadley, on his appointment to the Head Mastership of the School
of Science and Art, Kidderminster, had to leave Manchester.             In
the meantime Mr. Griffiths' important research was published, and
we had to consider whether our own work, which was designed           on a
smaller scale, could compete with it in accuracy.           We decided to
complete the investigation, principally for the reason that, although
we both aimed at determining what is commonly called the mechani
cal equivalent of heat through the heating of a certain mass of water
by means      of an electric current, the details of the experiments
 differed very materially, so that our two ways of dealing with the
problem seemed to afford a useful test of the amount of agreement
which at    present may be obtained.      Our investigation touches only a
 small part  of that treated by Mr. Griffiths, as we did not attempt to
 measure the changes in the specific heat of water due to change of
 temperature.    On the other hand, the more modest limits within
 which we have confined ourselves allowed us to use a much simpler
 apparatus.
    On   Mr. Hadley's departure, Mr. W. Gannon took his place.       From
 the  former gentleman we received a good deal of help in the divising
 and construction of some important parts of the apparatus.
    The principle of the method we have used is extremely simple.
 The electrical work done in a conductor being measured by j ECifa,
 where E is the difference of potential at the ends of the conductor,
 C the current, and t the time. We keep the electromotive force con
 stant, and measure
                       J Cdt directly by a silver voltameter. We do not,
 therefore, require to know the resistance of the wire, and we thus
 avoid the difficulty of having to estimate the excess of temperatnre
 of the wire over that of the water in which it is placed.        We also
  gain the advantage of not having to measure time, and therefore of
  being able to complete the experiments mere quickly than we could

have safely done   if the length of time the current passed bad to be
measured with great accuracy.
                                 The Results.
   We divide our experiments into three series, hut only attach any
value to the third, as during the first two sets the thermometer was
falling in the last period. W e bad hoped at first to be able to apply
a small correction to eliminate the error which is due to the fact that
a falling thermometer will read too high, and we made a large number
of experiments to determine the correction.          We arrived, however,
at the result that the indications of a falling thermometer are so
irregular that no correction is possible.        Consequently iu our third
series the thermometer was rising during the whole course of each
experiment.
   We think it worth while to put on record an impression that the
behaviour of our Baudin thermometer has altered since we first
received it from the maker. As soon as it came some preliminary
experiments were made to see if we could work with the thermo
meter while it was falling, and the observations seemed to show that
the fall was sufficiently uniform. Our first three experiments gave
results which were very consistent, and a minute after the current was
broken the temperature seemed to fall already in a perfectly regular
manner. But as we continued our work, the behaviour of the instru
ment seemed to deteriorate.        Thus, in our experiment on March 8,
the temperature had hardly fallen three minutes after the current
had stopped. It is possible that this is due to accidental circum
stances, for it is well known that different places of the bore of a
capillary tube behave very differently.       We wish, therefore, to ex
press no opinion at present as to the probability of an actual change
in the thermometer, but only to draw the attention of other experi
menters to this point, which seems worth keeping in mind.
   Our final value is
     J=   4-1804  Joules on the mercury scale of hard French glass,
          4" 1905 on  the nitrogen scale,
          41917 on the hydrogen scale,
                        at a temperature of 19°-1.
   This result depends on the assumption          that the electrochemical
equivalent of silver is 0 001118, and that our standard Clark cell had
an electromotive force of

as    given by    Kahle (' Zeits. f. Instrumeutenkunde,'            vol. 13, p. .310,
1893).      Glazebrook    and  Skinner's   coefficient   refers to a mean tempera
ture of 7°-5, and is identical with the above at that temperature.
     The comparison of the results of different observers will be facili
tated by Table I, in which we compare the work done in ergs with
the foot-pound at Greenwich and the kilogrammetre at Paris.                     This
table has been calculated ou the assumption that g at Paris is equal
to 980-96, and at Greenwich equal to 981 -24.                   We have prepared
another table (II), which at any temperature will give the correc
tion of an interval measured on our mercury thermometer to an in
terval measured on the nitrogen and hydrogen thermometers.                      This
table has been calculated with the help of the equation given by
I-happuis for the correction to the thermometer made of Freuch hard
class.
     In comparing our results        with that of other observers, we have in
the    first  place to consider the value which         Mr. Griffiths has obtained
in his very        excellent series of measurements.               His final result

                       J = 4-1982(1-0       00266    0^15) x 10'.
This     refers to the nitrogen thermometer. At a temperature of 19-1°,
the value would be reduced to 4-1936, which corresponds to our
41905 at the same temperature.               Griffiths' value is to be increased
lightly, owing         to  the  fact  that    he really measures the difference
 between the specific heat of water and of air.                This would increase
the value of      J  by "0011   about,  so that   the  value  of  J  at 191° would
be raised to 4-1947 x 10', which           is exactly one part in a thousand
 larger than ours.        The difference is small, but must be due to some
systematic      error,  as both Griffiths' value and our own agree so well
with each other, that ordinary observational errors and accidental
 disturbances could not have produced so large a difference in our
 results.     The least satisfactory part of a calorimetric measurement
 must always be the application of the cooling correction, and we have
 considered it of great importance to reduce that correction as much
 as possible.      The uncertainty of the cooling correction does not
 necessarily depend on its value ; thus we can much diminish it by
 starting, as we have done in the third series, with the initial tem
 perature of the calorimeter about as much below that of the water
 jacket as the final temperature is above it ; yet the uncertainty of the
 correction does not seem to us to be diminished by that process.                We
 "iay    reasonably estimate     the uncertainty      due  to the cooling    correc
 tion, by    calculating what the error in the observed rate of cooling,
 cither at the    beginning or the end of the experiment, must have been
   ii order to
                 produce a difference of one part in a thousand in the
  anal result.     We find in our own experiments that the error must

have amounted to more         than   15 per cent.     We consider it unlikely
that so large an error occurred always         in the same direction.    Apart
from the cooling correction, however, it is difficult to see how a differ
ence of one-tenth per cent. in our result can be produced unless by
the accumulation of a number of small errors.
    The weak point of Mr. Griffiths' determination is the small qunn-
tity of water he uses, his result depending on the difference in his
rate of rise after the addition of about 120 grams into his calori
meter.     The highest water equivalent with which he worked was
about 360 grams, of which 85 are due to the calorimeter itself.
The chief objection to the use of such small quantities of water
lies in the great cooling correction.            In the experiments quoted
by    him  at  p.  482,   the   loss of heat  due   to radiation and conduc
tion at the end of his experiment amounts to about 9 per cent.
of his heat supply.        If such loss had been wrongly estimated to
 1 per cent., an error of one-tenth per cent. would         result in the final
 value.    The consistency of Mr. Griffiths' results shows that if an
error occurred due to that cause, it must have been systematic ;
and we may point out how, with such a large cooling correction,
 serious errors may arise.        In applying the cooling correction, it is
always    assumed   that  the  loss  of heat depends only on the difference
of temperature between the calorimeter and enclosure ; but, as has
 teen already pointed out, this is not the case as regards conduction.
 Mr. Griffiths' calorimeter was suspended by three stout glass tubes,
 through one of which the stirrer was passing. The exhaustion in the
 space surrounding the calorimeter was never sufficient to do away with
 the conduction of air ; so that we may take the larger part of the cool
 ing to be due to conduction and convection.           The loss of heat in that
 case must to some extent depend, not only on the temperature, but
 also on the rate of change of temperature.          Whether the part which
 depends    on the rate of change is sufficient to produce a sensible
 difference in the result, it is not easy to say.      But the error produced
 would, with different currents and quantities of water, be the same in
 all cases, and could not therefore be detected by the inconsistencies
  thereby introduced into the results.
     The difference between our value of the equivalent and that of
  Mr. Griffiths are, however, of smaller importance than the difference
  which exists between them and the equivalent as determined directly
  by Joule, Rowland, and Miculescu.         Joule's latest value, which is the
  only  one   which    needs     consideration,   is 772-65 foot-pounds, at
  61a7 Fah.     The number refers to the degree as measured by Joule's
  mercury thermometer.         Rowland adds to this a correction to the air
  thermometer of about 3, and another small correction for a change in
  the heat capacity of the apparatus, which brings the value up to about
   776.  The correction to the air thermometer has been obtained by

   30              Prof. A. Schuster and Mr. W. Gannon.            [Nov. 22,
   means of a comparison made by       Joule himself with one of Rowland's
   thermometers.     Joule's original thermometers have been temporarily
  placed by Mr. B. A. Joule in the hands of Professor Schuster,
  in order that an accurate comparison may be instituted between it
  and modern thermometers.          A full description of the comparisons
  made will be given on another occasion.        The result arrived at shows
  that the correction is less than that assumed by Rowland, and would
  brin^ his value up only to 775 at the temperature indicated. Griffiths
  compares his result with that deduced by Rowland from Joule's
  observations.     Rowland combined the different values obtained by
  Joule in his various investigations, attaching weights according to
  his judgment as to their relative merits. He finds in this way that
  the difference between him and Joule amounts to one part in 350, bat
 if eqnal weights are attached to all Joule's results, the difference is
 reduced to one part in 4281.       Little value can be attached, however,
 to a combination of Joule's results which gives equal weights to that
 obtained in 1847 and that deduced from hi3 latest and most careful
 work. There is, moreover, in Rowland's table a misprint or error in
 the reduction of Joule's 1847 result from foot-pounds to kilogram-
 metres, which lowers the value as given by Griffiths from 779"2 to
 about 778. It does not seem to us advisable to go beyond Joule's
 1878 results, and the value assigned by him in this latest research
 should be taken as giving his final judgment on the matter. Reducing
 to the nitrogen thermometer of the Bureau International, Joule's
result is 775 foot-pounds at Greenwich, at a temperature of l60-5 C.
At the same temperature Griffiths' number is 779-8.
     Great weight must be attached to Rowland's determination, which
at the temperature to which Joule's number applies is 777"6, and at
 19°"l, 776-1, corresponding to our 778 5. Rowland's value is there
fore halfway between our and Joule's result. But it mast be taken
into consideration that if the comparison between Rowland's and
Joule's thermometers as made by the latter is to be trusted, Rowland-s
                          "       "
value referred to the Paris nitrogen thermometer would be slightly
reduced. At any rate it seems probable that if his value is in error, it
is rather in the direction of being too high.           We have therefore a
difference of three parts in a thousand to account for between our
result and that of Rowland, and of nearly four parts in a thousand
between Griffiths and Rowland at a temperature of 19°-1. These
results are summarised in the following table : —-

    We now turn to an investigation of Miculescu ('Annalesde Chimie
 et de Physiqae,' vol. 27, 1892), in v/hich the mechanical equivalent
of heat is measured directly by what seems a very excellently
devised series of experiments.           Its result is 4 1857 X 107. He does
 not state the exact temperature to which this applies, but all his
 experiments       seem to have been made between 10° and 13°, so
 that we may nssume 110,5 to be the mean temperature of his experi
 ments.      Rowland's value at that temperature is 41099 X 10'. We
 meat   draw attention to one point in Miculescu's work which requires
clearing up before we can give to           it any decisive value.    Everything
in the    experiments depends on the measurement of a couple, the arm
of the     couple being the distance between two knife-edges: one of
them had to support a weight of more than 43 kilograms.                  The dis
tance between these knife-edges is said to have been 28 cms. in all
experiments.        Very insufficient information is given, however, as to
how that distance was measured, and it would almost seem as if the
author had trusted to the maker            in adjusting the central knife-edge
to the   zero point of that scale.        If  the apparatus is still in existence,
it might be well to make sure that no error has been introduced
through a wrong estimate          of the distance of the lever arm.
   In order to compare Miculescn's value with that of others, we must
apply   a temperature        correction which is somewhat doubtful ; but
taking the mean of Rowland's and Griffiths' values as the most pro
bable at present, we obtain at 15° the following table: —
       Table IV. — Equivalent in foot-pounds at Greenwich at             15°
               referred to the " Paris " Nitrogen Thermometer.
                                                                    Schuster and
     Joule.          Rowland.        Miculescu.       Griffiths.       Gannon.

   If  we remember        that Rowland's nnmber referred to the "Paris"
nitrogen thermometer           would probably be smaller by one unit, we
are  struck with the fair agreement there is, on the one hand, between
the  results of Joule, Rowland, and Miculescu, and on the other hand
between      Griffiths and ourselves.
   As far as we         can   draw any conclusions from the comparison, it
seems to point to a difference in the value obtained by the electrical
and direct methods.          Whether this difference is due to some remain
ing  error    in the  electrical  units, or to some undiscovered flaw in the
method       adopted by Mr. Griffiths and ourselves, remains to be
decided     by further investigation.

     Science has lost severely during the past year.           In the list of
 Fellows deceased, which I have read to you, you have heard the
 names of Tyndall, Milnes Marshall, Van Beneden, Pengelly, Brown-
 Sequard, Romanes, Alder Wright, Helmholtz, Marignac, Topley, all
 well known to you as having been in their lives zealous and success-
 fill scientific investigators, who have largely contributed to the object
 for which the Royal Society works, " The Increase of Natural Know
 ledge."     Tyndall, full of fire and enthusiasm in solid experimental
 work advancing the boundaries of science, contributed largely, by
 his brilliant lectures and books, to make science popular, as it now is
 in England and America.          By the sad death of Milnes Marshall on
 Scawfell, in Cumberland, on the last day of 1893, we lost a young,
 able, and enthusiastic worker in zoology.          A few months later, we
  lost the veteran Pengelly, who did so much for geological science,
  and gave such delightful and valuable lessons to the larger world of

the most difficult problems that have ever occupied the mind of man,

of 46.
                                             I
   A year ago, in my anniversary address, called your attention to
Hertz's experimental demonstration of electric waves, which he
found in working out an experimental problem originally proposed by
Helmholtz to him when he was engaged in experimental researches
in the Physical Institute of Berlin in 1879.   An English translation
by Jones, of Hertz's book describing his work on electric waves,
dedicated "with gratitude
                            " to Helmholtz, was
                                                 published in England
and America in December, 1893.       On the first day of the new year
the disciple died, and within the year the master followed him.    Of
the whole of Helmholtz's great and splendid work in physiology,
physics, and mathematics,    I  doubt whether any one man may be
qualified to speak with the power which knowledge and understand
ing can give: but we can all appreciate, to some degree, the vast
services which he has rendered to biology by the application of his
mathematical genius and highly trained capacity for experimental
research to physiological investigation.
   In his interesting autobiographical sketch he tells us that his early
natural inclination was for physics, which he found more attractive
than purely geometrical and algebraic studies ; but his father could
only give him the opportunity of studying physics by his learning
medicine to earn a livelihood, and he himself was by no means averse
to thus entering on the study of living matter instead of confining
h-mself to the physics of dead matter. I think we may now feel that
the world has gained largely by this early necessity for a young man
of great genius and power to choose a practioal profession.
   One early result was his careful examination, while still a student,
 of the theory of animal heat, and a little later (1847) his great essay,
'
  Qeber die Erhaltung der Kraft,' Conservation of Energy as we now
call it,communicated to the Physical Society of Berlin on the 3rd July-
1847, of which he said in 1891, "My aim was merely to give     a  critical
investigation and arrangement of the facts for the benefit of physio
logists."    As a student he had found that Stahl's theory, ascribing to
                                                        " The
every living body the possession of the property of            Perpetual
          "
Motion      as an essence of its " Vital force," was still held by most
physiologists.    His essay on the "Conservation of Energy," giving
strong reasons for rejecting that theory, though looked upon, at first.
 by many of the physical and philosophical authorities of the time as
a  fantastic speculation, was enthusiastically welcomed      by younger

Etudent-philosophers, and must soon have convinced the elder men
that, whatever may be the real efficiency of vitality, vast and wonder
ful as it is, it does nut include the performance of work without
drawing upon a source of energy. This conclusion had been virtually
foreseen before the end of last century by Rumford aud Davy, and
had    been   clearly stated and powerfully supported by Joule and
Mayer a     few years before Helmholtz found it for himself and success
fully persuaded others of its truth.
    It is interesting for us now to know that, while thus contributing
so effectively     to the abandonment of the old doctrine that vital
"force" can work without drawing on an external source of energy,
Helmholtz was even more effectively concerned in the establishment of
a new doctrine which has given a vast extension to the province of life,
previously perhaps undreamt of, but now universally recognised as
thoroughly well established, and supremely important in modern
physiology and medicine. On recovering from a typhus fever in the
autumn of 1841, at the age of 20, the last year of his undergraduate
course in the Army Medical              School of the Friedrich Wilhelm's
Institute, he spent the accumulations of his income, which free treat
ment at the hospital during his illness had left him, in the purchase
of a microscope, an instrument then but little used in medical educa
 tion. He began immediately to use it, and made some important
 observations on the ganglion cells of invertebrates, which, at the
 suggestion of his master, Johannes Miiller, he took as the subject of
 his inaugural thesis for the doctor's degree, in November, 1842, and
 which was his first published work.*          With the same microscope, he
 observed vibrios in putrefying liquids, which he described in his
 second published paper (1843),
                                        " On the Nature of Putrefaction and
  Fermentation."       His distinguished comrade, Schwann, in the labora
 tory of Johannes Miiller, had already shown that vegetable cells are
  present in fermenting solutions of sugar, and that air, which had
  been highly heated, was incapable of exciting the fermentation which
  the access of      ordinary atmospheric air was known to produce.
  Uelmholtz found that oxygen, yielded by the decomposition of water
  in Basks containing small pieces of boiled meat, did not produce
  pntrefaction.    Thus the doctrine, held perhaps by all before them,
  and certainly supported by the great Liebig, that putrefaction and
  fermentation are purely chemical processes of eremacausis (or slow
  combustion),    produced by oxygen, was thoroughly disprove 1 by the
  two  young investigators.       But Helmholtz went farther, and showed
  almost certainly that the actual presence of a living creature, vibrio,
  as he called    it, bacterium, as we more commonly call it now, is
   necessary  for   either fermentation or putrefaction.          Ho proved by
   experiment that a partition of moist bladder, between the yeast and
           * HelmholU's   '
                            Wbsenschaftliche Abhandlungen,' vol. 2, p. 663.

the fermentable liquid, prevented the entrance of the vibrios which
he had observed, and prevented the fermentation.                  It had been
reasonably suggested that fermentation or putrefaction might be a
purely chemical process produced by a quasi-chemical agent or
poison secreted by a living organism; but Helmholtz's observation
disproved this supposition almost certainly, because any such chem
ical substance in solution would pass by diffusion through the
bladder, and produce its effect without any direct action of the living
creatures. Although Helmholtz himself was characteristically philo
sophical and conscientious in not claiming, as absolutely proved,
what he had only rendered probable, it is certain that this early work
of his on putrefaction and fermentation constituted a very long step
towards the great generalisation of Pasteur, adverse to spontaneous
generation, and decisive in attributing to living creatures, born from
previous living creatures, not only fermentation and putrefaction, but
a vast array of the virulent diseases and blights, which had been most
destructive to men, and the lower animals and crops and fruits. It
is well that Helmholtz himself lived to see the great benefits con
ferred on mankind by Pasteur's work; and by the annulment of the
 deadliness of compound fractures and the abolition of hospital
 gangrene in virtue of Lister's antiseptic treatment ; and by the
 sanitary defences against fevers and blights, realised by many other
 distinguished men as practical applications of the science which his
 own typhus fever of 1841 helped so much to create.
    Close after his work on this subject and on animal heat, followed
 investigations on the velocity of transmission along the sensory
 nerves of the disturbance to which sensation is due, the time which
 the person perceiving the sensation takes to decide what to do in
 consequence, and the velocity of transmission of his orders along the
 motor nerves to the muscles which are to carry out his will. Results
 of the highest scientific interest and of largo practical importance
 were given in two great papers published in 1850.*                 These were
 followed a few years later by his ""Tonempfindungen,"                   a great
 work, not merely confined to the perception of sound, but including
 mathematical and experimental investigations on the inanimate
 external influences concerned in sound, investigation of the anatom
 ical structure of the ear in virtue of which it perceives sound, and
  applications to the philosophical foundation of the musical art.
  which holds a unique position in the literature of philosophy, and is
  certainly a splendid monument to the genius and indomitable working
  power of its author.         Anothor great work of Helmholtz is his
  " Physiologische
                      Optik ; " who shall say which of the two books is
  the more important, the more interesting, or the more valuable:
  Each of them has all these qualities to a wonderfully high degree.

 Perhaps the most interesting of his experimental investigations in
physiological optics was the measurements, by his ophthalmometer,
 of the  curvatures of the several refracting surfaces constituting the
 lens-system of the eye, from which he ascertained that it is almost
altogether by changing the curvature of the front surface of the
 crystalline lens that the eye is accommodated by its possessor to
 vision at different distances.       His ophthalmoscope, by which for the
first time he himself saw and showed to others the retina of the
living eye, was a splendid and precious contribution to medicine. By
allowing that outlying portion of the brain to be distinctly seen and
examined, it has shown the cause of many illnesses which had been
regarded as hopelessly obscure ; and for diagnosis and guidance of
medical treatment, it is now continually used not only by oculists,
but by   general practitioners.
                       I
    Constrained as feel not to overtax your patience,              I  find it impos
sible on the present occasion, to enter upon Helmholiz's researches
in mathematics and mathematical physics farther than just to mention
his small but exquisite paper on anomalous dispersion, and the grand
contribution to hydrodynamics which we have in his " Integrals of
the Hydrodynamical Equations which express Vortex Motion."*
    Since our last anniversary, important questions regarding the
conduct of the ordinary meetings and the publication of papers, both
in the 1 Transactions ' and ' Proceedings ' of the Royal Society, have
been engaging the attention of the Council, with the assistance of a
Committee appointed on the 5th July, 1893.                The final report of this
Committee was submitted to the Council on the 5th July, 1894, when
resolutions were adopted accepting some of its recommendations and
deferring the consideration of others until after the recess.
   At the request of the Royal Geographical Society, a Committee
was appointed by the Council of the Royal Society to consider the
advisability of asking the Government to undertake an Antarctic
Expedition.      A very important and valuable Report on the advan
tages which such an expedition would bring,                  both to science and
to practical     navigation, was presented by this Commiltee to the
Council on the 24th May. The Council, after much careful consider
ation, resolved to ask the Lords of the Admiralty to grant an inter
view on the subject with representatives of the Royal Society.                  This
request was assented to : and an interview was accordingly held
between the First Lord of the Admiralty and representatives of the
Hoyal Society; bnt the proposal of an Antarctic Expedition was not
favourably received.

the following resolutions : —

   (1) That the proceeds be applied in the form of a studentship or
           grant, to be awarded every second year, to assist research,
           especially among younger men, in those branches of physical

   II. That a sum of £100, which is now, or shortly will be, available,
for the first studentship or grant be awarded in accordance with
Regulation 4.
   The first appointment was accordingly         made  on the 21st   June,
1894, when it was resolved : —
        " That    a  Joule Scholarship of the Royal Society Memorial
    (1)
           Fund     be awarded to Mr. J. D. Chorlton, of Owens College,
           Manchester, for the purpose of enabling him to carry on
           certain researches on lines laid down by Dr. Joule, more
           especially with the view of determining the constants of
           some of the instruments employed by Dr. Joule, which can
           be placed at his disposal by his representatives."
        "
   (2) That the value of the Scholarship be £100, payable quarterly,
           on the certificate from the authorities of Owens College
           that the researches are being conducted in a satisfactory
           manner."
   On the occasion of Sir George Buchanan's retirement from the
post of Chief Medical Officer to the Local Government Board, it
was decided by some of his friends that a testimonial should be pre
sented to him, and a sum, amounting to about £340, has been sub
scribed by medical officers of health, sanitary engineers, and others
interested in sanitary science.     It was resolved, on the suggestion of

 Sir George Buchanan himself, that this testimonial should take the
 form of a medal, to be awarded periodically for work done in con
 nection   with sanitary science, and that the Royal Society should be
 asked to    administer the testimonial fund under the following con
 ditions : —
     1. The money collected, after      paying expenses   incurred, to be
 devoted —
     (0) To the foundation of a Gold Medal      of the value as nearly as
           may be of twenty guineas, with       a portrait of Sir George
           Buchanan on the one side and an appropriate design on the
           other, to be awarded every three or five years in respect of
           distinguished services to Hygienic Science or Practice, in the
           direction either of original research or of professional, ad
           ministrative, or constructive work.

           (remaining after paying for the Medal and discharging the
           incidental expenses) which has accumulated since the last
           award.
    2.  The Medal to be awarded without limit of nationality or sex.
    The Council of the Royal Society has accepted the Trust under
these conditions ; and it was agreed that the first medal should be
given to Lady Buchanan by the testimonialists themselves.
    The Catalogue Department has been specially active in the past
session.     Mr. Ludwig Mond's generous gift of £2000, which            I
announced to the Society in my Anniversary Address last year, has
given a new impulse to our operations in that department, and
enabled us to increase the staff of assistants.    Under the able super
intendence of Miss Chambers, Volume 10 of the Catalogue under
authors' names has been completed, and was issued in June of the
present year.      The Society is indebted to several members of the
Catalogue Committee who have lent their scientific knowledge to aid
in the revision of the proofs, and especially to the Treasurer, under
whuse     experienced eye every sheet in the Catalogue has passed.
The preparation of copy for a supplementary volume, which will
include papers from a large number of periodicals not included in the
existing volumes, is now nearing completion.
    The Catalogue Committee have held several meetings and discussed
some important qnestious.      The proposed subject-index to the exist
ing Catalogue has been the chief matter under consideration, and
the burning question of the respective merits of an alphabetical and
a classified    index has been so far settled as to make it possible to
commence the work of transcription and translation, nearly 40,U00
 slips being already finished, so that when the details of the plan
 agreed npon have been finally settled, as there is good hope they will

 be speedily proceeded with.      Before, however, any final steps can be
 taken, it will be necessary that the supplement volume of the cata
 logue should have issued from the press.      The preparations for this
 volume are in active progress.
    A kindred subject, but one of still wider scope, has been discussed
 by a Special Committee appointed by the Council at their first meet
 ing in the present session.      The question, namely, of a scientific
 subject-catalogue, which it is proposed to carry out by means of
 international co-operation. This Committee, with the sanction of the
 Council, have addressed a circular letter to scientific societies and in
 stitutions in this country and abroad, proposing by way of preliminary
 suggestions, first, that the Catalogue should commence with the next
 century; secondly, that a central office or bureau shonld be main
 tained by international     contributions;  and third, that this office
 should be supplied with all the information necessary for the con
 struction of the Catalogue.      The circular invites the views on this
 subject of scientific bodies and scientific men, without in any way
 committing the Society to farther action. A large number of replies
 to this circular have been received, many of them carefully prepared
 and able documents. They will be submitted to the new Council of
 the Royal Society, and will,   I am sure, be most valuable in assisting
 it to judge as to future proceedings.
    The principal question which the Library Committee have had
 before them during the past session is the accumulation of the stock
 of ' Philosophical Transactions ' from the beginning of the century to
the present time. New racks have been erected in tho basement
which have partly relieved the pressure on our space, but the Com
mittee recognise the necessity of some active measures being taken to
increase the sale of this accumulated stock. They are of opinion that
the sale mi<*ht be much facilitated if the memoirs composing the
volumes published in the past were made separately available to the
public, as is done with those that are published at the present time.
On the advice of the Committee, the Council have empowered the
Treasurer to treat with one of the leading booksellers with the view
of bringing some such arrangement into effect.
    The collection of marble busts belonging to the Society, which is
of such personal and historical interest to all our Fellows, has received
most important nnd valuable accessions.         The sons of our former
President, Mr. William Spottiswoode         — Messrs. Hugh and Cyril
Spottiswoode    — have  presented to the Society a marble bust of their
father, by Woolner, which will find in our apartments a fitting home
among the busts of many of our former Presidents and distinguished
Fellows, and will hand down to posterity a striking likeness of one
who deserved so well of the Society and whose premature decease we

all still deplore.       Earlier in the session, Mr. Alfred W. Dollond pre
sented     a marble bust by Garland, of his great-uncle, George Dollond,
F.R.S., who himself presented a bust of John Dollond, in 1843, by
the same sculptor.
     The House and Soiree Committee bave discussed the advisability
of increasing the accommodation in the tea room, and have presented
a report to the Council upon the subject.              The Council, while not
disagreeing with this report, considered it wiser, in the present state
of finances, to defer the matter for a time.
     A third Report of the Water Research Committee has been issued
during the present year. It gives the results of further experiments
                                               " Action of Light on Bacillus
 by Professor Marshall Ward on the
 Anthracis," and on the " Bacteria of the Thames," and the experi
 ments of Professor Percy Frankland on the " Behaviour of the
Typhoid Bacillus and of the Bacillus Coli Communis in Potable
 Water," the whole filling 242 octavo pages.
      Unusually large as was the amount of matter published last year,
 this year the amount is even larger.              In the mathematical and
                               1
 physical section of the         Philosophical Transactions,' seventeen papers
 have been published, eighteen in the biological section.              The two
 sections together contain, in all, 1992 pages of letterpress, and
  112 plates; to which must be added eight or ten papers now passing
 through the press, and probably to be issued before the close of the
                    '
 year. Of the Proceedings,' ten numbers have been issued, contain
  ing 1026 pages.          As a result, the finances of the Society are, 1
  regret    to say,   in  not  such a satisfactory condition as could be de
  sired.     The cost of the publications, which, last year, was far in
  excess of what it was in previous years, and of what the Society
  could really afford, has, in the year 1894, amounted to nearly
   £3260, or about £90 more than it was in 1893.               For lithography
  and    engraving alone £1516 have been paid, as against £977 last
  year.     There is, moreover, an accumulation of printed matter now
   almost in readiness to be issued, the cost of which has still to be
   defrayed.     To meet this extraordinary expenditure it has been
   necessary to sell out enough of the Society's funded capital to pro
   duce £1000, and rigorous retrenchment will be necessary in order
   to avoid further loss of provision for continued            work in future.
   While the Council feels the importance of all the publications of the
   Society being as completely illustrated and as fully detailed as the
   subjects discussed may require, it is evident that some check must bo
    placed on the extent of the publications, and the best manner of effect
    ing this end is occupying the careful attention of the Council.
       The establishment of the Faraday -Davy Research Laboratory, in
     connexion with the Royal Institution, is a splendid benefaction which
     science has gained during the past year, through the untiring and

grand generosity of Mr. Ludwig Mond.          The Royal Society interests
itself in all work contributing towards the object for which it was
founded — the increase of natural knowledge ; and while gratefully
remembering the assistance so generously given to it in the humble but
highly valuable work of cataloguing papers which describe the results
of scientific investigations already made, it hails with delight this grand
foundation of a practical laboratory, of which the purpose is not the
teaching of scientific truths already discovered, but the conquer
ing of fresh provinces from the great region of the unknown in
Nature.
   The greatest scientific event of the past year is, to my mind, un
doubtedly the discovery of a new constituent of our atmosphere.     If
anything conld add to the interest which we must all feel in      this
startling discovery, it is the consideration of the way by which it
was found. In his Presidential address to Section A of the meeting
of the British Association at Southampton in 1882, Lord Rayleigh,
after calling attention to Prout's law, according to which the atomic
weights of the chemical elements stand in simple relationship to that
of hydrogen, said : — " Some chemists have reprobated strongly the
importation of d priori views into the consideration of the ques
tion, and maintain that the only numbers worthy of recognition are
the immediate 'results of experiment.    Others, more impressed by
the arjument that the close approximations to simple numbers cannot
be merely fortuitous, and more alive to the inevitable imperfections
of our measurements, consider that the experimental evidence against
the simple numbers is of a very slender character, balanced, if not
outweighed, by the a priori argument in favour of simplicity. The
subject is eminently one for further experiment; and as it is now
engaging the attention of chemists, we may look forward to the
settlement of the question by the present generation.  The time has,
perhaps, come when a re-determination       of the densities of the
principal gases may be desirable —  an undertaking for which    have      I
made some preparations."     The arduous work thus commenced in
1882, has been continued for 12 years,* by Rayleigh, with unremit
ting perseverance. After 11 years of        first important part of

all possible       accuracy was attained by the comparison,* of Scott's
determination of the ratio of the volumes of hydrogen and oxygen
in the constitution          of wat-er, with Rayleigh's determination of the
ratio of the densities.          The result was 15 82, which is almost 1 per
cent. (087        per  cent.) less than the 16, which it would be according
to Prout's law.          It is very slightly less        per cent.) than Dittmar
and Henderson's value obtained                 by an investigation-)- for which
the Graham medal of the                   Glasgow Philosophical Society was
awarded in 1890.            Values, not quite so small as these for the atomic
weight of oxygen, had been previously found by Cooke and Richards
(15 869) and by Lednc (15-876).               There can be no doubt whatever
now that the true value is more than § per cent, smaller than accord
ing to Prout's law, and that in all probability it agrees exceedingly
closely with the results obtained by Rayleigh and Scott, and by
Dittmar and Henderson.              The question of Prout's law being thus so
far set at rest, Rayleigh. persevering in the main object which he had
promised in 1882,
                          " a redetermination of the densities of the principal
gases," attacked nitrogen resolutely and, stimulated by most disturb
ing and unexpected difficulties in the way of obtaining concordant
results for the density of this gas as obtained from different sources,
discovered that the gas left by taking vapour of water, carbonic
acid, and oxygen from common air was denser                    J   by 1/230 than
 nitrogen obtained by chemical processes from nitric oxide or from
 nitrons oxide, or from ammonium nitrite, thereby rendering it
 probable that atmospheric air is a mixture of nitrogen and a small
 proportion of some unknown and heavier gns. Rayleigh, and Ramsay
 who happily joined in the work at this stnge, have since succeeded in
 isolating the new gas, both by removing nitrogen from common air
 by Cavendish's old process of passing electric sparks through it,
 and taking away the nitrous compounds thus produced by alkaline
 liqnor; and by absorption by metallic magnesium. Thus we have a
 fresh and most interesting verification           of a statement which    I  took
 occasion to make in my Presidential             address to the British Associa
 tion in 1871, §
                      " Accurate and minute measurement seems to the non-
 scientific imagination a less lofty and dignified work than looking for
  something new. But nearly all the grandest discoveries of science
  have been but the rewards of accurate measurement and patient
  long-continued labour in the minute sifting of numerical results."

                  Dr. Edward Frankland, D.C.L., F.B.S.
     The Copley Medal is awarded to Dr. E. Frankland for his eminent
 services to theoretical and applied chemistry.
     At a time when the classification of organic compounds in homolo
gous series was a comparative novelty, when isomerism was still a
profound mystery, and the theory of compound radicles introduced
 by Li:jbig was still on its trial, Dr. Frankland made his first attempt
 (in 1H4S) to isolate the radicle of common alcohol.              Though the
attempt was in one sense       unsuccessful,    inasmuch as the free radicle
was never obtained, for reasons which we now more fully understand,
the research led to important consequences.            The discovery of the
organo-metallic compounds,       and  the study    of their composition and
 properties,  was followed   by  a  recognition    of the  fact, first that the
capacity for combination possessed by the atoms of the metals was
 limited (' Phil. Trans.,' 1852), and secondly that variation of "atom
icity," as it was then called, nsually occurs by an even number of
units (• Jonrn. Chem. Soc.,' 1866), represented by atoms of hydrogen,
chlorine, or such compound radicles as methyl, ethyl, and the rest.
These discoveries form the basis of the modern doctrine of valency,
with ill the important consequences that follow, including the idea of
the orderly linking of atoms, and hence the theories of structure or
constitution now current.
    The discovery of zinc ethyl placed in the hands of chemists an
important new instrument of research, which Dr. Frankland was
himself the first to use in his investigations concerning the syntheti
cal production of acids of the lactic and acrylic secies.              Further
important    synthetical work,   conducted    in  concert  with   Mr.   Dappa,
led to a method of ascending the series of acids homologous with
acetic acid.
    Dr. Fr iukland's researches in pure chemistry are almost rivalled
in interest by his discoveries in physical chemistry, especially in
relation to the influence of pressure on the rate of combustion, on the
light emit'ed during combustion, and on the cause of luminosity in
hydrocarlion fl imes.

                                 Professor Dewar.
    During more than twenty years past Professor Dewar has been
engaged in researches of great difficulty, in the first instance at very
hijrh, and latterly at very low temperatures, his inquiries having
extended over an extraordinarily wide field, as will be seen by refer
ence to the
             -
                B.S. Catalogue ' of scientific papers.
   In conjunction with Professor Livoing, he has communicated to
the Royal Society a large number of papers which have added much
to our knowledge of spectroscopic phenomena.
    During recent years he has made the liquefaction of gases a
subject of deepest study, and in the course of this work has dis
played not only        marvellous       manipulative        skill and fertility of
resource,   but also great personal courage, such researches being
attended with considerable danger.                 One of his chief objects has
been so to improve and develope the methods of liquefying the more
permanent gases that it shall become possible to deal with large
quantities of liquid, and to use such liquids as instruments of
research in extending our knowledge of the general behaviour of sub
stances at very low temperatures.             In this he haa already been highly
successful.     Not only has he succeeded in preparing large quantities
of   liquid oxygen, but he has been able by the device of vacuum-
jacketed vessels to store this liquid under atmospheric pressure
 during long periods, and thus to use it as a cooling agent.                  Very
 valuable outcome of these labours has been the series of determina
 tions, made by him in conjunction with Dr. Fleming, of the electrical
 conductivity of metals at exceedingly low temperatures, which have
 furnished results of a most unexpected character, and of extraordi
 nary interest and importance.           Professor Dewar's experiment show
 ing the great magnetic susceptibility of liquid oxygen is exceedingly
 important     and interesting.         His recent observations on phospho
 rescence,  and on photography,* and on ozonef at very low tempera
 tures, have given surprising results of a highly instructive and in
 teresting character.        It is difficult to exaggerate the importance of
 extending these researches,           which certainly deserve all possible
 encouragement and support.             The award of the Rumford Medal to
  Professor  Dewar    is   made    in  recognition of the services which ho
  has rendered to science by the work which he has already done and

 tho provision he has been successful in making for future work,          in
 the investigation of properties of matter at lowest temperatures.
                                Royal Medat,.
                       Professor J. J. Thomson,  F.B.S.
    Professor J. J. Thomson has distinguished himself in both mathe
  matical and experimental fields of work.        His first essay on vortex
 rings showed power of grappling with difficult problems, and added
  to our knowledge concerning the encounter of rings which came
 within a moderate distance of one another so as to deflect each others'
  paths.
    His theoretical work in the borderland of chemistry         and physics
 has been    very interesting  and suggestive. His experimental work
 has likewise been mainly on the borders of chemistry and physics.
 He has observed the large conductivity of many gases and vapours,
 and proved the non-conducting power of several others, founding
 on the conducting power of iodine vapour important speculations as
 to its probable chemical constitution.
    He has also measured the specific resistance of various electrolytes,
 under extremely rapid electric oscillations, by an ingenious and valuable
 method, based on the partial opacity of semi-conducting matter to
 electro-magnetic waves.      Recently he has worked at the discharge
 of electricity through rarefied gases, getting induced eurrente in
closed circuits in sealed bulbs without electrodes, and, in especial,
 measuring to a first approximation the absolute velocity of the posi
 tive discharge through a long vacuum tube, proving that it was com
 parable with, though decidedly less than, the velocity of light. He
 also gave an ingenious theory of the striae — a theory which he has
 since endeavoured, with some success, to extend to a large number of
electrical phenomena, the whole of electric conduction and induction
being regarded by him from the chemical side as a modified or inci
pient electrolysis, or as concerned with electrolytic chains of mole
cules or " Faraday tubes."
    Some of his recent mathematical work on the theoiy of electric
oscillations in spheres and cylinders, and in dumb-bell oscillators of
the kind used by Hertz, with reference to not only their oscillation-
frequency but also their damping efficiency, has been of much service
to experimental workers in those branches of physics.               And, in
general,   the  effective manner    in  which   he  attacks  any electrical
problem presenting itself, as evidenced by his book on Recent
Researches in Electricity and Magnetism, wherein he worthily carries
on into a third volume the great treatise begun by Clerk Maxwell, is
evidence of consummate ability combined with remarkable energy
and power of work.

                                  Royal Medal.
                       Frofessor Victor Horsley,   F.R.S.
    A Royal    Medal is awarded to Professor Victor Horsley, F.R.S. ,
 for his laborious and fruitful researches     in physiology and pathology,
nnd particularly for those relating to the functions          of the nervous
 system   and   of  the   thyroid gland.     His  inquiries relating to the
 former subject have been pursued for more than ten years, and
 have been communicated          to the Royal Society in a succession of
 papers,  the most important        of which have been published in the
'Philosophical     Transactions.'     The first of the series of researches
('Phil. Trans.', 1888), which was conducted in co-operation with
Professor Schafer, and concerned the relation of a part of the cere
bral cortex (the limbic lobe) to sensation, afforded a new confirmation
and extension of the doctrine of the localisation        of cerebral function
now generally accepted.        While this work was in progress, Professor
 Horsley engaged with Dr. Beevor in a long and laborious series of
experiments, for the purpose of determining with the utmost attain
able accuracy the nature of the muscular responses which are evoked
by stimulating the convolutions        in the quadrumana. The results of
these researches were communicated in four papers, of which the first
three relate to the
                         " cortical representations " of the movement of
the limbs,    and of those of the tongue and face (' Phil. Trans.,'
1887—1890) ; the fourth to the channels (in the internal capsule) by
which the cortex exercises       its influence on the rest of the nervous
system ('Phil.     Trans.,' 1890).
   These experiments not only served to bring to light a number of
new facts,    and to elucidate their physiological relations in a very
remarkable way, but had a special interest in their bearing on the
physiology and pathology of the brain in man.           Their importance in
this respect is enhanced by the circumstance tha t in the course of the
enquiry the opportunity offered itself of comparing the brain of the
monkey with that of the orang (' Phil. Trans.,' 1890), a brain which
-o closely approaches that of man in its structure that the knowledge
acquired by these researches may now be confidently used as a guide
in the diagnosis and treatment of cerebral disease.        Professor Horsley
has himself shown — and this is not the least of the merits which it is
desired to recognise in the bestowal of the Royal Medal — in how
many instances      the knowledge which is acquired by patient and
skilful work in the laboratory may be made available for the saving
of life, or the alleviation of human suffering.
    In connection with this leading series of researches, two others
relating to the physiology of the central nervous system must be
 'eferred to.   In one of these (' Phil. Trans.,' 1890), Professor Horsley
 'in co-operation with Dr.
                                Semon) established the existence, not only
                                                                   K ^

of a co-ordinating centre in the bulb, but of a cortical area in physio
logical relation with the respiratory and phonatory movements of the
larynx ; in the other, in conjunction with Professor Gotch, he investi
gated the electrical changes in the spinal cord which are associated
with excitation of the cortex and internal capsule, and showed how
the observation of these facts can be made available for tracing-
channels of conduction in the cord.
   As regards the thyroid gland, Professor Horsley's inquiries relating
to functions of that organ were, like those relating to the nervous
system, begun ten years ago, though the results were not communi
cated to the Royal Society until three years later. Their purpose
was to ascertain the nature of the very marked influence which the
thyroid was known to exercise on the nutritive functions of the
organism, and to show that this influence is constant and definite.
In this field, Professor Horsley has not only the merit of having beeD
one of the earliest workers, but of having at this early period arrived
at results which the numerous investigations of subsequent writers
have in all essential particulars confirmed.
                                Davy Medal.
                       Professor Peter Theodor Clere.
   The Davy Medal is awarded to Peter Theodor Cleve, Professor of
Chemistry in the University of Upsala, for his services to chemical
science during the last thirty years, and in particular for his long-
continued and valuable researches on the chemistry of the rare earths.
   This field of inquiry is pre-eminently Scandinavian.            By the
manner in which he has cultivated it, Professor Cleve has shown
himself a worthy successor of such forerunners as Gadolin, Berzelios.
and Mosander, and by sound and patient investigation he has faith
fully upheld the traditions inseparably associated with these names.
All chemists are agreed that no department of their science demand*
greater insight or more analytical skill than this particular section.
Many of the minerals which furnish the starting point for investiga
tion are extremely rare, and the amounts of the several earths which
they contain are frequently very small. Moreover, the substances
themselves are most difficult of isolation, and their characters are so
nearly allied that the greatest care and judgment are required in
order to determine their individuality.
   A remarkable example of Professor Cleve's power in overcoming
these difficulties is seen in his masterly inquiry into the affinities and
relations of the element scandium, discovered by Jfilson.        This, one
of the rarest of the metals, is found only in gadolinite to the extent
of 0 003 per cent., and in yttrotitanite to the extent of about 0 005
per cent.   The whole amount of the material, as oxide, at Cleve's

disposal   was  only about   1 gram, but with this small quantity he
determined the atomic weight of the element, and ascertained the
characters of its salts with such precision as to leave no doubt of the
identity of scandium with the element Ekabor, the existence of which
was predicted by Mendeleef, in the memorable paper in which he
first enunciated the Law of Periodicity.         Cleve's research, indeed,
constitutes one of the most brilliant proofs of the soundness of the
vreat generalisation which science owes to the Russian chemist.
   A not less remarkable instance of Cleve's skill as a worker is seen
in his research on samarium and its compounds, which he communi
cated, as one of its Honorary Foreign Fellows, to the Chemical Society
of London.     The existence of samarium was inferred independently by
Delafontaine and Lecoq de Boisbaudran, but we owe to Cleve the
tirst comprehensive investigation       of its characters and chemical
relations.    From the nature of its compounds, a large number of
which were first prepared and quantitatively analysed by Cleve, and
from the value of its atomic weight, which was first definitely estab
lished by him, it would appear that samarium most probably fills a
gap in the eighth group of Mendeleef 's system.
   We are further indebted to Cleve for a series of determinations of
the atomic weights of the rare substances yttrium, lanthanum, and
didymium ; these are generally accepted as among the best authenti
cated  values for these particular bodies.
   No record of Cleve's scientific activity would be complete without
some     reference to his investigations      in the domain of organic
chemistry, and more particularly to his studies, extending over
twenty years, of naphthalene derivatives.           By these researches,
made partly independently,     and  partly in conjunction with his pupils,
among whom may be named Atterberg,                Widman, Forsling, and
Hellstrom, Cleve has gradually brought order out of confusion, and
has supplied most valuable experimental evidence of the constitution
of naphthalene, and of the course        of substitution of naphthalene
derivatives.    Within recent years a score of workers have occupied
themselves with the same field of research, and no greater proof of
Cleve's accuracy and care as an investigator could be furnished than
the manner in which his naphthalene work
                                                 — confessedly one of the
most intricate and complicated sections of the chemistry of aromatic
compounds — has stood the ordeal of revision.
                              Darwin Medal.
                     Rt. Hon. T.   II. Huxley,  F.R.S.

    Of Mr. Huxley's general labours in biological and geological

  54                       Anniversary Meeting.                 [Nov. 30,
           I
 science need say Dothing here.        They are known of all men, and
  the Society showed its appreciation of their worth when it awarded
  to him the Copley Medal in 1888.       The present medal is a token of
 the value put by the Society on the part of his scientific activity
  bearing more directly on the biological ideas with which the name of
 Charles Darwin will always be associated.
     All the world now knows in part, no one perhaps will ever know
 in full, how, in the working out of his great idea, Darwin was
 encouraged, helped, and guided by constant communion with three
 close and faithful friends, Charles Lyell, the younger Joseph Dalton
 Hooker, and the still younger Thomas Henry Huxley. Each repre
 senting more or less different branches of science, each bringing to
 bear on the problems in hand more or less different mental charac
 ters, all three bore share, and were proud to bear share, in aiding the
 birth of the " Origin of Species." Charles Lyell has long been
 removed from us. Two years ago it was my pleasing duty to place
 the Darwin Medal in the hands of Joseph Dalton Hooker; that
 pleasing duty is renewed to-day in now giving it to the last of the
 three " who kept the bridge."
    To the world at large, perhaps, Mr. Huxley's share in moulding the
 t hesis of
             " Natural Selection " is less well known than is his bold
 unwearied exposition and defence of it after it had been made pnblic.
 And, indeed, a speculative trifler, revelling in problems of the " might
 have been," would find a congenial theme in the inquiry how soon
                                  "
 what we now call " Darwinism would have met with the acceptance
 with which it has met, and gained the power which it has gained,
 had it not been for the brilliant advocacy with which in its early
days it was expounded to all classes of men.
    That advocacy had one striking mark; while it made or strove to
make clear how deep the new view went down and how far it
reached, it never shrank from striving to make equally clear the
limits beyond which it could not go. In these latter days there is
fear lest the view, once new but now familiar, may, through being
stretched farther than it will bear, seem to lose some of its real worth.
We may well be glad that the advocate of the " Origin of Specie?
by Natural Selection," who once bore down its foes, is still among ns,
                        "
ready, if needs be, to save it from its friends."

     Electrical Interference Phenomena somewhat analogous to
          Newton's Rings, but exhibited by Waves along Wires."
          By Edwin H. Barton, B.Sc, late "1851 Exhibition"
          Science Scholar.           Communicated by Professor ARTHUR
          W. Ruck¦r, M.A., F.R.S.             Received February 20 —Read
          April 19,— Abbreviated* July,           18<J4.
                                      Introduction.
     The preliminary paper on this subjectf gave the results of a single
 experiment, and approximately accounted for them by a mathematical
theory of the reflexion and interference phenomena involved.
     Since the publication of that paper the question of disturbances
has been investigated, the experimental conditions improved, and
various results obtained in confirmation of the original conclusions.
    These matters form the subject of the present communication.
    The apparatus. employed for observing the interference phenomena
is diagrammatieally represented in fig. 1 and explained in the notes
accompanying it.
    In Experiment        VII   the electrometer was placed at HH' instead of
 EE', its usual position. In Experiments            VIII    and IX two electro
meter     needles    were   used,  their respective attachments     being at FF'
and HH'.
    The lengths of SAM and MD, and the special construction of the
abnormal part will be specified as required in the course of the paper
when reference is made to the figure.
    In the former paper| it was shown that in the case of a train of
electrical waves advancing along the secondary from AA' towards
DD1 fig. 1, we have the following phenomena:
                                                         —
    (1.)   A partial    reflexion at BB', the beginning of the abnormal part ;
    (2.) A partial reflexion at CC, the end of the abnormal part ; and
    (3.) Interferences between the two sets of waves proceeding from
          BB' and CC respectively.

       I.  Induction coil worked by two secondary cells. This coil could give
              regular sparks up to 2 cm. long ; their frequency was about 25 per
              second.
     G.    Spark gao, usually 2 mm.
  PGP' was 204 cm. measured along            the semicircle.   The wires PO, OP' were
              2 mm. diameter.
    PP'.   Condenser      plates of zinc 40 cm. diameter to form the ends of the
              Hertzian primary oscillator.
    SS'.   Similar plates at a distance of 30 cm. from P and P', and forming the
              beginning of the long secondary which consists of copper wires about
              1  mm. diameter.      Those parts shown dotted in the figure were set up
              in the corridors adjoining the laboratory.       With the above dimensions
              waves 9 mm. long were produced, their frequency             being about 33
              millions per second.
A A' = BB' = CC = DD' = 8 cm.               This distance was maintained throughout
              the   secondary    by pieces of dry wood     at intervals of about 2 or   3
              metres.
UCB'C.     The     abnormal (or altered) part of the secondary used to produce the

              pended by a quartz-fibre, and gave (though uncharged) a deflexion of
              about 35 scale divisions when the electrometer was connected to a
              battery of 10 Daniell's cells.        In using the electrometer for the
              electric waves first throws, not steady deflexions, were always read.

   Hence, as      the length of the abnormal part is gradually increased,
the  total energy         of the reflected waves is thereby periodically in
creased    and decreased.           It was thus seen that the length of the
abnormal part of the secondary corresponds to the thickness of the
air film in the optical phenomena known as Newton's Rings, and
that the reflexions of the electrical waves at the beginning and end
of the abnormal part correspond respectively to the reflexions of light
at the first and second faces of the air film.

 matical theory previously developed* are as follows : —

                              Approximate         Theory of Disturbances.
     Thus far, then, we have dealt only with a single incidence of the
wave-train upon the abnormal part of the secondary, and have found
expressions for the two trains thereby produced. But in order to
represent more completely what occurs with the apparatus arranged
as in fig.         further necessary to trace the history of the two
                    1,   it   is
wave-trains to which the original one thus gives rise.

again reached the plates, SS' fig    and    the transmitted wave-train

after passing the electrometer, and thus giving the deflexion by which
it   measured, were also quickly extinguished without again reach

                        somewhat        analogous       to Newton's Rhtgs.                            71
ing the   abnormal part CB, then, and then only, would the theory
hitherto developed suffice.  Clearly, however, these conditions are
not fulfilled.
   On the contrary, the waves go to and fro along the secondary,
suffering —
  (a) Total reflexion               with reversal of electrification at the short cir
            cuited end        DD' (fig. 1),
  (ft) Total reflexion without reversal of electrification at SS', and
  (7) Partial reflexion and partial transmission at each incidence on
       the abnormal part BC.
  We have, thus, a case of        binary fission at each incidence of a train
on the      abnormal part. each such fractional train returning to the ab
normal       part to be further, in like maimer, subdivided. Theoretically,
this processcontinues ad infinitum.
  From these considerations it may easily be inferred that, to avoid
hopeless confusion, the distance from the abnormal part to either end
  the secondary must exceed half the length of the train of electrical
iif
waves,      or in symbols —     :
                                    SB   >   |X     and       CE   >   £X                           (A),
where       X  the effective length of the wave-train, and the other
                  is
letters refer to fig.          1.
  It  was also found necessary to avoid placing the abnormal part
midway between the two ends,        and D, of the secondary. For, in
                                                  S
that case, the two sets of waves respectively reflected at and trans
mitted through the abnormal part would, after travelling to opposite
unds of the secondary, again meet at the middle and interfere with
each other.    This disturbance was sufficiently obviated by fulfilling
the    condition —
                                         (SM'MD) >iX                                                 (B).
      But when conditions               (A) and (B)           are both     fulfilled, there   is   still   a
residual  disturbance.    For, although the electrometer         placed to            is
receive the systems transmitted through the abnormal part,              in                          it,
consequence   of their repeating coursings  to and  fro, actually receives
also feebler systems of reflected waves.
   Thus, let the fraction of incident wave-energy transmitted by the
abnormal part be t, and let the ratio of the electrometer readings with
and without the abnormal part be                        t-,
                                       then the author has shown that
/     is   approximately given by the equation

 where       ti   and    sa   express    the attenuation               of energy suffered by the

waves in passing along lengths of the secondary equal respectively to
twice SM and twice MD (fig. 1).
    t' is always a little greater than t except in the limiting cases
where t = 0 and t = 1. Thus, the experimentally-determined ratio
needs a negative correction.         This is easily applied hy graphical
methods.
    Now, since r is a function both of t and of the attenuation (or
secondary damping) it becomes necessary, in order to utilise Equatioii
(4), to estimate the value of this damping.
    The theory of one method devised for this purpose is as follows : —
    Suppose the arrangement of apparatus shown in fig. 1 to be modi
fied thus.     Let the 1-mm. diameter copper wires be continued beyond
DD' for some distance, and after that let the wires for a further
length be of iron of 01 mm. diameter. Also let the bridge shown at
DD- be movable and capable of being placed at pleasure anywhere
beyond the electrometer.
    And consider, first, the changes in the electrometer throws as the
bridge is moved from the electrometer, but still always upon the
copper wires. Let the electrometer throws be plotted as ordinates,
and the distances of the bridge from the electrometer as abscissae.
Then, for positions of the bridge immediately beyond the electro
meter the curve so obtained is conspicuously wavy, and continues
 sensibly so for a distance equal to half the appreciable length of the
 wave-train.      This is the part corresponding to the curve shown by
 V. Bjerknes (' Wied. Ann.,' vol. 44, p. 522, 1891), and is due to the
 interferences between the wave-trains advancing towards and re
 flected from the bridge DD'.          Beyond this part, whatever the rate
 of decay of the waves, we have a continuous droop in the curve. The
 exact form of the curve depends, in part, upon this decay, and the
 ordinate of the asymptote to the curve may be shown to be a
 simple function of <r(where e-<ra is the law of decay of the amplitude
  of the waves).
     Let the distance SE (fig. 1) be L, and let yz be the ordinate of tbe
  curve at the point whose abscissa is x, the ordinate at the origin being
  unity.    Then we have for the equation of the curve —
                           y¦ =  —     —

      The ratio y^ is difficult to determine if the copper wires only
  are used, but with the thin iron wires the electrometer throws
  rapidly fall off to their minimum value, and thus yx is readily ob
  tained   as desired.

Experiment      I. — Undesired      Interferences   of Distinct Wave-Trains simul
      taneously reflected at and transmitted through the Abnormal Part of
      the    Secondary.
   To investigate       this question the arrangement of apparatus shown
in fig. 1 was     adopted. The abnormal part consisted of a single pair of
tinfoil sheets each 50 cm. long and 32 cm. deep, the two being hung
immediately opposite each other, one on each wire of the secondary.
The    total length, SAD, of the secondary was 162 m., the distance
SAM was varied from 75 m. to 90-5 m. by steps of 0-5 m. each.
Electrometer readings with and without the sheets were taken alter
nately in order to eliminate the possible errors due to irregular work
ing of the primary sparks.                The observations taken are shown in
Table     I.
   The result is      graphically exhibited in the curve, fig.          2.

   Various experiments were made with the secondary lengthened
 about 70     mm. by the addition of thin iron wires, in the hope that they
 wonld absorb all the incident waves and thus do away with their
 repeated coursings and consequent interferences.                  The result was an

Thus the extreme values of the ordinates differed from their mean
value by about 17| per cent. of the latter.          The electrometer throws,
however, were now reduced to about one-third of their former value.
This was owing to the continuation of the wires so far beyond the
electrometer instead of their termination by a bridge distaut only a
quarter wave-length from it. It seemed, therefore, that the iron wires
did more harm than good, and they were accordingly abandoned in
favour of the arrangement described in the next experiment.

                   somewhat     analogous to Newton's Rings.
 Experiment     III. — Search  for  Interferences as in Experiment I, hut with
         the Abnormal Part      away from the middle of the Secondary.
    As the outcome of Experiment            II  the theory resulting in condition
 (B), p. 71, was developed, and the present experiment tried in
accordance therewith.          The effective length of the wave-train was
 experimentally fonnd to be about 70 m. Hence, to fulfil (B) it was
 necessary to make (SAM            MD) >35 m.
    The apparatus shown in fig. 1 was then arranged thus: SAD =
 164 m.      SAM varied from 95"25 m. to 105-75 m., and electrometer
throws were taken alternately with and without a pair of tinfoil sheets
as in Experiments       I  and II.
   This experiment was performed twice and the mean result, when
plotted as in Experiment I, gave a curve undulating between the
limiting ordinates 0-55 and 0"46. Thus the extreme values of the
ordinates differed from their mean value by about 9 per cent. of the
Litter.
   It  is thus seen that, although        the straight    line hoped for was not
obtained, yet this curve is less wavy than either of the two previous
ones.     And since, also, this arrangement yields the maximum effect at
the  electrometer,    it was adopted in the experiment for the analogy          to
Newton's     rings by transmission hereafter described.
Experiment      IV. — Estimate of      the Rate    of Decay of  the Waves in their
                          Advance along      the Secondary.
   The arrangement         of the apparatus adopted for this determination
has   already been described under the headings of Theory (p. 72).
In this experiment the droop of the curve sought was expected to be
very slight.      Consequently, for the sake of accuracy, each point of
the curve was determined by twenty-one electromoter readings.                  Six
sets of observations were made with SAE, fig. 1, = 160 m.                   They
yielded a curve whose asymptote was —
                         ym  = 0"34  ;  whence we obtain
                                    «  = 0-0018                               (7).
   A second series of observations with SAE = 91"5 m. afforded the
values ya = 031 and
                                   <r  = 00029                               (8).
Experiment V. — Analogy to Newton's Rings by Transmission under best
                                    Conditions.
   This experiment was made with exceptional care, as it is the chief
one  of the series.       Most of the others either served to indicate the

76        Mr. E. H. Barton.        Electrical Interference Phenomena
conditions adopted in this one or were in other ways subsidiary to it.
The construction of the abnormal part was such as to reflect a large
fraction of the wave-energy incident upon it. Its position was so
chosen as to avoid the interferences of higher order already noticed.
Thus the true effect sought was large, the disturbing ones small. The
arrangement of the apparatus is shown in fig. 1. The details are as
follows.
     The abnormal part consisted of tinfoil sheets each 32 cm. deep and
50 cm. long.       These were hung opposite each other upon the two
wires of the secondary. Lest a shift of the middle point of the sheets
along the wires might have a slight disturbing effect on the electro
meter throws, the abnormal part was always lengthened or shortened
by the same amount at each end, thus leaving the middle point M
undisturbed.        The length SAM was throughout the experiment
101 m., MD being 63 m.* so as to comply with condition (B).                     The
tinfoil sheets were kept properly spaced by very accurately cut wood
separators, one for each half metre's length of the sheets.              The same
separators,    but  at   longer  intervals,  were   used    throughout the line.
The vertical edges of consecutive sheets were made to overlap about
 2 cm. and allowed to hang in simple contact.
     Lest this contact should be insufficient and so involve an error, the
sheets were built up in this way to a length of 2-25 m. (a quarter of a
wave-length), and the ratio determined of the wave-energy trans
mitted by it to that incident upon it. Then an abnormal part, con
sisting of zinc plates soldered together was substituted, and the
fraction of wave-energy transmitted again determined. In each case,
 to insure accuracy, twenty-one electrometer readings were taken
alternately with and without the abnormal part. The two ratios
 thus determined were:— f
           (1) For the tinfoil sheets                     0135     ± 0-007
           (2) For the zinc plates soldered               0135     ± 0-002
     Hence this apparently imperfect contact seemed sufficicnt for the
 case, and was adopted in the main experiments now under considera
 tion. A spark gap of 2 mm. was used throughout both in the experi
 ments just described and in what now follows.
     The method of taking the observations so as to eliminate the
 possible errors due to the irregularities in the sparking of the primary
 was as follows.        Several electrometer throws were taken, at first
     •  When making the corresponding    experiment, described in the former paper
 p. 96, SAM was taken equal to MD.         I had not, up to then, seen that it -was
 desirable to avoid that arrangement.
     t The probable errors were calculated by the formulas given in Eohlrausch's
  -

without any      tinfoil sheets on the wires, then a couple of readings
with, say, two sheets on each wire ; then two readings with four
sheets on each wire, and so forth.           After the abnormal part had thus
heen built up to a considerable length, it was then in like manner
shortened, two readings being taken for each length, concluding with
several readings without any sheets at all on the wires.                 The whole
process    was   carried   out   four  times,  the   lengths  used  in  the various
cases being varied so as to obtain eight electrometer readings for
each half metre's length of the abnormal part.               Thus, in the first and
third sets of observations, the          lengths of the abnormal         part  were
approximately 0, 1 m., 2 m., 3 m                    3 m., 2 m., 1 m., 0 ; whereas,
in the second and fourth sets, the lengths were about 0, 0-5 m., 1"5 m.,
25 m            2-5 m., 1"5 m., 0"5 m., 0.
    A single set of readings up to nearly 7 m. length of abnormal part
is given in Table II. During the process of lengthening the abnormal
part the ratios are obtained by taking for the divisor the initial mean
throw without abnormal part, whereas, during the shortening, the
 l\ke final value is used as the divisor.           Hence the double values for
 the ratio corresponding to the length 6"72 m.                 The last column of
 the   table contains the mean of the ratios during               lengthening   and
 shortening.
     The kind of agreement obtained by the four sets of observations is
 shown by the two curves in fig. 3.                In these curves the abscissae

   On this curve two apparently anomalous humps may be noticed in
the neighbourhood of 1"5 m. and 5-5 m. lengths of the abnormal

carefully repeating the experiment in these regions the first results
were confirmed, as shown by the double dots made at those places.
   A few readings were also taken with the above general arrange
ment, but an abnormal part, consisting of the ordinary wires nearer
together, just as in Experiment VI. It was thus found that the
electrometer throws were about three times as great with an ab
normal part a quarter- wave long as with one a half-wave long.
  Experiment     VIII. — An    Abnormal Part lOhich Produces no Reflexion.
   Having      thus far experimented with the desired interference
phenomena, and discussed the various disturbances involved, it now
*eems of interest to notico particular forms of the abnormal part
which reflect no portion of the wave-energy incident upon them.
This and the following experiment were tried as tests of the truth of
the theory    for a  single reflexion.
   However, to establish the entire absence of reflexion would be very
difficult with the single-needle electrometer previously used, because
the slightest irregularity of the primary sparking might be mistaken
for the effect of reflexion. And no repetition of observations, however
extended, would justify the conclusion that the energies transmitted
   0OL.  LVH.                                                      G

82      Mr. E. H. Barton.      Electrical Interference Phenomena
with and without the abnormal            part    were absolutely equal. It-
became expedient, therefore, to use an electrometer which gave de
flexions only when reflected waves were present.             Such an instru
ment was, fortunately, ready to hand in the differential electrometer
used and described by Dr. von Geitler,* and kindly left by him for
my use.
   In this form of electrometer two needles, rigidly connected with
each other and hanging upon the same quartz fibre, are employed.
One of these experiences a right-handed torque, owing to attach
ments at one pair of points on the secondary, whenever these points
have a potential difference of either sign, while the second needle,
under like conditions, experiences a left-handed torque, owing to
attachments at a second pair of points on the secondary, and distant
a quarter of a wave's length from the first pair.            Thus, when the
instrument is properly adjusted, the mere -passing of a wave-train
leaves the needles undisturbed.
   Tf, however, reflexion is by any means produced near the electro
meter, so that it is in a region of standing waves, it may give a
throw.
   The arrangement of apparatus adopted may be seen from inspec
tion of fig. 1, which was modified by the removal of the single-needle
electrometer from EE', and the insertion of the differential electro
meter at FF' HH'.       The first needle was influenced by attachments
to F and F', and the second by attachments to H and H'. The main
wires between the first and second pairs of points were led in a loop,
so that they first passed the electrometer at FF', and a second time at
HH'. Thus, all the attachments between the main wires and the
electrometer were quite short.
   The wires in the normal part of the secondary were 0-116 cm.
diameter. The abnormal part consisted also of copper wires, and
were in this experiment 0"019 cm. diameter, and 2-25 m. long.
   These were tried at two distances apart, namely, 1 cm. and 1"5 cm.
The electrometer throws in these cases were —1.8 and +0"6 scale
divisions respectively.    Whence, by interpolation, we have 1"37 cm.
nearly, as the distance apart at which these wires would yield no
reflexion. The electrometer throw with a bridge atBB' was twenty-
four scale divisions.
Experiment    IX. — -A Second Example of no Reflexion from an Abnormal
                                    Part.
   In this  experiment everything was the same as in the preceding
one, except that the abnormal part consisted of wires thicker and
wider apart than the rest of the line, instead of being thinner and

when      placed at 66 cm. apart, there was practically no reflexion.
                   Comparison of Theory and Experiment.
    It now becomes of interest to compare the results of Experiments
V to IX with the theories advanced concerning them.
    In Experiment V we have the capacity per unit length of the
normal         part in electrostatic           units   approximately      given      by
1, (4 log, djw), where d is the distance              between the centres of the
wires and w their radius.              For the abnormal part, without any cor
rection for the edges, we have capacity per unit length equals D/4jtcZ,
where D is the width of the tinfoil sheets.                Now d was 8 cm., w was
005 cm. nearly, and D 32 cm.               Thus we obtain for r, the ratio of the
capacities, 6-5 nearly.          If, however, in estimating the capacity of the
abnormal part, a correction for the edges is made, we obtain values
of r     ranging up to 8 or 9, according to the length of the abnormal
part under consideration, and the formula used for the correction.
    Taking as a typical case the length of abnormal part to be
2 25 m., on which special experiments were made, and correcting for
the edges by the approximate formula given by Professor Kohlrausch*
we obtain r = 9, nearly.             Whence, from equation (1), b = — 0-8.
    It will be seen from the equations (3) that it is further necessary to
know the constants * and p.              These were determined by experiments
similar to those previously devised and carried out by V. Bjerknes.f
     In my case, however, the electrometer readings were alternated
 with the bridge at the variable distance »•, and at the quarter wave
 length distance beyond the electrometer.               A spark gap of 2 mm. was
 used    throughout.
     Thus were obtained for the electrical waves advancing along the
 wires, the wave-length A* = 9 m. ; and for the constant involving the
 primary damping, we have ^ = 2irnjj3 = 0-524, or say 7! = 0"5 nearly.
    Then, assuming that the velocity of propagation of the waves along
 the wires is practically            that of light in air,J we obtain, from

\i   =  9 m.,   the value of the frequency, namely, /S/2er = 33^ millions
per second, nearly.
    From these data the curve T, fig. 4, is plotted, the lengths of the
abnormal part being abscissa; and the corresponding fractions of in
cident wave energy transmitted being ordinates.
    It is thus noticeable that the theoretical curve, though of simi
lar form, lies wholly below the experimental one. If, however,
we apply to the latter, a correction based upon Equation (4) aud
the results of Experiment IV, we obtain curves which lie wholly
below the theoretical one.          One such is shown in curve C, fig. 4, in
which     a is taken equal to O0029.
    Thns, while the comparison of theory and experiment has not
resulted in the establishment of an exact agreement between them, it
is yet so far satisfactory to notice* that the three curves are precisely
similar in form, and that the theoretical one lies entirely between the
two experimental ones, with and without correction.                 It is also note
                                                               "
worthy that Mr. Yule, in his recent workf on                     The Passage of
Electrical Wave-trains though Layers of Electrolyte," found a dis
crepancy of the same sign and of like amount between the experi
mental curve and the theoretical one.
    The dotted lines above and below the main curve in fig. 4 indicate
the limits between which the latter lies. These limiting lines would
be horizontal but for the primary damping of the waves emitted by
 the oscillator.
     We thus see that the curve in the neighbourhood of \|/4 affords
 the best means of determining 6 when it is nearly unity.                        For
 the troughs of the curve are broad, and therefore the curve is at that
 part for some distance nearly parallel to the axis of the abscissa.. Thus
 a great deviation from the true length X^4 would make but a small
 one in the corresponding ordinate.               Secondly, for large values of
  b, this ordinate is but very slightly affected by the primary damping.
  Hence a great error in the measurement of a makes but a slight one
 in the determination of 6 from this part of the curve. Thus, taking
 7, = 0.5, and accepting the experimental curve, we obtain b — — 0-71
  and r = 6, or taking the experimental curve, with correction, as
  shown by the lower line in fig. 4, we get b — — 0-8 and r = 9.                And
  it was between these limits 6 and 9 that r was calculated to lie.
     In Experiment VI. — Since the same wires were used for the
 abnormal part but closer together, namely, at a distance d" = 0"C8
 cm. instead of d = 8 cm., we have for the ratio of capacities

Thus, by Equation (1) we obtain b =                From this value of b and
those last used for a and /3 we derive the curve shown by T, fig. 5.
     This, as  in the case of Experiment V, lies wholly below the experi
mental curve.         But here, again, the correction to the experimental
curve applied in accordance with Equation (4), and the higher value
¦of a from Experiment IV yields the curve C, fig. 5, lying still lower
 than the    theoretical one.
     In Experiment     VII. — It may be seen from the Equations (3) or from
 general considerations that the total intensity of the reflected waves
 must be complementary to that of the transmitted ones, that is p + t
  = 1.     Consequently the theoretical curve showing p as ordinates
 instead of t would be obtained by inverting the theoretical one for t.
 Hence, we see that the general characteristics of the curve for p may
 be   thus  outlined : —
     (1)  A damped wavy-formed curve with —
      (2) narrow   troughs at I = 0, X/2, X, &c., and
      (3) broad crests at I = X/4, 3X/4, Ac.,
  where   I is the length of the abnormal part. These general charac-
  istics are possessed by the experimental curve obtained.        It must, of
  coarse, be borne in mind that the ordinates of the curve thus experi
  mentally determined do not represent p, but represent approximately
  ratios proportional to 1 +/>, since we have both the reflected and the
  incident waves passing the electrometer.       On this account the wavy
   form of this curve is less strongly marked than in the case of trans
   mission.    Probably also other, and undesired, interferences arose
   between the on-coming and reflected waves in the neighbourhood of
  the electrometer, thus causing the two anomalous humps at 1"5 m.
 and 5.5 m.
      In Experiment VIII. — For the cases to which Equation (1) applies
  wesee that there is no reflexion when r = 1, that is, when no change
  in the capacity of the secondary occurs.           Now the apuroximate
 ¦expression     for  the capacity  of  two equal parallel cylinders depends
  not upon their absolute but upon their relative dimensions only.
  Hence, if Equation (1) is correct, it must be possible to arrange a
  part of the wires in a form which appears very abnormal, but yet so
  as to prodnce no reflexion.          We have simply to introduce, at any
  part, thinner wires placed proportionately nearer together or thicker
  ones in like manner further apart.         Thus, since in either case, tbe
  capacity is unaltered by the change in question, we have r = 1, and
  the fraction of wave-energy reflected disappears.
      In the experiment under consideration the readings taken pointed
  to the distance 1.37 cm., from centre to centre of wires, as being that
  which,    with the wires in use, would give no reflexion. Theory gives
  as the   correct distance 1"32 cm. Thus the discrepancy is not great ;

86       Mr. E. H. Barton.      Electrical Interference Phenomena
in fact, it may perhaps     be within the limits of the errors of observa
tion.
   In  Experiment IX. — Here theory points to a distance apart of 38 cm.
as that which should produce no reflexion.           The experiment, how
 ever, gave 66 cm. This discrepancy at first sight appears serious.
 When, however, it is noticed that in the case of cylinders widely
 separated a very great further increase in their distance is required to
 produce a small decrease in their capacity, the discrepancy does not
 seem so great. Indeed, when the distance between the wires in this
 case is altered from 38 cm. to 66 cm., the capacity is only changed
 by about 10 per cent. It is conceivable that a discrepancy of that
order might be due to the sloping portions of wire which served to
.connect the normal wires, spaced at 8 cm., with the abnormal ones
 spaced at 66 cm.
                         Summary   o0  Chie0 Results.
    The principal conclusions to be drawn from the foregoing theory
 and. experiments taken in conjunction may be stated as follows      :—
    (1.) In experimenting      with electrical waves of high frequency
          passing along a pair of parallel wires with short-circuited end,
          and containing a portion which produces partial reflexion, it is
          necessary to make right choice of the lengths before and after
          such source of reflexion in order to avoid disturbing inter
          ferences.
    (2.) A sudden change in the capacity of       the secondary produces a
          partial reflection at that place of change.      The ratio of the
          amplitudes   of  the reflected  and incident  wave-trains may be
          expressed as a simple function of the change in capacity. See
          Equations (12) and (13) in the previous paper.
    (3.) If a sudden change in the capacity of the secondaiy is suc
          ceeded by a sudden reversion to the normal state of the wires,
          then reflexions occur at each of these places of abrupt change.
          And, if the distance between these two points is comparable
          with a wave-length, then the waves proceeding from them will
          interfere, consequently when the distance in question is in
          creased a series of maxima and minima successively obtain,
          essentially analogous to those which simultaneously occur
          in the optical phenomena known as Newton's Rings.
    (4.) If the secondary has a part which, though abnormal in appear
          ance, introduces no change in its capacity, then no reflexion is
          produced by it.
    For each of the above statements theoretical grounds and experi
 mental confirmation have been adduced. And, although the two are
 not in exact quantitative agreement, yet I think it will be admitted

               somewhat   analogous to Newton's Rings.            87
that  they are approximately    so, and that their accordance in all
general respects is such that they support each other and warrant
the conclusions drawn from them.
   I have again to acknowledge my deep indebtedness to the late
lamented Professor Hertz for the very able advice he at all times so
readily gave me while   I was engaged on the above work under him
at the University of Bonn during the session 1892 — 93.

     On the Leicester Earthquake of August                 4, 1893."    By Charles
          Davison, M.A., F.G.S., Mathematical Master at. King

          Read      May 10, 1894.
     On August         4, 1893, at 6.41   p.m. (G.M.T.), an earthquake shock was
    >lt throughout the whole of Leicestershire and Rutland, and in parts
  Iso of the adjoining counties of Lincoln, Nottingham, Derby, Staf-
    >rd, "Warwick aud Northampton.                 The disturbed area, therefore,
 ^es entirely
                      within the land. It is also one over which villages and
    mntry       houses    are for the most part closely scattered, and it has
    ins heen possible to obtain          a large number of careful and detailed
    iconnts.        I  have received altogether 391 records from 298 places
  rhere the earthquake was observed, and 103 others from                      97 places
  rhere, so far as known, no trace of it was perceived.*
     My     inquiries     were   carried    out on the supposition that tectonic
      rthqnakes       are, as a rule, mere     incidents in the gradual develop
   ment of faults, that the shock is caused by the friction which results
   pom one rock-mass slipping slightly but heavily over and against
    le other, the accompanying sound and tremulous motion being due
       the exceedingly small and rapid vibrations which proceed chiefly
     >m the margins of the fault-surface               over which the slip takes
 placet
     The     interpretation of the evidence collected rests on the following
 |irinciples : —
      (1.) The direction of the fault is parallel, or nearly so, to that of
    le longer axis of the disturbed area, or of an isoseismal line.
     .) The intensity of the shock increases in both directions from the
    inlt-line     until a maximum is reached, and then decreases, so that
     • The expenses of the inquiry were defrayed by part of a grant which I had the
 honour to receive from the Government Research Fund. I regret that I am unable
       acknowledge     in detail the valuable and courteous  assistance rendered    by my
Kniiirrmm       correspondents.

on both sides of the fault, and close to it, there is a meizoseismal
area ;* but the maximum intensity is greatest in the area situated
on the side towards which the fault hades.            (3.) Other conditions-
being the same, isoseismal lines which can be traced on both sides of
the fault are further apart on the side towards which the fault hades.
(4.) The nature of the fault-slip may be ascertained to a certain ex
tent by the relative positions of the isoseismal lines, and by the time-
and space-relations of the sound and shock.
                      Disturbed Area and Isoseismal Lines.
   On the accompanying map are shown the principal places within
the disturbed area and those to which reference is made in this
paper. The three curves are isoseismal lines corresponding to in
tensities 5, 4, and approximately 3 of the Rossi-Forel scale. The
latter may be regarded as practically the boundary of the disturbed
area, though records have come from four places outside it where the
shock was very slightly felt. In drawing this line the knowledge of
the places where no trace of the earthquake was perceived has been
of considerable service.
   The disturbed area is 58 miles long and 46 miles broad, and con
tains about 2066 square miles. The isoseismal 4 encloses an area 47
miles long, 34 miles broad, and of about 1251 square miles ; that in
cluded by the isoseismal 5 is 17j miles long, 12 miles broad, and of
about 163 square miles. The directions of the longer axes of the
three curves are about W. 38° N. and E. 38° S., W. 40° N. and E.
40° S., and W. 31° N. and E. 31° S., respectively, the second prob
ably being the most accurate. The longer axis of the isoseismal of
intensity 4 lies on the north-east side of that of the isoseismal 5, and
 we therefore conclude that, if the earthquake be fault-formed, the
direction of the fault must be about W. 40° N. and E. 40° S., and its
 hade must be to the north-east.
    The principal meizoseismal area is a narrow band, nearly parallel
 to the longer axis of the isoseismal 5, and at a short distance from it
on the north-east side.        It extends from Sheepshed to the neighbour
 hood of Rothley, a distance of eight miles.               The intensity was
greatest at    and   near  Woodhouse     Eaves.
    On the opposite side of the axis of the same isoseismal there is
 another, though less distinctly marked, meizoseismal area, which
 includes Markfield, but the intensity here was less than in the north
 east meizoseismal area.
    This confirms the previous conclusion that the fault must hade to
the north-east.       It also shows that the fault-line must pass between
   * The term " meizoseismal area " is here used as denoting an area where the
intensity is greater than in the surrounding region.

cenied is that lying near the centre of the isoseismal 5. Here the
beds, which are believed by Messrs. Hill and Bonney to be of pre-
Cambrian age, " are elevated in an elongated dome-shaped anticlinal
of which only one-half is visible, and the vertex points to the south
east ; so that denudation has exposed the lowest beds at the northern
end, and the others lap round them in rudely elliptical zones."
Along the anticlinal axis, the direction of which is approximately
north-west and south-east, but in the neighbourhood of Woodhouse
Eaves more nearly W. 40° N. and E. 40° S., there appears to run a
considerable fault, the beds on the south-west side being older than
those on the north-east.        The course of this supposed fault is indi
cated on the map by a dotted line.         If the fault be a normal one, but
nf this there is no certainty from geological evidence, it must clearly
hade to the north-east.
    The close correspondence between the probable position of this
fault and that of the fault suggested by the seismic evidence allows
us to infer,  I think, with some degree of confidence, that the Leicester
earthquake was caused by a slip of the anticlinal fault of Charnwood
Forest.
                    Nature of   the Earthquake Phenomena.
    In  the present section   I  will first give  a few  brief descriptions of
the earthquake, and will afterwards present a summary of the
evidence from different points of view.          The first group of accounts
:vre from places near the major axis of the disturbed area, the second
from places near the minor axis of the isoseismal 5, which may be
regarded as the minor axis of the disturbed area.
    1. (a.) Accounts from places between the north-west end of the
major axis and the isoseismal 5: Quarndon, a dull rumbling sound
 first heard, as of some very distant explosion, lasting about five
 seconds, followed without any interval by a quick tremulous motion,
 which gradually increased in intensity, and then died away, intensity
 3.    Derby, a tremulous motion, increasing in intensity for three
 seconds, and then decreasing until it ceased after one second more,
 i otensity 3 ; a soft, slightly tremulous sound heard for two seconds
 before    the tremulous motion began, increasing in intensity and
 ending rather abruptly just before the tremulous motion was
 strongest. Spondon, a tremulous motion for two or three seconds,
  preceding more prominent vibrations which lasted for two seconds
 more and were not followed by tremulous motion ; a rumbling sound
 like that of a heavy cart passing close to the house, the beginning
 and end of which coincided with, or slightly preceded, the beginning
 and end of the shock respectively, the sound loudest when the vibra
 tions were strongest. Weston-en-Trent,            a slight tremulous motion
       about two seconds, succeeded by two series of vibrations, each

                On the Leicester Earthquake   of August   4, 1893.         91
lasting       about two seconds, not followed by tremulous motion, in
tensity nearly 5 ; the beginning of the sound coincided with that of
the shock, it began abruptly, and died away a second or two before
the end of the shock.          The most interesting point brought out by
these observations is that, as the earth-wave radiated from the centre,
the sound apparently outraced the shock, leading at first sight to the
conclusion that the velocity of the sound was greater than that of
the shock.        In a later section it will be seen, however, that such a
conclusion would be incorrect.
     (b.) Accounts from places within the isoseismal 5 : Mount St.
Bernard's Abbey, prominent vibrations, followed by tremulous motion,
duration about five seconds ; the beginning of the sound slightly
preceded that of the shock, the end of the sound followed that of
the shock by at least three or four seconds.          Sheepshed, the vibra
 tions gradually increased in intensity and then died away, duration
 about seven seconds ; the beginning of the sound preceded that of
 the shock by about two seconds, the end of the sound followed that
 of the shock by about two seconds, the sound loudest at the time
 when the vibrations were strongest.           Markfield, prominent vibra
 tions, preceded and followed by tremulous motion, duration about
 five seconds ; the beginning of the sound slightly preceded that of
 the shock, the end coincided approximately with that of the shock,
  the principal      vibrations felt at, or immediately after, the instant
  when the sound was loudest.        Thus, at places close to the epicentrum
  the sound generally overlapped the shock at both ends, and there
  was    little or no interval between their epochs of maximum intensity.
      (c.) Accounts from places between the isoseismal 5 and the south
 east end of the major axis : Humberstone, principal vibrations for
  three or four seconds, strongest near the beginning, followed by
 tremulous motion for two or three seconds, intensity 4 ; the begin
  ning and end of the sound coincided approximately with those of the
 shock.        Harringworth, tremulous motion, followed by principal
  vibrations, intensity 4 ; the beginning of the sound preceded that of
  the shock, the ends of both coincided, the principal vibrations felt
  after the instant when the sound was loudest.          Barton Segrave, the
  sound, a deep loud rumble, lasting four or five seconds, seemed to
  cease as the vibrations began ; these were strongest near the middle,
  and lasted      about five seconds, intensity 3. In this direction also,
  then, the sound apparently outraced the shock.
      2. Sutton (near the north-east end of the minor axis), one series
  of vibrations, strongest towards the end, duration five or six seconds,
  intensity 3 ; the beginning of the sound preceded that of the shock
  by two or three seconds, the end followed that of the shock, the
   principal vibrations felt when the sound was loudest.        Barwell (near
   the south-west end of the minor axis), principal vibrations      for about

 02                           Mr. C. Davison.
 four seconds, followed by tremulous motion for about eight seconds ;
 the beginning of the sound coincided with that of the shock, the end
 followed that of the shock by about two seconds, the principal vibra
 tions felt when the sound was loudest. Both of these places are at
 considerable distances from the fault-line, and on opposite sides of
 it.    Consequently, from these and similar observations, we may
 conclude that in the direction of the minor axis there is no sign of
 the sound outracing the shock.

 and followed it at 3, places. The latter are, however, close to places
 where the sound was heard before the shock. Hence, in all parts of
 the disturbed area, the beginning of the sound as a rule preceded
 that of the shock.
     The end of the sound preceded that of the shock at 16 places,
 coincided with it at 6, and followed it at 16, places.     In the majority
 of cases, the end of the sound preceded that of the shock at places
 near the major axis, and especially close to the ends of it ; and it
followed the end of the shock at places chiefly within the isoseismal 5
and in the neighbourhood of the minor axis.
     The epoch of maximum intensity of the sound preceded that of the
shock at 19 places, which are as a rule near the ends of the major
axis, coincided with it at 18 places, which are not far distant from
the epicentrum or minor axis, and followed it at 3 places, namely,
Rothley, Woodhouse Eaves and "Wymondham.
     Lastly, the sound appeared to precede the shock entirely at seven
places, Ashley, Barton Segrave, Bretby, Farndon, Hazelbeach Hill,
Quarndon and Wartnaby.          Six of these are close to the ends of the
major axis, and still closer to the continuation of the anticlinal fault-
line.
     Thus, the more detailed evidence here summarised supports the
conclusion previously stated, that the sound apparently outraced the
shock in the direction of the major axis of the disturbed area, but not
in the direction of the minor axis.
     Space-Relations of the Sound and Shock. — In the absence of any
scale of seismic sound-intensity, it has not been possible to indicate
the position of any isacoustic lines.      It is clear, however, that they
would not be concentric with the isoseismal lines. For instance, the
shock was felt, while no sound was heard, by the observers at
Burton-on- Trent, Castle Donington,       Cole Orton, Long Eaton and
Staunton.      The  sound  was  heard, while   no shock was felt, by the
observers at Aldwincle, East Haddon, Finedon, Holme, Loddington,
Ragdale Hall and Thorpe Underwood.           In one or two cases this may
    ve  been  due  merely to defective observation   ; but, on the whole, it
       -dent that the shock was a more prominent feature than the

             On the Leicester Earthquake        of August  4, 1893.       93
sound near     the north-west end of the major axis, while the sound was
more    prominent than the shock near the south-east end.
                             Origin of the Earthquake.
    Whatever may be the extent of the fault-surface over which a slip
takes place,    there must, in the simplest case, be a certain central
region over which the slip is comparatively great, surrounded by a
marginal area over which it is very small, and gradually diminishes
in all directions until it disappears along the boundary.         The minute
and exceedingly rapid vibrations             proceeding chiefly from this
marginal area are,        I believe, those which are perceptible as sound ;
the sound which precedes, accompanies and follows the shock being
produced by the vibrations            which come from the nearer lateral
margin, the upper margin chiefly, and the further lateral margin,
with reference      to the place of observation.
    In the case of the Leicester earthquake, the sound was observed
before the shock all over the disturbed area, because no part of that
area was at a great distance from the nearer lateral margin           of the
 seismic focus.       But some places, especially near the end of the
 major   axis,  were    so far from the further lateral margin that no
 sound following the shock could be heard.
    At a place (like Quarndon) close to one end of the major axis, the
sound-vibrations from the further edge of the nearer lateral margin
 were nearly or quite imperceptible, and the sound entirely preceded the
 shock.    A little  nearer the epicentrum (at Derby) the sound-vibrations
 from the   nearer part of the upper margin were perceptible, and conse
 quently the sound partly overlapped the shock, but the beginning, epoch
 of maximum intensity, and end of the sound preceded respectively those
 of the shock.       Lastly, at places close to the epicentrum the sound-
 vibrations from the further lateral margin could be perceived, and
 thus the sound was heard both before, during and after the shock,
 while the epochs       of their maximum intensity were nearly or quite
 coincident.
    In the neighbourhood of the minor axis the sound was heard at
 the same time as the shock, and generally both before and after.        JSTo
 interval was apparent between their epochs of maximum intensity,
 for the places of observation were at nearly the same distance from
 the upper lateral margin and central area of the seismic focus.
     The time-relations       of the sound and shock are thus readily
  explained on the supposition that the sound- vibrations come chiefly
  from the marginal area of the seismic focus.            But this theory of
  their origin receives a stronger support from the observations sum
  marised above than its mere capability of offering a satisfactory
  explanation.     The sound was heard before the shock practically at

 94            On  the  Leicester Earthquake      of August    4, 1893.
all parts of the disturbed area ; it was heard after the shock at places
near the ends of the minor axis but, not of the major axis. This
shows, I think, that the preliminary and subsequent sounds must
 have been due to vibrations proceeding from two distinct origins,
situated roughly in a north-west and south-east line.
    Length of the Fault-Slip. — On this subject our conclusions are of
necessity only approximate.             It may be shown, however, that the
seismic focus must have been several miles in length.
    The elongated form of the disturbed area and of the isoseismal
lines is sufficient evidence of this. If the slip were instantaneous
the length of the focus would probably be greater than the difference
between the length and breadth of the disturbed area, i.e., than about
12 miles.
    Again, the curve which includes all places on the north-west side
of the minor axis at which the sound preceded the shock, and all
those on the south-east side at which it followed the shock, bounds
the area over which the sound-vibrations from the north-west lateral
margin were perceptible.            Similarly may be obtained the area over
which the sound-vibrations from the south-east lateral margin were
observed.       The centres of these areas must, as a rule, lie vertically
over the corresponding lateral margins, and the distance between
them must therefore be less than the length of the seismic focus.
It is difficult to determine the centre of the north-west area very ex
actly, but the length of the fault-slip, as ascertained by this method,
cannot have been much less than 12 or 15 miles.
    It is possible, however, that the slipping did not take place in
stantaneously,* and, if so, these estimates may be a little too great.
But, in any case, the fault-slip must have been continued for some
distance under the Triassic rocks on which Leicester is situated.
    Nature of the Fault-Slip. — The intensity of the shock was greatest
on the north-east side of the fault at and near Woodhouse Eaves, and
on the south-west side at Markfield.            The line joining these places is
perpendicular      to   the fault-line,  and  we  may therefore conclude that
the slip was greatest at this part of the fault. For a distance of two
or throe milesf in either direction the slip may have been considerable,
and it then died out rather rapidly in amount towards the north
west, and much more slowly towards the south-east.                        That the
south-east lateral margin of the seismic focus was longer than the
north-west is shown (1) by the relative distances between the iso-
   * The great extension of the isoseismal 1 towards the south-east may be partly due
to the fault-slip starting near Woodhouse Eaves and spreading out rapidly in either
direction, but towards the south-east with a velocity not much greater than that of
the earth-wave.
   t  The difference between the length and breadth of the isoseismal     5 is about
five miles.

seismal lines     in these directions, and (2) by the greater prominence
of the sound in the south-east part of the disturbed area and of the
shock in the north-west part.
    After two or three seconds there appears (from the double charac
ter of the shock) to have been a second and slighter slip, probably at a
short distance to the north-west of the former.
    History of    the Charnwood Forest Fault. — The greater part of the
displacement along the anticlinal fanlt seems to have taken place in
pre- Carboniferous times, leaving only a few hundred feet to be ac
complished in subsequent periods.*               Earthquakes in the Charnwood
district are now extremely rare.             Between December 23, 1838, and
August 4, 1893, we have not one recorded.f                The shocks of the pre
sent century thus indicate at how slow a rate the fault is now grow
ing.      They also show that that growth has not yet ceased, and
enable us to form some conception of the vast interval of time over
which the life of a fault may extend.
    On the    Different Forms of Breathing." By William Marc¦t,
       M.D., F.R.S.        Received June 12,— Read June 21, 1894.
        Revised September 7, 1894.
    I mast beg leave at the outset to acknowledge the valuable aid of
my    Assistant,   Mr. R. B. Floris, F.C.S., in the present inquiry.           An
investigation of this kind, necessitating much consideration, can only
be carried to a successful issue by arguments and discussions, and to
Mr.    Floris much credit is due for the light these discussions have
shed on the inquiry ; I feel also indebted to him for the care he has
bestowed on the numerous analyses he has made for me, and for the
accuracy with which his work has invariably been done.
    Prom a general view of the function             of respiration it follows that
there are     four fundamental       forms of breathing ; their characters are
the   following : —
    1st. Normal breathing in the state of repose — a regular succession
of the respiratory movements, involuntary, unattended with fatigue,
and leaving an approximately unchanged balance between the CO2 in
store, in the blood, and the CO2 expired.                                  •
    2nd. Forced breathing — a voluntarily increased thoracic expansion,
bronght about by the contraction of muscles differing more or less
from those in comn on use in respiration and attended with fatigue.
The expiration of carbonic acid is increased beyond the normal ;

though not from excessive oxidation, with the exception of a small
amount due to the extra work of the respiratory muscles.
   3rd. Respiration under exercise — increased volumes of air inspired
and expired in a given time with an expiration of CO2 in excess of the
CO2 expired in repose, and unattended with fatigue. At the same time
there occurs an increase of the CO2 in store in the blood, which takes
place with a certain regularity during the first fifteen or eighteen
minutes after exercise has begun, and is irregular afterwards.       This
excess of stored up CO2 is given out as soon as exercise is followed by
repose.
   4th. The fourth form of breathing is under the influence of volition,
when exerted in a person's imagination towards a powerful muscular
exertion, while the muscles are in a perfect state of repose.        This
form of breathing exhibits the characters of forced respiration and
respiration under exercise.
   These four different forms of breathing have received special
attention, and will, collectively, be found to include every variety of
respiration. They have been recorded graphically in the charts which
accompany the present paper. By means of a drum revolving regu
larly by clockwork, and of a style at the end of a rod fixed to the
summit of the bell-jar into which the air was expired, tracings were
obtained on lithographed charts.      The abscissae on the charts indi
cate the litres of air expired, and the ordinates the minutes through
which the experiment was continued.
   The air expired was analysed, either for the determination of its
CO2 alone, or of its CO2, O, and N ; the volume of nitrogen obtained
yielded by a simple proportion the volume of air inspired.
   I  shall now beg to give an account of my inquiry on these different
forms of respiration.
               Jut. Normal Breathing in  the State of Ikpose.
   The methods adopted in the present work have been fully described
elsewhere ; as time elapsed improvements were introduced, and
this last year the bell-jars used for collecting the expired air, instead
of being exactly balanced as in former experiments, had their
counterpoise charged in such a way as to give a slight ascending
motion to the receivers when in free communication with tho atmo
sphere, the speed they acquired being rather less than would be
produced by the rush of air owing to the expiratory effort. Thus,
the respiration was unattended with the unconscious strain necessary
to raise the bell-jar while perfectly balanced. This effort, although
unnoticed at the time, had a slight tendency to bring on after a
     le a sensation of fatigue in the respiratory muscles, and pro-
     ly to increase, though to a very small amount, the volume of

                      On the different Forma       of Breathing.                    i)7
 COa expired    ;   at the same time the percentage of CO2 in that air was
somewhat greater than might have been anticipated.                       The present
arrangement made away with that slight defect. It should be under
stood that the person under experiment while inspiring through the
nose, first expired through a tube into the open air, then by means of
three-way stop-cocks was placed in communication with either of the
three bell-jars, used in these experiments ; thus, the bell-jar only
began ascending when the air was expired, while, during the period
of inspiration, the mouth-piece              retained in the mouth entirely
checked any ascending tendency of the receiver.
   This last season (1893-94), both            I  and Mr. Floris submitted to
experiment for the determination            of  our   carbonic acid expired and
oxygen absorbed         (not given out as CO2) in the state of            repose.   In
my case eleven experiments were made from 2 hours                        to 1\ hours
after luncheon (chop, potatoes, and bread), while four                   others were
undertaken within 1 hour and 5 minutes after lunch.                        The results

    The experiments on Mr. Floris are made partly after luncheon and
partly between           breakfast and luncheon.         There are fifteen of the
former and twelve of the latter.             The experiments after lunch show
more COa expired than those made after breakfast, and considerably
more O absorbed, the figure for the mean volumes of oxygen absorbed
being 40 5 c.c. after luncheon, and only 22-4 c.c. after breakfast.
     If we now compare with each other the present series of experiments
made individually for each of us, it will be seen that in those undertaken
at a mean time of 2 to 2j hours after luncheon, the ratio of O con
sumed to COa produced is all but exactly the same, these figures
being 0-830 in my case and 0-840 in that of Mr. Floris. Moreover,
if    the whole of the experiments on Mr. Floris be taken into account,
including those after luncheon and after breakfast, the respiratory
ratio will be 0-862, which is all but exactly the figure I formerly
obtained for myself, 0-S64 (means fasting and under food), and near
to the figure for a former assistant, 0"87o, these results agreeing
closely with the ratio given by Messrs. Jolyet Bergonie et Sigalas,
0 864, and by Mr. C. Speck, 0-869.
    "While in the experiments reported in my last paper, the volume
of oxygen consumed in a certain time was nearly the same for
each individual person (one excepted) under similar physical cir
cumstances, in the present instance there is a variation between the
volumes of oxygen consumed, the extreme difference amounts in my
case to 17 t> c.c., in that of Mr. Floris to 30 c.c. per minute.               More
over, wo no longer observe, as formerly, that the oscillations in the
 figures for carbonic acid expired, and corresponding oxygen absorbed
vary in a measure inversely to each other. After giving the question
a full consideration, I have come to the conclusion that this is due

 expired into bell- jars with weighted counterpoise, as previously ex-
 plained.     With the balanced bell- jar there was a slight amount of
 work done which gave the breathing a degree of steadiness wanting
 with the counterpoise weighted ; in the former experiments the very
 slight, though imperceptible, effort to raise the bell-jar gave regu
 larity to the respiratory function. It must be recollected that during
 the day time, sitting perfectly quiet in an arm-chair, from a quarter
 of an hour to an hour, is altogether unnatural in ordinary life.            We
 are always in a state of activity, and therefore the slight effort to
 raise the balanced bell-jar is perhaps more consistent with the ordin
 ary functions of life than breathing perfectly freely, doing practi
 cally no work, indeed breathing much as we do at night in bed and
 during sleep.      I therefore believe that the irregularity in the present
 figures obtained for the composition of expired air does not militate
 in any way against my former conclusion.
    The next subject for our consideration will be
                                  Forced Breathing.
     Let us follow the different stages of this form of respiration.        The
 person under experiment is resting in the recumbent posture and
 perfectly still, he then takes a succession of deep nasal inspirations
 while expiring through the mouth into one of the bell-jars.            After a
 certain time, say one, two, or three minutes, he suddenly relapses into
 natural automatic breathing, and then observes that his respiration
 subsides for a few seconds into a pause or state of apncea ; by degrees
 it returns, shallow and feeble, and then fuller, increasing beyond the
 normal. If the apncea has been great, the increase is well marked,
 but if comparatively slight the increase may be only just perceptible.
 These characters are invariably met with in every instance of "forced
              " and are
 breathing                  clearly shown by the tracings recorded in the
 charts.     The phenomenon may be conveniently illustrated by means
 of the following diagram —
    The horizontal     line   AA   represents normal respiration, the curve
AB the line of forced breathing,           the curve BC the collapse in the
respiration or apncea, and gradual return to normal,* which it exceeds
in CD, reaching finally the normal in D.
    With reference to the respiratory changes in these three successive
stages : — In the forced period, or from A to B, much more CO2 is

found to be       given oat of the blood than can be accounted for by the
oxygen consumed, or, in other words, the volume of air expired
exceeds in a marked degree the volume of air inspired.              Where can
the excess of C02 come from ?               It is evidently due to an emission
from the blood of a portion of C03 stored up within it.               This view
is advocated by        0. Speck    in his paper, which   has been referred to in
my last communication.              It will be shown presently that a further
and more direct proof of this interesting fact can be experimentally
given.
     Until tracings of the phenomenon had been obtained on the record
ing drum,       I  thought the return to normal respiration was effected at
the point C in the diagram, assuming that from B to C the blood
recovered its C03 entirely and replenished its store ; but as soon as
 tracings were obtained it became obvious that the final return to
 normal breathing failed to take place at C, and that the influence of
 the forced breathing continued to show itself as far as the point D.
     This influence may appear consistent with the observation of
 C. Speck, who allies the "after stage" of forced breathing to the
 " after            " of
            stage         breathing under exercise ; but the phenomenon
 appears     to   me   to be   strictly a character of forced respiration, inas
 much as it begins with apncea, passing                 gradually into slightly
 increased      breathing.
      In the following table the COa entered as expired in forced breathing
  is the total C02 expired from A to D in the diagram, and includes,
  therefore, the C02 expired in forced breathing plus the COa emitted
  in the stage of apncea and that obtained in the final reaction from
  C to D ; the whole volume being calculated per minute.
      It will be observed that the volumes of COa in the experiments in
  forced breathing (including after stage) invariably exceed the volumes
  of C02 obtained in the same lapse of time during rest ; this excess,
  which is entered in the table for each experiment, must represent the
  work done per minute in forced breathing.
       The mean amount of        this work done per minute would be equal to a
  combustion       yielding  62'5 c.c.  C02for the author, and 47'5 c.c. COafor
   Mr.    Floris, corresponding to a consumption of carbon of 0'034 gram
   per minute for the author and O025 gram per minute for Mr. Floris.
       The subject is further developed in the appendix to this paper.
       A great deal more COj is expired in forced respiration indepen
   dently of the reaction and after stage than in ordinary breathing, and
   I shall now beg to demonstrate experimentally that this excess of
   expired CO, is from the store of absorbed C02 in the blood (with the
   exception of the small proportion for work done) and not a product
   of   oxidation.
       In order to attain        that object, air forcibly inhaled was expired
    into three    different   bell-jars in succession, the air being diverted

    There can be no doubt, therefore, that the excess C02 expired in
forced breathing is a result of diffusion through the moist pulmonary
membrane        of some of the C03 stored up in the blood.                     Forced
breathing is concerned in sighing, yawning, and sneezing.
                           Breathing under Muscular Exercise.
   The third form of breathing is under muscular exercise when an
increased volume of air is breathed and a larger volume of CO.
expired than in a state of repose.                 It has been shown in my last
paper that the mean volume of oxygen, absorbed (not transformed
into C02), at all events within a few minutes (from 15 to 18 minutes)
after exercise has commenced, is the same as in the state of repose,
or nearly so ; this               I have confirmed by more recent experiments,
which, however, are not included in the present work. The increased
action of the respiratory muscles under exercise is involuntary, un
attended with fatigue, and differs in these respects from forced
breathing.       Again, in muscular exercise there is no apncea or reaction
after the exercise is arrested ; on assuming a state of repose the
breathing continues for a short time much the same as dur'ng

                    On  the differ¦nt  Forms of Breathing.                105
 exercise,   and then gradually returns to the normal.            This " after
        "
stage      of muscular exercise is attended with a feeling of breathless-
ness, due mainly to the C02 accumulated in the blood during exercise.
By increased expansion of the lungs, it soon finds its way into the
air inspired, and is thus removed from the blood.
    The tracing obtained on the chart for muscular exercise is steeper
than that for breathing in the state of repose ; on the person under
experiment assuming the recumbent posture in an armchair, the
 tracing will be observed to be somewhat prolonged, then it straightens,
 parallel with the tracing for breathing in repose.
    In none of these curves are there any signs of the reaction of
forced    breathing.
    Muscular exercise of every kind, including singing, reading, talk
ing, laughing, weeping, gives the same kind of tracing on the chart,
though of course more or less steep, as will be seen in the accom
panying curves.       But in such kinds of exercise as singing, reading,
talking, &c., which are not followed by breathlessuess, it will be seen
that the curve is either not prolonged at all, or but very slightly
after the exercise is over, returning quickly to the normal ; and
showing that in these cases the C02 is emitted as fast as it is formed,
or nearly so, little or none being detained in the blood.
    There are passive forms of exercise which also increase the volume
of air breathed and produce an excess of carbonic acid, such as
friction of the skin, and cutaneons irritation.          On the author's bare
legs being rubbed hard by two persons, the volume of air he expired
increased per minute from 3-892 litres to 4-441 litres, and the volume
of CO> from 182"6 c.c. to 208-6 c.c.          It may be therefore concluded
that "shampooing" is really a form of exercise, as it must be pro
ductive of increased combustion.           The application of a mustard leaf
to each leg, causing a powerful          degree of smarting, gave rise to a
similar effect on the respiration ; the volume of air breathed was in
creased per minute in one experiment from 4-719 litres to 5 099
litres, and the CO2 from 189-4 c.c. to 2267 c.c.
                  Breathing under    the  Influence of the Will.
    The  fourth form of- breathing is while under the influence of the
<nU.      It had occurred to me to inquire whether the mill without
muscular exercise was attended with an increased volume of air
breathed and a simultaneous excess of CO2 expired.               The experi
ment was carried out as follows.               The person under experiment
rested for a while in the recumbent posture in the deck chair, and
then expired naturally into the bell-jar connected with the recording.
 instrument, thus a tracing of his normal breathing was obtained.
 Then he commenced applying the will as he thought best, either to
                                                                    i 2

i-iirry a heavy weight. or to run up hill pursuing another person, or
to ride a bicycle up hill, or in any other form, care being taken to
keep the muscles absolutely at rest, when the result was invariably
:m increase in the volume of air expired, as shown in the chart.      On
suddenly dropping the influence of the will, and relapsing into the
usual state of mind, a slight reaction was visible on the chart re
calling forced breathing.        The line, however, is straighter, and
nearly free from the after rise observed in forced breathing, thus
exhibiting a slight tendency to the form of curve peculiar to breathing
under exercise.
     Let us now inquire more closely into the present form of breathing.
The moment the will is applied, as stated above, there is an increase
iu the volume of air breathed.         What is the reason of this pheno
menon ?      It must result from one of two different causes or from
Iwth — either an increased demand of oxygen by the blood, or the
acquired habit of breathing more air while under an exercise which
is itself controlled by the will. The increased action of the respiratory
 muscles when influenced      by an effort of the will is absolutely auto
 matic ;   there is no strain, no effort of any kind recalling forced
 breathing.    Together with a greater volume of air breathed per
 minute we observe a marked increase of CO2 produced and expired
— s.n increase which amounts to a mean of 20-9 c.c. per minute. These
-J0"9 c.c. of COa can only be due either to increased labour in the act
of breathing, or increased combustion from the effect of the will, or
to both these causes.    The increased respiratory labour which is un
conscious and unattended with fatigue must be very slight, and to
 my mind cannot account for 209 c.c. of CO2 per minute ; moreover,
 if the fact be taken into account that the increased volume of air
breathed under an effort of the will points distinctly to a demand
of oxygen from the air by the blood, and an increased production of
CO< which has to be emitted, we shall be more and more convinced
 that volition (powerfully exerted) is productive of carbonic acid.
     If we now turn our attention to the graphic illustration of breath
ing under a strong exertion of the will, we observe that the apncea
is somewhat less marked than in forced breathing, the curve
straightening and thus approaching that of respiration under mus-
cnlar exercise.
    Taking into account the whole of the ahove considerations, it
appears to mo that we are justified in concluding, as it were from
circumstantial evidence, in the absence of direct proof, that oxygen
 is absorbed and carbonic acid formed in the body from the mental
effort of the exertion of the will. A remark falls from Dr. Vaughan
 Harley, in a recent paper on " The Value of Sugar and the effect of
 Smoking on Muscular Work"* in keeping with the foregoing ob-
                       • '

which he was going to apply his fingers, the maximum power was
obtained at the very outset.                   The reason of this observation is
obvious.        The exercise of the will caused him to take into his lun,'s
an increased volume of air, and on that account he was the bettjr
prepared for the exercise the moment it was commenced.
    Professor Ramsay, of University College, kindly consented to
submit to tiie experiment, and others were made on myself and
Mr. Floris.         These experiments all give the same result, that breath
ing   under     the  influence of the will is a phenomenon attended with
an increased volume of air breathed, and a greater volume of car
bonic acid expired.
    The results of these              experiments     are   given        in the following

    The well       known interesting           experiment of Professor Mosso, of
 Turin, might be here recorded,               which demonstrates in the most con
 clusive   manner that the brain, from fatigue, loses its power to excite
  muscular contraction ; this experiment also favouring the conclusion
 that brain work is attended with combustion.
     Tbe following is a summary of the present inquiry : —
     There are four distinct forms of breathing, which include every
  variety of    respiration.
     1.  Natural breathing in the state of repose.
     2.  Forced breathing: — a voluntary increased action of the thora:.o

muscles    attended with fatigue and with an expiration of carbonic
acid increased beyond the normal.          This, however, is due mainly to
the displacement of carbonic acid present normally in the blood, a
small proportion of C02 only being the result of the work done by
the action of the muscles concerned in the forced respiration.            A
sudden return from forced to normal breathing in repose is attended
with an involuntary double reaction, the first being a respiratory
pause, and the second a slight increase of the respiration more or
less marked according to the intensity of the first reaction and
merging into natural breathing.
    3. Respiration    under exercise, exhibiting characters shown in the
tracings,   and  in other   respects described in a previous paper.
    4. Breathing in a state of muscular repose while under the influence
of a strong effort of volition. The characters of this form of respira
tion partake of breathing under muscular exercise and of forced breath
ing.    Like breathing during exercise, the volume of air respired is
increased, and the action of the respiratory muscles is automatic and
unattended with any fatigue, while there is an elimination of an
increase of C02.       Like forced breathing, on releasing the influence
of the will there is a slight reaction or pause, but it is distinctly less
 marked than after forced breathing, and the following after stage
 observed in forced breathing, is barely, if at all perceptible.       From
these circumstances      it  is concluded, though  as it were from  circum
 stantial evidence, that volition strongly exerted is productive of the
 formation of carbonic acid.
    The second form of breathing, or forced expiration, includes sneez
ing, sighing, and yawning.
    The third form of breathing, or under exercise, includes what may
 be called vocal breathing, or reading, talking, singing, weeping,
 laughing, shouting, and coughing.          In these instances there is but
 little or no C02 absorbed in the blood as it is given out as the exercise
 proceeds.
    The fourth form of breathing may be considered as including every
 kind of mental exertion.
     Finally, the different forms of breathing may assist or clash with
 each other.     Thus forced breathing assists breathing under exercise,
 especially when repose follows exercise.
     Forced respiration may clash with vocal respiration as shown by
the difficulty experienced in talking or singing immediately after
 forced breathing.
                                     Appendix.
    An explanation is wanted with reference to the production of heat
 required for the labour of forced breathing.       It might be objected in
 accordance with the statement of Hirn, in his book on the " Mechani

                      On the different Forms    of Breathing.                     109
cal Theory of Heat," that the heat emitted by an animal should be
measured by the amount of oxygen consumed, while                  I  look upon this
heat as due exclusively to the CO, produced.
   The fact contained in my last paper that the mean volume of
oxygen absorbed (not transformed into COa) in exercise, is the same
as that absorbed in the state of rest, shows clearly that the oxygen
absorbed is not concerned in the production of heat necessary for
muscular exercise.
   By an inspection of the following table, it will be clearly seen that

            On the  Absorption Spectra of Dilute Solutions.              117
"On the Absorption          Spectra of Dilute       Solutions."    By Thos.
       Ewan, B.Sc, Ph.D., 1851 Exhibition Scholar in Chemistry
       in the Owens College.        Communicated by Professor H. B.
       Dixon, F.R.S.      Received April 7 —Read June 21, 1894.
    The changes  which occur in the colour of a solution when its con
centration is changed, are closely connected with the simultaneous
changes which occur in the molecular condition of the dissolved sub
stance, and a study of these changes of colour may be expected therefore
to furnish valuable information as to the molecular condition of the
                                                  '
dissolved body. In a paper published in the Philosophical Magazine
                                                                             '
for 1892,   I described some experiments on the absorption spectra of
eolations of copper salts, which were made from this point of view. It
was found that with increasing dilution the spectra of the different
salts examined tended to become the same.              The solutions experi
mented with were, however, tolerably concentrated, which makes the
 interpretation of the results difficult, as, according to Kundt's rule,
the absorption     spectrum of a substance varies to some extent with
the dispersive power of the solvent in which it is dissolved, and,
therefore, when working with strong solutions there is always the
possibility that a change in the absorption, produced by changing
the concentration     of the solution, may be due to the alteration in
 dispersive power.      In order to avoid this uncertainty,      I  have con
 fined my attention      almost exclusively to dilute aqueous solutions.
 In such solutions   —   differing very little from pure water — a change
in colour can only be ascribed, according to our present knowledge,
to some change in the nature of the dissolved substance, and there
fore definite information as to the latter may be obtained.
    A very large number of observations on the spectra of dilute solu
tions of salts of the same metal with different colourless acids and
of the same acid with different colourless metals have been made by
Ostwald ('Zeit. Phys. Chem.,' 9, 579, 1892).          He miasured the posi
tion of the absorption bands in the spectra, and also photographed
them.      Both methods of observation showed that the absorption
spectra of all salts containing the same coloured metal or acid were
identical.    This is a necessary consequence of the electrolytic disso
ciation theory of Arrhenius.        For at the concentrations employed,
the salts being     almost completely dissociated into their ions, the
colour of all the salts containing the same coloured metal, for example,
 will be due to the same ion.
     As, however, no photometric        measurements of the absorption
 spectra of very dilute solutions have been made from this point of
  fiew, I thought it not superfluous to make a series of measurements

  118                           Dr. T. Ewan.          On  the
  with solutions of copper salts.             It was   found that the solutions of
 copper bromide, chloride, nitrate, and sulphate possess — within the
 limits of experimental error — the same absorption spectrum, while
 that of copper acetate is different.             The difference, however, dimin
 ishes with decreasing concentration.
    The absorption spectrum of the dilute solutions of copper salts
 differs but little from those of concentrated solutions of copper
 sulphate and nitrate, although in the latter the salts are only partly
 dissociated into their ions, and in the former much more completely.
 Observations of a similar nature have led Magnanini* to express the
 opinion that the absorption spectrum of a substance in solution is to
 be regarded as independent of the extent to which it is electrolytically
 dissociated. A more probable explanation is, as Ostwald has pointed
 out, that the absorption spectrum of the nndissociated molecule is
 very nearly the same as that of the ions, and therefore a change in the
 degree of dissociation will produce little alteration in the spectrum.
    A case in which the absorption of the nndissociated molecule dif
 fers considerably from that of its ions was also investigated by
 .Magnanini.    J    Solutions of the salts of violuric acid, in which the
salt is almost completely dissociated, possess a violet colour ; while
 .Magnanini found the solutions of the free acid to be nearly colour
less, although some 8 per cent. of the acid was dissociated into its
ions. J. Wagner,J however, did not succeed in obtaining colourless
solutions of the acid. He found that they had the same colour as
the solutions of the salts, and a comparison of the intensity of colour
in a solution of the free acid and in one of the sodium salt, showed
that the intensity of the colour was nearly proportional to the number
of ions present.
    In dinitrophenol I have found another case of this sort. The
solution containing only undissociated molecules is almost colourless,
while solutions containing dissociated molecules are bright yellow.
 From the measurements of the absorption spectra of these solutions
I  have been able to calculate the fraction of the dinitrophenol disso
ciated into its ions at different concentrations, and the numbers so
obtained are in very satisfactory agreement with those calculated
from the electrical conductivity.
    Besides the chauges of colour which may be ascribed to the electro
lytic dissociation of the dissolved substance, changes of colour occur in
consequence of its hydrolysis by the water. As an example of this kind
of change, I have studied the ferric salts, especially ferric chloride.
The results are, however, more complicated than those obtained with

bodies which are only eleetrolytically           dissociated, aDd it will be better
to consider them along          with the experimental numbers. Changes of
colour may also be due to the breaking up of polymeric molecules into
smaller ones.        It was found that solutions of colloid ferric hydroxide,
obtained by dialysis, absorb less light than those obtained by the
hydrolytic decomposition of ferric chloride, and in this case there is
some reason to suppose that the dialysed hydroxide consists of larger
molecular groups than that formed in the very dilate solution of
ferric chloride.
                                 Apparatus Employed.
    The measurement of the quantity of light of given wave-length
which is absorbed by a substance                  in very dilute solution, is not
very easy.       In order to compensate for the small absorbing power of
the    solutions,   it is necessary to employ long layers of them, and this
makes it almost impossible to use a spectrophotometer such as that
of Vierordt.          The apparatus shown in fig. 1 was therefore put
together.*        Both   for advice and assistance in its construction, and
for the loan of valuable apparatus,            I  am much indebted to Professor
A. Schuster, F.R.S. My thanks are also due to the Government
Grant Committee of the Royal Society, who provided me with the
 means of obtaining several pieces of apparatus.
    Fig. 1 is a diagramatic representation of the arrangement of the
parts of the apparatus as seen from above.
    It consists of a collimator A, with two lenses, a and b, of 20 in.
 focal length, which are both filled with light from the slit c.                 The
source of light was an incandescent

                                                    Auer lamp ; and in order to
 distribute the light more evenly a plate of ground glass was intro
duced between the lamp and the slit.                 When it was desirable (as in
 the violet and extreme red ends of the spectrum) to obtain a stronger
 illumination this was removed. The parallel beam of light from the
 lens a passes through the solution ; that from 6 was used as the
 standard of comparison ; the object of using only one source of light
 being to keep the ratio between the brightness of these two beams
constant.       The solutions were contained in tubes which rested on
 Y-shaped supports. capable of sliding along the bar C, D, which was
 clamped to the board on which the apparatus rested, and which
 allowed of a horizontal adjustment of the position of the tube.                 The
 Y-supports allowed of a vertical adjustment.                The ends of the tubes
 were ground as nearly as possible parallel to each other, and closed
 by plates of glass which were simply pressed against the ground ends,
 no cement or washer being necessary.                The tubes were 34 — 5 mm.

internal diameter, and the longest (length         =  1 metre) was provided
with five   rings of ebonite (2 — 3     mm. wide), distributed at eqnal dis
tances along its inside in order to prevent reflexion from the walls.
The shorter tubes were provided with black paper rings at their ends
for this purpose.       After passing through the solution, the light is
reflected internally by a right-angled flint-glass prism E, and falls on
the Lummer and Brodhun prism F.*                  The construction of this
photometric      prism has been described minutely by Lummer and
Brodhun (' Zeitschrift fur Instrumentenkunde,'             1889, p. 461 ; and
1892, p. 46).       It consists of two right-angled prisms, ground and
polished together on their hypothenuse surfaces, and held together as
shown in fig. 2. Certain parts of the surface of one prism are removed,
at a, a for example, so that the light coming from E is totally reflected
at the surfaces a, but transmitted at 6.        The light from lens 6 is only
transmitted at the surfaces b. Consequently, an eye placed at O sees
the surface 6, b, b, a, a, illuminated      on the parts marked a by light
from E, and on the parts b by light from the lens 6.             The measure
 ment then consists in varying the brightness of the light coming
 from lens 6, until the brightness of the different surfaces is the same.

  also be made at the same time.         For the details of this arrangement,
  however,   I  must refer to Lummer and Brodhun's original papers.
     The variation of the intensity of the light from lens b was pro
  duced by means of the rotating sector described by Abney (' Phil.
  Mag.,' vol. 27, p. 62, 1889).      The sector was made by Mr. A. Hilger.
     After passing through the prism F, the two beams of light follow
  the same path through the two colourless flint-glass prisms G and (one   I
  of 60°, the other 45°). The lens g then throws the spectrum thus pro-

 122                     Dr. T. Ewau.       On the
 duced on to the slit /. The tube K can be rotated round the centre
 of the iron table (represented in the figure by a circle ; it was part of
 a large Steinbeil spectroscope), and thus the slit /can be made to cut
 out portions of any desired wave-length from the spectrum. The eye
 placed behind the slit then sees the surface of the photometer prism
 in the colour of the part of the spectrum which is allowed to pass by
 the slit. Both slits were provided with micrometer screws, the heads
 of which were divided into 100 parts, and one whole turn of which
 opened the slit 0-5 mm.      The axle round which the telescope, K,
 turns ended below the table in a small mirror, which turned with
 the telescope, and which served for reading its position by means of
 the millimetre scale and telescope, MM. The wave-lengths of the light
 passing through the slit, /, were measured by means of a small spec
troscope with graduated arc, the readings of which were converted
 into wave-lengths by means of a curve drawn from readings of the
 positions of the principal Fraunhofer lines. The lamp was enclosed
 in a blackened box, and all the parts of the apparatus covered as
 much as possible by blackened screens.       In the later measurements
 the lamp was connected with a gas pressure regulator, as variations
 in the gas pressure are apt to cause changes in the ratio of the
 brightness of the two beams of light.
    A difficulty which was encountered at first was due to the ends of
the glass tubes containing the solutions not being exactly parallel.
They act as prisms of very small angle, and deflect the light which
passes through them to some extent ; so that, after adjusting the two
 images of the slit, c, which are formed by the two lenses, a and b, to
fall together at /, and pntting in the tube of solution, the two images
 no longer coincide. The light coming from the lens, 6, is unchanged,
while that from a has a colour differing from that which it had at
first. It was therefore necessary to have some method of adjusting
quickly and accurately the two images to fall together. This was
done by allowing the light reflected from the front surface of the
prism, G, to fall on a mirror, N, from which it was reflected into the
telescope, O.     This was an ordinary telescope, in which the two
images of the slit, c, were seen, side by side, as two bright lines,
which could easily be brought to coincidence by rotating somewhat
the prism, F. A glance at fig. 2 will show that, by a small rotation
of this prism, the direction of the light from the lens, 6, is unchanged,
while that of the light from a is changed by twice the angle through
which the prism iR rotated.
   The careful adjustment of the apparatus was also necessary irt
order to obtain good results. This was done briefly as follows : —
    The collimator lenses were placed at their focal distance from the
slit, r, and the lamp arranged (the ground glass plate being removed)
so that they were both just filled with light.   The triangular ground

glass plate on which the prisms stand was then placed as nearly as
possible horizontal, and the prisms adjusted with their refracting
edges vertical by reflecting the light from the slit, c, first from one
.surface and then from the other into the telescope, K (the slit of this
telescope being replaced by an eye-piece with cross threads) nntil the
images reflected from the two surfaces were seen in the same position.
The telescope, K, was then placed horizontal, and the collimator
levelled, so that the images of the slit, c, seen in the telescope were in
the centre of the field of view.
    The right-angled prism, E, was then put in position and levelled,
so that the light underwent no vertical displacement on passing
through it. The Lummer and Brodhun prism is next treated in the
same way, and finally the two refracting prisms are put in position
and adjusted to minimum deviation.          The angle at which the light
was internally reflected in the right-angled prism was in my apparatus
43° 30'.   As the critical angle for flint glass is 37° 19' there was no
danger    of the internal reflexion being incomplete.       Finally it was
found to be of great importance that the light should pass centrally
through the tube of solution.    To adjust the tube, cross threads were
attached to the lens, a. This was conveniently done by means of a
brass ring which just slipped over the tube carrying the lens to which
the threads were attached.      A card with a pin-hole in it was set up
at a distance of about a metre and half from the lens in such a posi
tion that the prolongation of the line joining the centre of the slit,
e, and the intersection of the cross threads passed through the pin
hole.    The tube of solution, also provided with cross threads at each
end, was then placed in position and adjusted, so that, on placing the
eje behind the little hole in the card, the intersections of all three
cross threads fell together. It was found that a perfectly satisfactory
adjustment could be got in this way.
                      Method of making    the Readings.
    The sector being open to its full extent, the brightness of the two
lights was arranged by putting a smoke-glass plate in the collimator
at d, so that the comparison light was a little brighter than the other.
 The width of the slits was taken as small as was consistent with
 having sufficient light. Five readings were then made of the ratio
 between the intensities of the two beams.       The tube of solution was
 then put in position, the two images adjusted to coincide, and five
 more readings made.      Then the readings were repeated, the tube
 being,  however,  the second  time placed in such a position that the
 deflection of the light was in the opposite direction ; consequently
  the tube rotated 180° round its long axis.
     When the means of these sets of readings did not agree, the ad

justment was generally defective, and was repeated. As the apparatus
 was not very rigid, owing to its size, the adjustments had to be
repeated every two or three weeks.    That of the tube of solution was
 done before each set of measurements, and the wave-lengths of the
 light were read after each day's work. The following readings were
made on a solution of CuS04 in the tube 1 meter long ; they are read
ings of average goodness, and will serve to show the sort of difference*
which occurred between the single readings. The numbers given are

   The quantity which is directly measured is the amount of light
which is lost by passing through a system consisting of two glass
plates with a layer of aqueous solution between them. In order to
calculate from these numbers the part of the light absorbed by the
dissolved substance, it is necessary to allow for the light reflected or
absorbed by the glass plates and the water. To obtain the necessary
formulae,        I have
                   applied the equations given by Stokes (' Roy. Soc
Proc.,' vol. 11, p. 545) to this special case as follows : —
  Call the fraction of the light incident on the glass plate from air,
which is reflected                =                 J        and the same quantity when                 the

   It will be seen that to a wave-length of about 513 the glass was
completely transparent, the loss of light on passing through the
plates being entirely accounted for by the reflections at their surfaces.

     The numbers obtained by Hiifner and Albrecht (' Wied. Ann.,' vol.
 42, p. 10,   1891) are also included in the table. The agreement is satis
 factory except at wave-lengths 576-5 and 55V5.                Owing to this lack
 of agreement     I repeated the measurements in this part of the spec
 trum several times, but never found such large absorptions as Hiifner
 and Albrecht.
     In fig. 3 the values of e are plotted against the wave-lengths.                  The

                             Solutions of Cupric Salts.
    The salts used were cupric sulphate, nitrate, chloride, bromide, and
acetate.     They were purified carefully, notwithstanding which the
solutions made by dissolving them in water were not sufficiently clear
to be measured.         Filtration through fine Swedish filter paper only
improved them a little.         The desired freedom from suspended par
ticles was, however, easily obtained by filtration through porous
earthenware. The apparatus shown in fig. 4 was found to be very con
venient, as it allowed of two or three litres of a solution being filtered
without requiring any attention. A and B are ordinary Winchester
quart bottles, C is the " Chamberland Pasteur candle."                  The solution
to be filtered is contained in A. B is ovacuated, and the apparatus
left to itself till the solution has filtered. Two litres could be filtered
in an hour, or less if a good vacuum was kept up.
    The solutions measured were always analysed as the filtration
changes their concentration somewhat. Two methods of analysis
were used, and the mean result taken.

  (1.) From 0"5 to 1 litre of the solution was evaporated to dryness
(with a little hydrochloric or acetic acid) on the water bath, the
residue dissolved in a small quantity of water, excess of potassium
iodide added,   and the liberated iodine titrated with sodium thio-
salphate solution.   In order to obtain accurate results by this method
the cupric solution must be concentrated, otherwise the reaction with
potassium iodide is incomplete, and the thiosulphate solution must be
standardised by means of pure CuSO4 in exactly the same way as it
is subsequently  to be used in the analyses.
   (2.) The solutions, without evaporation, were titrated with potas
sium cyanide solution in presence of ammonia.     Here also the KCN
       was always standardised by means of a solution of CuSO4 of
solution
known strength before using it, as its strength changes on keeping.
The   results of the two methods agreed satisfactorily.
   The results of the photometric measurements are contained in Table
II Appendix. In order to be able to compare the absorption spectra
of the different solutions, the extinction coefficients c for the dissolved
substance for 1 cm. layer, and for a concentration of 1 gram molecule
per litre, have been calculated from the values of e, given by equation 2
 (p.125) . The extinction coefficient   proportional to the length of layer
                                             is

                Absorption Spectra of Dilute Solutions.                131
   In some cases the numbers given by two different sets of measure
ments were so neai"ly the same that they were united to one curve.
This was the case with CuSOi      III and  II  and part of the numbers for
CnCl2; and also with the two solutions of Cu(C2HaO2)2 X and XI.
Leaving for the present the numbers for Cu(C2HaO2)a out of account,
it is evident that the differences which occur between the numbers
obtained with different solutions of the same salt are as great as
those which are found between solutions of different salts.            The
absorption spectra of the four salts CuSO,, CuCl2, Ca(NOa)2, and
CaBr2 must accordingly, in the concentrations used, be regarded as
the same.
   In the following table (p. 132) the means of the above numbers
are compared with the numbers which           I formerly obtained (- Phil.
Mag.' [5], vol. 33, p. 317, 1892).
   These numbers show that the absorptions change very little when
the solutions are diluted.       The electrolytic dissociation, however,
changes   considerably.    For CuSO4 the fraction of the salt electrolytic-
ally dissociated increases from 0-317 in the stronger solution to 0-49-i
in the more dilute.      For CuCla the increase is from 0-634 to 0"920.
That the change in dissociation produces very little change in the
absorption is most simply explained by supposing that the Cu exist
ing in chemical combination with other atoms in the solution has the
same absorption spectrum as the copper ion.          In the case of CuCl2
this leads to a result of some interest.    For the concentrated aqueous
solution of cupric chloride and also its alcoholic and ethereal solu
tions are brownish-green in colour, and as these solutions doubtless
contain the molecule CuCI2 we cannot ascribe to it the same absorp
tion spectrum as to the Cu ion.          In the dilute solutions of CuCl2
examined, therefore, the combined part of the copper probably exists
in the form of the ion CuCl.       This is also in good agreement with
the observation which     I made formerly (' Phil. Mag.,' 1892) : that the
rapid change in the absorption spectrum which accompanies the dilu
tion of a concentrated solution of CuCl2 ceases when the concentra
tion reaches a value lying between 0-5 and 0-2 gram molecules per litre.
 The fractions of the salt dissociated in these concentrations, calcu
lated from the electrical conductivities of the solutions, are 0 41 and
0-634 respectively.     It would appear thus that on diluting a strong
solution of cupric chloride the CuCl2 molecules first dissociate into
the ions CuCl and CI, and that the dissociation of the CuCl ions only
takes place to any considerable extent after this process is tolerably
complete, that is, after the dissociation of the salt has reached 50 per
cent.   This behaviour is very common in the case of dibasic acids, of
 which a large number have been examined by Ostwald (' Zeitschrift
 fur Phys. Chem.,' vol. 3, pp. 186 and 280, 1889).
    It will be seen from Table    III  that the extinction coefficients of

                    Absorption Spectra of Dilute Solutions.                            133
solutions of copper acetate are much            larger than those of the other salts.
The concentrations of the two solutions, the measurements on which
are there given, were 0-003748 and 0 004203 gram molecules per litre
respectively.        The following numbers (Table V) show that the ex
tinction coefficients diminish rapidly when the concentration becomes
smaller.      The most dilute solution used still gives larger extinction
coefficients than those found for the other copper salts, but it was
unfortunately not possible with my apparatus to make accurate
measurements with still smaller concentrations, so that                     I was unable
to    find out     whether the absorption spectrum of copper acetate
becomes       ultimately identical with that of the others or not; it
appears,     however, to tend to do so.*

     Two explanations         of the abnormal behaviour of copper                   acetate
 solutions offer themselves : (1) The electrolytic              dissociation       into Cu
 ions may be incomplete, and the still undissociated part of                       the salt
 may have a different colour from the Cu ion ; (2) the salt                         may be
 partially hydrolysed, acetic acid being a so much weaker acid than
 the others used.        In the latter case, however, one would expect the
 difference between the spectrum of copper acetate and that of the
 other salts to become greater with increasing dilution, as in the more
 dilute solutions the hydroly tic decomposition would be most advanced.
 The opposite, however, is the case.                The addition of acetic acid to
 the solutions should, by diminishing the amount of hydrolysis, bring
 the copper acetate         spectrum nearer to that of the others, if the
     * The              of observations of absorption spectra made without the help
            uncertainty
  of photometric measurements is      illustrated by the following remark of Knoblauch
                                                " Ebensowenig wie bei Xupfersulfat zeigte
  (- Wied. Ann.,' toI. 43, p. 754). He says :
  sicb. bei Eupferacetat mit der Verdiinnung eine Veranderung            im Character des
  Spectrums.     Die Beobachtung der Absorptions-Grenze im Roth war auch bei
  diesem 8alze fur verdiinnte     L8sungen durch die Absorption des Wassers beein-
  triohtigt." Table V shows that a not very considerable dilution (about one to
  fiTe) reduced the absorbing power of a copper acetate solution by about one-half.

difference       were   due to      hydrolytic decomposition.            The following
measurements of         e  show that again the opposite to this really occur*.

    That     some     very small amount of hydrolytic dissociation takis
place is, however, probable. Dibbits* found that a solution of copper
acetate in the cold is very weakly acid towards litmus, and that on
warming it basic salts separate out, and on boiling the decomposition
into acetic acid and basic salt reaches about 50 per cent.                     The most
dilute solntions which I used did not deposit any visible quantity of
copper hydroxide on the porous vessel through which they were
filtered, and, even after standing for three days, the filtered solution
remained perfectly clear. The behaviour of the solutions of copper
acetate is, on the other hand, qualitatively at any rate, in agreement
with the hypothesis that the substance is dissociated into ions.
Professor J. H. van't Hoff was so kind as to place the results of an
unpublished set of determinations made by him of the electrical con
ductivity of solutions of copper acetate at my disposal, for which 1
take this opportunity of again expressing my indebtedness to him.
The numbers are given in Table VII.

    It will    be  noticed that k remains constant till 0 35 of the salt is
dissociated, after which it diminishes.             This behaviour reminds one
strongly of that of the dibasic acids studied by Ostwald ('Zeit-
schrift fur Phys. Chem.,' vol. 3, p. 170, 1889) ; the only difference is
that with the acids k finally increases instead of diminishing. It

seems   probable then that jnst as the dibasic acid first split off one

splits up first into the ions Cu(C2HsO2)and(C2Ha02), and then the ion
Ci^CaHsOa)        breaks up, after the first process is fairly complete, into
the ions Cn and (C2HaO2).               Calculated from the numbers for the

   These     two solutions       will accordingly contain the ions Cu and
Cu(C>HaOa),       the greater the quantity of the latter the more will the
colour   of the solution differ from the normal. The addition of acetic
acid to the solution diminishes the dissociation of the copper salt, and
so increases the difference of the colour from the normal.

   As  I could find no satisfactory way of analysing the dilute solutions
of these salts,  I made them by dissolving a weighed quantity of the
carefully purified salt in water. The solutions so obtained were fairly
olear.    The values of t (the extinction coefficient for the dissolved
lx>dy for 1 cm. layer and 1 gram molecule per litre concentration) are
given in the following table. The experimental numbers are given
in the same way as before in the Appendix Table III.
   The numbers given in Table           VIII   are obtained from the numbers
in Table   III of the Appendix by graphical interpolation.              The con
centrations are in gram molecules per litre.
   The two most concentrated solutions used give somewhat smaller
numbers than the others, which may probably be attributed to the
electrolytic dissociation being incomplete in the stronger solutions.
The numbers obtained with the other solutions vary irregularly ;
by taking their mean the following numbers are obtained.

    The absorption increases so extremely rapidly between the wave
lengths 470 and 500 that a small error in the measurement of the
wave-length can make a great difference in the value of e obtained.
Taking this into account the absorption spectra of the potassium and
ammonium salts may be regarded as the same.                     These salts dis
sociate electrolytically    into the   ions   K+ or NH4+ and CtH>(NO>)2O— .
The mean of the above numbers may therefore be taken -as represent
 ing the absorption spectrum of the ion CtHa(NO2)aO.

    The behaviour of the solutions of the free dinitrophenol is of some
 interest. The solutions in benzene or ether are brownish-yellow, but
 the colour is faint, and unless they are fairly concentrated they
appear colourless.        An alcoholic solution is much more strongly

potash solution added to either the alcoholic                            or aqueous solutions
increases the depth of colour.      The addition of hydrochloric acid
diminishes      till, with some excess of acid,
                 it,                                 disappears almost   it
entirely. The fact that the solutions of dinitrophenol in benzene 01
ether are only faintly coloured, suggests that the undissociateil
dinitrophenol molecule      devoid of any great absorbing power in the
                                  is

ing the solutions of dinitrophenol       also due to its converting the

obtain the spectrum of the undissociated dinitrophenol a solution

clear. They had,   therefore, to be filtered through the porous earthen
ware and analysed.      The analysis was made by titration with                                         a
dilute ammonia solution, using litmus as indicator.      The change of
colour not being very sharp, standard hydrochloric acid was addeil
till the liquid was acid, and then ammonia till alkaline, and so on
several times. Tests with solutions of known concentration showed
that accurate results could be obtained in this way. The following
tabic contains the extinction coefficients of the solution containing
excess of hydrochloric acid, and also for comparison, the mean of the
numbers obtained with the potassium and ammonium salts.

   The agreement found between the numbers obtained from two so
very different properties as the absorption of light and electric
conductivity, is so striking, taking into account the very considerable
experimental error, that little doubt can be felt as to the substantial
accuracy of the hypothesis on which the whole calculation is based.
                                       Ferric Salts.
   The changes of colour which take place when the aqueous solution
of a ferric salt is diluted are so considerable that they appear to
offer a very suitable means of determining the amount and nature
of the decomposition which the salt undergoes.
   In 1856, Pean de St. Gilles,* made a study of the decomposition
which ferric salts undergo on heating their aqueous solutions.                         He
noticed the peculiar appearance of the solutions containing ferric
hydroxide, they being clear by transmitted, but apparently turbid by
reflected light. He was aware that the hydrate exists in the liquid
in a state of pseudo solution and uncombined with the acid present,
                                                 "
as the following remark shows : — II semblerait plutot que l'acide
ac^tique exerce sur l'hydrate une action purement mecanique en
divisant a l'extreme les particnles insolubles et simulant ainsi une
dissolution veritable."
   In 1861, Grahamf showed how the colloidal ferric hydroxide can
 be prepared by dialysis, and described its principal properties.                      He
 regarded it as being different from the soluble hydroxide obtained
 by Pean de St. Gilles, by heating the solution of ferric acetate.
    Gunning,}: in 1869, Tichborne,§ in 1871, and Berthelot,|| in 1873,
 made studies of the decompositions which occur both on heating the
 solutions and on diluting them with water. Their results, however, do
 not lend themselves to a calculation of the amount of decomposition
 which has taken place. In 1871, Krecke^f made a number of deter
 minations of the quantity of ferric hydroxide formed in solutions of
 ferric chloride of different concentrations, and at various temperatures.
 The amount of ferric hydroxide present was determined by precipitat
 ing it with sodium chloride. He found that the precipitate formed by
 heating solutions of ferric chloride containing more than 4 per cent
of the salt contained a variable amount of chlorine.                          The more

     Finally, G. Wiedemann,* in 1878, pnblished an investigation on
the    hydrolysis of ferric salts, the determinations of the amount of
hydrolysis which had taken place being made by means of the
molecular magnetism of the solutions.                 The molecular magnetism of
 iron in the form of hydroxide being 0-16 of its value in a strongly
acid solution, a measurement of the magnetism of a solution of
 known strength allows the ratio in which the iron is divided between
 the two forms to be calculated.
     The fact that, as Krecke observed, the precipitate formed by
 heating solutions of ferric chloride contains chlorine, and also an
 observation, made by Picton and Linder,f that on filtering a solution
 of colloid ferric hydroxide containing              chlorine through a porous cell
  the filtrate contained neither iron nor chlorine, led me in the first
  place to attempt to decide whether the hydroxide formed in dilute
  solutions of ferric chloride contained chlorine or not.
      For this purpose solutions of known concentration were filtered
  through a porous cell.         The cell was first well washed with distilled
  ¦water, and then a quantity of the solution              filtered through it to re
   move the water from its pores.               The next portion of the filtered
   solution was collected and analysed.                The difference between the
   composition of the original solution and that of the filtrate gives the
   composition of the substance held back by the porous cell.                        The
   filtration apparently removed the hydroxide completely from the
   solution.     The yellow-brown coloured solutions were, after filtration,
   either  completely colourless or very faintly yellow, according to their
   concentration.        This method of analysis has the drawback that the
   solution changes its concentration to some extent during the filtra
   tion partly owing to evaporation in the vacuous vessel into which it
   is filtered, partly owing to the-difficulty in removing the water which
   has served for washing the cell from its pores.                A direct analysis of
   the precipitate is hardly possible as it cannot be collected on a filter,
   nor can it be washed by decantation, as it refuses to settle.                 Further,
    to wash it with water is not allowable, as it would tend to change its
   composition.       The ferric chloride used was purified by repeated re-
    crystallisation of the hydrate, FeaCL>lSHaO ;J an analysis of its solu
    tion showed     that it contained iron and chlorine             in the ratio repre
    sented   by its formula.

    The     decrease     in the concentration           of chlorine in the solutions,
caused      by filtration,   is so small      (in   one case there was even an in
crease), that it appears probable that the substance separated from
the solutions is really a hydroxide of iron, and contains no chlorine.
The changes of concentration of the chlorine are probably sufficiently
explained by the errors inherent in the method used, which have
been already mentioned.                On the qther hand the loss of iron in

    The    numbers            now     found   are       approximately        constant.    As
   That     the dissociation constant of ferric hydroxide
           is,                                                  about 9000    is
times that of water.      Ferric hydroxide       thus an extremely weak

comparison,* the dissociation constants of KC1 = 0'00958, that of
CuS04 = 0-0001898, so that ferric chloride must be regarded as one
of the exceptionally slightly dissociated salts.
    A number of photometric measurements were made of the absorp
tion spectra of solutions of ferric chloride, but their peculiar properties
make      rather difficult to obtain accurate results. The solutions
          it
were made by diluting a concentrated solution of ferric chloride,
which had been made as clear as possible by  filtration through paper.
They were then allowed to stand till no further change took place in
their colour   they were then without visible turbidity, they were
                 ;   if
nsed for measurement, but, owing to the peculiar fluorescent appear
ance of solutions containing colloid ferric hydroxide, was not easy          it
to see whether they were really free from solid suspended particles
or not.
    The numbers which are contained              VI of the Appendix,
                                                        in Table

                                                    is
agree approximately with the results of the filtration experiments
given above.   The calculation of the amount of ferric hydroxide in
the solutions was made as follows — The most dilute solution of
                                                    :
FeCl, which was used (XXV, Table XII), and another one to which
a  small quantity of ammonia had been added (XXVI, Table XII),
gave nearly the same numbers.     The decomposition in these solutions
appeared to be complete, as neither of them gave a red colour on
addition of excess of ammonium sulphocyanide.       Solutions of colloid
ferric hydroxide, obtained by dialysis, also give no red colour with
sulphocyanide.      took the absorptions of these solutions as corre
                      I
sponding   to complete hydrolysis.    The smaller absorptions of the
other solutions will then correspond to a proportionately smaller de
composition,    we assume that the whole absorption

                   Absorption Spectra of Dilute. Solutions.                       147
experiments       show, the removal of the hydroxide from the solutions
leaving them nearly coloarless.
    All the soluttons in which the hydrolysis was incomplete gave the
red colour with ammonium sulphocyanide.
    The measurements which           G. Wiedemann made of the amount of
hydrolysis in the more concentrated solutions of ferric chloride appear
to be in harmony with the results given in Table XI.                The numbers,
when plotted against concentrations, give two curves, which appear
to be parts of the same curve.
    Colloid Ferric Hydroxide. — A solution was prepared by dialysing a
solution of ferric chloride in which a quantity of ferric hydroxide
 had been dissolved.         It was clear red-brown by transmitted but
apparently     turbid  by  reflected   light ; it gave no deposit on standing
 for three months, and passed through filter paper without leaving
any residue.       A solution of NH4SCN coagulated it, but gave no red
colour.     Analysis showed that it contained 12-4 per cent, of the
amount of chlorine corresponding to the formula FeCl2.                 The extinc
tion coefficients obtained for different solutions, made by diluting this
solution, are given in Table          XIII   ;  they are obtained by graphic

   The nnmbers, on the whole, show some tendency to increase as the
dilution increases.      A   comparison with the numbers obtained for the
completely hydrolysed solutions of ferric chloride                  (last column,
Table XIII) shows that the spectra are entirely                 different.     There

148                                Dr. T. Ewan.           On the
the ferric chloride solution, and one would imagine that if all the
iron exists as hydroxide in a solution containing an equivalent quan
tity of chlorine this should be certainly the case in one containing
only some 12 per cent. of that quantity of chlorine.                       An explanation
is,   I  think, suggested by an observation made by Picton.* Be
noticed that a solution of antimony hydrosulphide, obtained by
pouring a solution of tartar emetic into one of sulphuretted hydrogen,
possessed only a fuint fluorescence, and, under the microscope, no
particles were visible in it. On dialysing the solution the fluorescence
increased, and gradually minute particles became visible under the
microscope ; finally the solution coagulated.                         Picton and Linder
(- J. Chem. Soc.,' 1892, 154) found also that silicic acid behaves in
quite a similar way. In a colloid solution of silicic acid containing
hydrochloric acid the particles were too small to reflect light, while
after dialysis they were large enough to do so. Krecke (loc. cit.)
also found that, on dialysing a concentrated ferric chloride solution,
it finally coagulated. It would appeal- as though the dialysis always
favoured the formation of larger molecular aggregates.                          A possible
reason for this, in the case of ferric hydroxide, at any rate, is not
difficult to see.         In the solutions containing hydrochloric acid the
hydroxide         must   be    regarded as constantly being acted upon by the
acid with formation of ferric chloride, which is at once decomposed
agiiin. Consequently the hydroxide never has the opportunity of
forming large molecular groups.
                  Solutions containing        excess  of Hydrochloric Acid.
    The addition of a small quantity of hydrochloric acid to a solution
containing the hydroxide diminishes the quantity of the latter, and
therewith the intensity of the brown colour of the solution, to a
marked extent.             I   found, for example, by filtration through the
Chamberland Pasteur candle, that the addition of one-sixth of an
equivalent of HC1 to a dilute solution of feme chloride reduced the
quantity of Fe(OH)a present by nearly a. half.                         The following are

    Larger quantities of acid seem to prevent the formation of ferric
hydroxide       altogether, as the acid solutions could all be filtered
through       the  porous cell without leaving any deposit. The analyses
also showed that their concentration was not diminished by the filtra
 tion.

    These numbers          appear to be somewhat irregular, but a glance at
fig. 5   will show that this is due to the way the curves cross each
other.      The curve XXX of the solution containing the smallest
excess of hydrochloric acid has a strong resemblance to the curve
for Fe(OH)a, which is included in the figure for comparison (with
ordinates divided by 100).             If the whole absorption of solution XXX
were due to hydroxide, the amount of hydrolysis would only be                        \ to
£   per  cent.  of    the   salt  present.    In   the curve   for the  next  solution,
XXXI, the similarity to that of the hydroxide has disappeared, and as
the quantity of acid is increased the curves evidently approach more
and more towards that of the concentrated acid solution XXXV,
which may be taken             as representing       approximately     the absorption
spectrum      of the undecomposed molecule of ferric chloride.               Whether
these   changes are due         to the change of the dissociated ferric chloride
into   undissociated, or       to tho conversion of a soluble oxychloride into
ferric chloride cannot           be decided.     It is certain that these solutions
contain none of the            colloid hydroxide, but they possibly contain a
soluble      oxychloride. Wiedemann found that solutions of ferric
 nitrate   and sulphate, containing excess of acid, still contain a con-

acid  solutions of the chloride, but as found that the acid solutions          I
of ferric nitrate and sulphate behave very much in the same way as
the chloride with respect to colour, we may perhaps conclude that
all these solutions contain some really soluble substance standing
between the undissociated normal molecules and colloid ferric hydr
oxide.
    Some  measurements which were made with ferric nitrate and
sulphate gave results similar to those obtained with the chloride, but
they are very much less complete.
   The following table contains the measurements made on concen
trated acid solutions   of ferric sulphate and nitrate, and with a
solution of ferric sulphocyanide in ether;    owing to the ease with
which the latter decomposes the numbers are only approximate, they
will serve, however, to give some notion of the relative magnitude of
its absorption.

ferric chloride solution, and for ferric hydroxide arc given.

                                (Abstract.)
   All  the processes hitherto available for the estimation of carbon
dioxide in its biological relations are open to serious objections,
either on the score of the amount of time involved in their perform
ance, or of their inadaptability to the estimation of small quantities
of carbon dioxide when slowly evolved.
   The present communication describes an apparatus in which, as a
result of two years' work,      I have succeeded in combining a high
degree of chemical accuracy with special adaptability to biological
research.
   Thus by its aid the evolution of CO2, by a single germinating seed
or by a small area of a foliage leaf, can be accurately estimated from
hour to hour without a break, for any desired time, while for the same
area of leaf, the more active absorption of CO2 in assimilation can be
easily determined for such short periods of time as fifteen minutes,
and that at the same time separately for the two surfaces of one and
the same leaf area.    Further, for the purposes of this assimilation,
a current of air containing any desired proportion of CO2, however
small, can be supplied continuously to the tissue under investigation,

 1394.]         on Vegetable Assimilation and Respiration.              163
while,   if desired, estimations of the CO2 evolved in respiration by
some other part can be carried on simultaneously in a separate cur-
rent of air freed from CO2.       This is made possible by the apparatus
being practically in duplicate ; strictly comparative experiments can
thns be carried out.
    The actual estimation of the CO2 is accomplished by the well-
known method of absorption by baryta solution and titration with
hydrochloric acid.      Tbe novelty consists in this, that only a very
small quantity of baryta solution (under 15 c.c.) is employed in each
experiment, and that after the absorption the whole of this is titrated
with acid in the tube in which the absorption has taken place.
Farther, the burettes containing the standard solutions are always in
air-tight connection with this absorption chamber, and no air beyond
the current under investigation        is ever admitted to the chamber,
 except such as has been carefully        freed from CO2.      The special
 arrangements for stirring and emptying, by means of this air, freed
 from C02, and stored under pressure, cannot be entered into here.
    The two currents of air passing continuously through the apparatus
 are generated by two aspirators of a special type, which, worked on
 the principle of Mariotte's bottle, give a practically constant outflow
 in drops, whatever the level of the water within them, and are
 adapted to work steadily with small rates of flow (50 to 100 c.c.
 per hour).     These currents enter the apparatus, either through an
 arrangement for removing the CO2 when working on respiration,
 or when      working   on assimilation through one for adding CO .
 Both these are so constructed that the current never has to bubble
 through a layer of liquid, and so is supplied to the plant at strictly
 atmospheric pressure, thus avoiding any risk of drawing gases
 mechanically out of the part under investigation.         The remover of
            " tower
                    " full of beads, over which a stream of
 CO>  is a                                                   strong potash
flows continuously, and through which the air is drawn.            The COa
generator is constructed on a new principle, and consists of a tall
tube containing fragments of marble, through which the air current
passes at a constant rate, while very dilute HC1 trickles down it at an
extremely slow rate, which is made constant and independent of
external variations of temperature by special arrangements.          Thus a
constant amount of CO2 is being continually generated, and is carried
off by the air current.     The amount of CO2 formed can be controlled
by the strength of the acid employed.           When generating amounts
below 2 per cent. of the air current, this arrangement works very
constantly.      From the CO2 generator or remover, as the case may be,
the current of air passes to the receivers, in which the parts of the
 plant under investigation are situated.      These receivers are of various
 forms, according to the material experimented on, but are all con
 structed on the cardinal principle of making them as small as
                                                                  K 2

  possible consistent with the well-being of the part, in order that
  changes in the composition of the gas shall, as soon as possible, be
  felt by tbe current which passes thence through narrow tnhes to the
  absorption chambers. When titrations are being made, and the air cur
  rent can no longer be allowed to pass through the absorption chambers,
  it passes through a column of water equal in its resistance to that of
  the baryta solution in the absorption chamber. This enables the
  rate of flow to be kept constant between, as well as during, the actual
  experiments. Numerous other details, such as the special method of
 refilling the burettes, Ac, and above all thoso small points by which
  constancy is, as far as possible, attained, many of which have involved
 weeks of special experiment, cannot be described here.
     Simplification of technique by complication of apparatus has been
 the guiding principle, and the result is that, although the whole con
 sists of at least eight separate pieces of apparatus, many being
 further in duplicate, and all connected together by a plexus of tubes,
 yet the working is so automatically arranged that the operator,
 beyond reading the burettes and occasionally working a finger bellows,
 has nothing to do but turn stopcocks.
     If only one series of estimations is being made, these can be kept
 absolutely consecutive, the current being led through one of the
 absorption chambers, while the solution in the other one is beiner
 titrated and renewed, and so on alternately.          When two series of
 comparative estimations are being made         at, once, a small interval
 must be allowed after each double estimation, during which the
 titrations are performed ; the currents of air in connection with the
 plants then pass through bye-paths, still at their previous rate. This
 interval (in which a double titration, emptying and refilling of the
 absorption chambers, is accomplished) can be reduced to ten minutes.
     Delicacy of estimation sufficient for present work is obtained by
 the use of half-decinormal, N/20, standard solutions.       Phenolphtha-
 lein is used as indicator, and specially delicate end-reactions can be
 obtained, since atmospheric C04 is excluded, and moreover the
burettes containing both the solutions can be drawn upon.
     The burettes, narrow and graduated in 1/10 c.c, are read to
 1/100 c.c, with a simple arrangement for avoiding parallax.             All
other usual precautions are taken, and series of control        titrations,
with an error of observation of not more than 0T per cent., are often
obtained.      This corresponds to 1/200 c.c. CO,.
    In experiments of short duration, 1/50 c.c. COs is found to be suffi
cient for a trustwoi thy estimation from which definite conclusions may
be drawn.
    The communication immediately following the present one, illus
trates the applicability of this apparatus to the investigation of minute
quantities of carbon dioxide.

       Blackman, B.Sc, B.A., St. John's College, Demonstrator
       of Botany in the University of Cambridge. Communicated
       by Francis Darwin, F.R.S. Received November 15, 18114.
                                     (Abstract.)
    On the   question of the path by which carbonic acid passes out of
the leaf   in respiration and into it in assimilation, whether this takes
place by the stomatal openings or through the continuous surface of
 the cuticle, all possible extreme and intermediate views have been
 expressed in recent text-books of botany.          On account of the small-
 bess of the quantities of gas involved, practically no attempt has
 hitherto been made to determine this question by direct estimation.
 The existing experimental evidence is all of an indirect nature, and
 tends rather to support the view that the exchange is a cuticular
phenomenon.
    An ingenious     synthesis of Graham's observations on the compara
tive readiness with which             COa osmoses through thin films of
caoutchouc, with observations by Fremy and others on the similarity
between      cuticle and caoutchouc in chemical composition, first led
Barthelemy (1868) to put forward the view that the cuticle was
specially adapted for transmitting COa from the external air to the
assimilating cells beneath it.          This view he supported by experi
ments   on   the  artificial osmosis of gases through leaves.       About the
same    time Boussingault performed experiments that seemed to
definitely show that in assimilation, the COa taken up by the leaf
entered it through the upper surface, devoid of stomata, to which
the assimilating       cells are adjacent, rather than through the more
distant stomatal openings.           These experiments have hitherto been
generally accepted,      but  I shall  show later that the conclusions drawn
from them are entirely           fallacious.  In support of the view that
stomata form the paths of gaseous exchange, besides scattered induc
tions by various workers, we have the conclusion arrived at in 1888
by Man gin, from diffusion        experiments on isolated cuticle, that this
diffusion is insufficient to account for the whole gaseous exchauge of
the  leaf.
   By the aid of the apparatus described in a previous paper, the
aathor has been able successfully to attack the problem directly by
estimating the amounts of CO2 given out or taken in by the two
surfaces    of the same leaf, und-r the same conditions.        For this put

 pose, shallow capsules 10 sq. cm. in area, consisting of a glass plate
 with a metal rim, through which tubes for the circulation of the air
 current    pass, are employed.        Two of them are affixed to a leaf on
 opposite sides of the same area in air-tight union by means of soft
 wax. Then, in the way described previously, two continuous currents
 of air can be kept up over the two surfaces, and the COa produced
 or taken in, during a given time, by each of them be determined.
    Numerous experiments on the respiration of a variety of leaTes,
 thick and thin, with the stomata all on the one side or with stomata
 variously distributed on the two sides, agree in showing that the
stomata are the site of the exhalation of this gas. When no stomata
are present on the upper surface of a leaf, then practically no CO. is
exhaled from that surface, at least, not more than falls within the
working error of the apparatus under these conditions, while more
than thirty times as much may be given off from the lower stomati-
ferous surface. When stomata occur on both surfaces, the relative
amounts of COa exhaled closely follow the ratios of the numbers of
stomata.
    A   few examples in illustration      of this may be given.

    Column A gives the proportionate numbers of stomata on the two
surfaces ; B the amounts of COa exhaled by these ; C the ratios o(
these amounts.       Each experiment lasted about fifteen hours.
    Experiments    on    the absorption of COa during assimilation showed
the same close relation to the distribution of stomata. For these
experiments a constant fixed amount of COa must be introduced into
the air stream supplied to the leaf, which makes them much more
complicated.
    As hitherto carried out, direct sunshine, continuous for several
hours, has been essential for the success of these experiments. They
are, consequently, but few in number, though perfectly clear in their
interpretation.

1804.]         on Vegetable Assimilation and Respiration.                      167
   In an experiment       on the leaf of Arnpelopsis hederacea, with no
stomata on the upper surface, air containing l-6 per cent. CO2 was
supplied to both surfaces at the rate of 22 c.c. for every fifteen
minutes ; of the 0-37 c.c. of CO2 thus entering the capsule on the
lower surface in this time, 0-14 c.c. was absorbed, while none at all
was absorbed by the upper surface.               With a leaf of Alisma, on the
contrary, the whole of the COa       — 0-15 c.c. — supplied in fifteen minutes
to the upper surface was absorbed, and 0"ll c.c. of that supplied to the
lower. In this leaf the stomata are in the ratio of 135 above to 100
below, to which ratio the absorption numbers closely correspond.                 A
very simple experiment       will show   that    stomata  are  practically the sole
path of entry of CO2 for assimilation.            If part of the lower stomatio
surface of any leaf with no stomata on its upper surface (Sparrmannia
gives very clear results) be coated with wax so as to mechanically
block the stomata, no starch can be formed in that area, while the
 adjacent  areas become     rich in starch.    I performed     this experiment in
 1893, and showed    it to  some botanists     ;  recently  it has been published
 by  Stahl*
                                                                             "
    As stated previously, the theory of " cuticular exchange                    has
 hitherto found its strongest support in the experiments of Bonssin-
 gault, in which, under similar conditions, leaves of Nerium Oleander
 assimilated less when        the  upper astomatiferous surface had been
 coated with an unguent than when the lower stomatiferous surface
 bad been so coated.      From this he drew the obvious conclusion that
 the C02 of assimilation normally passes into the leaf through the
 cuticle of the upper surface.          Exposure of the interesting experi
 mental fallacy here concealed, however, quite reverses the interpre
 tation of these  experiments.       Boussingault experimented with leaves
 in an atmosphere containing 30 per cent. CO2.                 Now the optimum
 percentage   of  COa  for   assimilation   is   very low  for  this leaf, and the
 real interpretation of the result is that the diminished decomposition
 of C02 in the leaf with open stomata is due to its obtaining not less
 CO> but more CO2.      In fact, there penetrates into it so much CO2that
 its assimilatory activity is lessened, and falls below that of the other
 leaf  into which, owing to the blocking of the stomata, the CO2 only
 diffuses very slowly, and cannot exceed the optimal strength.                 This
 view has been conclusively         proved by a series of experiments in
 different strengths     of   CO2. In a small percentage the leaf with its
 stomata open decomposes          more CO2 than the leaf with its stomata
 blocked  — a result just the reverse of Boussingault's.
    Further evidence on the possible paths of gaseous exchange has
  been obtained by investigating       the degree to which diffusion of CO2
  can be artificially produced through the living leaf.           Strong mixtures
  of C02 are led continuously across one surface of a leaf, and the

168                               Presents.                      [Dec.  6,
a mount which diffuses through is estimated. On supplying 31 per
cent. COa to the lower surface of a leaf of Nerium only 0 035 per
cent, appears by diffusion in a slow current of air kept continually
passing over the upper surface of the leaf.
   Other experiments on the respiration of injected leaves alsoscpport
the view that the stomatal openings, in spite of their minuteness,
offer a very much easier path from the atmosphere to the interior of
the leaf than does the cuticle.
   Conclusions. — 1. Under normal conditions practically the sole path
 way for COa into or out of the leaf is by the stomata.    Since oxygen
diffuses more readily than COa through fine openings, the same prob
ably holds for oxygon and the whole of the gas exchange.
   2. Under abnormal conditions, when the stomata or intercellular
spaces are blocked and the surrounding tension of C02 is great
enough, passage of COa by osmosis through the cuticle may take
place.
   3. That such closure of stomata as is held to take place in darkness
does not prevent the distribution of gas exchange closely agreeing
with that of the stomata.
   4. That the exhalation of C02 in bright light by a leafy shoot in
Garreau's well-known experiment is not the expression of any phy
siological truth for the leaf, but only due to the imperfections of the
conditions ; to the presence of immature parts, or of tissues not suffi
ciently green or not fully illuminated.     Mature isolated green leaves
fully illuminated assimilate the whole of their respiratory COj and
allow none to escape from them.

 I.   "On the Photographic Spectrum                     of 7-Cassiopeise."    By
        J. NORMAN Lockyer, C.B., F.R.S.                Received November
        1894.
                                   Introductory.
     In the Bakerian Lecture for 1888*          I  referred in some detail to the
 spectrum of 7-CassiopeitB, and suggested explanations of the origins
 of the various lines which had been observed. At that time no photo
 graphs of the spectrum were available for discussion, but the ques
 tions raised by the eye observations were of such great interest that
 I determined to attempt a photographic study of the spectrum.
This was commenced in November, 1888, and has been continued at
intervals up to the present time.
    In view of the somewhat conflicting evidence of the variability of
the spectrum,      it was considered uecessary that the photographs
should extend over a considerable period beforo any serious attempt
was made to discuss them.           Some of the results obtained, however,
now appear to be so definite that I have thought it desirable to com
municate them to the Society at once.               I therefore give particulars
of the inquiry so far as it has yet gone, and a brief account of other
observations is added, in order that the significance of the photo
graphic results may be the better realised.
    In the paper referred to I gave an historical statement including
the early observations ; it is only necessary to add to this that the
spectrum has been since observed               or photographed by Professor
E. C.   Pickering, Professor Keeler, and Dr. Belopolsky.
    Professor Pickering makes no mention of dark lines, or of bright
lines other than F.f
    Professor Keeler, observing with the Lick refractor in 1889J failed

narrow, and sharp. H7 in the violet           seen with some difficulty.
The green       full of very fine delicate dark lines, seen only under
               is
pood atmospheric conditions, the         group being somewhat more
                                                  b
prominent than the others.       There     also an appearance of faint
                                                      is
bright lines, or perhaps spaces between the fine dark lines just men
tioned, seeming bright by contrast. It        difficult to decide on this
                                                           is

to  C than to the estimated position of D        a fairly prominent dark
                                                                is
band, or, more probably, group of fine lines. Not the slightest trace
of bright or dark lines can be seen in the vicinity of D. The con
tinuous spectrum close to the bright hydrogen lines appears some
what darker than       does elsewhere, but this
                        it                          have considered to be
                                                                  I
the effect of contrast."
   Professor Keelor has since succeeded in photographing dark lines
in the spectrum.*
   Belopolsky states that D3 did not appear in three photographs                                  of
the spectrum taken by him in 1892.             t
   It may also be stated that the spectrum of this star has been
occasionally shown to students at Kensington since 1886, and the
bright lines    and
                  C    have always been visible.
                             F                        Four dates are
recorded in the note-books, namely, September 18, October 13 and
October 24, 1889, and October 21, i894.   The presence of bright D*
as well as of and C       F,
                     was noted on all these dates, except October 24,
1889.
    Dr. Copeland has been good enough to communicate to we                                       an
unpublished observation made at Dunecht on September 13, 1885.
C  was then very bright,       just measurable, while Ds could not be
                                  F
made out with certainty.         This observation was made with the
15-in. refractor.
   It appears, therefore, that D3, and possibly also the bright lines                             of
hydrogen, may be of variable intensity, but      does not seem possible
                                                                  it

   The first photograph obtained at Kensington was taken on Novem
ber 20, 1888, and since then fifty-three photographs have been
secured.    The instruments employed were those described        my                         in

                        Results of     the  Preliminary Discussion.
   (1)    All    the photographs         taken at Kensington show bright               lines   of
hydrogen.
   The lines        H/9, H/y, and       BS are constantly seen, and He and Hf
appear when the photographic conditions have been good.                                    This
suggests that their apparent absence, noted by some observers in the
period 1874 to 1883, was possibly                    due to imperfect          conditions      of

lines  in  the spectrum.
   The additional         bright lines appear in all good negatives                  ; in cases
of under     or over exposure, or when other conditions have affected the
quality of the negative, they are not distinctly seen.

     The wave-lengths of some of these lines may also require correction
 for displacement due to motion in the line of sight, when the condi
 tions have been more fully investigated.              Attention may be specially
 directed to two lines at 4384 and 4465 ; in the spectrum of y3-Lyrse
 there are two bright lines with the normal positions 4388 and 4471,
 agreeing in position with prominent lines in the spectra of stars of
 Group HI7,* and it seems possible that we have to deal with the
 same lines in ^-Cassiopeiee.         This is rendered more probable by the
 fact, which will appear later, that the two lines in question appear as
 bright fringes on the more refrangible sides of dark lines, having the
 wave-lengths 4388 and 4471.
    (3) During the period covered by the photographs there is no evidence
 of any change in the intensities of the principal bright lines.
    (4) The bright lines of hydrogen are double in all the photographs
 taken icith sufficient dispersion.
    The series of twenty-six photographs, showing the duplicity of the
 hydrogen lines, was taken with the Ci-in. prism of 45°, and extends
from May 18, 1892, to November 16, 1894.
    H7 and He usually show the doubling best, but in some of the
 photographs         is also clearly seen to be double.          The doubling is
not so clearly seen at He, probably owing to the presence of other
lines near the same wave-length.              The double lines are somewhat
diffused at both edges.
    (5) There is no evidence of orbital movement during the period which
has elapsed since May, 1892.
    Careful measurements of the distance between the two bright lines
at H7 and US have been made by Mr. D. Baxandall, and it was
found that the distances are constant, within the limits of accuracy
in measurement.
    (6) Assuming the presence of two sources of bright hydrogen lines, the
relative velocity in the Hue of sight is about 115 miles per second.
   This velocity has been deduced from measures of the separation of
the lines at H7 and He in the photographs taken with the 6-in. prism
of 45°.
   (7) The bright lines of hydrogen are superposed cm broad dark
bands.
   This was noted in the earliest photographs, and is fnlly con
firmed by those subsequently obtained.                 H/i, H7, and H£ exhibit
this feature prominently, but the same is occasionally seen at He and
H£.    It has also been noted that C presented the same characteristic
when observed by Messrs. Fowler and Shackleton on October 21,
18i>4.   The borders of these dark bands are all ill-defined, but they
appear to be symmetrically placed with regard to the bright lines.
The dark bands are from 10 to 12 tenth-metres broad.

   (8) Besides the dark bands in the positions of the hydrogen lines, there
are other ill-defined dark lines.
   The additional         dark lines are seen in all good negatives, whether
taken with high or low ciisperfion, but their haziness makes their
positions difficult to determine with accuracy.                      The approximate
wave-lengths of the principal dark lines are 3887, 3968, 3994, 4008,
4025,    4069,     4101,    4119,   4143,     4168, 4340, 4388,      4471,   4643, 4860.
This at once contradicts Professor              Scheiner's recent statement* that
he
     " does not believe it           possible that dark lines can exist in the
spectrum."
   (9) The dark lines          in  the   spectrum of '/-Cassiopeia! correspond very
closely with the lines seen in the spectra of              and 7- Ononis.

similarity is shown by the accompanying enlargements.                        The resem

   A bar is subjected to a gradually increasing tension, and the
extensions for a series of loads are measured.             If the loads are
plotted as ordinates and the extensions as abscissae, a load-strain
curve is obtained. In the case of many materials the load-strain
curve is fairly continuous (figs. 1 and 2). But with certain qualities
of iron and steel there is a remarkable irregularity in the curve
(fig. 3). Up to the elastic limit a the strain is proportional to the
stress, and Oa is a straight line.        Beyond a the strains increase
faster than the stresses.   At some point, b, termed the yield point. a
very large   and abrupt permanent elongation is produced.             The bar
continues to elongate for some time without increase of load, or even
apparently with some decrease of load.              At some point, c, the
material is so hardened that further deformation can only be pro
duced by increase of load, and a continuous load-strain curve, cdf, is
obtained.
   In some tests of very long iron and steel bars, by a Committee of
the Institution of Civil Engineers,* the extensions for equal incre
ments of load were carefully measured, and load-strain diagrams were
plotted.     These diagrams showed for the first time the abrupt

name   yielding point.  It appeared from their experiments that there
was a  yield point also in compression, though hardly so well marked
as in tension.   Since these experiments, autographic apparatus has
been used for describing     the load-strain curve during a test. The
unronraphic load-strain curres exhibit the yield point in the case of
certain materials in a very striking way.

   If at some point, d, the load is removed and again imposed, then in
the reloading a curve, edf, is obtained without any marked yield
 point.   The material is physically a different material, when it has
 been strained beyond the yield point.      The new curve is similar to
the curves figs. 1 and 2, and unlike the primitive curve Oabcd, fig. 3,
for the material.    In the case of a steel which will slightly harden if
 heated and suddenly cooled, the load-strain curve is Oacdf,      if it is
tested unhardened, and very similar to edf if it is hardened before
testing.
   Pig. 4 shows load-strain curves for two pieces of the sam¦ steel
 unhardened and tempered by heating and sudden cooling.
   As the yield point only occurs in materials which have been rolled
or hammered in a plastic state, it has been supposed to be due to
some purely mechanical condition of constraint produced by pressure,
which could be broken down if the stress reached the yield point.
But any purely mechanical condilion of constraint, such as is pro
duced by cold hammering, is entirely removed by annealing.        On the
other hand, annealing the bar before testing does not alter the yield
point.   If anything, it makes it more distinctly marked. Further, if
the bar is strained to the point d and the load removed, or if it is
hardened by sudden cooling, and the bar then annealed and again

 t¦st¦d, it is found      to have returned       to a condition      almost identical
with that which it        had at first. In testing again, a new yield point
appears, and the new load curve is such a curve as egh.
     Osmond appears first to have suggested that in the ease of iron or
steel any stress which produces a permanent deformation is attended
by a rearrangement of the atoms withm the molecules of the metal,
such as marks the passage of the iron from one state into another
allotropic state.* The following experiments on alternate straining
and annealing, in which straining appears always to produce effects
like those which occur in hardening steel, and which, like them, are
completely destroyed by annealing, would be most easily understood,
if  Osmond's view were accepted.
    In the following experiments a bar was alternately tested to a
stress somewhat beyond the yield point and then annealed. The
ann¦aling oven, shown in section in fig. 5, was an iron chamber with
                                         Fig. 5.

burners, the products of combustion passing round the annealing
box. When the bar to be annealed was red-hot it was turned end
for end, and shortly after the gas was extinguished, and the chamber
allowed to cool down slowly with the bar in it. Every time the bar
was strained beyond the yield point, its diameter sensibly decreased
from lateral contraction.    Some further diminution of section was
due to oxidation in the annealing oven.     After each annealing the

  In this experiment      a bar of the same steel as in the previous test
was    broken in the first loading without any annealing, in order that
its autograph diagram might be compared with that of a bar broken
after eight annealings.        The diagram is drawn dotted in fig. 8.
There is no marked difference in the two diagrams, if the decrease of
area due to successive tests and annealings is allowed for.
    It is clear from these tests that the change produced in the iron or
steel bar by straining beyond the yield point is completely reversed
by simple annealing, and this apparently after any number of repeti
tions of the process.      It appears hardly possible to understand either
the singular abruptness of the load strain curve at the yield point, or
the difference of the load strain curves for an unstrained and a
strained bar, or the reversal of the change of properties produced
daring straining by simple annealing, except by supposing that at
the yield point there occurs a chemical or molecular or allotropic
change of the same kind as that which occurs in ordinary tempering
 by sudden cooling.
    If mere stress can produce a change of this kind, it may be that
 the stresses     produced in sudden cooling also are factors in the
changes which occur in that case.       If a red-hot bar is plunged into
 water the surface must cool first.     A condition of stress must arise
 in which there is a ring tension and radial thrust in the section of
 the bar.     It is well known that the stresses so set up are often of
 great intensity.     Bars tear or crack in hardening.        The material
 may be strained beyond its yield point by the stresses due to cooling.
 When bars are subjected to a Wohler test, that            is,
                                                         to a large number
of   repetitions of straining action, they break ultimately with a stress
 much less than that which would break them in a simple loading and
 with a very characteristic fracture.      The outside of the fracture    is
 fine grained, and resembles a crack extending gradually across the
 section of fracture.     However ductile the material, initially, there  is
 no sign of contraction at the fracture.     The bar breaks like brittle
                                                                   a
 material.      It seems possible that here also the repetition of the
  straining action may produce a molecular change in the bar in the
  neighbourhood of the fracture.

III.    "Preliminary Note on Embryonic Fission in Lichenopora."
       By Sidney F. Harmer, M.A., Fellow of King's College.
        Cambridge, Superintendent of the University Museum of
        Zoology. Communicated by A. Sedgwick, F.R.S. Received
       November 3, 1894.
   I have    shown on a previous occasion* that the primary embryo of
Crisia gives rise to numerous larvae by a constantly repeated process
of embryonic fission, and I have suggested the probability that this
method of development will be found to bs characteristic of Cyclo-
stomatous Polyzoa in general. Observations recently made on Licheno
pora verrucaria, Fabr., obtained on the coast of Norway ,f have enabled
mo to prove the occurrence of embryonic fission in a second genus of
Cyclostomata, although the details of the development are remark
ably different from those of Crista.
   The colonies of Lichenopora verrucaria occur in great numbers on
fronds of Laminaria saccharina, growing just beneath low-watermark.
The colony is regularly plano-convex, with a diameter, in the full-
grown condition, of about 5 mm. ; and it is attached by its flat sur
face to the sea-weed.         Embryonic development commences with the
beginning      of   the  formation      of the colony, and the earliest stages
can only be followed by examining the initial stages of the colony
itself.
    The growth of the young colony closely resembles that of Tubu-
lipora flabellaris, Fabr., as described by Barrois.J               The colony origi
nates    from   a circular disc, which, as Barrois has          shown,   results from
the calcification of the outer part of the body-wall of the larva after
its fixation.     This disc is continued into the primary zocecium, which
buds off simultaneously, on its side turned towards the sea-weed,
two new zocooia, more or less parallel with itself.                 The first brood of
embryos is normally developed from the egg formed in one of these
two zoiecia, although the egg is in some colonies formed in a younger
zocecium.
    The colony continues to grow in the form of a compressed funnel,
which at first lies on one of its flattened sides.              By further growth,
 the mouth of the funnel soon curves ronnd so as to look directly
 away from the sea-weed, its rim meanwhile extending in a plane
 parallel to the surface of attachment, so as to overlap and finally
cover the disc from which the colony originated. The adult colony may

be  compared    with a funnel with a basal angle of nearly 180°, passing
off into  a short stalk, which is curved round so as to lie between the
base of the funnel and its attachment.
   The funnel is composed of a multitude of closely packed pyramidal
tubes, whose wider ends opeu at the surface in the manner of the
cells of a honey-comb. These are continuously formed at the margin
of the colony, where fresh tubes are constantly cut off, simultaneously
with the extension of the margin, by the upgrowth of calcareous septa.
The body-cavity is here closed in on the upper side by an uncalcified
body-wall.    The new septa are developed at the growing edge in such
a way that two kinds of tubes are formed.           These give rise respec
tively to the zocecia and to the ovicell.         The zocecia all reach the
base of the colony, where they are in close contact with one another.
In growing upwards they diverge, so that a set of pyramidal spaces,
narrow below and widening above, originate between them.               These
spaces,  from   which  the  ovicell  is developed,  acquire  complete  calca
reous walls, their roof remaining at first membranous.            Each con
tains a part of the body-cavity, cut off from the growing edge of the
colony, and the spaces may accordingly be compared with zocecia, in
which, however, no polypide-buds are formed.
   The membranous roof of these interzocecial spaces becomes calci
fied, thus forming a
                          " crust " which extends horizontally between
adjacent zocecia.     The side walls of the spaces then break down, and
a large    continuous cavity thus results.      This cavity, the ovicell, lies
superficial to the bases of the zocecia, some of which pass through it
as free columns which project beyond its roof.             The ovicell later
 acquires one or more trumpet-shaped openings to the exterior.
    The mature ovicell contains several hundred larviB in varions
 stages of development.       These, constituting the first brood, have all
 been derived from the primary embryo which normally develops in
one of the two zocecia first formed from the primary zocecium.
    The beginning of the developmental processes was found in a
 colony consisting of three zocecia only.        Each of these contained a
"                "
   brown body and a mature polypide. The polypide of the primary
 zocecium, like that of one of the two secondary zocecia, possessed a
 testis, attached to the lower end of its alimentary canal. That of
 the remaining zocecium had an egg in the corresponding position.
    A precisely similar egg was found, in one or two young colonies, in
a polypide-bud, where, from its position, it had probably been de
 veloped from the outer (mesodermic) layer of the bud.          Eggs are not
 necessarily confined to a single polypide in the colony, but in a con
dition in which they can be recognised as eggs, they do not appear to
be developed in most cases except in the polypide destined to give
rise to a primary embryo.           The testis, on the contrary, may be re
 garded as a normal possession of every polypide.            It usually gives

  been observed, although a testis may be developed                     by a polypide
  which carries an egg, and although free, ripe spermatozoa have been
  noticed in the immediate neighbourhood of young primary embryos.
      The primary embryo in its older stages is always in the immediate
  neighbourhood of a "brown body," a structure which was found,
  with rare exceptions, in the younger stages as well. Unless it should

  hereafter appear that a "brown body may be formed by the degene
  ration of a part of a polypide, the presence of this structure in a
  zooecium containing an egg or a very young embryo clearly indicates
  that the egg itself belongs to the second polypide which tenants the
  zooecium.
      Every colony normally gives rise to an ovicell, although cases are
  not uncommon in which degeneration sets in at an earlier or later
  period, resulting in the atrophy of the embryonic tissues or in their
  failure to develop further.
      Development of the colony and of the egg go on pari passu.                    The
 details of the segmentation of the egg are even more difficult to observe
 than in Crista; but stages were found in which the number of embryonic
 nuclei progressively increases.           By the time that the embryo comes
 to consist of four or five cells, it is surrounded by other cells which
 form the commencement of a follicle.                  This structure is at first
 composed of loosely-arranged            cells, hardly distinguishable from the
 " funicular tissue " which occurs in the body-cavity generally.                    The
 follicle becomes more compact, and finally assumes a form which has
 a striking similarity to a stage described by Kraepelin* in the early
 development of Plumaiella.             In this condition the embryo consists of
a small spherical mass of protoplasm, including a few nuclei.                     It is
supported by       a  structure      resembling    the  suspensor    which    supports
the embryo in flowering plants.              This suspensor contains a very fine
 lumen, and a section which passes longitudinally through its axis
accordingly shows two rows of nuclei, one row belonging to each of
 the walls on opposite sides of the lumen.                The suspensor and the
embryo are surrounded by              a  common investment of cells ; and the
 whole arrangement         is   attached  either to the testis of the polypide or
to the lower end of the alimentary canal when no testis is present.
The embryo, with its investment, hangs down freely into the body-
                                                                      " brown          "

to which allusion has already been made.

part   which   I have      termed the suspensor corresponding with the inner
layer of the hud, and the outer investment with its outer layer.
Although this interpretation would make the agreement between
Lichenopora and the Phylactolaemata closer than would otherwise he
the case,   I  have not succeeded in showing that the arrangement has
really the morphological value of a polypide-bud.
    The polypide now begins to pass into the condition of a new
"brown body," with which the old "brown body" fuses.                                    The
embryo,     with    its  investments,    hangs   down    into    the  zocecium from the
wall of the " brown body," which has meanwhile moved up the
zocecium to the neighbourhood of the orifice.                       In this position it
remains during the later stages, becoming much complicated by the
processes    which succeed.
    The suspensor ceases to be sharply defined as such, its cells merging
               which surround the " brown body and the embryo. The

increase in the number of its nuclei, begins to undergo fission.                        But
 whilst in Crista the primary embryo remains throughout in the con
dition of a coherent mass of cells, which buds off successive embryos
into the ovicell, that of Lichenopora early divides up into a consider
able number of irregular pieces, which ultimately give rise to the
secondary embryo.             In the earlier stages of the process it is easy to
show that the pieces are continuous with one another, or that, from
their position and structure, they have recently been separated from
one another.          In older ovicells it may be difficult to demonstrate the
existence of the process of fission, since the number of embryos is
 increased, to a considerable extent at least, by the binary division of
 small masses of cells which have all the appearance                           of young
embryos.       The     details  of the  fission are,  in fact.    more   similar  to those
which occur in the fission of the
                                              "

 [Doliolurn* &c.) than          to those   which  occur    in   Crisia.
   After the first brood of larvae are hatched the colony may develop
new primary embryos at several points in the ovicell.                        These form
the starting points         for  the  development       of  a   fresh   brood   of larvre.
Thus, early stages in the embryonic development may be found, not
only in the youngest colonies, but also in the largest, fully-formed
colonies. These latter differ from the young colonies in containing
the set of cavities constituting the original ovicell.                      The primary
embryos of the second               generation may readily be recognised in
                                                     " brown
sections by means of the characteristic                           body," to which the
follicle containing the embryo is attached. Their earliest stages have
not so far been traced ; but the later stages, in which fission is com
mencing, are, in all important points, identical with those of the
first  generation.

     After the commencement of fission the follicle may contain numerous
  egg-like cells, which are probably identical with the giant cells which
  I have previously described in the ovicell of Crista. Although it is
  not impossible that these cells may plav some part in the formation
  of the secondary embryos, this is rendered improbable, not only by
  the analogy of Crista, but still more by the fact that the early stages
  in the development of the primary embryo take place before such
  cells can be recognised in the ovicell.
     The following results may be deduced from the preceding state
 ments    : —
     1. The ovicell is not altogether external to the zocecia, as might be
  inferred from some of the older- descriptions of this structure. Its
 cavity is morphologically identical with the body-cavity of the
  zocecia, and the ovicell results from the breaking down of numerous
 septa which at first separate from one another a set of tubes formed
 at the growing edge of the colony in the same manner as tie
 ordinary zocecia.
     2. The development of the ovicell and that of the embryo normally
 commence at almost the beginning of the life of the colony.              So long
 as the growth of the first brood of larvse continues there is no develop
 ment of new primary embryos; and the numerous young larva1
 found in the ovicell are descendants of the single primary embryo
 which is normally produced in one of the two zocecia first budded off
 from the primary zocecium.
    3. The process cannot well be interpreted as a form of alternation
 of generations.      A large number, perhaps the great majority, of the
 secondary embryos are formed by the direct fission of pre-existing
 embryos, and are not budded off from a compact mass of cells as in
 Crista.
     4. Certain   remarkable analogies may be detected between the
 development     of  the Cyclostomata and that of the Phylactobaemuta.
 Further research will be necessary in order to show whether these
 resemblances are more than mere analogies.

    The effect of position of the body upon the circulation of the blood
is a matter of daily observation with the physician and surgeon, but

it   has been, curiously  neglected by physiologists.     So far as my
researches into the history of the subject go, the mere fact that the
feet-down position lowers arterial pressure, and that the feet-up posi
                      almost all that has been determined.
                   it,
tion heightens     is
   In 1885, Hermann placed the subject in the hands of two pupils,
Blamberg and Wagner, with the object of investigating the dynamic
and hydrostatic effects of gravity on the circulation.
   The hydrostatic moment        the altered relationship of level between
                                     is
the given spot on the artery (where the manometer         placed) and the
                                                               is
rest of the vascular system.
   The dynamic moment         the altered relation between pressure and
                                is
resistance produced indirectly by the change of position on the heart
beat, the filling of the heart, the vaso-motor nerves, &c.
   Hermann instructed his pupils to find the indifferent point of the
circulatory system, in order that the hydrostatic effect might be
eliminated and the dynamic effect alone studied.
   Blamberg and Wagner determined the indifferent point by filling
the circulatory system of the dead animal with salt solntion and
then by shifting the position of the axis round which the body was
turned.
I     have found that on attempting, according to Wagner's method, to
fill the circulatory system of the dead animal with salt solution, the
arterial part of the system does not remain filled, for the salt solution
rapidly leaks into the splanchnic venous area. By alternately          placing
the animal with feet down or with feet up, a pumping action        pro is
duced which gradually forces the salt solution out of the arterial
system into the venous side, where     remains. The indifferent point
                                              it
caDnot, therefore, be found on the dead body.      Further,       were
                                                                      if
                                                                      it
possible to find the indifferent point  on the dead  body,  the  indif
ferent point on the living body could not be deduced therefrom,
because such indifferent point depends on the coefficient of elasticity
which   must constantly alter in the living animal with every altera
tion of the arterioles by vaso-constriction or dilatation.
   As regards the dynamic effect of gravity on the circulation, there
fore, the work of Blumberg and Wagner cannot be accepted.
   My attention was first drawn to the influence of gravity upon the
circulation by observations which        made upon the normal intra
                                          I
cranial tension in a patient of Dr. Claze-Shaw.         This patient had
been trephined, and Dr. Shaw asked me                 could estimate his
                                                        if

method for investigating      intra-cranial pressure described by me in

nndulations.
   Experimenting       on dogs,   I  found that exactly the same thing
occurred. The normal cerebral pressure became markedly negative
in the feet-down posture, and positive in the feet-up posture.
   For the further investigation of the subject,          I constructed an
animal holder which could be swung round a horizontal axis. In
this axisthe cannula connected with the vessel under observation was
always placed, and the cannula itself was connected with a fixed
hydrostatic manometer.
   The " hydrostatic and dynamic moments," to use Hermann's ex
pression, were investigated and separated, not by attempting to find
the indifferent point, but by carefully observing the effects of dividing
and stimulating the vagus and splanchnic nerves and spinal cord, and
by watching the influence of anaesthetics, curare, and asphyxia.
   The research has been carried out upon rabbits, cats, dogs, and
monkeys, and the same general results have been obtained from all.
The animals were anaesthetised in all the experiments, and were placed
upon a board with the limbs fully extended in the same direction as
the longitudinal axis of the body.
   The experiments group themselves under the following headings :
                        A. Effects on the Circulation.

in the torcula Herophili by the method described by me in the
before-quoted     paper.
   The respiratory tracings were taken by means of a broad band of
strapping passed round the thorax and connected to either side of a
Paul Bert tambour.        The changes of position prevented the use of
any   more   accurate  method   for recording the respiration.
   The results of the research are shown in a series of tracings, from
which the following conclusions are drawn :—
   1.  That the force of gravity must be regarded as. a cardinal factor
          in dealing with the circulation of the blood.
   2. That the important duty of compensating for the simple hydro
          static effects of gravity in changes of position must be ascribed
          to the splanchnic vaso-motor mechanism.
   3.  That the effects of changing the position afford a most delicate
          test of the condition of the vaso-motor mechanism.
   4.  That the amount of compensation depends largely on individual
          differences.
   5.  That the compensation is far more complete in upright animals
          such as the monkey, than in rabbits, cats, or dogs, and, there-
,         fore, is probably far more complete in man.
   6.  That in some normal monkeys over-compensation for the hydro
          static effect occurs.
   7.  That in the normal monkey and man gravity exerts but little
          disturbing influence, owing to the perfection of the compen
          satory mechanism.
   8.  That when the power of compensation is damaged by paralysis
          of the splanchnic vaso-constrictors, induced by severe operative
          procedures or by injuries to the spinal cord, by asphyxia, or
          by some poison such as chloroform or curare, then the influence
          of gravity becomes of vital importance.
   9. That the feet-down position is of far greater moment than the
          feet-up position, because when the power of compensation is
           destroyed the blood drains into the abdominal veins, the heart
          empties, and the cerebral circulation ceases.
   10. That, generally speaking, the feet-up position occasions no ill
          consequence.
   11.  That the horizontal      and feet-up positions at once abolish the
          syncope induced by the feet-down position by causing the
          force of gravity to act in the same sense as the heart, and
          thus the cerebral circulation is renewed.
   12.  That firmly bandaging the abdomen has the same effect.
          While the heart remains normal, and so long as the mechan-
        ¦
          ical pressure is applied to the abdominal veins, the blood
           pressure cannot possibly fall.

   13.  That if the heart is affected,   as by chloroform or curare poison
           ing, the restoration of pressure is incomplete, and it is possible
           that the heart may be stopped altogether by the iurush of ;i
           largo quantity of blood, caused by too rapid an application of
           pressure on the abdomen. More work would be thrown upon
           the heart than, in its impoverished          condition, it could
           perform.
   14. That vagus inhibition and cardiac acceleration are subsidiary
           compensatory mechanisms in the feet-up and feet-down
           positions respectively.
   15. That chloroform rapidly paralyses the compensatory vaso
           motor mechanism, and damages the heart.
  16.  That ether, on the other hand, only paralyses the compensatory
          vaso-motor mechanism very slowly and when given iu
           enormous amounts.
  17.  That the vaso-motor paralysis induced by these anaesthetics
          lasts for some considerable time after the removal of the
          antesthetics.
  18.  That chloroform can, by destroying the compensation for
          gravity, kill the animal, if it be placed with the abdomen on
          a lower level than the heart.
  19.  That elevation or compression of the abdomen immediately com
          pensates for the vaso-motor paralysis produced by chloroform.
  20.  That compression or elevation of the abdomen, coupled with
          artificial respiration and with squeezing of the heart through
           the thoracic walls, is the best means of restoring an animal
          from the condition of chloroform collapse.            That these
           results agree entirely with McWilliams', and are opposed to
          those of the Hyderabad Commission.
  21.  That the feet-down position inhibits respiration, and the feet-up
          position accelerates it.
  22.  That these respiratory results probably depend upon the stimu
          lation of sensory nerve endings by changes of tension brought
         about by the alterations of position, because the results are
         abolished by dividing the vagi.
  23.  That in the feet-down position the respiration is thoracic in
         type, and the abdomen is retracted ; in the feet-up position the
         respiration is diaphragmatic and the abdomen freely expanded.
 24.   That these types of respiration tend to compensate for the
         effects of gravity on the circulation, for the retraction of the
          abdomen in the feet-down position mechanically supports the
         abdominal veins, whilst the thoracic inspirations aspirate
         blood into the heart. In the feet-up position the full and
         free expansion of the abdomen withdraws all obstacles to the
         compensatory dilatation of the abdominal veins.

   In the last part of the paper the medical aspects of this research
are  discussed. It is suggested that emotional syncope is due to
paralysis of the splanchnic area, and a case is quoted where com
pression of the abdomen immediately removed the syncopal condition.
The same treatment, or that of elevation of the abdomen, is sug
gested for conditions of shock, chloroform collapse, and after severe
haemorrhage.
   Finally, a parallel is drawn between some of the results of this
research in reference to monkeys and those obtained by Dr. George
Oliver on man, by measuring the diameter of the radial artery with
his ingenious instrument, the arteriometer.
   The  Chairman announced that a paper on a newly-discovered gas
having been promised by Lord Rayleigh and Professor Ramsay, this
paper would on January 31 be taken as a subject for discussion under
a Resolution of Council passed last session,         whereby in each year
certain Ordinary Meetings were to be " devoted each to the hearing
and   consideration of some one important         communication, or to the
discussion   of some important topic."

I. The Widening       of Iron Lines and of Unknown Lines in relation            to the
                                    Sun-spot Period.
    It is now twenty-eight        years since    I  discovered that the lines seen
in sun-spots     were subject to widening,* and that different lines were
widened at different times.
    It was not, however, till 1879 that I was enabled to commence
daily routine work of such a nature that all observations were com
parable inter se.      This desideratum was secured by limiting attention
to the twelve lines most widened between F and D.
    In l886f I gave an account of some of the early results obtained by
this research.      I have recently commenced the oomplete discussion
of the whole series of observations to the present year.
    This discussion, involving 21,000 lines widened during the period
in question, has necessitated three special researches : the first, deal
ing with the lines with which, contemporaneously, coincidences have
been found in the laboratory ; the second, dealing with those the
origin of which is so far unknown ; and the third, with the distribu
tion of both Rets of lines in spots in relation to the sun-spot period.
     To make the work as definite as possible, I am, iu the first instance,
 confining the inquiry concerning the known lines to lines of iron
 based upon the examination of the pure electrolytic iron referred to
 in a previous communication.          J
     The following statistics will show the relation of these iron lines
 to the Fraunhofer lines in the region F — D over which the spot work

many lines as appear in the solar spectrum. The wave-length map

   In the present communication          I  confine myself to submitting pro
visional curves based upon a preliminary inquiry into the number of
times the lines of both categories have been observed to be widened
in spots.        Some slight corrections will, doubtless, be ultimately
required when some uncertainties connected with some of the earlier
observations, made before Rowland's maps were available, have been
cleared up. The highest points of the curves represent the maximum
frequency of iron lines in one case and of unknown lines in the other.
   The period embraced by the observations practically enables us to
study what has taken place at two successive sun-spot minima and
two maxima. It will be- seen that the phenomena which followed the
minimum of 1879 have been exactly reproduced after the minimum
of 1890.      At the minima the iron lines are prominent among the
most widened lines ; at the maxima we only find lines about which
nothing is known.       Since the discussion indicates that the iron lines
involved, which ultimately disappear, are almost invariably those
seen most prominent in the spark, the view put forward in my paper
of 1886 that the change observed is due to the dissociation of iron in
the spots as a sun-spot maximum is approached, is corroborated, and,
so far,   I have heard of no other simple and sufficient explanation.
   It will be noted that the maxima and minima of solar temperature
ti ns revealed to us, if my hypothesis be confirmed, lag behind the
    ot maxima and minima.            This may explain the lag observed in

as treasurer, in 1874.    On the present occasion     I propose to treat
the subject as briefly as possible with due regard to clearness.
                 No.  1.  Thk Scienti0ic Relief Fund.
   This most excellent and valuable institution originated in the year
1859, in a proposition of Mr. J. P. Gassiot that a fund of this kind
should be founded for the aid of such scientific men, or their families,
as may from time to time require assistance.      A circular announcing
the project   was  issued  by  the  Society,  in May, 1859, and by the
following July £2500 had been subscribed. By the end of 1864, the
amount of £5000 had been reached, and by 1868 the fund consisted
of £6052 17s. 8d., New 3 per cent. Annuities.
   Until 1884 the amount remained stationary at a little under £6500,
but legacies, from the late Sir W. Siemens, of £1000, and from Mr.
Bentham, of about £500, gave it a sensible help.
   In November, 1885, however, a noble offer was made by Sir
William, now Lord Armstrong, to present a sum of about £6500 to

1895.]                   The Trusts   of the Royal Society.                203
the fund on       the understanding that an equal sum should be raised
by subscription, and further that the fund might be used in cases
of urgent necessity for the remission of the fees of Fellows.
    Although by the beginning of 1887 it was not found possible to
raise more than about £4200 by subscription, Lord Armstrong, in
February, 1887, munificiently increased his contribution to £7800,
so that in all £12,000 were added to the fund.           Since that date about
£800 more have accrued from bequests from Mr. H. B. Brady and
others, and from donations.            The permanent invested capital of the
fund now consists of
      £6000 London and        North-Western Railway 4 per cent. Guaranteed
                  Stock ;
      £7200 Great Northern Railway 3 per cent. Debenture Stock ;
                  and
      £4340 South Eastern Railway 5 per cent. Debenture Stock ;
producing       an income of about £670 and of the saleable value of
upwards of £24,000.
    The grants last year were unusually high, amounting to £982 5s. ;
bat the available balance in hand is still over £500.
    The administration of the fund is entrusted to a committee con
 sisting of ten members of whom two retire annually, and applications
 for grants are made through              the Presidents of nine chartered
 scientific societies, including the Royal Society of Edinburgh and the
 lioyal Irish Academy, who may recommend the cases for considera
 tion by the Committee.          It has not of late years been the custom fo
 any   officer  of  the  Society to be a member of this Committee.
                           No. 2.   The Donation Fund.
     In  1828    the   late William    Hyde Wollaston, M.D., at one time
  President of the Society, gave the sum of £2000 3 per cent. Consols,
  to be  called the Donation Fund, the dividends to be applied from time
  to time   in promoting experimental researches, or in rewarding those by
  whom such researches may have been made, or in such other manner
  as shall appear to the President and Council for the time being most
  conducive to the interests of the Society in particular, or of science
  in general.      The application of the funds extends to individuals of
  *11 countries,     but. not to members of the Council of the Society,
   lhe dividends are not to be hoarded parsimoniously, but expended
  liberally.     About £1400 more were contributed to the fund by
   Dr. Davies Gilbert (who gave
                                          £1000) and others. In 1874 and
   1875 two legacies of £500 each were            received from Sir Francis
   Ronalds,   F.R.S.,    and  Sir  Charles Wheatstune, F.R.S., and the fund
   for some years consisted of £6339 Consols, which in 1888 was con
                                                                     q 2

verted into £5030 Great Northern Railway Perpetual 4 per cent.
Guaranteed Stock, producing an income of abont £200 per annum.
In the year 1879 the late Sir Walter C. Trevelyan bequeathed a sum
of £1500, the interest to be applied in the promotion of scientific
research.   This was invested in the purchase of £1396 Great
Northern Railway 4 per cent. Debenture Stock, now converted into
£1861 6s. 8il. 3 per cent. Debenture Stock, and forms practically a
part of the Donation Fund. The interest of the Jodrell Fund is also
transferred to   it,

grants last year, however, amounted to £665, though they left a
balance of £364 5s. 4c?. in hand.
                       No.   3.    The Rumford   Fund.
   Count Rumford, in a letter to Sir Joseph Banks dated 12th July,
1796, informed him, as President of the Society, that he had pur
chased and transferred £1000 Stock in the funds of this country,
to the end that the interest of the same should be given once every
second year as a premium to the author of the most important dis
covery or useful improvement which shall be made or published by
printing, or in any way made known to the public in any part of
Europe during the preceding two years on heat or on light, the pre
ference always being given to such discoveries as shall, in the opinion
¦
r£  the President and Council, tend most to promote the good of
mankind.     The premium         to take the form of two medals, the one
                                  is
of gold and the other of silver, to be together of the value of two
years' interest on the £1000, or £60 sterling.        In case of there being
no new discovery in heat or light during any       term   of years which, in
the opinion of the President and Council,          of sufficient importance
                                                    is
to deserve the premium, direction          given to. invest its value in the
                                          is
purchase of additional    stock   in  the English Funds, and the interest
of this additional capital         to be given in money, with the two
                                   is
medals, at each succeeding adjudication.           In     subsequent letter,
                                                          a
Count Rumford suggests       that  the  premium  should   be limited to new
discoveries tending to improve the theories of fire, of heat, of light,
;ind of colours, and to new inventions and contrivances by which the
generation, and preservation, and management of heat and of light
may be facilitated.    Chemical discoveries and improvements in optics,
so far as they answer any of these conditions, are to be within the
limits of the premium, but the Connt wishes especially to encourage
such practical improvements in the management of heat and light as
tend directly and powerfully to increase the enjoyments and comforts
of life, especially in the lower and more numerous classes of society.
The first recipient of the medals was Count Rumford himself.
Previously to 1846     itwas not unfrequently the case that no medal

 1895.]
                      The Trusts  of the Royal  Society.              205
 was  adjudicated for four years. Indeed between 1818 and 1832 the
 only recipient was M. Fresnel.      As a consequence the invested funds
have increased to £2330, but the interest is now only 2f per cent., and
 will in 1903 be only 2£ per cent.      A bonus on the conversion of the
 Stock, including> an additional quarter's interest, and some returned
income tax, either have been, or immediately will be, added to capital.
 The annual income is at present about £64, and the sum of money
that accompanies       the medal abont £68.     In adjudicating this and
other medals the following procedure is adopted.          At a specified
meeting of the Council members are invited to suggest a name or
names thought worthy of consideration.         At a subsequent meeting,
held before the midsummer recess, names are formally proposed and
carefully prepared statements of the claims on which the proposals
are based are circulated among the members of the Council.           At a
Council meeting in October these claims are discussed, and finally,
at a meeting in November, the medals are adjudged.
               No. 4.     Bakerian and Copley Medal Fund.
   There   has for many years been only one amalgamated fund for
these two objects.       It now consists of £403 9s. 8d. New 2f per cent.
Consols.     The Bakerian Lecture originated in 1775, through a
bequest of Mr. Henry Baker, F.R.S.,          of £100, for an oration or
discourse, to be spoken or read yearly by some one of the Fellows of
the Society, on such part of natural history or experimental philosophy,
at such time and in such manner as the President and Council of the
Society for the time being shall please to order and appoint.          In
case no lecture be given, there is a pain of forfeiture attached to the
bequest.    The payment to the lecturer has for many years been a
fixed sum   of £4.
   The Copley Medal, which has long been regarded as the highest
scientific distinction   that the Royal Society can bestow, originated in
a legacy of £100 from Sir Godfrey Copley, Bart., F.R.S., received
in 1709.     The testator directed that this sum should be laid out in
experiments or otherwise for the benefit of the Society, as they shall
direct and appoint.         For many years the interest of the fund was
paid to Dr. Desaguliers, Curator to the Society, for various experi
ments made before them, but in 1736 Martin Folkes, who subse
quently became President of the Society, proposed to render Sir
Godfrey Copley's donation more beneficial than at that time it was.
His suggestion was that instead of the annual experiment, "a medal
or other honorary prize should be bestowed on the person whose
experiment should be best approved, by which means he apprehended
a laudable emulation might be excited among men of genius to try
 their invention, who in all probability may never be moved for the

20t5                          Sir John Evans.                    [Jim. 17,
sake of lucre."     Eventually, in 1736, it was resolved that a medal of
 the value of £5, to bear the arms of the Society, should be awarded
to the author of the most important scientific discovery or contribu
 tion to science by experiment or otherwise.           The weight of the
medal was fixed at 1 oz. 2 dwts. of fine gold. In 1831 is was resolved
that the Copley Medal shall be awarded to the living author of such
philosophical research, either published or communicated to the
Society, as may appear to the Council to be deserving of that honour.
The particulars of the subject of the research are to be specified in
the award, and there is to be no limitation as to the period when
the research was made, or the country to which the author may
belong.
    Owing to the payments for the lecture and the medal being some
what less than the dividends received, a balance has gradually accu
mulated in favour of the fund, amounting to over £100.         This, how
ever, is now being gradually reduced, for in the year 1881, Sir
Joseph Copley, Bart., transferred to the Society a sum of £1666 13s. 4<f.
                        " to
3 per cent. Consols,         provide in perpetuity a yearly bonus of £50,
to be given to the recipient of the Copley Medal." So long as the
interest was at 3 percent., the income of £50 was produced, but now
that it is reduced to 2f per cent., with the near prospect of falling
to 2\ per cent., it is insufficient for the gift. So long, however, as
there has been a balance in hand in favour of the fund, the Council
has thought well to fulfil Sir Joseph Copley's liberal intention.
                        No. 5.   The Keck Bequest.
    In the year 1719 a bequest of £500 was received from Mr. Bobert
Keck, who directed that the profits arising from it were " to be
bestowed     on some one of the Fellows, whom they shall appoint to
carry on a foreign correspondence."      For many years this bequest was
merged    in  the general funds of the Society, and the proceeds applied
towards the payment of the Foreign Secretary. In 1881 it was again
made to appear as a separate trust fund, and £666 13s. id. Consols
was allotted as the equivalent.      This has, at the present time, been
converted into £800 Midland Railway 3 per cent. Debenture Stock,
and the proceeds are annually paid to the Foreign Secretary, who
now receives no other honorarium.
                     No.  6.  The Wixtrixghasi    Fund.
    In 1794 a sum of £1200 Consols was bequeathed to the Society by
Sir Clifton Wintringham, M.U., a Fellow, payable on the decease of
his widow, and subject to certain conditions.        It was not, however,
until 1842 that, after   a tedious law suit, an amount of £1200 Consols

1895.]                The Trusts of  the  Royal Society.               207
was    transferred to the Society.      It was then found that the con
ditions    of the will were so stringent, and involved so much expense,
that it was practically impossible to fulfil them, even when the rate
of interest on Consols was 3 per cent. instead of, as at present, 2|,
or, as it will be shortly, 2\ per cent. There being a further provision
that iD case of failure on the part of the Society to fulfil the inten
tions of the testator, the income of the fund should be paid over to
the Governors of the Foundling Hospital, that institution has in
each year received the interest accruing from the fund.         The subject
has on several occasions     been brought before the Council, and also
before the legal advisers of the Society, but as yet no way out of the
 difficulty has been discovered.
                    No. 7. The Croonian Lectukk Fund.
    This is one of the earliest institutions connected with the Society,
 and,   in name at least, carries us back to the days of its foundation.
 At the meeting held on November 28, 1660, when the design for
 founding the Society whs discussed, Mr. Croone, though absent, was
 nominated as the Register, or as we should now call it Registrar,
 of the small band of learned men who met weekly at Gresham
 College.      Dr. Croone, as he subsequently became, was from the
 beginning an active Fellow of the Society, and on his death, in 1684,
 left a scheme for two lectureships which he intended to found, one of
 which was for the Royal Society.         In his will, however, he made no
 provision    for this purpose, but his widow, who subsequently became
 Lady Sadleir, remedied the omission, and in her will, dated Septem
 ber 25, 1701,    bequeathed to the Society one-fifth of the clear rent of
 the King's Head Tavern, in or near Old Fish Street, London, at the
 corner of Lambeth Hill, "for the support of a lecture and illustrative
 experiment for the advancement of natural knowledge on local
 motion, or (conditionally) on such other subject as, in the opinion of
 the President for the time being, Rhould be most useful in promoting
 the  objects for which the Royal Society was instituted." A decree
 in Chancery, in 1728, empowered the Society to devote the whole
 nett annual profits of the legacy to the payment for a single lecture
 and its attendant expenses.      The proper subject for the lecture is the
 nature or laws of muscular motion, to be accompanied by some
 anatomical demonstration.       The first Croonian Lecture was delivered
 in 1738 by Dr. Stuart, the subject being
                                               " The Motion of the Heart."
  From 1786 to 1885 the property was let for £15 per annum, so that
 the share of the Society was only about £3, but since 1885 the
 rent of the estate has been materially increased, and the Society now
 receives a sum of about £52 yearly as its share, which is paid over
  by the Royal College of Physicians.          The whole of the available

 account at the present time is slightly overdrawn on account of the
 expenses of the last lecture having been unusually high.
                     No.  8.    The Davy Medal Fund.
    By the will of Dr. John Davy, F.R.S., the service of plate pre
 sented to  Sir Humphry Davy for the invention of the safety lamp,
 was bequeathed to the Society, to be melted down and sold, in order
 to found a medal to be given annually for the most important dis
covery in chemistry.      The amount received in 1869 was invested in
the purchase of £660 Madras Railway Stock, producing about £33
per annum.      Some little time elapsed before the dies could be pre
pared, and the first medal actually awarded was given, in duplicate,
to Bunsen and Kirchhoff in 1877.          It was also given in duplicate in
 1878, 1882, 1883, and 1893, but the fund has still a balance in hand
of £48 17*. 9d.
                        No.  9.    The Gassiot Trust.
    In the year 1871 the late Mr. John Peter (lassiot conveyed to the
Society   £10,000  Italian Irrigation Bonds, for the purpose of assisting
in carrying on and continuing magnetical and meteorological obser
vations with self-recording instruments, and any other physical
investigations that may from time to time be practicable and desir
able in the Kew Observatory, in the Old Deer Park, Richmond,
Surrey.
   The proceeds are paid over to the Kew Committee appointed in
accordance with the trust deed.          From time to time some of the
Irrigation   Bonds  are  drawn,    and a profit has been made on reinvest
ment.     These accumulated profits are now represented by a sum of
£400 2f per cent. Consols, which forms a kind of reserve or insur
ance fund. The balance in hand in November last was £164 10s. Id.
                      No. 10.      The Handley Fund.
   By the will of Mr. E. H. Handley, dated 1840, the reversion of his
property was bequeathed to the Society after the death of his sister,
the income to be applied as a reward for important inventions in art
or discoveries in science, physical and metaphysical, or for assistance
in the prosecution of any such invention or discovery, but with power
to the President and Council to apply the income as they may deem
best for the advancement of science.
   Owing to the Statute of Mortmain, a considerable portion of the
property did not pass by this will, but eventually, in 1876, the sum
of £6378 19s. was received, which, after paying Legacy Duty at the

  1895.]             The Trusts  of the Royal   Society.              209
  rate of 10  per cent, and legal expenses, left sufficient to purchase
 £6047 7s. 9d. Reduced 3 per cents.       When the rate of interest was
 threatened a few years ago, this was converted into £4798 Lanca
 shire and Yorkshire Railway 4 per cent. Guaranteed Stock, producing
 about £195 per annum.      Of late years this has been applied towards
 the cost of preparing the Catalogue of Scientific Papers.
                      No. 11.   The Jodrell Fund.
    The late  Mr. T. J. Phillips Jodrell, in  1876, placed at the disposal
of the    Society the sum of £6000, at first with the intention of
encouraging     in this country original research in the physical
sciences, but subsequently, in the same year, with directions to apply
the proceeds as part of the ordinary revenue of the Society.      In 1879
£1000 was, by Mr. Jodrell's directions, transferred to the Fee Reduc
tion Fund, and the remaining £5000 is represented by the sum of
£5182 lis. lOd. 2% per cent. Consols, which stand in the name of
the fund.
    On the death of Mr. Jodrell, in 1889, the proceeds of the fund, in
accordance with a letter from him of April 5, 1878, devolved to and
were incorporated with the Donation           Fund. The income is at
present about £140, but this will be reduced when the diminution in
the interest of Consols takes place.
                      No. 12.   Fee Reduction Fund.
    This fund originated in 1878, the object being to relieve future
Fellows of the Society of the £10 paid as an admission fee and of £1
out of the £4 annual subscription.       These advantages, however, do
not extend to the Privy Councillors and other privileged Fellows who
j0n the Society. Most liberal sums were subscribed : Sir Joseph
Whitworth contributing £2000, Sir William (now Lord) Armstrong and
Mr. James Young £1000 each. The demand upon the fund keeps on, of
coarse, increasing from year to year, but the excess of income over ex
penditure has been regularly invested, and the fund now consists of
£4900 Metropolitan 3£ per cent. Stock and £9333 London and North-
 Western Railway 3 per cent. Debenture Stock, producing an income
of about £450 per annum.          The payments on account of Fellows
amounted last year to £342, and inasmuch as in each year the pay
ment in respect of the subscriptions         of Fellows increases to the
extent of £10 or £12, it is evident that, in the course of time, the
question will have to be considered whether some modification in
 the amount of the reduction or some addition to the capital of the
 fund must not be made.       The payments last year were in respect of
 the contributions    of 192 Fellows and the admission fees of 15.

There is, however, at present over £100 per annum left for invest
ment; so that there is no immediate danger of the fund failing.
Meanwhile, if any Fellow wishes to relieve the fund of the annual
payment of £1 on his account, the Treasurer will be glad to hear
from him.
                   No. 13.   The Darwin Memorial Fund.
    In  1885   the Committee    of the International Darwin Memorial
Fund resolved to transfer to the Royal Society the balance that
remained in their hands, in trust, to devote the proceeds from time to
time towards the promotion of biological studies and research. The
amount was invested in the purchase of £2200 South-Eastern Rail
way 4 per cent. Debenture Stock, which now forms the capital of the
fund.      The annual income is about £88.          In accordance with a
resolution of the Council, a medal, either in silver or in bronze, is
awarded biennially in reward of work of acknowledged distinction
 (especially in Biology) in the field in which Mr. Darwin himself
laboured. The medal is accompanied by a grant of £100, and the
 balance of the proceeds is from time to time to be added to the
capital fund. At the November audit the balance was £461 18s. 10d.r
 but oat of this the grant of £100 to the recipient of the medal was
 paid at the anniversary.
                    No. 14.   The Joule Memorial Fund.
     In 1890 the   Joule Memorial Committee transferred to the Society
 the balance in their hands, the proceeds to be applied for the en
 couragement of research, both in England and abroad, especially
 amongst younger men, in those branches of physical science more
 immediately connected with Joule's work.        According to the regu
 lations made by the Council, a studentship or grant is to be made

  Although the enquiry described in the paper,* of which this com
munication   an abstract, has engaged my attention for the last two
             is
years, the actual experiments on which the conclusions are based were
not performed until the months of September and October, 1894.
Many difficulties in the construction of the apparatus had to be over
come, also the necessary standardisation of the instruments occupied
my leisure time for some months.f
   The apparatus was designed so as to enable me to perform experi
ments at temperatures from 10° to 60° C, and         hoped to carry out
                                                        I

described in Paper     L,  have been able to complete the enquiry at

give approximate determinations at other temperatures.
   The apparatus is, regret to say, of a very complicated nature,
                       I
owing, in a great measure, to my desire to avoid observational errors
by as far as possible so arranging the machinery as to make           self-   it
recording and self-regulating.       do not, therefore, feel

clusions to which the experiments have led me.
   The calorimeter was suspended by glass tubes in a chamber, the
walls of which were maintained at a constant temperature (Go). The
7nethods by which      was kept constant have been fully described

a previous paper.  J    Since the publication of that communication
some additions have been made by which the apparatus has been so
improved that     may be regarded as almost perfect in its action over
                  it
the range 10° to 60°.
   A silver flask which contained the water to be evaporated was
placed within the calorimeter, and the whole of the calorimeter exterior
to the flask was filled originally with aniline, and afterwai-ds with                    a

singularly limpid oil, consisting of hydrocarbons only. This oil was
stirred by paddles   revolving about 320 times per minute. Within
the oil was a platinum-silver coil whose ends were kept at a known
potential difference when an experiment was proceeding. The supply
of heat was balanced by the loss due to evaporation in the flask, and
thus the temperature of the calorimeter             was kept practically
constant and equal to 0C throughout an experiment. True 0, oscillated
slightly about 00, but 0i — 0C rarely attained to 0"05° C. in experiments
lasting 70 or 80 minutes, and the oscillations could be so controlled
that 01—00 was alternately positive and negative.         The advantages
of the above method are that the results are not appreciably affected
by-
       (1.)   Errors in thermometry.
       (2.)   Changes in the specific heat of water.
       (3.)   The capacity for heat of the calorimeter.
       (4.)   Loss or gain by convection, &c.
     Had the calorimeter been filled with water, its capacity for heat
  would have been so great that a considerable loss or gain of heat
  might have caused but small change in 0,, henca the employment of
  the oil, above referred to, whose specific heat and specific gravity
  wei* both small, and thus its
                                      " volume heat " was
                                                           only about four-
  tenths that of water.      It was necessary to detect, and in some cases
  to  measure,  very  small   differences between 0C and $u and this was
  done by the use of differential platinum thermometers.             A full
. description   of these thermometers has recently been published.*
  Eitremely     minute   differences of temperature could not only be
  detected, but also be measured by means of the arrangement adopted.
                I
  In Paper L describe the experimental proofs of the following state
  ment:   "It   follows that the differences of temperature could be
  determined to 0,0004° C, and             I
                                           am confident that differences of
  0 0001° C. could be detected."
      Had it been possible to securo (a) that 0C should remain absolutely
  unchanged ; (6) that the value of 0i — 00 should be zero at the com
  mencement and also at the end of an experiment, it would have been
   unnecessary to measure differences of temperature, since the variations
   daring an experiment would, if the above conditions were observed,
  have no effect on the result.      Let <V and 0," be the initial and final
  temperatures of the calorimeter, and Cel the capacity for heat of the
  calorimeter and contents at the temperature 0„ then Ct, (0/— 0")
   gives the loss of heat of the calorimeter, and as              I
                                                           have shown that
   the loss or gain by radiation, &c., may be neglected, it follows that
   this heat was abstracted by the evaporation of some water.        Also, if
 I'o  varied, an additional correction had to be made.       have indicated

owing to the increase in viscosity of the oil). A study of the results

    There can        be no question as to the accuracy            with which Qf<« was
measured.         The term Qji, is probably the one least accurately deter
mined, but the probable error is not 1 in 100, and the quantity 2g
was found to a far greater degree of accuracy than the above table
shows to be necessary, as it was certainly known to 1 in 1000.
    I  will not here attempt any proof of the above statements, full
particulars being given elsewhere, nor do                  I propose to describe the
mode of carrying out an experiment, as I find it impossible to suffi
ciently compress the account of the operations.
    I performed a large number of experiments when the evaporation
of the water was promoted by the passage of a gas.                         Extreme pre
cautions were taken to dry the gas and to prevent any carrying of
heat by it either to or from the calorimeter, but the results of these
experiments cannot be called satisfactory, as the differences between
individual experiments at the same temperature in extreme cases
amounted to as much as 1 per cent.                  The following table gives the
results    : —

     The rate      of evaporation was greatly varied during these experi
 ments, for the potential difference was changed from that of 1 to 3
 Clark cells, hence the rate of evaporation was in some cases nine
 times as great as in others.
     There is one curious coincidence, which, however, may be merely
 fortuitous.        In two of these experiments nitrogen was passed through
 the water instead of air, and these two experiments                         give almost
 exactly the same value as my final results, viz. :              —

      The method      finally adopted was that of allowing the water to fall
  drop   by drop on to the interior surface of the silver flask, and causing
  identical, and  it will be seen that any errors of this kind would be eliminated during
  •He calculations.    This remark, however, does not apply to Professor Schuster's
  correction for the specific heat of the air displaced, for we are not dealing here
  »ith differences in rate of rise caused by the displacement of air by water.        Ilia
  correction (1 in 4000) is therefore   included in the above value.

    I  regret that the experiments are comparatively few in nnmber,
 but they occupied so much time that         I was unable to make further
 repetitions.
    I   do not, however, consider that such repetitions would have
 greatly strengthened the evidence, for the mean probable error of
 even a small group of experimental results like the above is less than
 the probable error of some of the constants involved in the reduction
 of those results.
    For the reason previously stated      I  attach small value to Nos. I
 to V.

                                         Section   II.
     On p. 218     will be found,    I think,   a  fairly complete table of results
published since the year 1843.
     The values obtained by          Winkelmann (- Wied. Ann.,'             9, 1880)   are
not     included in the table, as they are not based on independent
experiments, but deduced from the observations of Regnault.
     In Paper L        I  have given reasons for my conclusion that much
greater weight attaches to the values of Dieterici and Reguanlt than
 to those given by the other observers.
      Dieterici's method was to determine the mass of ice formed by the
evaporation of a certain mass of water at 0°.                  Hence, his results, like
 my own, are independent of thermometric errors, or errors in the
 determination of the water equivalent of his apparatus.                       Certain of
 his   experiments were performed by placing the water to be evaporated
  in platinum, instead of glass, tubes, and to these he attaches,                 I think
 rightly, greater importance than he does to the remaining experi
  ments.      His conclusions are as follows : —
      " Die
             Versuche mit dem Platingefasse ergeben
                                       L  = 596-73,
  mit einem wahrscheinlichen            Fehler des Mittels von +0° "13."*
      He succeeded       in altering the rate of evaporation very greatly, and
  that    without affecting his results.            I   cannot here even enumerate
   other    considerations which lead to the conclusion that the result of
   Dieterici's platinum tube experiments carries great weight.
      As stated in the above table, Regnault performed twenty-two ex
   periments over the temperature range — 2° to + 16°.                     There can be
   little doubt, however, that his results over this range are of small
   value, and he was evidently of this opinion himself.f
      Winkelmann has written a criticism of Regnault's experiments^
   in which he comes to the conclusion that it is necessary to reject this
   series of   experiments, and, in Paper L,           I  give additional     reasons   for
    their  rejection. The chief arguments are as follows : —
       (1.) Regnault        determined the temperature of the vapour in the
               spiral    by observations of the pressure in the condenser.

           This must Lave been (as Regnault himself points out) con
           siderably below the pressure of the vapour in the flask.
   (2.) At low temperatures a small error in the pressure would
           cause a considerable error in temperature.            For example,
           an error of 0-4 mm. in pressure would correspond (at 4° C.)
           to an error of 1° in 0.
   (3.) All his observations of the change in temperature of the
           calorimeter at low temperatures were taken on a falling
           mercury thermometer, and an error of 0o,01 (the limit to
           which he observed his thermometer) would change the
           resulting value of L by 1 in 500, Now, no observations on
           falling mercury thermometers can be relied on to give an
           accuracy of anything like the above order. •
   (i.) The extreme divergence between the results of these experi
           ments would alone render them of small value.
   (5.) Regnault's    formula for the "total heat" (606-5 + 0-305 0) is
           not in agreement with his experimental results.
   I have  in my paper given further reasons for their rejection, but
T think the above are alone sufficient to prove         that at any rate the
results of these experiments must be regarded with suspicion.           I have
also shown that the tendency of all the above sources of error is to
make Regnault's values of L too high at these temperatures.
   These above objections, however, lose all their force when applied
to Regnault's determinations from 63° to 100°.            His methods of ex
periment    were   entirely  altered  ; for example,  p  was   observed where
-he vapour was formed, and a large change in p would produce but
a small change in 0.      Also his thermometers were rising, the range of
temperature was more than twice as great, and his results were far
more   uniform, &c.
   At about 100°       Regnault performed forty-four experiments, of
which he rejects the    first six as "preliminary"; the remaining thirty-
eight give the following mean results : —
                        Temp.                  Total heat.'
                        99-88                    636-67
   This would become 636-60 at 100°.             Hence, if we assume that
1  gram   of  water  in  cooling   from   100° to 0° gives out 100 thermal
units, we get L = 536 60 at 100°.
   Now, taking my values, viz.,

  If   we assume        with Regnault that             L   is    a linear    function         of    0   we
can deduce the values at 0° and 100", and we get 596'73 and                                        53663

 I     think that   I         in calling this agreement remarkable,
                            am justified
and there   evidence that

   Winkelmann, in his analysis of Regnault's work, states that the
following formula gives the results of Regnault's experiments with
greater accuracy than Regnault's own formula —

    We thus         see    that formula (G) t^ives a closer approximation to

lend support to formula (G).
    One difficulty, however, presents itself.               If there is any truth in
the ordinarily accepted ratio of the " mean thermal unit from 100°

and thus Dieterici's value of L at 0°,            if expressed in     terms of thermal
unit at 15°, would become 603-3.
    Again, according to Regnault we ought to subtract 100-5 from
63(5-60, and thus get L at 100° = 536-1.
    The only reasonable explanation of this difficulty appears to me to
be that the value of the " mean thermal unit " is practically the same
as the value of the "thermal unit at 15° C."
    I see nothing impossible in this supposition. As shown in Paper L,
there is sufficient evidence that at low temperatures the capacity for
 heat of water decreases with rise of temperature.                   Rowland found a
minimum indicated near 34°. If, therefore, the capacity for heat
increases gradually above some such temperature, but more rapidly
neat- 100°, it is quite conceivable that the " mean thermal unit

clusions at low temperatures are incorrect, and                    I  do not see that
those at higher temperatures have greater value, for his methods of

III.   " On   Slow Changes in the Magnetic Permeability of Iron."
         By William M. Mordey. Communicated by Professor
         Silvanus P. Thompson, F.R.S. Received December IS,
         18y4.
   When iron is magnetised for a long time by rapidly alternating
currents,    its magnetic permeability is usually reduced, a gradual
increase taking place in the amount of energy absorbed in producing
a given magnetisation.           This effect has been observed in connection
with    the working        of   transformers       on    alternate-current       systems.
Although it has been known for some time to a few electrical en
gineers, the author is not aware that any investigation or proof lias
been published as to the cause of this change.*
    When the author first became aware of this increase he investigated
the subject in connection with the work of the Brush Electrical
Engineering Company, and to that company acknowledgments are
ilue for permission to publish the results so far obtained.                    It may br
mentioned that the investigation is still in progress.
    In the first place explanations were sought in direct connection
with the magnetic or electric actions that take place.
    The explanation that first suggested itself was that eddy currents
were being set up in the coils by leakage or partial failure of the in
sulation between adjacent portions of the conductor, or that eddy
currents were being set up to an increased degree in the iron by
disturbance or change of the insulating material interposed between
the thin plates of iron of which the transformers were composed.
   * The following arc the only published references to this subject, so far as known
to the author : —
   In the ' Electrician ' of December 7th, 1894, the subject is introduced by Mr.G.
 W. Partridge, with some examples of the increase and a statement that the eBect is
          " molecular
due to a                change or fatigue in the iron."
   There is also a note by Professor Ewing referring to Mr. Partridge's article, also
                                          "a
ascribing the effect, if confirmed, to        progressive magnetic fatigue."
   In the same journal for December 14th, 1894, there is an article on the subject
by Dr. Fleming, stating that the effect is not general, that he has failed to find it in
some cases, and pointing out that differences of temperature at the times of testing
may account for the variations observed.
   Mr. B. T. Smith states that in one sample of iron he has found considerable
increase after about 240,000,000 reversals.
   Mr. O. T. Blathy, of Buda-Pesth,     states that he is familiar with the effect, that. the
loss in magnetising  transformers   increases from 20 to 25 per cent., and that artificial
heating of the transformer     for several hours to about 150° C. will have the saint-
effect, which he states is permanent,
   Sir David Salomons also states that he lias referred           to the effect in   a work
written some months ago.

 1895.]           in  the Magnetic  Permeability of Iron.             225
 A careful examination     showed that this explanation was untenable.
 The increase    was found in transformers, the coils of which were
thoroughly dry and well insnlated, and in which no change had
occurred in the separating material between the plates.          This was
confirmed by removing the iron> and trying it with new coils
specially insulated — also by trying the old coils with other samples
of iron which had been separately tested.
   Another explanation suggested was that the effect was a sort of
magnetic fatigue — that the iron deteriorated somewhat in the same
way as with steel springs, which suffer from
                                                 " fatigue " after a great
number of extensions or vibrations.
   The gradual increase in the energy absorbed pointed to a physical
change in the iron, which behaved exactly as if it slowly hardened
and so became less permeable — as if the softening         results of the
process   of annealing were being gradually lost.
   Effect of Annealing.
                         — On carefully re-annealing some of the iron by
heating it to redness and cooling slowly, ic entirely recovered its
original high permeability.
   Having thus found that the iron was not permanently or irre
mediably affected — although apart from annealing the effect seems
to be permanent — it remained to ascertain whether the change was
due directly to the magnetic action, or whether it was caused by
some secondary condition,      having the reversals of magnetism as a
primary cause.
   Effect  of Heat. — An investigation was therefore made as to the
effect of heat on the iron.
   Under the conditions of working, the temperature of the iron in
transformers is raised, both by the energy dissipated in the iron itself
by  hysteresis and eddy currents, and also by conduction and radiation
from the copper windings forming the primary and secondary con
ductors.     This rise of temperature varies according to the conditions
of working and the construction of the transformer; usually it is
from 20° to CO" C. above the surrounding atmosphere.
   In order to investigate the action of heat, aa distinct from magnetic
or electric action, some samples of iron were kept for some months
in an oven maintained at temperatures varying from about 60° C. to
about 75° C.     These samples were of iron obtained for transformer
construction and were built up in the manner of transformers, having
windings which were used simply for testing purposes.
   Method of Measuring. — The coils used were of known turns and
resistance.    The wire was of such a size as to make the C'-R loss
negligible in comparison with the losses in the iron.           The power
was measured by a very             sensitive wattmeter, constructed by
Dr. Fleming, the volts by a Cardew voltmeter checked against a
 Kelvin multicellular electrostatic voltmeter, and the current by a

 Siemens electro-dynamometer.          These were instrnments in regular
 use for manufacturing      purposes and used in fixed positions. The
 readings    of watts   and volts are reliable within about (V5 per cent.
 The current readings are less accurate, as the range of the instrument
 was not very suitable.       The source of current was a 37-kilowatt
 alternator of the author's type, working at 100 periods per seeond,
 and at a high E.M.F. The low E.M.F. required for the tests, from
 20 to 60 volts, was given by the secondary of a transformer, the
 primary of which was connected to the alternator.           Variations of
 E.M.F. were obtained by adjustment of the field excitation of the
 alternator.
    There are irregularities in the tabulated readings which are
 probably not entirely due to errors of observation, but to differences
 of the conditions under which the tests were made. For example, the
iron when removed froin the oven was allowed to cool, but the exact
 temperature was not taken, and it certainly was not the same in all
cases.    In August it would probably be higher than in December.
And although the alternator used to supply the testing current was
the same in all cases and was run at the same periodicity, there were
 differences of condition of the circuit and load which may have had a
slight influence on the results.
    Sample No. 1. This consisted of a block built up of stampings
arranged as in Fig. 1, which shows section and plan, the outside
dimensions of the plates being 16£ ins. by 11 ins. The sheets were
0 014 in. (0"354 mm.) thick, varying slightly ; they were built up to
a certain thickness with 100 stampings separated by paper, the total
weight being about 55 lbs.       The winding is shown at C.
    Samples   Nos.  2 and  3 were  made up exactly the same as No. 1,
but were taken from different supplies of iron.
    They were occasionally removed from the oven, allowed to cool, and
then returned to the oven after a test had been taken of the loss of
energy with a given magnetisation.
    The results obtained from these three samples are given respec
tively in Tables 1, 2, and 3, and graphically in Diagrams 1, 2, and 3.
For ease of comparison the watts are plotted as percentages in all
the diagrams.
    The magnetising coil in each of these cases consisted of 100 turns
of copper strip 0"16 in. by 0-09 in., having a resistance of 0"15 ohm.
or so low as to make the C*R loss negligible, as compared with the
loss in the iron.       For example : with the maximum current nsed,
07 ampere, CSR      =  0"0735 watt, the total loss being 29-3 watts.
    In the foregoing examples the iron magnetic circuit is not quite
continuous : it is interrupted in part by butt joints and in part by
lap joints.

ing, consisting of 140 turns of insulated        copper wire O049 in.

almost evenly throughout the magnetic circuit.
  The measurements made with this sample are given in Table V
and  Diagram 5.

   On the occasion of each test, measurements were made at three
¦densities, viz., B 2500, 2752, 3050.
   The sample was kept in the oven between each set of tests, at the

same temperature as the others, that       an average of about 67° C.
   It will be seen that the hysteresis still rising, the change being
about in the same order as in the other samples, showing that the
question of joints has no noticeable effect.    The change also follows
closely  the  same  order, whether measured  at 2500, 2762, or 3050 B.
   Effect of            —
               Pressure. An attempt was made to find     if   the increase
was due directly       to  heat or toa   mechanical   condition   brought
about by the heat.
   A possible explanation of the increase of hysteresis suggested itself
in connection with the method of construction.       In transformers the
iron laminse are usually bolted together very firmly, in order to
ensure good contacts at the magnetic joints, to prevent noise, and for
ordinary purposes of mechanical construction.       It appeared possible
that the expansion of the iron, due to heat, caused the plates to be
pressed together more firmly when hot than when cold, and that this
state of compression, if   long continued, had a hardening effect on the
iron similar to that caused by cold rolling or hammering.

    One    objection to this explanation was, that as the iron bolts
holding the plates together were heated nearly as much as the plates,
and therefore expanded nearly as much, the pressure could only vary
slightly.
    It was thought that in some forms such a gradual hardening
might also be caused by the pressure exerted by the weight of the
upper plates on the lower ones.            But the increase was found where
there was no superincumbent weight, in transformers in which the
plates rested on their sides or edges.
    In order to investigate this point two experiments were tried. The
first was with the sample marked No. 5.              In order, as far as possible,
to avoid any compression,         the  plates  in  this  sample were not bolted
or clamped together, but, as described above, were merely held
together by a binding of insulating tape and by the layer of copper
wire with which they were covered.               The results given in Table V
do not differ materially from those of Nos. 1, 2, and 3.
    An observation which tends to indicate that pressure is not the
cause of the change of condition was made some time ago.                 Different
parts of the iron of a transformer, which had been in use some time,
were examined, when it was found that the middle portions were
rather more affected than the end portions.                As the end portions,
being most exposed, are least heated, and as in this instance all parts
were subject to the same amount of pressure by the clamps or bolts,
this observation does not support the supposition that pressure is the
cause of the change.           As, however, commercial iron varies in its
hysteresis,    even   in   the  same sheet, the observation is of doubtful
 ralue
    A second set of tests is that marked No. 6. In this case the iron
used was      of the same size as in Nos. 1, 2, and 3, but of smaller
amount.
    It  was arranged     with a testing coil in the samo manner, but instead
of   keeping the iron with its coil complete throughout the experiment,
 the   c0l was only put on for the          tests,  and was then removed, the
 iron being placed in the oven, arranged as a flat block (its upper
 surface being about 150 sq. ins.), with a weight of about 300 lbs. on
 it till the next test was made.            It was thought that perhaps the
 slight pressure produced       in  this way might affect the results. These
 are given in Table VI and Diagram No. 6, and are markedly different
 from the tests of Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 5.            The increase of hysteresis is
 greater, although the test has not been so long in progress.
    This point     deserves    full investigation,     and the author hopes to
 obtain   further results from tests now in progress.*
     Change   of Power-factor.— The power-factor or ratio of watts to
 volts   X amperes shows an irregular increase in all the tests.              This

                  Mr. W. M. Mordey.       On Slow Changes          [Jan. 17,
 increase in the power-factor indicates a possible (but improbable)
 increase in the eddies, such as would be accounted for by a decrease
 of (bo specific resistance of the iron. The author is proceeding to
 investigate this matter by continuously heating a ring formed by
  winding a volute of iron ribbon or wire, overwound with a testing
 coil of copper wire.     The ends of the iron being brought out enable
 measurements of the resistance to be taken, the magnetising losses
 being measured as in the other samples.*
     Magnetisation not necessary to Production of the Effect. — Having
 ascertained that neither magnetic nor electric action was necessary to
  the production of this effect, the author has endeavoured to find
  whether alternate- current magnetisation of iron can be carried on
 continuously, or for considerable periods, without producing any
  noticeable change, and, although the evidence is not sufficient to
  justify a positive statement, he finds that so long as the iron is kept
 cool it suffers no reduction of permeability.         For example, a trans
  former in regular use for certain testing purposes, and used several
 hours daily during the last fifteen months, has kept its permeability
 unaltered. It is magnetised at various densities up to about 2700 B.
  It is a specially designed apparatus, of large size for the work it has
 to do (and therefore inefficient and costly), and the temperature of its
 iron probably never rises more than about 6° to 8° C. above the room
 in which it is placed. It may be that its daily periods of rest account
 for the absence of change.       This supposition is, however, not sup
ported by other cases where iron which has been in regular use, bnt
 with daily periods of rest, has shown the increase of hysteresis very
 clearly.
     Condition not Changed by Repose. — Further, the iron of some trans
 formers which showed this increase, but which for several months
 have not been used, shows no return to the original condition.          The
 author is thereforo inclined to believe that if periods of repose in
.some cases prevent the rise, it is because the time of use is not long
 enough to allow of much increase of temperature.
     This part of the subject is being pursued, but for the present the
 author will only say that, so long as iron is only slightly warmed
 (even when that warmth is caused by alternate-current magnetisa
 tion) its permeability remains unaffected.
     ft may be that repose at a temperature near or below zero, Centi
 grade, or at a still lower temperature, would have some effect. It
 appears possible, since continued expansion due to moderate heat can
 bring about this permanent increase of hysteresis, that continued
 contiaction by moderate cold may bring the iron back to its original
 condition, or even permanently increase its permeability.       The author
 intends to investigate this point.

   The     slow increase of hysteresis,* which is the subject of this
communication, must not be classed with the immediate effect pro
duced by the moderate heating of iron.                When the iron of trans
formers is heated, in working, it at first absorbs less energy than
when ccol, probably because the increase in its resistance lessens the
eddies set np in it.          This is the case whether the heating is by
ordinary means or by magnetic reversals.              It is a temporary effect —
the loss goes up again on cooling.          If it is kept heated, a slow change
takes place, the loss gradually increasing again, from the decrease of
permeability caused by heat.f If the temporary reduction of the loss
is entirely accounted for by the increased resistance reducing the
eddies, it appears to afford a means of separating the losses caused
by hysteresis proper, and those caused               by eddies.     The ordinary
measurement of magnetising loss of course gives the sum of these
two.
   The increase       of hysteresis shown in the tests, and resulting from
the    heating, is somewhat greater than the author has observed in
transformers      where the heat has been caused by the magnetic and
electric losses    ; possibly this is because in the latter cases the tempe
rature has been somewhat lower.
   All the tests show an increase of loss, the maximum apparently
not yet having been reached.            The tests are being continued.
    Conclusions.   —  The conclusions to which these observations lead, so
far as they have gone, are : —
    1. The effect is not fatigue of the iron caused directly by repeated
magnetic reversals — it is not
                                      " progressive magnetic fatigue."
    2. Neither magnetic nor electric action is necessary              to its pro
duction.
    3.  It is a physical change resulting from long-continued heating at
a very     moderate temperature.
    4. It appears to be greater if pressure is applied during heating.
    5. It is not produced when the iron is not allowed to rise more
 than a few degrees above the ordinary atmosphere.
    6. It is similar to the effect produced by hammering, rolling, or by
 heating to redness and cooling quickly.
    7. The iron returns to its original condition on re-annealing.
    8. It does not return to its original condition if kept unused and at
 ordinary atmospheric temperatures, whether the periods of rest are
 short or   long.
   *
       This effect may have an important influence on the reliability of measuring
 instruments having iron portions magnetised by alternate currents.   The constants
 of such instruments    may gradually fall.

                                   Appendix   I.
    Effect of Pressure without Heat. — The following test on the effect
of pressure has been made without the application of heat. A trans
former constructed in the manner of Fig. 1 was taken and tightened
up by hand in the usual way, sufficient for ordinary purposes of con
struction.      The loss, on magnetising to 2180 B at 100       ^  was found to
be 59-8 watts.
    It was then submitted to a pressure of 100 tons, or about 1500 lbs.
per sq. in. (10'57 kilos, per sq. cm.), in a direction to force the
lam in re closer together, the tightening bolts then being screwed up
with the pressure on. On magnetising again to 2180 B the loss was
found to be 72"5 watts, or an increase of 21 per cent.
    It was kept bolted np in this way for 30 days, and readings
 taken occasionally as shown in Table IV, the loss remaining practi
 cally unchanged under this continued application of pressure.
    The bolts were then slackened and the loss, on being agaia
 measured, was found to be the same as before the pressure was
applied.
     Thus, without heat, pressure (up to the limits of the test) pro
 duces no permanent effect.          But that even a very small pressure will
 increase the permanent effect of heat is shown by the results given
 in Table VI.
     It should, however, be remembered that Table VI is the record of
 only a single set of tests, and that it is not known what the effect
  would have been if the iron had been heated without any application
 of pressure. It is, therefore, safe only to say that under considerable
  pressure, without the application of heat, there is a change of a
  definite amount which remains constant under constant pressure, and
  which disappears immediately on the removal of the pressure.*
     It is, however, clear that the slow decrease in permeability under
  continued moderate heating is not to be accounted for by hardening
  produced by pressure.
     The hardening, which takes place veiy slowly at these low tempera
  tures, is similar, apparently, to the hardening which takes place
  when iron is heated to a high temperature and then suddenly
 cooled.

   The author has a test         in hand to find the effect of heat combined
with considerable pressure, but cannot yet give any results.
                                      Appendix     II.
   The results obtained in this way, so far as the investigation                         haB
gone, are as     follows : —
   A ring was       made up of       iron ribbon, wound in a close volute, the
convolutions       separated from each other by paper. This was then
wound     with    a magnetising winding of copper wire covering the
whole ring.       A test was taken on January 15, 1895, of the resistance
of the   iron,   and of the energy spent in magnetising it to 2500 B at
100 <^w.    It   was then kept in an oven at a temperature ranging
between 60° and 75° C.               It was taken out, cooled, and the tests
repeated on January 25 and February 8 as below : —

                                  17-3            4-9              0-72           0-9410

   Thus the hysteresis loss has gone up considerably, as a result of
continued heating, and the resistance has also risen.                     This result is
in accordance with what is known as to the connection between the
magnetic permeability and the electrical resistance of iron.                           Pro
fessor Hughes showed many years ago* that the lower the resistance
of iron the better      its magnetic qualities.
   As bearing on this point, the author has measured the resistance of
some soft annealed iron strips, which were then hardened by being

heated to redness and quenched in oil at 14° C. It was found that this
hardening process increased the resistance 4 per cent. and 7 per cent,
in different samples.
                                  Appendix   III.
   This effect may he illustrated by an example. A transformer was
kept in a tank of heated oil, the temperature of which was kept between
HO3 and 140° C.        Readings of its loss were taken occasionally as
below, the magnetisation being the same in all cases, the current
being applied only at the time and for the purpose of the test.
   This test has not yet been in progress long enough to show the
slow rise very clearly.

   Black-damp, sometimes also called choke-damp, or stythe," is one
of the gases frequently found in the workings of coal mines.       It is
distinguished from fire-damp by the fact that it is not explosive
when mixed with air, but extinguishes flame; and from after-damp
by the fact that it is not the product of an explosion, but collects in
the workings under ordinary conditions.       Like after-damp and fire
damp, it produces fatal effects when inhaled in sufficient concentra
tion.   A further distinction has been drawn between black-damp and
white-damp, which latter is described as capable of supporting com
bustion, while at the same time acting as a poison when inhaled.
   Black-damp usually occurs in old workings and other ill-ventilated
parts of coal mines. It is much more common in some districts than in
others.   As to its composition, very little seems to have been hitherto
ascertained, and           I
                       have not been able to discover any published
analysis.    The prevailing opinion, however, is that it consists of
carbonic acid, and that its suffocative properties are due to this gas.*
This opinion appears to bo chiefly based on the observation that
black-damp frequently lies along the floors of workings with fresh
air above     it,
              and must therefore be, like carbonic acid, heavier than
air.

250               Dr.   J. Haldane.      An Enquiry     into the      [Jan.   24.
   In  a paper read before the British Association in August of the
present year*      I  expressed the opinion that black-damp is chiefly
nitrogen, and does not contain more than from 10 to 20 per cent, of
carbonic acid. One of the grounds for this opinion was the fact that
the symptoms and the action on lamps described as produced by
diluted black-damp do not correspond with those produced by
mixtures of carbonic acid with air.
   Through thekind co-operation of Mr.W. N. Atkinson, H.M. Inspector
of Coal Mines,     I have lately had the opportunity of making observa
tions on concentrated black-damp from two pits, the first being in a
fiery and the second in a non-fiery district.            These two pits were
selected by Mr. Atkinson as affording characteristic specimens of
black-damp.       In each case the gas was obtained from unused work
ings through an iron pipe inserted through a stopping.             On turning
 the tap with which the pipe was provided, the black-damp issued in
an abundant stream.
    Specimens were collected in the following manner : — A short piece
of rubber tubing was attached to the tap by means of a cork perfo
rated by glass tubing.         The other end of the rubber tubing was
attached to another doubly-tubulated cork, which was fitted into a
small glass bottle. The second tube of this cork was conuected by
rubber tubing with a small syringe, provided with valves arranged
for aspirating through the bottle. With the help of the syringe, the
bottle was washed out with about twenty times its volume of gas
from the tap, and then, while held mouth upwards, at once closed
perfectly air-tight by forcing into it a cork which had been previously
boiled in somewhat soft paraffin wax.          I  adopted this method owing
to the impossibility of using naked lights in a fiery mine for the pur
pose of sealing np specimens of gas in glass tubes.
                        Podmore   Colliery, Staffordshire.
   An ordinary locked safety-lamp held under the tap was at             once ex
tinguished when the black-damp was allowed to issue, as was a
Clowes hydrogen lamp. Two other safety-lamps, which had been
put down or hung np a few yards away, were also extinguished
while the specimens were being collected.            I was provided with one
of the small electric hand-lamps         made    by the Lithanode Company,
which afforded an excellent light, so that the loss of the oil light*
caused no inconvenience.          After the specimens had been collected,
the tap was arranged so as to enable me to inhale the black-damp as
it issued, without dilution.        I  inspired from the tap and expired
through the nostrils.        The sensation produced at the back of the
mouth was identical with that produced by air containing 8 or 10 per

cent, of    carbonic acid. There was no smell of sulphuretted hydrogen
or any other gas.         Two or three inspirations were sufficient to pro
duce marked increase in the depth and frequency of the respirations.
The hyperpncaa          rapidly became more intense and was accompanied
by   palpitations.       At the same time I was observed to become blue in
the face.      Within about thirty seconds I felt that I was becoming
confused, and did not push the observations further.                  Two or three
seconds     after   I had ceased to breathe from the pipe the blueness was
seen suddenly to disappear from my face and lips, and to be replaced
by the natural colour.
    The feelings which        I  experienced after the first fifteen or twenty
seconds in breathing the black-damp were distinctly such as are pro
duced    by breathing air very poor in oxygen. From previous experi
ments I had become familiar with the distinction between the feelings
produced by excess of carbonic acid and those due to deficiency
of oxygen.         The experiment of breathing the black-damp was re
peated twice in order to leave no doubt.               An analysis of the black-
damp gave the following result :           —
                       Nitrogen                              82- 56

                                      Total                 100-00
     I tested  part of the mixture for carbonic oxide by shaking with a
 little very     dilute blood.       Neither with the spectroscope nor by the
 change of tint could I discover any evidence of the presence of
 carbonic oxide.         The test employed would have detected 0-05 per
 cent.     The oxygen was determined by absorption with alkaline pyro-
 gallate solution of the composition recommended by Hempel.                      The
 methane was determined by                explosion in a Hempel's explosion
 pipette, after the addition of oxygen and detonating gas.                   All the
 measurements were made over mercury.                    The gas-burette was a
 modification of that of Petterson.
     The calculated specific gravity of this mixture is T0106, or very
 nearly that of air.          The extra nitrogen and the methane are both
 considerably      lighter  than    the oxygen which they replace, and thus
 counterbalance the effect on the specific gravity of the heavier
 carbonic acid.

          second   determination   of the carbonic acid gave  exactly the same result

                            Lilleshall Colliery, Shropshire.
    The part of the heading nearest the pipe had, at Mr. Atkinson's
 request, been bratticed (curtained) off, so that a chamber was pro
 vided in which the black-damp could be allowed gradually to accu
 mulate. The heading was about 3£ ft. high.                    As the mine is not a
 fiery  one,  it   was possible    to  use naked   lights.
    The gas from the pipe at once extinguished a candle.                         On
breathing the gas        I  found that my respirations rapidly became deeper
and more frequent, so that after a short time I was panting violently.
The panting, however, did not increase beyond a certain point, and
 was not distinctly accompanied by the peculiar feelings character
istic of distress from want of oxygen. After breathing the black-
damp for two minutes it seemed to me that the distress was, if
anything, diminishing, and that              I  might have continued to breathe
from the pipe for a considerable time without injury.                  The panting
was accompanied by blueness of the face, which did not, however,
.seem to Mr. Atkinson to be so marked as it was at the Podmore Pit,
although the change of colour when                 I  ceased to breathe from the
oipe was quite distinct.              A  similar  result was obtained when the
 ^as   was   breathed      by   Mr.   Richard    Warren,    who had accompanied
me.
    The effect of the black-damp on a mouse was then observed. The
animal was placed in a piece of wide glass tubing, over one end of
which gauze had been tied.               The end of this tubing was then luted
with clay to the opening of the pipe (which was directed upwards),
and the gas allowed to pass through the gauze, on which the animal
sat.    It at once began to pant violently, but did not lose power over
its limbs, or seem to become otherwise seriously affected, although
exposed to the black-damp for eleven minutes.                  The panting did not
increase     after   the   first  few   seconds,  and   ceased   at once when the
animal was taken out.               It was in no way injured by the experi
ment.
    With Mr. Warren's help a graphic record was then taken, by means
of a Marey's recording stethograph, of the effect of the black-damp
on my respirations.           The tracing obtained is reproduced below. An

the  lower. The time-marker indicates seconds.                It will be seen that
the action of the black-damp became apparent after two inspirations
and attained its maximum after twenty inspirations, or one minute,
and that subsequently the hyperpncea              gradually became somewhat
less marked.
   After this observation the tap was turned full on and the brattice
closed, two of the party remaining outside in case of any accident.
A sample of air* taken at the moment when the last light (a candle
fixed horizontally) was extinguished, had the following composi
tion  : —

   This composition corresponds to what would have been expected
from previous observations.            Thus, in experiments by Dr. Lorrain
Smith and myself on air vitiated by respiration,              J a match could no
longer be lighted when the air contained about 17-7 per cent. of
oxygen and 2-5 per cent. of carbonic acid, or 17-4 per cent, of oxygen
and 0-4 per cent. of carbonic ac.id.
   About half an hour later, Mr. Warren's breathing had become
somewhat deeper than usual, though my own was not distinctly
affected.      A sample of air taken at this point had the following com-
sition   : —

   Neither of us could detect any loss of power, headache, or                any
other abnormality, nor did we experience any trace of after-effect on
coming out of the mine.           We did not continue these observations
further, as the vitiation was now evidently proceeding very slowly,
owing to the slight ventilation through the brattice cloth. When
this was lifted, the lights of the party outside were suddenly ex

time it was impossible to re-light a candle.

     This   composition supports the view that black-damp is the
residual gas left on slow oxidation of the carbon and hydrogen
of coal by air.        Supposing that the black-damp were produced by
the oxidation of the carbon and hydrogen which                            would, under
other conditions, be given off as methane, it would consist of 88-30
per cent. of nitrogen and 11"70 per cent. of carbonic acid. This com
position very closely approximates to that actually found in the first
specimen.         The second specimen shows a larger proportion of
carbonic acid, and corresponds to the oxidation of material contain
ing about 3 atoms of hydrogen to one of carbon.                     It must be borne
in mind, however, that the coal may itself supply part of the oxygen
 required for the formation of carbonic acid and water in the oxida
 tion process.
     The physiological       action of black-damp such as that examined is
 due partly to its deficiency in oxygen, and partly to its carbonic acid.
 When mixed in increasing proportions with air, its action, as shown
 above, first becomes sensible when the oxygen is diminished to about
 15 per cent. and the carbonic             acid increased to about 3-5 per cent.
 From the observations previously made by Hermans, and by Lorrain
 Smith and myself,* it follows that the hyperpncea which began to
 be produced at this point was due to excess of carbonic acid, and not to
 deficiency of oxygen.          Until the carbonic acid is increased to about
 7 per cent. the same inference holds good ; the effect on the respiration
 is almost the same as that of air or oxygen containing 7 per cent. of
 carbonic acid ; and the breathing of such air for some time is
 attended with no immediate risks to normal persons.                        When, how
  ever, the air is still further vitiated          the   deficiency  in   oxygen begins
  to tell dangerously ; and when the oxygen is reduced to about 7 per
  cent, there is imminent risk of loss of sensation and power over the
  limbs.      The danger-point from deficiency of oxygen (about 7 per
  cent.) is sooner reached in the case of a mixture of black-damp and
  air than the danger-point from excess of carbonic acid. The presence
  of the carbonic acid in black-damp would seem in reality to diminish
  the risk, since, by causing panting, it gives some warning of the

gravity.
                                 Summary of Conclusions.
      1.   The specimens of black-damp   consisted when undiluted of
nitrogen containing an admixture of a seventh to an eighth of its
volume of carbonic acid.
   2. Air containing just sufficient black-damp to extinguish a candle
or oil lamp produced no immediately sensible action on a man. A
mixture of about 16 per cent. of the black-damp and 84 per cent, of
air extinguished candles and lamps, whereas a mixture of about
60 per cent. of the black damp and 40 per cent. of air would be
required to produce immediate danger to life.
  3. The dangerous physiological action of black-damp is dne to
deficiency of oxygen, not to excess of carbonic acid. The effect first
appreciable when increasing proportions of black-daiup are breathed
is,however, due to carbonic acid alone.

   In the deduction of the normal curve of frequency from the sym
metrical point binomial, three conditions are usually assumed to be
true   : —
                                      "                        "             unit of
   (o.) The chances of any               contributory cause       giving its
deviation in excess or in defect are presumed to be equal.
   (b.) The        number of "contributory causes" are supposed to be
indefinitely great.
   (r.) The "contributory causes" are all supposed to be indepen
dent.
    (e) amounts to the assumption of a binomial form (p + q)",                (a) to
the   equality of p and q, (c) to the indefinitely great value of n.
    It   is shown     in the paper that there is an important geometrical
relation between the normal frequency curve
                                      z  =  w-W,
and the         symmetrical point binomial,            +        which is true inde
 pendently        of the  magnitude      of n.   Thus    the condition (I) is not
 necessary to the very close fitting of symmetrical point binomials to
 normal curves for even very small values of n, such, for example, as
 8 or 10.        This has been long recognised in statistical practice if its
 source has not been noted.
     We can remove the condition (a) fiom our a priori limitations by
 finding a curve which is related to the skew binomial (p + q)" in pre
 cisely the same manner as the normal curve is related to the sym
 metrical binomial                     The equation to this curve is

-258               Prof. Karl Pearson.        Mathematical        [Jan.  24,
If  x be the total frequency, and pr% the      rth moment of the frequency
curve about its centroid vertical, then for this curve
                          2fH   (3tf—fn)   + 3^ =   0.
This relation mast be satisfied or nearly satisfied if a series of obser
vations or measurements is to be fitted with the skew curve, which is
related to the skew point-binomial as the normal curve to the          sym
metrical point-binomial.         For fitting a skew point-binomial we  must
have
 For  the normal curve    /»4
                               = 3^. But a great number of statistical
returns   — especially in anthropometry and zoometry — give
                              /*»>3^r+3/ia7(2,u2).
 Hence they differ from the normal curve in the opposite direction to
the skew point-binomial and its corresponding frequency curve.
    After the complete theory of the fitting of skew binomials ami
this special skew curve has been discussed with examples, the
memoir proceeds to the generalisation of the frequency curve by
withdrawing the limitation (c) above. Just as the symmetrical bi
 nomial and normal curves are illustrated by the tossing of a group
of 11 coins, and the skew binomial and its skew curve by the spin
ning of a group of » ni-sided teetotums, so we can arrive at a series
of curves in which the contributory causes are interdependent, by
considering the withdrawal of r cards from a pack of ns cards con
 taining s suits ; or, again, by drawing a definite amount of sand from
 a vessel containing two kinds of sand.
    For discontinuous series the solution is a hypergcometrical series.
 If now a curve be formed which is related by the same fundamental
 geometrical relation to this hypergeometrical series as the normal
 curve to the symmetrical point- binomial, or the first skew curve to
 the skew point-binomial, we obtain a generalised frequency curve
 which contains both those hitherto considered as special or limiting
 cases.
    It is not suggested that the hypergeometrical series or its corre
 sponding curve is the only case in which the a priori condition (c) of
 dependence of
                   " contributory causes " is replaced by an interde
  pendence.    But it is suggested that it is one of the most important
  cases, and one which naturally occurs at the commencement of our
  investigations.   That it is probably quite sufficient is evidenced by
  the fact that the author has hitherto failed to find any group ol
  homogeneous and skew statistics which cannot be closely expressed
  by the curves which correspond to the hypergeometrical series.

most      general case we are led to two principal types of curves
     The second of these curves                is   marked by   a   limited range and skew-
negs.  Its theory — method of fitting to actual statistics and its
geometrical properties — are discussed, and the curve is shown to
involve     in fitting only the use of a table of T-functions —               a   table which
already exists.
   The first of these curves has skewness but no                      limit to range.    This
unlimitedness        of range       is   not, however, necessarily significant.         There
ia   a    limit to the height of adult males, or at any rate to the ratio of
their sitting to standing height, but we do not hesitate to express the
results in terms of the normal curve.    The fact    that both normal  is
curve and generalised curve are only close approximations to series —
point-binomial and point-hypergeometrical series — which can them
selves give a limited range, and we ought to fit these series rather
than the curves to our observations.*

which we have seen vanishes for the curve corresponding to the skew
point-binomial.
     The complete treatment  of curves of the first kind     shown to             is

has been discussed in a recent paper by Dr. Forsyth, to whom the

    The author regrets that while he has obtained a criterion for each
species of skew curve, he has hitherto failed to find one which will
distinguish a compound curve, e.g., heterogeneous material, from a
skew curve resulting from skew variation in homogeneous material.

    The second part of the memoir provides the minimum of illustra
tion, which the author considers absolutely necessary, in order to
demonstrate that the generalised curves reached are capable of the
widest application to every variety of practical statistics.                    The
illustrations show that from the slight amount of skewness usually
neglected by statisticians — although of vital import when we come
to consider variation with growth, as in statistics of child-variation
with growth — even to extreme cases in which the curve is asymptotic
to the ordinate of maximum frequency, a good fitting generalised
frequency curve can be found. Although the number of illustrations
is considerable, and is only a part of the author's material, y6t he
hesitates at present to make any dogmatic statements with regard to
the relations of skewness in variation to secular evolution ; but he
believes that the persistent recurrence of certain types of curves in
zoometry and of certain directions of skewness in anthropometric
 statistics will be found, as sufficient material accumulates, to justify
 broad generalisations, although at present they can only be treated as
 suggestions for further investigation.

III. "   On the Distribution of Assimilated Iron Compounds,

       Vegetable Cells. Preliminary Communication."                     By A. B.
       Macallum, Associate-Professor of Physiology, University
       of Toronto. Communicated by Professor M. Fost¦r, Sec.
       B..S.    Received December 3, 1894.
   The question of the presence of             iron in the chromatin of animal
and vegetable cells and the methods            of demonstrating the element in
this substance were discussed in a communication to the Royal
Society made more than three years ago.*                     Since then I have
endeavoured to determine with perfected methods the distribution of
assimilated iron compounds in cells of all classes, and have succeeded
in obtaining results of which the present communication is an ex
ceedingly condensed and preliminary account. A fall account will
be published elsewhere.
   The methods adopted were such as prevented a confusion of the
iron of inorganic and albuminate combinations with that of as
similated compounds.            The reagent which proved to be of the
greatest   service  was   freshly   prepared ammonium hydrogen sulphide
made from a solution of ammonia of 0.96 specific gravity, and
applied, mixed with glycerine, to the isolated cells in the way
already described.         Sulphuric, hydrochloric, and nitric acids, dis
solved in certain proportions in alcohol of 95 per cent, strength,
have been found to liberate the iron of assimilated compounds, but
the results obtained with these acids were, in all cases where this
 was possible, controlled by experiments with the sulphide reagent.
The iron liberated was readily demonstrated in the form of ferrous
 sulphide or of the Prussian-blue compound.
   The fact that the iron of coagulated haemoglobin is unaffected by
 ammonium hydrogen sulphide enables one to overcome the diffi
 culties presented by the presence of that colouring matter in many
 animal forms.      The iron of haematin is, however, liberated by that
 reagent, but the rapidity with which this is done, under the most
 ordinary conditions, may be employed to distinguish                 the iron so
 derived from that of other organic compounds. Whether chlorophyll
 contains iron as a constituent of its molecule is still a matter of dispute,
 but the presence of that colouring matter in vegetable cells does not
 complicate the results, since in the hardening processes, especially
 when alcohol is nsed, it may be wholly removed from vegetable tissues,
 which then, so far as the distribution of " masked " iron is con-

cerned, give no evidence of         anything different from what obtains in
Monotropa uniflora and Corallorhiza multiflora — phanerogamous plants
destitute of chlorophyll.
   Some of the more important facts ascertained in the investigation
may be thus briefly stated : —
   1. Iron, firmly combined, is a constant constituent of animal and
vegetable chromatin.           Another compound, less rich in iron, is found
in nucleoli.
   2. The chromophilous substance in ferment-forming cells contains
iron, and the cytoplasm of Protozoan organisms, which also probably
secretes ferments, yields evidence of the presence of a firmly combined
iron compound.
   3. A firm compound of iron is present in the chromophilous sub
stance of the cytoplasm of Fungi.
   4. Of the non-nucleated organisms, Bacteria,                 owing to their
minuteness, have, with one exception, given little evidence of the
presence of an organic iron compound ; but in the Cyanophyceie the

chromophilous portions of the central substance contain iron, and
iron may be also demonstrated in the peripheral granules formed of
the so-called cyanophycin         (Palla).

but it soon became apparent that the nitrogen was contaminated.

The " inert and inodorous        gas attacked vigorously the mercury of
the Topler pump, and was described as smelling like a dead rat. As
to the weight, it proved to be in excess even of the weight of atmos
pheric nitrogen.
   The corrosion of the mercury and the evil smell were in great
degree obviated by passing the gas over hot metals.         For the fillings
of June 6, 9, and 13 the gas passed through a short length of tube
containing copper in the form of fine wire heated by a flat Bunsen
burner, then through the furnace over red-hot iron, and back over
copper oxide.     On June 19 the furnace tubes were omitted, the gas
 being treated with the red-hot copper only. The mean result, re
duced so as to correspond with those above quoted, is 2 2985.
    Without using heat, it has not been found possible to prevent the
corrosion of the mercury.       Even when no urea is employed, and air
simply bubbled through the hypobromite solution is allowed to pass
with constant shaking over mercury contained in a \J tube, the snr-
face of the metal was soon fouled.
    Although the results relating to urea nitrogen are interesting for
comparison with that obtained from other nitrogen compounds, the
 original object was not attained on account of the necessity of retain
 ing the treatment with hot metals. We have found, however, that
 nitrogen from ammonium nitrite may be prepared without the em
 ployment of hot tubes, whose weight agrees with that above quoted.
 It is true that the gas smells slightly of ammonia, easily removable
 by sulphuric acid, and apparently also of oxides of nitrogen. The
 mean result from three fillings is 2-2987.
    It will be seen that, in spite of the slight nitrous smell, there is no
 appreciable difference in the densities of gas prepared from ammonium
 nitrite with and without the treatment by hot metals. The result is
 interesting- as showing that the agreement of numbers obtained for

    The five results obtained      in more or less distinct ways for chemical
nitrogen     stand thus : —

    These    numbers, as well as those above quoted for " atmospheric
nitrogen/' are subject to a deduction of O0006 for the shrinkage of-
the globe when exhausted.*            If they are then multiplied in the ratio
of 2-3108 : 1"2572, they will express the weights of the gas in grams
per litre.      Thus, as regards the mean numbers, we find as the weight
per litre under standard conditions of chemical nitrogen 1"2505, that
of atmospheric       nitrogen being 1 2572.
    It is of interest to compare the density of nitrogen obtained from
chemical compounds with that of oxygen.                     We have           : Oa =
2-2984 : 2-6276 = 0 87471 ; so that if Oa = 16, Na = 13 9954.                    Thus,
when the comparison is with chemical nitrogen, the ratio is very
nearly that of 16 : 14 ; but if
                                      " atmospheric nitrogen " be substituted,
the ratio of small integers is widely departed from.
    To the above list may be added nitrogen prepared in yet another
manner, whose weight has been determined subsequently to the isola
tion of the new dense constituent of the atmosphere.                    In this case
nitrogen      was   actually  extracted    from   air   by means   of    magnesium.
 The nitrogen thus separated was then converted into ammonia by
action of water upon the magnesium nitride and afterwards liberated
in the free state by means of calcium hypochlorite.               The purification
 was conducted in the usual way. and included passage over red-hot
 copper and copper oxide.          The following was the result : —

 of its history formed part of the atmosphere.

that previously mentioned, inasmuch as it had not been subjected to
treatment with red-hot copper. After treating the nitride with water,
the remltinsf ammonia was distilled off, and collected in hydrochloric
acid; the solution was evaporated by degrees, the dry ammonium
chloride was dissolved in water, and its concentrated solution added
to a freshly-prepared solution of sodium hypobromite.       The nitrogen
was collected   in a  gas-holder over water   which had previously been
boiled, so as, at all events partially, to expel air.      The nitrogen
passed into the vacuous globe through a solution of potassium hydr

the other phosphoric anhydride.

    Experiments were also made, which had for their object to prove
that the ammonia produced from the magnesium nitride is identical
with ordinary ammonia, and contains no other compound of a basic
character.     For this purpose the ammonia was converted into
ammonium     chloride,  and the percentage of chlorine determined by
titration with a solution of silver nitrate which had been standardised
by titrating a specimen of pure sublimed ammonium chloride.             Tho
silver solution was of such a strength that 1 c.c. precipitated the
chlorine from 0.001701 gram of ammonium chloride.
    1. Ammonium chloride from orange-coloured sample of magnesium
nitride contained 66-35 per cent. of chlorine.
    2. Ammonium chloride from blackish magnesium nitride contained
 66.35 per cent, of chlorine.
    3. Ammonium chloride from nitride containing a large amount of
unattacked magnesium contained 66.30 per cent. of chlorine.
    Taking for the atomic weights of hydrogen H = 1"0032, of nitrogen
 N = 14"04, and of chlorine CI = 35.46, the theoretical amount of
 chlorine in ammonium chloride is 66.27 per cent.

   II.  Reasons fur suspecting a Jiitherto Undiscovered Constituent in Air.
    When the discrepancy of weights was first encountered, attempts
were     naturally made to explain it by contamination with known
impurities.      Of these the most likely appeared to be hydrogen,
present in the lighter gas in spite of the passage over red-hot cupric
oxide.     But inasmuch as the intentional introduction of hydrogen
into the heavier gas, afterwards treated in the same way with cupric
oxide, had no effect upon its weight, this explanation had to be
abandoned, and finally it became clear that the difference could not
be accounted for by the presence of any known impurity.                      At this
stase it seemed not improbable that the lightness of the gas ex
tracted from chemical compounds was to be explained by partial
dissociation of nitrogen molecules N2 into detached atoms.                  In order
to test this suggestion both kinds of gas were submitted to the action
of the silent electric discharge, with the result that both retained
their weights    unaltered.      This was discouraging, and a further ex
periment pointed     still more   markedly in the negative direction.           The
chemical behaviour of nitrogen is such as to suggest that dissociated
atoms would possess a high degree of activity, and that even though
they might be formed in the first instance their life would probably
be short.     On standing they might be expected to disappear, in
partial analogy with the known behaviour of ozone.                  With this idea
in view, a sample of chemically prepared nitrogen was stored for
eight months.       But at the end of this time the density showed no
sign   of increase, remaining exactly as at first.*
    Regarding it as established that one or other of the gases must be
a mixture, containing, as the case might be, an ingredient                     much
heavier or much lighter than ordinary¦ nitrogen, we had to consider
the relative probabilities       of the various possible interpretations.
Except upon the already discredited hypothesis of dissociation, it
was difficult to see how the gas of chemical origin could be a mixture.
To suppose this would be to admit two kinds of nitric acid, hardly
reconcilable with the work of Stas and others upon the atomic
weight of that substance. The simplest explanation in many respects
was to admit the existence of a second ingredient in air from which
oxygen, moisture, and carbonic anhydride had already been removed.
The proportional amount required was not great.                   If the density of
the supposed gas were double that of nitrogen,                  \ per cent. only by
volume would be needed ; or if the density were but half as much
again as that of nitrogen, then 1 per cent. would still suffice.              But in

  accepting this explanation, even provisionally, we had to face the
  improbability that a gas surrounding us on all sidi-s, and present in
 enormous quantities, could have remained so long unsuspected.
      The method of most universal application by which to test whether
  a gas is pure or a mixture of components of different densities is that
  of diffusion. By this means Graham succeeded in effecting a partial
 separation of the nitrogen and oxygen of tho air, in spite of the com
 paratively small difference of densities.               If the atmosphere contain
 an unknown gas of anything like the density supposed, it should be
 possible to prove the fact by operations conducted upon air which had
 undergone atmolysis.           This experiment, although in view from the
 first, was not executed until a later stage of the inquiry (§ VI), when
 results were obtained sufficient of themselves to prove that the atmos
 phere contains a previously unknown gas.
     But although the method of diffusion was capable of deciding the
main, or at any rate the first question, it held out no prospect of
 isolating the new constituent of the atmosphere, and we, therefore,
turned our attention in the first instance to the consideration of
methods more strictly chemical.                And here the question forced itself
upon us as to what really was the evidence in favour of the prevalent
doctrine that the inert residue from air after withdrawal of oxygeu,
water, and carbonic anhydride, is all of one kind.
    The identification of " phlogisticated air" with the constituent of
nitric acid is due to Cavendish, whose method consisted in operating
with electric sparks upon a short column of gas confined with potash
over mercury at the upper end of an inverted [J tube.*
    Attempts to repeat Cavendish's experiment in Cavendish's manner
have only increased the admiration with which we regard this won
derful investigation.         Working on almost microscopical quantities of
material, and by operations extending over days and weeks, he thus
established one of the most important facts in chemistry.                   And what
is still more to the purpose, he raises as distinctly as we could do, and
to a certain extent resolves, the question above suggested.                        The
passage is so important that it will be desirable to quote it at foil
length.
    " As far as the
                        experiments hitherto published extend, we scarcely
know more of the phlogisticated part of our atmosphere, than tnat it
is not diminished by lime-water, caustic alkalies, or nitrous air ; that
it is unfit to support fire, or maintain life in animals; and that its
specific gravity is not much less than that of common air : so that

was reasonable      to suppose, that        part at least of the phlogisticated air
of the  atmosphere consists of this acid united to phlogiston, yet it
was fairly to be doubted whether the whole is of this kind, or
whether there are not in reality many different substances          com
pounded together by us under the name of phlogisticated air.                       I
therefore made an experiment to determine whether the whole of a
given portion of the phlogisticated air of the atmosphere could be
reduced to nitrous acid, or whether there was not a part of a different
nature to the rest, which would refuse to undergo that change.       The
foregoing experiments indeed in some measure decided this point, as
much the greatest part of the air let up into the tube lost its elas
ticity; yet as some remained unabsorbed it did not appear for certain
whether that was of the same nature as the rest or not. For this
purpose I diminished a similar mixture of dephlogisticated and
common air, in the same manner as before, till it was reduced to a
small part of its original bulk.             I
                                      then, in order to decompound as
much as I could of the phlogisticated air which remained in the tube,
added some dephlogisticated air to         and continued the spark until
                                                     it,
no further diminution took place.      Having by these means condensed
as much as   I could of the phlogisticated air,     let up some solution
                                                                I

onlya   small bubble of air remained unabsorbed, which certainly was
not more than         of the bulk of the phlogisticated air let up into

                                     is
atmosphere which differs from the rest, and cannot be reduced to
nitrous acid, we may safely conclude that           not more than
                                                            it   is   5th    T-J
part of the whole."
   Although Cavendish was satisfied with his result, and does not
decide whether the small residue was genuine, our experiments about
to be related render    itnot improbable that his residue was really of a
different kind from the main bulk of the " phlogisticated air," and
contained the gas now called argon.

Besides these, a mixture of barium carbonate and carbon at a high
temperature is known to be effective. Of those tried, magnesium in
the form of turnings was found to be the best. When nitrogen
is passed over magnesium, heated in a tube of hard glass to bright
redness, combustion with incandescence begins at the end of the tube
through which the gas is introduced, and proceeds regularly until
all the metal has been converted into nitride. Between 7 and 8 litres
of nitrogen can be absorbed in a single tube; the nitride formed is a
porous, dirty orange-coloured substance.
      IV. Early   Experiments on Sparking Nitrogen with Oxygen    in
                            presence of  Alkali.
    In our earliest attempts to isolate the suspected gas by the method
of Cavendish, we used a Ruhmkorff coil of medium size actuated by
a battery of five Grove cells.     The gases were contained in a test-
tube standing over a large quantity of weak alkali, and the current
was conveyed in wires insulated by U-shaped glass tubes passing
through the liquid round the mouth of the test-tube. With the giveD
battery and coil a somewhat short spark or arc of about 5 mm. was
found to be more favourable than a longer one. When the mixed
gases were in the right proportion the rate of absorption was about
30 c.c. per hour, or thirty times as fast as Cavendish could work with
the electrical machine of his day.
    To take an example, one experiment of this kind started with
50 c.c. of air.    To this oxygen was gradually added until, oxygen
being in excess, there was no perceptible contraction during an hour's
sparking.     The remaining gas was then transferred at the pneumatic
trough to a small measuring vessel, sealed by mercury, in which the
volume was found to be 1"0 c.c. On treatment with alkaline pyrn-
gallate, the gas shrank to 0 .32 c.c. That this small residue could
not be nitrogen was argued from the fact that it had withstood the
prolonged action of the spark, although mixed with oxygen in nearly
 the most favourable proportion.
     The residue was then transferred to the test-tube with an addition
 of another 50 c.c. of air, and the whole worked up with oxygen as
 before.   The residue w0as now 2-2 c.c., and, after removal of oxygen,
0-76 c.c.
    Although it seemed almost impossible that these residues could be
 either nitrogen or hydrogen, some anxiety was not unnatural, seeing
 that the final sparking took place under somewhat abnormal condi
 tions. The space was very restricted, and the temperature (and with
 it the proportion of aqueous vapour) was unduly high. But any
 doubts that were felt upon this score were removed by comparison
 experiments in which the whole quantity of air operated on was very

 1895.]       Argon, a new Constituent of the Atmosphere.             273
 small.   Thus, when a mixture of 5 c.c. of air with 7 c.c. of oxygen
 was sparked for 1^ hours, the residue was 0"47 c.c., and after removal
of oxygen 0-06 c.c.     Several repetitions having given similar results,
it became   clear that the final residue did not depend upon anything
that might    happen when sparks passed through a greatly reduced
 volume, btit was in proportion to the amount of air operated upon.
   No satisfactory examination of the residue which refused to be
oxidised could be made without the accumulation of a larger quantity.
This, however, was difficult of attainment at the time in question.
It was thought that the cause probably lay in the solubility of the gas
in water, a suspicion since confirmed.       At length, however, a suffi
ciency was collected to allow of sparking in a specially constructed
tube, when a comparison with the air spectrum, taken under similar
conditions, proved that, at any rate, the gas was not nitrogen.        At
first scarcely a trace of the principal nitrogen lines could be seen, but
after standing over water for an hour or two these lines became
apparent.

                          of  Red-hot Magnesium.

allowed to remain in contact with the metal, gave a residue of density
1488.    This result, although not conclusive, was encouraging ; and
an attempt was made,       on a larger scale, by passing atmospheric
nitrogen backwards and forwards over red-hot magnesium from one
large gas-holder to another to obtain a considerable quantity of the
heavier gas.    In the course of ten days, about 1500 c.c. were collected
and transferred gradually to a mercury gas-holder, from which the
gas was passed over soda-lime, phosphoric anhydride, magnesium at
a red heat, copper oxide, soda-lime, and phosphoric anhydride        into
a second mercury gas-holder.       After some days the gas was reduced
in volume to about 200 c.c., and its density was found to be 16"1.
After further absorption, in which the volume was still further re
duced, the density of the residue was increased to 19-09.
   On pa ssing sparks for several hours through a mixture of a small
quantity of this gas with oxygen, its volume was still further reduced.
Assuming that this reduction was due to the further elimination of
nitrogen, the density of the remaining gas was calculated to be 20-0.
   The spectrum of the gas of density 19-09, though showing nitrogen
hands, showed many other lines which were not recognisable as
belonging to any known element.

     VI. Proof of the  Presence of Argon in Air by means of Atmolysis.
   It has                                       "
          already (§ II) been suggested that if atmospheric nitrogen"
contains two gases of different densities, it should be possible to
obtain direct evidence of the fact by the method of atmolysis. The
present section contains an account of carefully conducted experi
ments directed to this end.
   The atmolyser was prepared (after Graham) by combining a num
ber of "churchwarden" tobacco pipes. At first twelve pipes were
used in three groups, each group including four pipes connected in
series.   The three groups were then connected in parallel, and placed
in a large glass tube closed in such a way that a partial vacuum
could be maintained in the space outside the pipes by a water
pump. One end of the combination of pipes was open to the
atmosphere ; the other end was connected to a bottle aspirator, in
itially full of water, and so arranged as to draw about 2 percent,
of the air which entered the other end of the pipes. The gas col
lected was thus a very small proportion of that which leaked
through the pores of the pipes, and should be relatively rich in
the heavier constituents of the atmosphere.         The flow of water
from the aspirator could not be maintained very constant, bnt the
rate of 2 per cent. was never much exceeded.
   The air thus obtained was treated exactly as ordinary air had
been treated in determinations of the density of atmospheric nitro
gen.    Oxygen was removed by red-hot copper, followed by cupric
oxide, ammonia by sulphuric acid, moisture and carbonic acid by
potash and phosphoric anhydride.
   In a total weight of approximately 2-3 grams the excess of weight
of the diffused nitrogen over ordinary atmospheric nitrogen was in
four experiments, O0049, 0"OOU, 0-0027, 0 0015.
   The mean excess of the four determinations is 0-00262 gram, or,
if we omit the first, which depended upon a vacuum weighing of two
months old, 0 00187 gram.
   The gas from prepared air was thus in every case denser than
from uuprepared air, and to an extent much beyond the possible
errors of experiment.      The excess was, however, less than had been
expected, and it was thought that the arrangement of the pipes
could be improved.       The final delivery of gas from each of the
groups in parallel being so small in comparison with the whole
streams concerned, it seemed possible that each group was not con
tributing its proper share, and even that there might be a flow in
the wrong direction at the delivery end of one or two of them.         Tc
meet this objection, the arrangement in parallel had to be abandoned,
and for the remaining experiments eight pipes were connected in
simple series.   The porous surface in operation was thus reduced,

 lmt tins was    partly compensated for by an improved vacuum. Two
  experiments were made under the new conditions, in which the excess
 was   I, 0 0037 ; II, 0-0033.
    The excess being larger than before is doubtless due to the greater
 efficiency of the atmolysing apparatus.      It should be mentioned that
 the above recorded experiments include all that have been tried, and
                                            "                         " is a
 the conclusion seems inevitable that         atmospheric nitrogen
 mixture, and not a simple body.
    It was hoped that the concentration of the heavier constituent
 would be sufficient to facilitate its preparation in a pure state by
 the use of prepared air in substitution         for ordinary air in the
 oxygen apparatus.      The advance of 3£ milligrams on the 11 milli
grams, by which atmospheric nitrogen is heavier than chemical
 nitrogen, is indeed not to be despised, and the use of prepared air
 would be convenient if the diffusion apparatus could be set up on
a large scale and be made thoroughly       self-acting.
    VII.  Negative Experiments to prove that Argon is not derived /;om
                       Nitrogen from Chemical Sources.
    Although the evidence of the existence of argon in the atmosphere,
derived from the comparison of densities of atmospheric and chemical
nitrogen and from the diffusion       experiments (§ VI), appeared over
whelming, we have thought it undesirable to shrink from any labour
that would tend to complete the verification.           With this object in
 view, an experiment was undertaken and carried to a conclusion on
November 13, in which 3 litres of chemical nitrogen, prepared from
ammonium nitrite, were treated with oxygen in precisely the manner
in which atmospheric nitrogen had been found to yield a residue of
argon.     The gas remaining at the close of the large scale opera
tions was worked up as usual with battery and coil until the spec-
tram showed only slight traces of the nitrogen lines.          When cold,
the residue measured 4 c.c.       This was transferred, and after treat
ment with alkaline pyrogallate to remove oxygen measured 3 3 c.c.
If atmospheric nitrogen had been employed, the final residue should
have been about 30 c.c.         Of the 3-3 c.c. actually left, a part is
 iccounted for by an accident, and the result of the experiment is to
show that argon is not formed by sparking a mixture of oxygen
and chemical nitrogen.
   In a second experiment of the same kind 5660 c.c. of nitrogen
from ammonium nitrite was treated with oxygen.            The final residue
was 3-5 c.c., and was found to consist mainly of argon.
   The source of the residual argon is to be sought in the water
used for the manipulation of the large quantities of gas (6 litres of
nitrogen and 11 litres of oxygen) employed.          When carbonic acid

276                Lord Rayleigli and Prof. Ramsay.             [Jan. 31,
was collected     in a similar manner and subsequently absorbed         by
potash,    it  was found to   have acquired a contamination    consistent
with this explanation.
    Negative experiments were also carried out, absorbing nitrogen by
means of magnesium.        In one instance 3 litres of nitrogen prepared
from ammonium chloride and bleaching-powder was reduced in
volume to 4-5 c.c., and on sparking with oxygen its volume was
further reduced to about 3 c.c. The residue appeared to consist of
argon.      Another experiment, in which 15 litres of nitrogen from
ammonium nitrite was absorbed, gave a final residue of 3-5 c.c.
Atmospheric nitrogen, in the latter case, would have yielded 150 c.c,
hence    less than -^th of the normal quantity         was obtained.     It
should be mentioned that leakage occurred at one stage, by which
perhaps 200 c.c. of air entered the apparatus ; and, besides, the nitro
gen was collected over water from which it doubtless acquired some
argon. Quantitative negative experiments of this nature are exceed
ingly difficult, and require a long time to carry them to a successful
conclusion.
                VIII.  Separation of Argon on a Large Scale.
    To prepare argon on a large scale, air is freed from oxygen by means
of red-hot copper.       The residue is then passed from a gas-holder
through a combustion-tube,        heated in a furnace, and containing
copper, in order to remove all traces of oxygen ; the issuing gas is
then dried by passage over soda-lime and phosphorus pentoxide,
after passage through a small      \J tube containing sulphuric acid, to
 indicate the rate of flow. It then enters a combustion-tube packed
 tightly with magnesium turnings, and heated to redness in a second
 furnace.     From this tube it passes through a second index-tube, and
 enters a small gas-holder capable of containing 3 or 4 litres. A single
 tube of magnesium will absorb from 7 to 8 litres of nitrogen.         The
 temperature must be nearly that of the fusion of the glass, and the
 current of gas must be carefully regulated, else the heat developed
 by the union of the magnesium with nitrogen will fuse the tube.
     Having collected the residue from 100 or 150 litres of atmospheric
 nitrogen, which may amonnt to 4 or 5 litres, it is transferred to a
  small gas-holder connected with an apparatus, whereby, by means of
 a species of a self-acting Sprengel's pump, the gas is caused to circu
  late through a tube half filled with copper and half with copper
  oxide; it then traverses a tube half filled with soda-lime and half
  with phosphorus peutoxide ; it then passes a reservoir of abont
  300 c.c. capacity, from which, by raising a mercury reservoir, it can
  be expelled into a small gas-holder.    Next it passes through a tube
  containing magnesium turnings heated to bright redness.         The   gas

 1895.]          Aryon, a new Constituent of the Atmosphere.                      277
is  thus freed     from any possible contamination with oxygen, hydrogen,
or hydrocarbons, and nitrogen is gradually absorbed.                  As the amount
of gas in the tubes and reservoir diminishes in volume, it draws sup
plies from the gas-holder, and, finally, the circulating system is full
of argon in a pure state.         The circulating system of tubes is con
nected with a mercury pump, so that, in changing the magnesium
tube,    no gas may be lost. Before ceasing to heat the magnesium
tube    the system is pumped empty, and the collected gas is restored
to the gas-holder ; finally, all the argon is transferred from the mer
cury reservoir to the second small gas-holder, which should prefer
ably be filled with water saturated with argon, so as to prevent
contamination from oxygen or nitrogen ; or, if preferred, a mercury
gas-holder may be employed.              The complete removal of nitrogen
from argon is very slow towards the end, but circulation for a couple
 of days usually effects it.
     The principal objection to the oxygen method of isolating argon,
 as hitherto described, is the extreme slowness of the operation.                   In
 extending the scale       we had  the great advantage        of   the advice of Mr.
 Crookes, who not long since called attention to the flame rising from
 platinum terminals, which convey a high tension alternating electric
 discharge, and pointed out its dependence upon combustion of the
 nitrogen and oxygen of the air.* The plant consists of a De Meritena
 alternator, actuated by a gas engine, and the currents are tranformed to
 a high potential by means of a Ruhmkorff or other suitable induction
 c0l. The highest rate of absorption of the mixed gases yet attained is
 3 litres per hour, about 3000 times that of Cavendish.                It is necessary
 to keep the apparatus cool, and from this and other causes a good
 many     difficulties have been encountered.
     In one experiment of this kind, the total air led in after seven days'
 working, amounted to 7925 c.c., and of oxygen (prepared from
 chlorate of potash), 9 1 37 c.c.       On the eighth and ninth days oxygen
 alone was      added,  of which  about    500 c.c. was consumed, while there
  remained about 700 c.c. in the flask.          Hence the proportion in which
  the air and oxygen combined was as 79 : 96.                 The progress of the
  removal of the nitrogen        was   examined     from   time     to time with the
  spectroscope, and became ultimately very slow.                 At last the yellow
  line disappeared, the contraction having apparently stopped for two
  hours,     ft is worthy of notice that with the removal of the nitrogen,
  the  arc discharge changes greatly        in appearance, becoming narrower
  and   blue rather than greenish     in colour.
      The final treatment of the residual 700 c.c. of gas was on the model
  of the   small scale operations already described. Oxygen or hydrogen
  could be     supplied at pleasure from an electrolytic apparatus, but in
   no  way could the volume be reduced be!ow 65 c.c.                     This residue

  refused oxidation, and showed no trace of the yellow line of nitrogen,
  even under favourable conditions.
     When the gas stood for some days over water, the nitrogen line
 reasserted itself in the spectrum, and many hours' sparking with a
 little oxygen was required again to get rid of it. Intentional addi
 tions of air to gas free from nitrogen showed that about 1| per cent.
 was clearly, and about 3 per cent. was conspicuously, visible. About
 the same numbers apply to the visibility of nitrogen in oxygen when
 sparked under these conditions, that is, at atmospheric pressure, and
 with a jar connected to the secondary terminals.
            IX.   Density of Argon prepared    by means of Oxygen.
    A first  estimate of the density of argon prepared by the oxygen
 method was founded upon the data already recorded respecting the
 volume present in air, on the assumption that the accurately known
 densities of atmospheric and of chemical nitrogen differ on aconnt
 of the presence of argon in the former, and that during the treat
ment with oxygen nothing is oxidised except nitrogen.         Thus, if
    D = density of chemical nitrogen,
    D' =        „      atmospheric nitrogen,
    d =         „      argon,
    a = proportional volume of argon in atmospheric nitrogen,
the law of mixtures gives
                               <w*+(l-a)D = D',
or                             d = D + (D'-D)/«.
    In this formula D' — D and     a are both small,  but they are known
with fair accuracy.      From the data already given
                                   0 79x 7925'
whence     if (on  an  arbitrary scale of reckoning) D = 2-2990, D' =
2-3102, we find d    = 3378. Thus if N, be 14, or O, be 16, the density
of argon is 20-6.
    A direct determination by weighing is desirable, but hitherto it has
not been feasible to collect by this means sufficient to fill the large
globe employed for other gases. A mixture of about 400 c.c. of argon
with pure oxygen, however, gave the weight 2-7315, 0-1045 in ex
cess of the weight of oxygen, viz., 2-6270.         Thus, if a be the rntio
of the volume of argon to the whole volume, the number for argon
will  be
                              2-6270 + 0-1045/a.

    The value  of «, being involved only in the excess of weight above
 that of oxygen, does not require to be known very accurately.         Suffi
 ciently concordant    analyses by   two methods  gave  a =  01845  ; whence
 for the weight of the gas we get 3- 193, so that, if O8 = 16, the density
 of the gas would be 19"45.       An allowance for residual nitrogen, still
visible in the gas before admixture of oxygen, raises this number to
 197, which may be taken as the density of pure argou resulting from
this determination.
          X . Density of Argon prepared      by means of Magnesium.
   The density of the original sample of argon prepared has already
been   mentioned.     It was 19.09 ; and, after sparking with oxygen, it
was   calculated to be 20-0. The most reliable results of a number of
determinations give it as 19-90. The difficulty in accurately deter
mining the density is to make sure that all nitrogen has been
removed.      The sample of density 19-90 showed no spectrum of nitro
gen when examined in a vacuum tube.                It is right, however, to
remark that the highest density registered was 2038.            But there is
some reason here to distrust the weighing of the vacuous globe.
                          XI.    Spectrum of Argon.
   The spectrum      of argon, seen in a vacuum tube of about 3 mm.
pressure, consists of a great number of lines, distributed over almost
the whole visible field.      Two lines are specially characteristic ; they
are less refrangible than the red lines of hydrogen or lithium, and
serve well to identify the gas, when examined in this way.               Mr.
Crookes, who     will give  a  full account of the spectrum in a separate
communication, has kindly furnished us with the accurate wave
lengths of these lines, as well as of some others next to be described ;
they are respectively     696"56 and 705 64, 10-c mm.
   Besides these red lines, a     bright yellow line, more refrangible than
the   sodium line, occurs at 603 84.          A group of five bright green
lines occurs next, besides a number of k ss intensity.         Of the group
of five, the second, which is perhaps the most brilliant, has the wave
length 56100.       There is next a blue or blue-violet line of wave
length 470 2 ; and last, in the less easily visible part of the spectrum,
there are five strong vioiet lines, of which the fourth, which is the
most brilliant, has the wave-length 420"0.
    Unfortunately, the red lines, which are not to be mistaken for
those of any other substance, are not easily seen when a jar discharge
is passed through argon at atmospheric pressure, unless a large jar
and a very powerful current be employed.               The spectrum seen
nnder these conditions has been examined by Professor Schuster.
 The most characteristic lines are perhaps those in the neighbourhood

     It is necessary to anticipitate Mr. Crookes' communication, and to
  state that when the current is passed from the induction coil in one
  direction, that end of the capillary tube next the positive pole appears of
 a redder, and that next the negative pole of a bluer hue.                There are,
 in effect, two spectra, which Mr. Crookes has succeeded in separating
 to a considerable extent. Mr. B. C. C. Baly,* who has noticed a similar
 phenomenon, attributes it to the presence of two gases. He says :—
 " W hen an electric current is passed through a mixture of two
                                                                              gases,
 one is separated from the other and appears in the negative glow."
 The conclusion would follow that what we have termed " argon " is
 in reality a mixture of two gases which have as yet not been sepa
rated. This conclusion, if true, is of great importance, and experi
 ments are now in progress to test it by the use of other physical
 methods.     The full bearing of this possibility will appear later.
     The presence of a small quantity of nitrogen interferes greatly
 with the argon spectrum. But we have found that in a tube with
 platinum electrodes, after the discharge has been passed for four
 hours, the spectrum of nitrogen disappears, and the argon spectrum
 manifests itself in full purity. A specially constructed tube with
magnesium electrodes, which we hoped would yield good results, re
moved all traces of nitrogen, it is true ; but hydrogen was evolved
from the magnesinm, and showed its characteristic                       lines very
strongly.     However,    these   are easily    identified.     The gas evolved on
heating magnesium in vacuo, as proved by a separate experiment,
consists entirely of hydrogen.
    Mr. Crookes has established the identity of the chief lines of the
spectrum of gas separated from air-nitrogen by aid of magnesium
with that remaining after sparking the air-nitrogen with oxygen in
presence of caustic soda solution.
    Professor Schuster also has found the principal lines identical in
t he spectra of the two gases,        as observed by the jar discharge at
atmospheric pressure.

                       XII.    Solubility of Argon in Water.
    Determinations of the solubility in water of argon, prepared by
 sparking, gave 3-94 volumes per 100 of water at 12°.                The solubility
 of gas prepared by means of magnesium was found to be 4-05 volumes
 per 100 at 13-9°.       The gas is therefore about 2^ times as soluble as
nitrogen, and possesses approximately the same solubility as oxygen.
    The fact that argon is more soluble than nitrogen would lead us to
expect it in increased proportion in the dissolved gases of rain water.
Experiment has confirmed this anticipation.                 "Nitrogen" prepared
from the dissolved gases of water supplied from a rain-water cistern
was weighed upon two occasions.                 The weights, corresponding to
those recorded in § I, were 2 3221 and 2-3227, showing an excess of
2i milligrams above the weight of true nitrogen.                  Since the corre

conclude that the water            nitrogen    is relatively more than twice as
rich in argon.
    On the other hand, gas evolved from the hot spring at Bath, and
collected for us by Dr. A. Richardson, gave a residue after removal
of oiygen and carbonic acid, whose weight was only about midway
between that of true and atmospheric nitrogen.
                    XIII.    Behaviour at Low Temperatures.*
   Preliminary experiments, carried out to liquefy argon at a pressure
of about 100 atmospheres, and at a temperature of — 90°, failed.                No
appearance of liquefaction conld be observed.
   Professor Charles Olszewski, of Cracow, the well-known authority

to make experiments on the liquefaction of argon.                  His results are
embodied in a separate communication, but it is allowable to state
here that the gas has a lower critical temperature ( — 121°) and a
lower boiling point ( — 187°) than oxygen, and that he has succeeded
in solidifying argon to white crystals, meltiDg at — 189-6°.              The den
sity of the liquid is approximately             1"5, that   of oxygen being V124,
and of nitrogen 0"885.          The sample of gas he experimented with was
exceptionally pure, and had been prepared by help of magnesium. It
showed no trace of nitrogen when examined in a vacuum tube.

   In order to decide regarding           the elementary or compound nature
of argon,    experiments were made          on the velocity of sound in it. It
will   be   remembered that, from the velocity of sound in a gas, the

i-atio of specific heat at constant pressure to that at constant volume
can be deduced by means of the equation
when n is the frequency, X the wave-length of sound, v its velocity,
e the isothermal elasticity, d the density, (1+a.t) the temperature cor
rection, Cp the specific heat at constant pressure, and C, that at constant
volume. In comparing two gases at the same temperature, each of
which obeys Boyle's law with sufficient approximation, and in using
the same sound, many of these factors disappear, and the ratio of
specific heats of one gas may be deduced from that of the other, if
 known, by means of the proportion
                                   : \'2d' :: 1"41    :  x,
where, for example, X and d refer to air, of which the ratio is 1.41,
according to observations by ROntgen, Wiillner, Kayser, and Jamin
and   Richard.
    Two completely different series of observations, one in a tube of
about 2 mm. diameter, and one in one of 8 mm., made with entirely
different samples       of gas, gave, the first,      1"65   as the ratio, and, the
second, 1-61.
    Experiments      made with the first tube, to test the accuracy of its
working, gave      for  carbon dioxide the ratio 1"276, instead of 1.288, the
mean of all previous determinations ; and the half wave-length of
sound in hydrogen was found to be 73.6, instead of 74-5, the mean of
 those previously found.        The ratio of the specific heats of hydrogen
found was V39, instead of 1.402.
    There can be no doubt, therefore, that argon gives practically the
 ratio of specific heats, viz., 1.66, proper to a gas in which all the
 energy is translational.      The only other gas which has been found to
 behave similarly     is mercury gas, at a high temperature.*
               XV.   Attempts    to induce    Chemical Combination.
    Many attempts to induce argon to combine will be described in full
 in the complete paper. Suffice it to say here, that all such atteinptri
 have as yet proved abortive. Argon does not combine with oxygen
 in presence of alkali under the influence of the electric discharge,
 nor with hydrogen in presence of acid or alkali also when sparked;
 nor with chlorine, dry or moist, when sparked ; nor with phosphorus
 at a bright- red heat, nor with sulphur at bright redness.                Tellurium
 may   be distilled   in a current    of  the  gas  ;   so  may sodium    and   potas

                               XVT. General Conclusions.
     Itremains, finally, to discuss the probable nature of the gas, or
mixture of gases, which we have succeeded             in separating from
atmospheric   air, and  which  has been  provisionally named argon.
   The presence of argon in the atmosphere           proved by many lines
                                                         is
 of evidence.    The  higher density    of " atmospheric nitrogen," and
the uniformity in the density of samples of chemical nitrogen pre
pared from different compounds, lead to the conclusion that the cause
of the anomaly        the presence of a heavy gas in air.
                          is                                   If that gas
                                                      "
possess the density 20 compared with hydrogen,          atmospheric nitro
     " should contain of                                       This is, in
gen                             approximately
                                    it             per cent.
                                                     1
fact, found to be the case.     Moreover, as nitrogen       removed from
                                                                   is
air by means of red-hot magnesium, the density of the remaining
gas rises proportionately    to the concentration of the heavier con
stituent.
     Second.       This gas has been concentrated in the atmosphere by diffu
sion.      It true that
                is        cannot be freed from oxygen and nitrogen
                               it
 by diffusion, but the process of diffusion increases, relatively to
nitrogen, the amount of argon in that portion which does not pass
through the porous walls.    This has been proved by its increase in
density.
     Third.        As the solubility of argon in waterrelatively high,
                                                              is
it   is                that the density of the mixture of argon and
          to be expected
nitrogen, pumped out of water along with oxygen, should, after
the removal of the oxygen, exceed that of "atmospheric       nitrogen."
Experiment has shown that the density           is
                                           considerably increased.
   Fourth. It    in the highest degree improbable that two processes,
                     is
so different from each other, should manufacture   the same product.
The explanation    simple is be granted th it these processes merely
                                     it
                                    if
eliminate nitrogen from an atmosph-ric mixture.     Moreover, if, as
                                                                        x   2

appears probable, argon be an element, or a mixture of elements, its
manufacture would mean its separation from one of the substances
employed.    The gas which can be removed from red-hot magnesium
in a vacuum has been found to be wholly hydrogen. Nitrogen from
chemical sources has been practically all absorbed by magnesium, and
also when sparked in presence of oxygen ; hence fu-gon cannot have
resulted from the decomposition of nitrogen. That it is not produced
from oxygen is sufficiently borne out by its preparation by means of
magnesium.
   Other arguments could be adduced, but the above are sufficient to
justify the conclusion that argon is present in the atmosphere.
   The identity of the leading lines in the spectrum, the similar solu
bility and the similar density, appear to prove the identity of the
argon prepared by both processes.
   That argon is an element, or a mixture of elements, may be
inferred from the observations of § XIV. For Clausins has shown
that if K be the energy of translatory motion of the molecules of a
gas, and H their whole kinetic energy, then

at constant volume respectively.    Hence            if,

and for argon      XIV), the ratio of specific heats

                                                                      :                it
follows that K  = H, or that the whole kinetic energy of the gas                        is
accounted for by the translatory motion of its molecules. In the case
of mercury the absence of interatomic energy       regarded as proof
                                                           is                           of
the monatomic character of     the vapour, and the conclusion holds
equally good for argrm.
   The only alternative     to suppose that
                             is                    argon molecules are di-
                                                    if
or polyatomic,  the  atoms  acquire  no  relative  motion, even of rotation,
a conclusion improbable in itself and one postulating the sphericity
of such complex groups of atoms.
   Now a monatomic gas can be only an element, or                 mixture of
                                                                          a
elements; and hence it follows that argon        not of a compound nature.
                                                  is

          ;                                  isapproximately 20, hence its
molecular weight must be 40. But its molecule              identical with its
                                                                is

the atomic weights of that mixture, taken for the proportion in which
they are present, must be 40.

and a     definite critical temperature and pressure ; and because on
compressing the gas in presence of its liquid, pressure remains sen
sibly constant until all gas has condensed to liquid. The latter
experiments are the well-known criteria of a pure sabstance ; the
former is not known with certainty to be characteristic of a mixture.
The conclusions which follow are, however, so startling, that in our
fature experimental work we shall endeavour to decide the question
by other means.
    For the present, however, the balance of evidence seems to point
to simplicity.     We have therefore to discuss the relations to other
elements of an element of atomic weight 40.          We inclined for long
to the view that argon was possibly one or more than one of the
elements which might be expected to follow fluorine in the periodic
classification of the elements — elements which should have an atomic
weight between 19, that of fluorine, and 23, that of sodium.             Bnt
this view is apparently put out of court by the discovery of the mon-
                                                      *
atornic nature of its molecules.
   The series of elements possessing atomic weights near 40 are : —
                          Chlorine .              355
                          Potassium               391
                          Calcium .               40-0
                          Scandium.               440
   There     can be no doubt that potassium, calcium, and scandium
follow legitimately their predecessors in the vertical columns, lithium,
beryllium, and boron, and that they are in almost certain relation
with rubidium, strontium, and (but not so certainly) yttrinm.              If
argon    be a single element, then there is reason to doubt whether
the   periodic classification of the elements is complete ; whether,
in fact,    elements may not exist which cannot be fitted among
those of which it is composed.          On the other hand, if argon be a
mixture of two elements, they might find place in the eighth
group, one after chlorine and one after bromine.         Assuming 37 (the
approximate mean between the atomic weights of chlorine and
potassium) to be the atomic weight of the lighter element, and 40
 the mean atomic weight found, and supposing that the second element
 has an atomic weight between those of bromine, 80, and rubidium,
 85'5, viz., 82, the mixture should consist of 93-3 per cent, of the lighter,
 and 6'7 per cent, of the heavier element.      But it appears improbable
 that such a   high percentage as 6 7 of a heavier element should have
 escaped   detection   during liquefaction.
    If it be supposed that argon belongs to the eighth group, then its
 properties would fit fairly well with what might be anticipated.        For

 might be expected to end with an element of monatomic molecules,
 of no valency, i.e., incapable of forming a compound, or if forming one,
 being an octad ; and it would form a possible transition to potassium,
 with its monovalence, on the other hand. Such conceptions are,
 however, of a speculative nature ; yet they may be perhaps excused,
 if they in any way      lead to experiments which tend to throw more
 light on the anomalies of this curious element.
     In conclusion, it need excite no astonishment that argon is so in
 different to reagents. For mercury, although a monatomic element,
 forms compounds which are by no means stable at a high temperature
 in the gaseous state ; and attempts to produce compounds of argon
 may be likened to attempts to cause combination between mercury
 gas at 800° and other elements.         As for the physical condition of
argon,   that  of a gas, we  possess  no  knowledge why carbon, with its
low atomic weight, should be a solid, while nitrogen is a gas, except
in so far as we ascribe molecular complexity to the former and com
parative molecular simplicity to the latter.         Argon, with its com
paratively low density and its molecular simplicity, might well be
expected to rank among the gases.            And its inertness, which has
suggested     its name,  sufficiently explains why it has not previously
been discovered as a constituent of compound bodies.
    We would suggest for this element, assuming provisionally that it
is not a mixture, the symbol A.
    We have to record our thanks to Messrs. Gordon, Kellas, and
Matthews, who have materially assisted us in the prosecution of this
research.
        Addendum       by Professor     Ramsay, March 20, 1895.
    Further determinations      have been made of the density of argon
prepared by means of magnesium.              The mean result of six very
concordant weighings of different samples, in which every care was
taken in each case to circulate the argqn over magnesium for hours
after all contraction had ceased, gave the density 19 90.
    The value of R in the gas-equation R = pv/T has been carefully
determined for argon, at temperatures determined by means of a
thermometer filled with pure hydrogen.          I have found that the value
of R remains practically constant between —87° and +248°; the
greatest difference between the extreme values of R amounts to only
                                                                "
0"3 per cent.     Argon, therefore, behaves as a " perfect         gas, and
shows no sign of association on cooling, nor of dissociation on
heating.
    The ratio of the specific heat at constant volume to that at con
stant pressure has been reinvestigated; the mean of four very concord
ant determinations with distinct samples of argon is 1"645.

    The   molecular    weight of argon is therefore 39-8, and the same
number expresses its atomic weight, unless it be a mixture of cwo
elements, or of mono- and diatomic molecules of the same element.
The ratio of specific heats might support the last supposition ; but
the thermal behaviour of the gas lends no support to this view.
     II. " On    the Spectra of Argon." By William Crookes,
                F.R.S., &c. Received January 26, 1895.
                                    (Abstract.)
    Through the kindness of Lord Rayleigh and Professor Ramsay I
have    been enabled to examine the spectrum of this gas in a very
accurate spectroscope, and also to take photographs of its spectra in a
spectrograph fitted with a complete quartz train.
    Argon resembles nitrogen in that it gives two distinct spectra
according to the strength of the induction current employed.                   But
while the two spectra of nitrogen are different in character, one
showing fluted bands and the other sharp lines, the argon spectra both
consist of sharp lines. It is, however, very difficult to get argon so free
from nitrogen that it will not at first show the nitrogen (lutings super
posed on its own special system of lines.          I have used argon prepared
by Lord Rayleigh, Professor Ramsay, and myself, and, however free
it was supposed to be from nitrogen, I could always detect the
nitrogen bands in its spectrum.           These, however, disappear when the
induction spark is passed through the tube for some time, varying
from a few minutes to a few hours.            The vacuum tubes best adapted
for showing the spectra are of the ordinary Pliicker form, having a
capillary tube in the middle.           For photographing the higher rays
which are cut off by glass          I  have used a similar tube,
                                                                       " end on,"
having a quartz window at one end.
    The pressure of argon giving the greatest luminosity and most
brilliant spectrum is 3 mm.
    If the pressure is further reduced, and a Leyden jar intercalated
in the circuit, the colour of the luminous discharge changes from red
to a rich steel blue, and the spectrum shows an almost entirely dif
 ferent set of lines.
    I have taken photographs of the two spectra of argon partly super
 posed.     In this way their dissimilarity is readily seen.* In the
 spectrum     of the blue glow I have counted 119 lines, and in that of
 the red glow 80 lines, making 199 in all.           Of these 26 appear to be
 common to both spectra.
    I have said that the residual nitrogen is removed by sparking the

 tube for some time when platinum terminals are sealed in. This is
 not the only way of purifying the argon.        By the kindness of Pro
 fessor Ramsay, I was allowed to take some vacuum tubes to his
 laboratory and there exhaust and fill them with some of his purest
 argon.    On this occasion    I  simultaneously filled, exhausted, and
 sealed off two Pliicker tubes, one having platinum and the other
 aluminium terminals.       On testing the gas immediately after they
 were sealed off, each tube showed the argon spectrum, contaminated
 by a trace of nitrogen bands.      The next day the tube with platinum
terminals was unchanged, but that having aluminium terminals
 showed the puro spectrum of argon, the faint nitrogen bands having
entirely disappeared during the night. After an hour's sparking the
tube with platinum terminals likewise gave a pure argon spectrum.
   A vacuum tube was filled with pure argon and kept on the pump
while observations were made on the spectrum of the gas as exhaus
tion proceeded. The large coil was used with a current of 8 84 amperes
and 11 volts, no jar was interposed.        At a pressure of 3 mm. the
spectrum was that of the pure red glow of argon. This persisted as
the exhaustion rose, until, at a pressure of about half a millimeter,
flashes of blue light made their appearance.      At a quarter of a milli
meter the colour of the ignited gas was pure blue, and the spectrum
showed no trace of the red glow.
   Au experiment was now made to see if the small quantity of argon
normally present in the atmosphere could be detected without previous
concentration. Nitrogen was prepared from the atmosphere by burn
ing phosphorus, and was purified in the usual manner. This gas, well
dried over phosphoric anhydride, was passed into a vacuum tube, the
air washed out by two fillings and exhaustions, and the tube was
finally sealed off at a pressure of 52 mm.        It was nsed for photo
graphing   the  band  spectrum    of  nitrogen on   several occasions, and
altogether it was exposed to the induction current from the large coil
for eight hours before any change was noticed. The last time when
photographing its spectrum difficulty was experienced in getting the
spark to pass, so   I   increased the current and intercalated a small
jar. The colour immediately changed from the reddish-yellow of
nitrogen to the blue of argon, and on applying the spectroscope the
linos of argon shone out with scarcely any admixture of nitrogen
band3. With great difficulty, and by employing a very small jar, I was
able to take one photograph of its spectrum and compare it with the
 spectrum of argon from Professor Ramsay, both being taken on the
 same plate.   The argon spectra were the same in each.       After this it
became difficult to illuminate the tube, except by employing a danger
ously large current.     Whenever a flash passed it was of a deep blae
colour.   Assuming that the atmosphere contains 1 per cent. of argon,
     3 mm. of nitrogen originally in the tube would contain 0"03 mm.

of   argon.      After the nitrogen had been absorbed by the spattered
platinum this pressure of argon would be near the point of non-con
duction.
    In all cases, when argon has been obtained in this manner, the
 spectrum has been that of the blue-glowing gas. It is not improbable,
and     I   understand that independent observations have already led
both the      discoverers to the same conclusion, that the gas argon is
not a     simple body, but is a mixture of at least two elements, one of
which glows red and the other blue, each having its distinctive
spectrum.        The theory that it is a simple body has, however, support
from the analogy of other gases.           Thus, nitrogen has two distinct
spectra, one or the other being produced by varying the pressure and
intensity of the spark.         I  have made vacuum tubes containing
rarefied nitrogen, which show either the fluted band or the sharp
line spectrum by simply turning the screw of the make-and-break,
exactly as the two spectra of argon can be changed from one to
the other.
   I have prepared tubes containing other gases as well as nitrogen at
different pressures, and have examined their bpectra both by eye ob
servations and by photography.          The sharp line spectrum of nitrogen
is not nearly so striking in brilliancy, number or sharpness of lines
as are those of argon, and careful scrutiny fails to show more than
one or two apparent coincidences between           lines in the two spectra.
Between the spectra of argon and the band spectrum of nitrogen
there are two or three close approximations of lines, but a projection
on the screen of a magnified image of the two spectra partly super
posed will show that two at least of these are not real coincidences.
    I have looked for indications of lines in the argon spectra corre
 sponding to the corona line at 531"7, the aurora line at 557-1, and the
 helium line at 587-5, but have failed to detect any line of argon suffi
 ciently near these positions to fall within the limits of experimental
 error.
    I have found no other spectrum-giving gas or vapour yield spectra
 at all   like those of argon, and the apparent coincidences in some of
 the  lines, which on one or two occasions are noticed, have been very
 few, and would probably disappear on using a higher dispersion.
 As far, therefore, as spectrum work can decide, the verdict must
 be that Lord Rayleigh and Professor Ramsay have added one, if not
 two, members to the family of elementary bodies.

                                 (Abstract.)
    Having been furnisbed, by Professor Ramsay's kindness, with            a
sample of the new gas, argon, I have carried out experiments on its
behaviour at low temperatures and at high pressures, in order to
contribute, at least in part, to the knowledge of the properties of this
i nteresting body.
                             I
    The argon with which was supplied had been dried with phos
phoric anhydride ; its density was 19 9 (H = 1) ; and Professor
llamsay thought that at the outside it might contain ] to 2 per cent,
of nitrogen, although it showed no nitrogen spectrum when examined
in a Pfliicker's tube.
    For the first two experiments   I made use of a Cailletet's apparatus.
As cooling agent     I used liquid ethylene, boiling under diminished
pressure.
   In   both the other experiments the argon was contained in a
burette, closed at both ends with glass stop-cocks. By connecting
the lower end of the burette with a mercury reservoir, the argon was
transferred into a narrow .glass tube fnsed at its lower end to the
upper end of the burette, and in which the argon was liquefied, and
its volume in the liquid state measured.       In these two series of ex
periments liquid oxygen, boiling under atmospheric or under
diminished pressure, was employed as a cooling agent. I made use of
a hydrogen thermometer in all these experiments to measure low
temperatures.
            Determination of   the Critical Constants of Argon.
    As soon as the temperature of the liquid ethylene had been lowered
to — 128°-6, the argon easily condensed      to a colourless liquid under a
pressure of 38 atmospheres.        On slowly raising the temperature of
the ethylene, the meniscus of the liquid argon became less and less
distinct, and finally vanished.
    From seven determinations the critical pressure was found to be
50 6 atmospheres ; the mean of the seven estimations of the critical
temperature is —121".

                    Determination of         the       Boiling and Freezing Points.
      A calibrated
                 tube, intended to receive the argon to be liquefied,
and   the hydrogen thermometer were immersed in boiling oxygen.
On admitting argon, and diminishing the temperature of the liquid
oxygen below —187°, the liquefaction of the argon became manifest.
When liquefaction had taken place,                          I
                                       carefully equalised the pressure
of the argon with that of the atmosphere, and regulated the tempera
ture, so that the state of balance was maintained for a long time.
This process gives the boiling point of argon under atmospheric
pressure.    Pour experiments gave the numbers — 186°-7, — 1860,8,
 -187° 0, and -187°-3. The mean is -186°-9, which I consider to
be the boiling point under atmospheric pressure (740 5 mm.).
   The quantity of argon used for these experiments, reduced to
normal temperature and pressure, was 99-5 c.c. ; the quantity of
liquid corresponding to that volume of gas was approximately 0"114 c.c
Hence the density of argon at its boiling point may be taken as
approximately 1"5.      This proves that the density of liquid argon
at its boiling point ( — 187J) is much higher than that of oxygen,
which           I
          have found, under similar conditions, to be 1"124.
   By lowering the temperature of the oxygen to —191° by slow
exhaustion, the argon froze to a crystalline mass, resembling ice ; on
further lowering temperature it became white and opaque. When the
temperature was raised it melted ; four observations which I made to
determine its melting point gave the numbers: — 189°-0, — 190°-6,
— 189°-6, and — 189u"4.     The mean of these numbers is — 189°-6 ;
and this may be accepted as the melting point of argon.
   In the following table I have given a comparison of physical con
stants, in which those of argon are compared with those of other
so-called permanent gases.    The data are from my previous work on
the subject.
   As can be seen from the foregoing table, argon belongs to the
            "            "
so-called     permanent gases, and, as regards difficulty in liquefying
it,    occupies the fourth place, viz., between carbon monoxide and
      it
oxygen.      Its behaviour on liquefaction places    nearest to oxygen,  it
but    itdiffers entirely from oxygen in being solidifiable     as   well              ;           is
known, oxygen has not yet been made to assume a solid state.
   The high density of argon rendered      probable that its liquefaction
                                                                it
would take place at a higher temperature than that at which oxygen
liquefies.     Its unexpectedly low critical temperature and boiling
point seem to have some relation to its simple molecular constitution.

 IV. " On the Spark Spectrum of Argon as it appears in the
          Spark Spectrum of Air." By W. N. Hartley, F.R.S.,
          Professor of Chemistry, Royal College of Science, Dublin.
          Received January 31, 1895. [Revised February 18, 1895.]
    The spark spectrum of air as photographed, mapped, and described
by Hartley and Adeney* contains various lines which they have not
been able to attribute to oxygen or to nitrogen, having no grounds
for assigning them to one element or the other.                     The lines belonging
to oxygen and nitrogen, when produced by uncondensed sparks, are
comparatively well known ; so also are the lines of oxygen when a
condensed spark is used, but it is otherwise with the lines of nitrogen
when the spark is condensed.
    It was observed by one of usf that the very abundant air lines in
the photographed spectrum of air were subject to considerable varia
tions according to circumstances.               Thus, by modifications in manipu
lation, the air- spectrum might almost be suppressed, though the
metallic lines remained strong.
    On the other hand, it was remarked that certain metallic electrodes
Rave spectra of air with some lines more prominent than others, also
more sharply and distinctly defined.                 Aluminium and copper were
iwo which gave the most distinctly-marked air-lines.                      Platinum also
in some cases.
    From       statements contained in the paper contributed by Mr.
Crookes        on the spectrum of argon it may be gathered that the
following conditions have been observed to yield the brightest and
purest spectrum          of argon : —
    1.   As to pressure, about 3 mm.
   2.    Electrodes of aluminium or platinum.
    3.   A condensed spark from           a coil and Leyden       jar.
    These conditions         were very nearly approached when Hartley and
Adeney's spectra of air were photographed, thus: —
    1.    As argon is about          1 per cent, of the atmosphere, its partial
            pressure is about 7'5 mm.
    2.    Electrodes of aluminium, copper, platinum, and palladium were
            used.
    3.    A condensed spark        was always employed, this being produced
            by using a coil and Leyden         jar.
    It    was therefore       reasonable to expect that the spectrum of the

    blue and ultra-violet rays emitted by argon would be recognised
    among some of the weaker lines in the spectrum of air. When
    operating in a tube closed by a plate of quartz with oxygen, carbon
    dioxide, nitrogen, and other gases, with carbon electrodes                          and
    points of aluminium, the variations in the spectrum were considered
    to be of the same nature as those described in the
                                                                        '

   vol. 55, p. 344, 1894, but it appears now to be extremely probable
    that they were in some cases due to the removal of nitrogen and the
   development of the argon spectrum. Accordingly the spark spectrum
   of air has been examined* for those lines more refrangible than 4674,
   since, if it be an elementary form of matter, they must appear there,
   or some explanation should be given to accouut for their absence.
       It may here be stated that the photographs were taken in 1882 with
   a Rutherford diffraction grating with 14,000 lines to the inch and
   quartz lenses of 3(5 inches focus. Two sets of measurements were
   made, one from the photograph of each metal ; where the lines did
   not agree, sometimes a third set of measurements were made from
   another plate, but when this was not necessary the mean value was
   adopted as the wave-length.                 The maximum error for well-defined
   lines was believed to be not greater than +0-3 of a tenth metre; for
   faint lines it is larger, but it seldom rises to more than 0"5. The
   metre of Angstrom was our standard.
      The following table gives the lines in the red and in the bine
   spectra of argon, and the corresponding lines in the spectrum of air.
   With the exception of two lines printed in italics, the latter are all
   absolute wave-lengths.

   It will appear that   these lines, which       approximate so closely to a
large number of lines in the argon spectrum, are scarcely likely to
do so by mere chance. There is one group marked by a bracket which
may be identified in the spectrum of aluminium in the

pare with the grating spectra, the air lines being, as far as possible,
suppressed in the former.
   I do not attribute much importance to the fact that argon gives
two spectra; the red appears to be the spectrum of the first order, or
the spectrum of the lower temperature which corresponds thereto ;
tho blue is the line spectrum, or spectrum at the higher tem
perature.
   I have photographed simultaneously from the same spark the two
spectra of nitrogen as rendered by atmospheric air.
   It is therefore more likely that argon is one substance and not two.
Whether it is a compound or an element is a question into which the
following considerations may enter. There are at present nongaseous
substances       known which can withstand the temperature of the
condensed spark without exhibiting the spectra of one or other of the
elements of which it is composed.             If, therefore, argon were Ns it
would disclose the spectrum of nitrogen.               As the spectrum is not
that of any known substance, it follows that, if a compound, it must
be a compound of a new element.
   A Letter from Prof. Fitzgerald upon the Atomicity of Argon                  was
read.

I. "    The Oscillations of a Rotating Ellipsoidal Shell con
       taining Fluid." By S. S. Hough. Communicated by Sir
       B. S. Ball, F.R.S. Received January 18, 1895.
                                  (Abstract.)
   The paper contains an application of the analysis          used by M,
Poincare, in his memoir       " Sur l'equilibre d'une masse fluide animee
d'un mouvement de rotation,"* to the determination of the free
oscillations of a system consisting of a fluid mass contained within a
rigid ellipsoidal envelope, rotating about one of its principal axes.
It is found that, when such a system is oscillating in one of its
fundamental modes, the disturbances of the fluid are all expressible
by means of Lame functions, the functions involved being all of the
same order ; and a method of obtaining the frequencies of these
oscillations, similar to that used by M. Poincare for a fluid ellipsoid
•with a free surface, is given.
   The oscillations, however, which involve Lame functions of the
second order, demand exceptional treatment in consequence of the
fact that these alone imply any disturbance of the containing shell.

300       Oscillations  of a Rotating Shell containing Fluid.    [Feb. 7,
problem in hand, enables us to determine an expression for the fluid
pressure at all points on the boundary in terms of the disturbances
communicated to the shell. From this, the couples on the shell, due
to the fluid pressure, are estimated and introduced into the dynamical
equations of motion of the shell.         A frequency equation of the
6th degree is derived, apparently involving three fundamental modes
of oscillation.    The equation, however, is found to bo satisfied by the
frequency of rotation of the system, and the corresponding oscillation
is shown not to be real but to arise (analytically) only in consequence
of the motion of the axes of reference.     We are left with two funda
mental modes.
    The case where the inertia of the shell is negligible, compared
with that of the fluid, is of analytical interest, and can be approxi
mately realised physically by means of a liquid gyrostat (' Nature,'
vol. 15, p. 297) mounted in such a way that its centre of gravity is
held at rest.     When the axis of rotation is an axis of symmetry, the
roots of the frequency equation will be real, and the motion therefore
stable, either when this axis is the least axis, or when it exceeds
three times the equatorial radius. When, however, the figure is not
one of revolution, the analytical conditions of stability are not so
simply exprpssible, but they will always be satisfied when the axis of
rotation is the least axis, or when it exceeds three times either of the
other axes.
    On taking into account the inertia of the shell, the discussion is
confined to the case where the ellipsoid is approximately spherical,
and the solutions of the frequeucy equation then assume a simple
form.     Of the two modes of oscillations, the motion of the shell in
one is analogous to the motion of a rigid body when slightly dis
 turbed from a motion of rotation about a principal axis, but the
period is found to be shorter than it would be were the fluid solidi
 fied ; the other exists only in consequence of the contained fluid.
    The former of these presents the greater interest. It has been
 supposed that if the axis of rotation of the earth wero displaced
 from its axis of figure, an oscillatory motion would ensue which
 would give rise to a variation in the latitude of places on the earth's
 surface in a period of 305 days. Recent observations (vide Chandler,
 '
   Astronomical Journal,' vols. 11, 12) have proved that such an oscil
 lation is taking place, but that the theoretical estimate of the period
 is considerably too short. This pnperwas undertaken with the object
 of investigating whether the extension of the period could be ex
 plained by supposing that the earth possessed a fluid interior, in
 accordance with a suggestion made byM. Folie ('Acta Mathematics,'
vol. 16). It is shown that the hypothesis of a fluid interior leads
to a result directly opposite to that which observation requires, and
that, therefore, tho discovery of the variations of latitude so far from

establishing the existence of a fluid interior, as supposed by M.
Folie, rather affords an additional reason for discarding this hypo
thesis.
II. "On the Abelian System of Differential Equations, and
     their Rational and Integral Algebraic Integrals, with a
     Discussion of the Periodicity of Abelian Functions." By
     Rev. W. R. Westropp Roberts.      Communicated by Rev.
     G. Salmon, D.D., F.R.S. Received January 17, 1895.
                                                           (Abstract.)
   Before   entering on the discnssion of the Abelian system of
differential equations, I treat of some general algebraic theorems
having reference to the differences of various sets of
                                                        " facients," and
give a wider definition to the term " source," hitherto used to signify
the source of a covariant, and treat of two operators, o and A.
   I then show how, by forming what         call a " square-matrix," all     I
the conditions can be obtained which are fulfilled when a polynomial
/(2) of the degree 2 n in z is a perfect square.   With regard to these
conditions,               I
               remark that any one of them being given all the others
 can be found by successive operations of the operator S.
   I next treat of the system of differential equations termod
 "Abelian," in which there are to quantities and m — 1 equations,
 comprehended in the typical form
 where  2 relates to the m quantities z,, zt   zm, and * may have any
 integer value from i = 0 to i = m—2, it being understood that /(z)
 is a polynomial      of the degree 2 m in z ; and I show that, if
 i(z) = ztm + -PlzlM~> + -P^m~"--\-    P^, be reduced to the degree
 2m— 2 in z in the following manner —

   so obtaining    the conditions that F (z) should be a perfect square.
   The various relations so found connecting the quantities p\,pe            pn,
   and m — 1 arbitrary quantities X,           , XM, are  algebraic integrals of
   the above system of differential equations, and are all rational and
   integral. I then apply the general theorem to the case m = 2, or the
   case of elliptic integrals, and easily deduce the resnlt given by Cayley
                                                                                '
   in his work entitled an ' Elementary Treatise on Elliptic Functions
   (p. 340).
      I next apply the theory to the case of m = 3, and deduce two
   algebraic integrals, and show how the remaining relations may be
  found, and lastly to the case m = 4.
      The next subject treated of is the source of F (*), from which we
  derive a differential equation which I call the fundamental equation
  in the theory of Abelian integrals and functions, as its integral lead9
  us to a form which, when operated on by i, leads us to a new
  algebraic equation, which again leads to another by a second applica
  tion of the operator.     By this method I obtain a number of interest
  ing results, many of which are now given for the first time, as far as
  I am aware.
     I then define    Abelian functions and, by a method of treatment
  depending on what precedes, show that they are periodic functions
 and determine their periods.
     We have at first sight 2 m— 1 independent periods, and            I reduce
 them    to 2m—   2 by  an easy application  of   the foregoing theory.
     The above is a short abstract of what my paper contains, the most
 important portions of it being (a) the determination of the algebraic
 integrals in a rational and integral form ; (h) the easy proof of the
 periodicity of Abelian functions.
     I  omit from this paper a discussion of the case in which the
 number of variables exceeds m, as likely to make my communication
 too lengthy.

                              *-^V  = Tr+i2SRr,
in which p denotes pressure per unit of area, V volume, and T,
kinetic energy of relative motion. Also R is the repulsive force, r the
distance between the centres         of two spheres,     and the    summation
includes all pairs.

    2. Evaluate 22Rr, on the assumption that no forces               act except
 during collisions.    That gives
                              22Rr =    f a-cV  ¦2PTn
 c being the diameter of a sphere and p the number of spheres            in unit
 of volume.
 Let                          iircsp =  k.
 Then                         22Rr =    k  . 2PTn
 and                               p=         + K)PTr.
   3.  This suggests that we should take for our law of distribution of
 energy, not e-*T, as in a rare medium, but <rMT+«T¦).
   4. To test that suggestion, consider the case of an infinite vertical
 column of gas subject to a constant vertical force /.           We have, if s
 be the height above a fixed horizontal plane, dpjds = — M/y>.
   Assuming for the moment the whole energy to be that of relative
 motion Tr, that gives
Now k contains p as a factor.        If we make     Tr constant, as in the rare
medium, the equation is impracticable.              But makel + KTr constant
 = 3/2fc, and we get the usual equation p         = p0(Tmf', pa being the value
of p when s   = 0.
   5. 6, 7, 8. Now consider N spheres crossing the plane t = 0, with
u for vertical component of velocity.             Of these some will undergo
collision before reaching ds. But an equal number will be substituted
for them with the same vertical velocity, but with a small average
advance in position in direction s, owing to the finite diameter c.          It
is shown    that on average of the N spheres this advance is icds, and,
therefore, the class of N spheres, original or substituted, will at the
end of the time dsjti be at the height, not ds, but on average (l + ic)ds.
But their loss of kinetic energy by the action of the force          f  is only
M/cfe.    And, therefore, the loss due to the height ds is, allowing for
substitutions,  M/is/l+K.
   9, 10.  Hence we find that the assumption l + «Tr = 3/ 2h satisfies
all the conditions of equilibrium        in exactly the same way as in the
rare medium Tr = 3/2/f, satisfies them.
   11. The result can now be generalised by introducing stream
motion, the energy of which is T„ as well as that of relative motion
TV, and we find that T + ,rT, must be constant throughout the column.
Say, now,   T + *Tr=    3/2*.

  cients all negative ; and the 6 coefficients express the fact that the
  pairs of velocities to which they relate are not independent ; and the
  It-s, being negative, express the fact that the two velocities are more
  likely to be of the same than of opposite signs, so that there will be
  on the average of any group of contiguous spheres a greater common
  or stream motion than there would be were the velocities all inde
  pendent.
      16. The coefficients b must generally diminish as the distance be
  tween the two spheres to which they relate increases, becoming
 evanescent when that distance is great enough.

     This shows that as n diminishes the a coefficients diminish, and
since every 6 coefficient is negative the 6's increase in absolute value,
 so that the ratios bh'ja or Vja increase.                  On the other hand, as n
increases the a's increase, and the squares and products of the form

         Internal Movements exhibited by the Spectra of Gases."
         By Professor G. F. Fitzgerald, F.R.S.                         Received
         February    7, 1895.
   It   has been generally held that a sufficient freedom of internal
motion in an atom to explain the spectra of gases proved that the
theorem as to equal partition of energy among all degrees of freedom
could not hold, and various suggestions have been made as to why
 the proof, as given by Maxwell, Boltzmann, and others, fails in this

18!)5.]    Energy among the Degrees of Freedom of Atoms.                313
case.    Professor Schuster has suggested that the numerous lines
need  not involve the same number of degrees of freedom, as it is
possible that there may be connections between them such that one
or two co-ordinates would define a motion which when analysed into
its Fourier components, as is done by a grating or prism, would pro
duce a very complex system of lines.        However, even one degree of
internal freedom would interfere very seriously with the observed
value of the ratio of specific heats, and the object of this letter is to
explain how this difficulty may be surmounted without supposing
that the theorem as to equal partition of energy is untrue, for it is
not by any means disproved because a certain form of proof fails in
certain cases.
   It has been long held that the motion        of the electrons on neigh
bouring atoms is very much controlled by the ether between them.
The wave-length of light is generally many times as great as the
molecular distances, so that the ether is a practically rigid connector
between neighbouring      electrons.     Suppose now, as a particular
example, that 10" atoms are    in  this sense, and so far as the motion of
electrons is concerned, within one another's control.         In this case
the motion of these 10' electrons might be defined by means of, say,
three co-ordinates.    Hence, if the atoms were spheres, there would
be 3 x 106 degrees of freedom plus these three degrees         defining the
motions of all the electrons.       Now, if the total energy be equally
distributed among all these degrees of freedom, each atom will only
have its share of the electromotions, and its energy of external
motion will only be diminished by 3 x l0-6th part owing to the
existence of the internal motion of its electrons.       I need hardly say
that our methods of calorimetry are by no means sufficiently delicate
to detect anything of this kind.        There might be a thousand such
internal degrees of freedom, and yet the ratio of specific heats would
agree   with observation.
   There   is some analogy between this suggestion and the case of a
sphere moving in a liquid.        The presence of the liquid, although
apparently endowed with an infinite number of degrees of freedom,
does not really increase the degrees of freedom at all, because its
motion is entirely defined by the motion of the sphere.         In a some
what similar manner,      I  would suggest that the presence of the
million electrons does not sensibly increase the degrees of freedom of
motion of the million atoms, as all their motions may be defined in
terms of the motion of a few of them.            That the ether would so
control the motions of electrons seems almost certain from what we
know of the rapidity with which electromagnetic actions are trans
mitted by it, showing how completely it behaves in respect of them
as a system of rigid connections.

II.   " Contributions to the
                                Chemistry of Chlorophyll.       No. VI."
       By  Edward     Schunck,      F.R.S.,  and  Leon   Marchlewski,
       Ph.D. Received January 25, 1895.
   The preceding memoir on the chemistry of chlorophyll contained
the results arrived at in the analysis of phyllotaonin and its
derivatives.    In the present communication it is proposed to give
further details regarding the properties and composition of alkn-
chlorophyll, the mother substance of phyllotaonin, on which will
follow an account of some products of decomposition of the latter.
Some experiments will then be described showing the connection
between phylloxanthin and phyllooyanin, and proving that the former
may by a simple process be converted into the latter.
   In order to determine the composition of alkachlorophyll, it was
necessary to prepare specimens of the substance purer than those
previously obtained, which were only just sufficiently pure for a
determination of its chief properties. For this purpose we employed,
as in previous experiments, an extract of grass with boiliDg
alcohol.
    We also made use of a commercial product furnished by Merck of
Darmstadt, under the name of " Chlorophyllum purissimum," which,
on examination, turned out to be not exactly what its name would
betoken, but a very impure alkachlorophyll.
    In the case of grass, the first part of the process was the same as
that described in the fourth memoir of this series, and the details may
therefore be omitted here. The sodium salt of alkachlorophyll of this
process was treated for some time with a mixture of equal parts of
absolute alcohol and ether, in. order to remove the fatty acid soaps
 present.    The sodium salt was then decomposed in the manner
previously described, and the free alkachlorophyll obtained having
been dissolved in ether, the solution was mixed with ligroin.
   The latter precipitated the alkachlorophyll,      the fatty acids still
present remaining dissolved. The solution in ether and precipitation
with ligroin was twice repeated, and the resulting product was treated
several times with small quantities of boiling ligroin.
   The product supplied by Merck, after being treated for some time
with alcoholic soda, was submitted to the same process as that just
described.
   The substance dried at 125° yielded on analysis the following
results, the first two determinations being made with the product
from grass, the third with that from Merck's " Chlorophyll."

   Since phyllotaonin,      with the formula      C40H102iuO6, is  formed by the
action of acids on alkachlorophyll, it was necessary to adopt for the
latter a formula with no less than 6 atoms of nitrogen.                The second
of the above formulae meets this requirement.
   The formation of phyllotaonin from alkachlorophyll                by the action
of acids, supposing the process to be one of simple hydrolysis, might
be  represented    by the  following equation : —
                 CmH^NA + HsO =          C11)H„N,O6 + C11H19NOa.
   That    a small quantity of a product of a basic nature probably con
taining nitrogen is formed along with phyllotaonin, by the action of
acids on alkachlorophyll, has already been mentioned in the fourth
mem0r of this series, but we have not been able to throw any more
light on the nature of this product.           That some substance containing
nitrogen must be formed together with phyllotaonin in the decom
position, is also indicated by the equation just given, but whether
the formula G*i2H19NO2 represents one substance only, or a mixture of
several, is doubtful.
   The properties of alkachlorophyll have been already described, and
need not therefore be referred to here.           The action of alkalis on it at
a high temperature may however be briefly described.

   When    a solution of alkachlorophyll in alcoholic potash is heated in
 ¦ sealed tube   for several hours at 190 — 200° it is decomposed; on
 opening the tube no pressure is perceived.
    The contents, consisting partly of small brownish-red crystals,
 having been poured out, an excess of hydrochloric acid is added; this
 dissolves a part, yielding a purple solution.
    The latter is filtered off from the undissolved brown mass, and
 after being nearly neutralised with soda, yields on agitation with ether
a solution of a fine crimson colour.          The ethereal solution after
 washing with water leaves on evaporation a quantity of small crystals.
 The substance so obtained is identical with the one formed by the
 same process from phyllotaonin and which will be described presently.
It seems also to be essentially the same as that obtained by Tschirch
in acting on alkachlorophyll with alkali, and called by him "phyllo-
 porphyric acid," but a comparison of the absorption spectrum of the
latter as described by him with that of our substance shows that his
product must have been impure.          This is evident from the fact that
the absorption spectrum of Tsohirch's product shows, according to
Vim, a band in the red about in the same position as band I of the
chlorophyll spectrum, whereas this band though visible in solutions
of our substance when the latter is not quite pure, disappears entirely
in solutions of the pure substance.
   The liquid filtered off from the products insoluble in hydrochloric
acid of the process just described, contains in combination with the
ncid various volatile bases, chiefly ammonia. In one experiment the
liquid, after being made alkaline with soda, was submitted to
distillation, the vapour evolved being passed into dilute hydrochloric
acid.     The acid liquid after concentration yielded with platinic
chloride a yellow precipitate, which was collected, treated with
 boiling alcohol, and dried.
    0-1031 gram of the substance gave 0.0451 gram platinum = 43"74
per cent. ; calculation for (NH,)aPtCl8 requires 43.90 per cent.
   The filtrate from the platinum ammonium chloride yielded, on
evaporation, orange coloured octahedra, containing 38-7 per cent. of
platinum.     It may hence be inferred that along with ammonia some
base of higher molecular weight is formed ; the quantity is, however,
very small.

    The action of caustic alkalis on chlorophyll and its derivatives has

solutions.    On account of the double fluorescence of its solutions
  bserved by him lie gave it the name of "dichromatic acid." The

 states, a very unstable body.      The absorption spectrum of its solu

 Among1 the products of decomposition of dichromatic acid mention is
 made of a substance which in acid solutions shows only two bands ;
 this substance Hoppe-Seyler calls phylloporphyrin. Another product
 of decomposition is obtained, according to him, on evaporating the
 ethereal solution.    Sachsse obtained by fusion of his /S-phaeochloro-
 phyll with soda a reddish-brown       product dissolving in acids with a
 violet colour, and having the formula C36HMN30j.          Similar experi.
 ments made with phyllocyanin,          which led to the formation of a
 purple crystallised substance, have already been described in the
 fourth memoir of this series.      The product formed in all these cases
 being   doubtless the  same,  we  shall adopt for it the name phyllopor.
 phyrin, Hoppe-Seyler's body of the same name being, in our opinion,
 simply a compound with acid, not a product of decomposition.         The
 substance has, in fact, a pronounced basic character, and shows in
 neutral solutions a spectrum differing entirely from that of its acid
 solutions.
               Preparation and Properties of Phylloporphyrin.
    The   method of preparing the substance from phyllocyanin lias
 previously been described.       The method before given is, however,
 not an advantageous one, the yield being trifling, and the quantity of
 bye-products formed at the same time relatively large.         We there
 fore adopted another process, avoiding the use of melted alkali in
 open vessels and employing alcoholic potash in sealed tubes.         The
 material employed was phyllotaonin, which, being itself a product of
decomposition of phyllocyanin with alkali at lower temperatures,
and being more easily prepared in a state of purity than phyllocyanin,
seemed better adapted than the latter for the preparation of phyllo
porphyrin. The process employed was as follows : — Ethyl phyllo
taonin in crystals was treated with alcoholic potash in sealed tubes
at 190° for several hours.       On opening the tubes no pressure was
observed.     The brownish-red contents were poured out, mixed with
water and an excess of hydrochloric acid, and then shaken up with
ether.    The ether acquired a fine purple colour, and left on evapora
tion a brownish residue in which dark purple crystals were discern
ible. The residue was treated with boiling alcohol, which dissolved
part, leaving a quantity of brown matter undissolved.        On adding to
the filtrate an alcoholic solution of zinc acetate, and allowing it to
stand, a red crystalline deposit — a zinc compound of phylloporphyrin
— was formed.       This was collected and dissolved in boiling alcohol.
 The solution, after addition of a little hydrochloric acid, was mixed

318           Mr. E. Schunck and Dr. L. Marchlewski.            [Feb.  14,
with much water and extracted with ether. The latter acquired a
splendid crimson colour, and, having been washed with water, left
011   evaporation reddish-violet crystals, which were recrystallised
from alcohol.
    As thus prepared, phylloporphyrin appears in the form of lustrous
crystals of a splendid reddish- violet colour, which under the micro
scope are seen to be short regular prisms.     It is tolerably soluble in
alcohol and ether, giving red fluorescent solutions, which, on the addi
tion of a little acid, acquire a bluish tint. It dissolves in mineral
acids as well as in glacial acetic acid. The solutions give up nothing
when shaken up with ether, even when previously mixed with much
water, showing that they contain compounds of the substance with
the respective acids. When, however, the solutions are made alkaline
and then again slightly acid, then ether, on agitation, takes up the
substance.     On adding nitric acid to the solution in acetic acid
it becomes greenish, and, on heating, the colour disappears entirely.
Phylloporphyrin possesses also acid properties, though these are not
very pronounced. It is, indeed, quite insoluble in aqueous alkalis;
but when caustic soda is added to its alcoholic solution a brown
sodium compound separates, which yields up nothing to ether until
the alkali has been removed by means of acetic acid.            It yields,
moreover, as before mentioned, a crystallised zinc salt, which is
formed on adding zinc acetate to its alcoholic solution, when it crys
tallises out in small red needles ; the compound is decomposed by
hydrochloric acid, but it is scarcely changed by acetic acid. The zinc
salt is of some importance in connection with the preparation of the
pure substance, since by its means it becomes possible to separate it
from other products of decomposition, more especially from the
brown amorphous substances accompanying it.
   As regards its absorption spectrum, phylloporphyrin is a very in
teresting substance.    The ethereal solution shows seven bands, which
are, for the most part, very sharply defined (see fig.) ; it is the
first of the derivatives of chlorophyll, so far discovered,- which shows
in solution no band within the red, the firsthand being at the margin
of and almost outside that part of the spectrum.            The spectrum
of the alcoholic  solution is similar, but the  second and third bands
are not seen, and the fourth and fifth bands appear as one. Tho
alcoholic solution to which hydrochloric acid has been added shows
an absorption spectrum of three bands only, one close to line B,
another near E, and a third, which is very faint, between the two.
This spectrum should, we thought, have been the same as that of
Hoppe-Seyler's phylloporphyrin, which we consider to be a compound
of our phylloporphyrin with acid ; that they are not quite identical is
probably due to Hoppo-Seyler's product having been impure. That

added    really contains a compound with acid and not a product
of decomposition, is evident from the fact that if the acid be neutra
lised with soda the solution loses its bluish tinge, and now shows the
absorption spectrum of an alcoholic solution of the free substance.
A solution of phylloporphyrin in concentrated sulphuric acid shows a
spectrum with four bands.         The spectrum of solutions of the zinc
salt is peculiar.     While the solutions of the alkaline salts show a
spectrum differing very little from that of the substance itself, the
zinc salt in solution shows only two bands (see fig.).         On adding a
little hydrochloric acid to the zinc salt solution and boiling, the
spectrum of the hydrochloride makes its appearance, followed, after
considerable dilution, by that of the substance itself.

 the dichromatic acid of Hoppe-Seyler,          which, according to him, is
 devoid of nitrogen.

  Want of substance prevented our making further determinations
in confirmation of those above given.
     It
     is difficult at present to explain in a simple manner the formation
of phylloporphyrin from phyllotaonin, the more so since phyllopor
phyrin is not the only product of decomposition due to the action of
alkali, it being always accompanied by a relatively large quantity of
brown   amorphous substances as before mentioned.           Ammonia,
together with a small quantity of another base having a higher
molecular weight, could also be detected in the acid liquid filtered off
from the phylloporphyrin and the brown substances, just as in the
case of alkachlorophyli ; the presence of these bodies was discovered
in the manner previously described.
              Conversion of   Fhylloxanthin into Phyllocyanin.
   Phylloxanthin and phyllocyanin being both products of decomposi
tion of chlorophyll with acids, and having many properties in common,
itseemed probable that a connection of an intimate character might
be found to subsist between the two substances. Our experiments lead
to the conclusion that this     is,
                                in fact, the case, and that phylloxanthin
may by the prolonged action of acids be converted into phyllocyanin.
This convertibility has frequently been suspected, but has never yet
been satisfactorily proved.
   The changes which take place in the spectrum of chlorophyll on
the addition of acids to its solutions have long been known, they have
been accurately described by Russell and Lapraik in their memoir
entitled " A Spectroscopic Study of Chlorophyll."            *
   According to these observers, when a few drops of hydrochloric
acid are added to an ethereal solution of chlorophyll, the colour of the
latter changes from bright green to yellowish-green.         At the same
time the spectrum of the solution undergoes a marked change         bands

I and  II appeal- more clearly defined in consequence of the clearing
up of the space between them, while band        III is shifted nearer the
blue end  and becomes paler, band IV", on the other hand, becoming
much    darker.   After the solution has stood for a few days a fifth
band nearer the blue end, and equal in. intensity to the fourth, appears.
The same changes take place, but more slowly, when tartaric acid is
employed in place of hydrochloric acid.       When acetic acid, however,
is taken, the solution     remains unchanged for some time; it then
becomes yellowish-green and shows four bands as before, but the fifth
band never makes its appearance however much the action may be
prolonged.    These changes in the spectrum of chlorophyll solutions
on the addition of various acids may be explained by supposing that
pbylloxanthin is formed in the first instance, and is then, by the
continued action of the acid, converted into phyllocyanin.            The
conversion though slow, on the whole proceeds more rapidly at the
commencement than towards the end of the process, and is evidently
due to hydrolysis.     Similar phenomena are observed in the case of
melitose, the metamorphosis of which also passes through two stages,
being first converted by the action of emnlsin into melibiose, which
then by hydrolysis with acid yields galactose and fructose.
   The phylloxanthin employed in the experiments about to be
described was obtained in accordance with the directions given in
the fourth memoir of this series.       We have nothing to add to the
account there given of the properties of phylloxanthin, except that
when quite pure its solutions show only four absorption bands, not
five as there stated, a fifth band, when it appears, indicating the
presence of phyllocyanin.
   Into an ethereal solution of phylloxanthin free from phyllocyanin,
a current of dry hydrochloric acid gas was passed, the solution being
kept cool, until quite saturated, and it was then shaken up with
concentrated hydrochloric acid.        The latter gradually acquired a
bluish-green colour, which became darker ou standing.            The two
liquids having remained in contact for some time were separated, and
the lower acid one was mixed with several times its volume of water,
which gave an almost black flocculent precipitate.          The whole was
then shaken up with ether, in which the precipitate dissolved, yielding
a solution which, after washing with water, showed the olive-green
colour peculiar to solutions of phyllocyanin as well as the five
absorption bands belonging to the latter in their usual position and
with their usual relative intensities.     That a formation oE phyllocy
anin had actually taken place was proved by the following experi
ments.     The ethereal solution of the product obtained was evaporated.
Part of the residue left was dissolved in caustic soda ; the solution,
after standing for some time, was supersaturated with acetic acid,
 and then shaken up with ether j the ethereal solution was evaporated,

ethereal solution was dissolved in boilingalcoholic potash ; thesolution,
after filtration and addition of water, was acidified with acetic acid
and then shaken up with ether ; an ethereal solution was obtained
showing tho characteristic absorption spectrum of phyllotaonin.
   The experiments just described proving the convertibility of
phylloxanthin into phyllocyanin, tend to support the view held by
some observers that only one chlorophyll really exists, and that there
are not two or more chlorophylls as has sometimes been maintained.
Under the action of acids, chlorophyll yields phylloxanthin, which is
then converted into phyllocyanin.        The latter when treated with
alkalis gives phyllotaonin, and this, by the more energetic action of
alkalis at a higher temperature, yields phylloporphyrin. The pro
gressive increase in the number of absorption bands in passing
through this series, and the gradual shifting of the bands from the
red to the blue end of the spectrum, are points worthy of notice.

(hat corresponding halogen derivatives of the same hydrocarbon have
the same 7, the statement being no longer restricted to the mono-
halogen derivatives of the paraffins.
   The equality of the 7's of the two dichlorethanes, and of methyl
acetate and    ethyl formate, shows that the previously investigated
case of the two propyl chlorides does not stand alone, but that it is
probably true that isomeric bodies in general have the same 7.
   From the results for the substitution products of methane and
ethane with more than one halogen in the molecule it is shown that,
whether the first chlorine introduced into the molecule alters the
value of 7 or not, each chlorine after the first causes a fall in 7.
   SiCU has the same 7 as CCI4.     SH2 has nearly the same 7 as some
observers have found for OH,, but COa and CS, differ widely, whence
it follows that, just as in the case of hydrogen and chlorine, the pos
sibility of interchange of oxygen and sulphur without altering 7 does
not extend to the substitution of two atoms of sulphur for two of
oxygen.

                                 (Abstract.)
     In a  recent communication (' Phil. Trans.,' 1894, Series A, p. 857 ;
 1
   Roy. Soc. Proc.,' vol. 55, p. 108) the author described an instrument
 for grinding accurately orientated section-plates and prisms of crystals
 of artificial preparations.   The success of that instrument is so com
 plete that another instrument has been devised and constructed,
upon similar principles, but with the necessary modifications and
additions, to enable equally accurately orientated plates or prisms to
 be prepared from the relatively harder crystals of natural minerals.
     The new instrument is constructed upon a scale one-fifth larger
 than the former one as regards such parts as are fundamentally
 similar, to confer greater strength.     The main innovations are those
 of a cutting apparatus, capable of ready removal, in order not to
impede goniometrical, grinding, and polishing operations, and a mnch
larger grinding table fitted with a particularly convenient mode of
attachment for any one of nine interchangeable grinding and polish-
iug laps, suitable for use with crystals of every degree of hardness.
The accompanying illustration represents the lower portion of the
instrument, drawn from a point sufficiently high above the base to
most clearly exhibit the arrangement of the cutting apparatus.
The instrument is not intended to replace the one previously de
scribed, which is fully adapted to all the uses of chemical crystallo-
graphers, and the cost of which is only two-thirds that of the one
now described. It is intended especially for the use of mineralogists,
but, naturally, will likewise serve all the purposes of the smaller
instrument.

and   its centering (o) and adjusting (c) movements,            are similar in prin

The same likewise         applies to the goniometrical telescope d and colli

   The crystal holders, in addition to being provided with cross-
grooved     surfaces for the reception of the cementing wax, which
should be the hardest variety used by opticians, are further pro
vided with protecting rims, so that the wax is firmly held in a
shallow cup.         Three ordinary holders are supplied, of T\, f, and
i   in.   diameter respectively.           Two holders, of T*g and ^ in.
diameter,    are   also  furnished,   which permit of a certain amount of
rotation of the crystal after fixation of the holder in its socket, as
described in the former communication, and one of which is shown
in position at
                     /  in the illustration.         Also there is the special
holder for use in grinding a second surface parallel to the one first
prepared,- and it is provided with two lower caps pierced by apertures
of T'? and
               T\ in. respectively, together with a dozen glass discs
ground to     fit each.

table are concerned.     The table itself is much larger however, the laps
being 4^   ins. in diameter,  and it is differently constructed, in order to
permit of rapid change from one lap to another. The table is pro
vided with a permanent rigid gun-metal top g, slightly larger than
the laps, upon which the latter are laid. The laps carry below three
cylindrical projections, which pass through corresponding holes in
tho table, and they may be locked in this position by a plate carried
beneath the table, and which is rotatable for a sufficient amount by a
iMck and pinion actuated by a short lever; the plate is pierced by
tapering slots, wide enough at one end to allow the projections to fall
through or be removed, but narrowed at the other so as to gear in
niches cut in the projections.        The lap h is placed in position, or
lifted out when it is desired to remove         it, while the lever    rotated
                                                                      is

a   lap of boxwood, either for grinding soft mineral crystals or for
polishing, are likewise supplied.       There are also three glass laps for
use with artificial crystals, one moderately ground for rough grinding,
the second extremely finely ground, and another of plain plate glass,
the last two for polishing, and all three to be lubricated with oil.
The final polisher of ordinary plate glass furnishes admirably
polished surfaces, and best of all when the amount of oil        is extremely
small.
    The cutting apparatus     is  carried at    a  suitable height above the
level of the grinding table upon     a   rigid horizontal   arm pivoted upon
the back pillar     k   of the instrument, so that         can be completely

rotated out of the way during grinding operations, and farther sup
ported when required for use upon an adjunct of the right front
pillar I.    It consists of a 4-in. disc of soft iron m, supplied with
diamond edge, and intended to be lubricated with brick oil, supported
truly parallel to the grinding table between two stout broad washers,
carried by the almost frictionless axle, and driven by an independent
driving gear the latter
              ;              is  somewhat similarly arranged to that            of
the grinding apparatus, in order that the pressure of the band round
the pulley which tarns with the axle of the cutter shall be equal on
each side to minimise friction, and       is  entirely carried upon the arm.
The latter  is    bent inwards towards the crystal, so that the cutting
eJge may be conveniently approached.

                         catting discs are supplied, one of the usual
     Three interchangeable
thickness of a lapidary's cutter, and two somewhat thicker, which
are preferable on account of their greater rigidity ; their edges are
carefully squared and charged with diamond dust in the usual
manner.          In order to protect the instrument from particles projected
during cutting, the disc is surrounded, except        in the vicinity of tho
crystal,  with a readily removable guard n. A second larger guard
is   also supplied in order to afford more complete protection to the
optical tubes ; it consists of a thin metal disc considerably larger
than the grinding table, upon which it is intended to rest, and fitted
round one-half of its circumference with a rim If in. high, sufficient
to protect the telescope and collimator, while not interfering with the
freedom of movement of the arm of the cutting apparatus.              The
support upon the front pillar is removable when the cutter is not in
use, so as to leave room for grinding ; the pillar carries in front at
the convenient height a rectangular       thickening o, out of which a
vertical dove-tailed recess is cut, within which a corresponding dove
tail p, forming the back portion of the main casting of the attachment,
is capable of sliding until arrested at the proper height, corresponding
to the perfectly horizontal position of the cutter and its arm, by a stop.
   This attachment includes not only the supporting fork q for the
arm, but also the apparatus for directing           and controlling the
cutting.   The latter consists of a horizontal traversing bed r and
sliders, manipulated by the large milled head t of the traversing screw ;
the arm is attached to the slider by being gripped between a small
spring piston v and a hinged wedge-shaped hook it), the latter being so
shaped in order that it may be pushed out of the way while the arm
passes     it,
           after which a spring x causes    to fall down behind the arm.

avoided, the spring giving way before the pressure becomes danger
ously great and the piston being pulled out of the cylinder.        Two
inches of traverse are permitted by the length of the slot        of the
                                                                   z

 328              Mr. A. E. Tutton.      An Instrument for       [Feb. 14,
 surface is exactly parallel to the cutting disc and grinding lap, is
 carried out as described in the former communication.         When about
to commence cutting, the crystal is first lowered by means of the
 milled bead at the top of the instrument until it is at a convenient
 level for cutting, in which position it is fixed by first clamping the
 circle to the fixed cone by means of the milled headed screw forming
 part of the arrangement for fine adjustment, and then preventing
any movement of the gun-metal axis by tightening the collar imme
diately above the circle by means of a key provided.            Cutting is
then proceeded with, commencing rotation of the cutter and its tra
versing slowly at first, and gradually increasing the speed according
 to the " feel" of the cutting.     If by inadvertence a jam should ever
occur, a slight reversal of the motion of the traversing screw will
 instantly release the cutter. The speed should be materially reduced
towards the finish, in order that the end of the crystal may be cut off
cleanly right up to the furthest edge. A hard crystal such as a
topaz, ^ in. thick, may be easily cut through in 10 to 15 minutes,
 and the cnt surface is so smooth that very little grinding is required,
which may at once be proceeded with upon the gun-metal or hard
 white-metal lap, with the finest washed flour emery made into a
moderately thick paste with water or brick-oil. The latter lubricant
offers the advantage of greater immunity from splashing, although
not perhaps so convenient in other respects.
    A. thick glass disc, about I in. in diameter, is provided for use as a
" bruiser," to work down the emery paste to an even consistency upon
the lap before grinding.      The pressure between crystal and lap is
controlled by manipulation of the counterpoised levers, as described
in the former memoir, and the path of the crystal upon the lap
changed from time to time by use of the centering movements, in
order to prevent undue local wearing of the lap.
    A further useful accessory is a small stand consisting of a weighted
base carrying an upright tubular stem, in which a lengthening rod
is capable of sliding, which latter carries an adjustable support,
formed by a couple of short links united by ball-and-socket joints, for
an oblique caoutchouc wedge.         The latter, when directed down upon
the lap, not quite in contact with the metallic surface cf the latter,
serves to keep the emery paste moving into the path of the crystal
during grinding.       When soft artificial crystals are being groumi
upon    the  glass  laps, the wedge may be replaced by a camel-hair
brush, to keep the path well supplied with the lubricating oil.
    The surfaces prepared by the fine grinding are usually sufficiently
transparent for the purposes of optical investigations, plates perpen
dicular to the median lines exhibiting clearly defined interference
figures in convergent polarised light. If a higher polish is desired,
the polishing laps supplied will enable this to be attained.

   After the completion of the operations upon the first surface, the
cutting of the second js proceeded with while the crystal is still
adjusted, the latter being fixed at the suitable height for the purpose.
The plate thus cut off is cemented      by the finished surface to one of
the small glass discs provided with the special holder, and the
finishing of the second surface carried out with the disc supported
in the holder, whose true plane has previously been adjusted parallel
 to the lap, as described in the former communication.
    When a prism is to be prepared the crystal is first adjusted so that
the plane of optical elasticity to which the two desired prism faces
are to be symmetrical is parallel to the grinding lap, and likewise
so that the direction of the desired edge, parallel to an axis of optical
elasticity, is at right angles to the upper tangent screw of the adjust
ing apparatus.      The latter is then rotated 30°, the crystal arranged
at the convenient height for cutting, and the end cut off.       The cut
surface is then finished upon the laps.      The tangent screw is next
rotated back to the adjusted position, and for 30° upon the other side
of that, when, after fixing at the proper height, the second surface is
cut.   The 60" prism thus cut off is again set in wax on the holder
with the second surface exposed, and the latter is then brought
parallel to the lap by goniornetrical adjustment, and ground and
polished, if desired, in like manner to the first.      The two surfaces
will invariably afford brilliant single reflected images of the spectro
meter slit, and transmit equally well-defined refracted images when
arranged  for minimum deviation.
   Instead of actuating the driving gear of the cutting or grinding
apparatus by hand, which, however, is very light labour owing to the
freedom from friction, a small electric, gas, or water motor may be
employed.    For this purpose the driving wheel a of the grinding
apparatus is supplied with two annular niches, the upper of which is
intended for the reception of the band from the motor ; and two
similar driving pulleys, one,   for hand rotation, and the other, y, for
                               /3,
use with the motor, are fitted at the two ends of the driving axle of
the cutting apparatus, that for hand driving being above the arm at
the level of the other pulleys of the cutting apparatus, and that for
the  reception of the band from the motor being arranged below the
arm, at the level of the upper niche of the grinding pulley.    Asmall
electric motor, driven by the current from three pint bichromate cells,
affords ample power for the purpose, and the speed of revolution       is
best controlled by a friction brake upon the motor.
   The instrument has been constructed by Messrs. Troughton and
Simms, who are prepared to furnish copies of either this or the
smaller instrument.      The author desires to express his thanks to

       "                  "
toe," clubbing," or anbury," attacks turnips, rape, cabbages of all
varieties, radishes, and, in fact, most cultivated plants belonging to
the order Cruciferm.         Several common weeds are also attacked,
namely, charlock (Brassica Sinapistrum, Boiss.),                     garlic-mustard
(Sisymbrium Alliaria, Scop.), treacle-mustard (Erysimum Cheiran-
thnides, Linn.), and shepherd's purse (Capsella bursa-pwtoris, D.C.).
The last-named is reported from the United States by Halsted,* and
has not been observed to be diseased in Britain, although one of our
commonest weeds.         The disease is characterised by the formation of
numerous nodules on the root, which becomes much distorted and
soon decays, forming a slimy, fcetid mass.
   Berkeleyf appears to have been the first to investigate the disease
from a scientific standpoint, and although he did not succeed in deter
mining the true cause, distinctly states that microscopic examination
revealed the presence of a factor previously unknown in connection
with plant diseases. Furthermore, Berkeley pointed out that wood
ashes were a cure for the disease, and supposed this to be due to the
presence of potash salts in the ash.
   Owing to the serious amount of damage caused by " finger and
    "
toe   to the cabbage crop in Russia, the Government of that conntry
offered a reward for the discovery of the cause of the disease.
WoroninJ undertook the investigation, and after years of patient
study published an elaborate account, proving clearly that the
disease was caused by a minute organism related to the fungi, to
which he gave the name Plasmodiophora brassicce.
   In 1859, Voelcker§ pointed out that the disease was influenced by
the amount of lime present in the soil. Where little or no lime
existed, as in light and sandy soils, the disease abounded, whereas in

roborated by the same author at a later date.*
    The following is an account of experiments conducted during four
successive years at Kew.
    1. Healthy seedling cabbages           planted in soil that had two years
 previously produced a crop of diseased cabbages, became diseased.
 Check plants from the same batch of seed, grown in sterilised soil,
remained free from disease.             Somervillef has also demonstrated
 that turnips become diseased when the seed is sown in soil brought
 from an infected area.
   A. Experiments conducted       in a Sterilised Solution of Stable Manure.
    2.  The contents of two flasks were infected by adding crushed
 tubercles    of a diseased cabbage root.             2 per cent. of a saturated
 solution of potassium hydrate was added to the contents of one flask,
and 2 per cent. of commercial sulphuric acid to the other.                   A young
cabbage plant free from disease was then placed in each flask.                     At
the end of two months the plant in the flask containing potassium
 hydrate was growing vigorously              and perfectly free from disease,
 whereas the plant growing in the solution containing sulphuric acid
 was badly diseased,     much more so than check plants growing in
 infected soil free from acid, for the same period of time.                   Similar
experiments      made during successive years always yielded the same
result.
    3.  Two young cabbage plants showing decided symptoms of disease
 were placed in flasks containing the same proportions of potassium
 hydrate and sulphuric acid respectively as in Experiment 1. At the
end of two months the plant growing in the solution containing
potassium hydrate appeared to be perfectly healthy, the indications of
nodnles present on the root at the commencement of the experiment
having become effaced by subsequent growth.                     The plant growing
in the solution containing sulphuric acid was badly diseased.
    Similar results were obtained in Experiments              1  and 2,  when potas
sium hydrate was replaced by ammonium hydrate, and sulphuric
acid by hydrochloric acid.
    4. Two diseased seedling cabbages were placed in separate flasks of
the sterilised solution.      The liquid in one flask was saturated once a
week with carbonic dioxide, the contents of the second flask not
being interfered with in any way.            At the end of two months both
plants had the disease developed to the same extent, proving that
carbonic acid is neutral as regards the development of Plasmodio-
phorce.

                  B. Experiments conducted with Sterilised Soil.
  5. Two pots of soil, sterilised by steam, were infected with the crushed
roots of diseased cabbages.       The soil in one pot was mixed with
quicklime, that in the other with bone manure, having an acid
reaction. A healthy cabbage seedling was planted in each pot, and
at the end of two months the plant in the pot containing lime was
perfectly healthy, whereas the plant in the soil containing acid bone
manure was badly diseased.
   6. Two pots containing soil mixed with quicklime and acid bone
manure respectively had a diseased cabbage seedling placed in each.
At the end of two months the disease was more developed in both
seedlings than at the time of planting ; proving that the presence of
lime will not arrest the disease when the plants are once attacked.
                                       Summary.
   The foregoing observations and experiments demonstrate the
following points : —                                     '
   1. That in addition to cultivated plants, several common weeds
belonging to the order Crucif¦rm are attacked by the Plasmodiophora.
Hence the necessity for preventing the growth of such weeds in fields
and hedge-banks.
    2. That the germs of disease are present in soil that has produced a
diseased crop, and retain their vitality for at least two years.
   3. That the development of Plasmodiophora is favoured by the
presence of acids, and checked by the presence of alkalies, agreeing in
this respect with the fungi rather than with bacteria.
   4. For the purpose of sterilising infected soil, experiments prove
that either a dressing of lime or a manure containing potash salts is
effective, the last being most valuable, as it not only destroys the
germs in the soil but also arrests the disease in seedling plants, and
at. the same time supplies one of the ingredients      necessary for the
healthy growth of turnips.

    § 1.   At  the meeting of the British Association in Oxford in August,

1894, a communication was given to section A, entitled         Preliminary
Experiments to find if Subtraction of Water from Air Electrifies it."
These experiments were performed during July of 1894, and were a
continuation of experiments which were commenced in the Physical
Laboratory of the University of Glasgow in December of 1868 with
the same object, but which were then, for various reasons, discon
tinued before any decisive result had been obtained.
    § 2. A glass U-tube with vertical branches (fig. 1), each 18 inches
long and about 1-inch bore, with the upper 8 inches of one of the
branches carefully coated outside and inside with clean shellac varnish,
was held fixed by an uninsulated support attached to the upper end
of this branch.       The other branch was filled with little fragments of
pumice soaked in strong sulphuric acid or in water, and a fine
                                     Fig. 1.

platinum wire, with one end touching the pumice, connected it to the
 insulated electrode of a quadrant electrometer. A metal can, M,
 large enough to surround both branches of the U-tube without
 touching either, was placed so as to guard the tube from electric
 influences of surrounding bodies, the most disturbing of which is
 liable to be the woollen cloth sleeves of the experimenters or observers
moving in the neighbourhood.        This metal can was kept in metallic
connection with the outside metal case of the qnadrant electrometer.
The length of the exposed platinum wire between the U-tQbe and
the electrometer was so short that it did not need a metal screen
 to guard it against irregular influences.     An india-rubber tube from
an ordinary blow-pipe bellows was connected to the uninsulated end
of the U-thbe.       Air was blown through it steadily for nearly an
hour. With the pumice soaked in strong sulphuric acid in the other
branch, the electrometer reading rose in the course of three-quarters
of an hour to about 9 volts positive.       When the pumice was moistened
with water, instead of sulphuric acid, no such effect was observed.     The
result of the first experiment proves decisively that the passage of
the air through the U^abe gave positive electricity to the sul
phuric acid, and therefore sent away the dried air with negative
electricity.    A corresponding experiment with fragments of pare
chloride of calcium instead of pumice in sulphuric acid, gave a
similar result.     In repetition of the experiments, however, it was
noticed that the strong positive electrification of the U-tube seemed
to commence somewhat suddenly when a gurgling sound — due to the
bubbling of air through free liquid, whether sulphuric acid or
chloride of calcium solution in the bend of the U-tube — began to be
heard , It has since been ascertained that it was because no liquid
accumulated in the bottom of the       \J -tube that no electric effect was
found when the pumice was moistened with pure water.
    § 3. Arrangements were made to prevent any bubbling of the air
through liquid, by using a straight tube instead of a [J -tube. In a
large number of experiments with pumice, moistened with pure sal-
phuric acid, in the straight tube, and air blown through for about
half an hour, no definite electrification was obtained.             In this
straight tube, as formerly with the U -tube, pumice moistened with
pure water gave no electrification.        Chloride of calcium in lumps,
not specially dried, gave no effect in the straight tube ; but if
previously heated to 180° or 200° and put into the straight tube
when still hot, it gave an enormous positive electrification imme
diately on the commencement of blowing.           Strong positive electrifi
cation was obtained a second time, by discharging the electrometer
to zero, re-insulating, and re-commencing the blowing.           But after
discharging a second time, re-insulating,        and re-commencing the
blowing, no further electrification was found.

  ber the arrangement represented in fig. 2 was set up.             An outer

 metallic guard-vessel,    M, was kept connected by a wire to the case and
 to one pair of quadrants of a quadrant electrometer, E.         Water in an
 inner glass or metal jar, A, was connected by a platinum wire to the
 other pair of qnadrants of the electrometer.        To have this inner jar
 well insulated,   it was supported on   a block of paraffin ; and the upper
 end of a   glass tube dipping into the water was fitted into one end of
 a tube of paraffin, to the other end of which was fitted a tube for
 ingress of air, from bellows, as shown in the figure.         The insulation
 of this arrangement was found to be good.            When air was blown
 through the water it was found that the jar containing the water
became    positively electrified.
    § 5. To prevent splashing of water out of the jar, a paper cover
 was   put on its mouth, or the jar was tilted, as shown in fig. 3,

so  that the bubbles broke against the inside of the jar. In three
experiments      thus made, the same electrification was still found,
amounting to about 6 volts positive in a quarter of an hour.

apparatus consists of a large sheet iron vat,        123 cm. in diameter

lead, and supported by three blocks of wood. By filling the tray
with water, the air      confined in the vat.

electrometer, and with the vat.      It surrounds both the electrometer
and the water-dropper, to prevent any external varying electrifica
tions from vitiating the proper results of our experiments.
   This screening of the electrometer       absolutely necessary when
                                               is                                      it
is used with high sensibility (70 scale divisions per volt in our experi
ments) in a laboratory or other place where various other electric ex
periments may simultaneously be going on. Four years ago the electro
meter, the vat, and the water-dropper, were set up on the class-room
table without a metal screen.      When the deflection indicated about
4  volts negative (see    8),
                          §   the negative lead of Lord Kelvin's house
electric-light circuit, which passes through the class-room, was joined
to earth.     This changed the deflection of the electrometer suddenly
by      volt in the positive direction.
        1                                   When the positive lead was
 "earthed," the deflection was changed suddenly by           volts in the
                                                                    6

a  volt in the negative direction.

     § 8. In experimenting with the same apparatus* in 1890 it was
  found that the water jet gave negative electricity to the ordinary air
  of the laboratory enclosed in the vat.              The present experiments fully
  confirm    this result, showing a gradual negative electrification of the
  enclosed mass of air rising to about 5 volts in an hour, once every day
 for the first few days. For twenty-eight days after the vat was set up
 in October,       1894, fifteen observations          of an hour each were taken,
 to find the effect of the water-dropper, with no other disturbing
 influence on the unchanged volume of air inside the vat.                          These
 experiments        verify the  conclusion        (' Phil. Mag.,'  August,    1890) that
 the more the air inside the vat became free of dust, the less became the
 rate at which the air was negatively electrified by the water-dropper.
    § 9. On the loth October last the vat was lifted from the tray to
remove some obstruction            in the nozzle of the water-dropper,            which
 was   not then flowing freely.          Curve (6) was obtained that afternoon.

The air in the vat was the ordinary air of the laboratory, and the
curve shows the effect of the water-dropper alone in electrifying the
air negatively.   For the next two days the water-dropper was kept
running continuously for about eight hours each day, to wash the dust
out of the air, and on the 18th of October curve (7) was obtained. It
shows a much less rate of negative electrification than curve (6). In
the experiments of summer 1890 an aspirator was used to draw the
air from the vat, and a tube full of cotton-wool was used to filter
the air drawn into the vat.
   Curves (1) to (5) are reproduced from the ' Philosophical Maga
zine,' and they show that the more the air becomes free from dust
the less is the rate at which the water-dropper electrifies.      Thus
curve (1) was obtained from the ordinary air of the laboratory, in the
vat, and curve (2) after the aspirator was working for some time. In
this curve the water-dropper itself was running for some time befor¦
the first observation was taken. The other curves were obtained
after further continuous working of the aspirator.

    After curve (4) was obtained the aspirator was worked continu
 ously for twenty-five hours, and then curve (5) was obtained.
    § 10. At the end of twenty-three days of October and November
 1894   (§§  8, 9 above), when the     air inside the vat must have been
 fairly free from dust, and when the water-dropper of itself was giving
 little negative electrification, we bubbled air into it by a forked tube,
 one end of which was connected to a bellows, and three other open
 ends were below the water inside the vat.         In five experiments thus
made — two on November 7, two on November 8, and one on Decem
ber 17 — an average negative electrification of 5 volts in twelve
minutes was obtained.
    § 11. We now arranged a U-tube with pure water in it (fig. 4)
outside the vat. Air from the bellows bubbled through the water
in this U, and was carried thence by a block-tin pipe into the
vat without any further bubbling.            Observations by the quadrant
electrometer, while the water-dropper was running and the bellows
worked, gave us measurements of the varying state of the electrifica
tion of the air in the vat. The average of fifteen experiments gave
a   negative    electrification of the air in the vat of 8£ volts in 25

minutes. The rate at which the air was blown in in these experi
ments was such as to displace the entire volume of air in the vat in
half an hour.
    § 12. Curve (8) shows the rate of electrification of air, in one of
the fifteen experiments, when thus bubbled through the water in the
U-tube and then admitted into the vat.
   § 13. Two U -tubes, in series, with water in each, did not seem to
give a perceptibly cumulative effect.
   § 14. The effect of one or more wire gauze strainers between the
 U-tube and the vat, or between the U -tube and the bellows, was
next tested.     The gauzes were placed between short lengths of lead
tube,   which  were  held together by a rubber tube slipped over them.
The arrangement is shown by longitudinal and cross sections in fig. 5.
                                    Fig. 5.
 Twelve wire gauzes,        with or without cotton- wool between them,
 placed between    the  bellows and the U-tube, did not prevent the sub
sequent electrification by bubbling of the air thus filtered.     Bat when
 placed between the U"tube and the vat they almost entirely diselec-
trified the air, even without the cotton-wool, and still more decidedly
 when cotton-wool was loosely packed between the wire gauzes.             A
 single wire-gauze strainer produced but little of dis-electrifying effect.
     § 15. The interpretation of these experiments is complicated, and
 the time required for each is lengthened, on account of the large
 mass of air in the vat to start with, whether uncharged or retaining
 electricity from previous experiments, and also on account of the
 effect of the water-dropper itself.     Hence, in our later experiments,
 we fell back on the arrangement shown in fig. 2, by which we test
 the electrification of the liquid, and not directly that of the gas blown
 through it.
     § 16. In our first experiments with this apparatus the      amount   of
 the electrification   did not seem much affected when a paper cover
 was put on the jar, or when we tilted the jar as shown in fig. 3.
 We now made a large number of tests with different covers and
 screens (chiefly of sheet copper or sheet zinc, or brass wire gauze) at
 different heights above the liquids, and we concluded that, if the
 screens are not within a centimetre and a half of the liquid surface,
 they do not directly affect the magnitude of the electrification obtained.
 In nearly all of the subsequent experiments a horizontal circular screen

  of  thin sheet copper, leaving an air space of about 3 mm. all round
  between its edge and the inner surface of the jar, about 3 cm. above
  the liquid surface, was used to prevent spherules of the liquid from
  being tossed out of the jar by the bubbling.
     § 17. In the following short summary of our results the duration
  of each experiment was 10 minutes.-             The effect of blowing air
  through water and other liquids is summarised in §§ 18 to 27, and of
  blowing other gases than air through water in §§ 28 to 31.
     § 18. The jar contained 200 c.c. of the Glasgow town-supply water
  (from Loch Katrine).       A mean of seventeen experiments showed an
 electrification   of the jar to 4 volts positive when air was blown
 through    it for 10 minutes.
     § 19. A solution of zinc sulphate of different strengths was now
 used instead of the pure water.             Three experiments, with 150 c.c.
 of water containing one drop of a saturated solution of the zinc
 sulphate, gave half the positive electrification that would, under
 similar circumstances, have been obtained from water only.                With
 five drops no definite electrification was obtained.             With greater
 proportions of the zinc sulphate solution up to saturation (twenty-
 four experiments altogether) the electrification was on the average
 slightly negative.
     § 20. Twelve experiments were then made to test the effect of
 adding a solution of ammonia to the water.             One drop reduced the
 electrification to one-half; two drops brought it down to one-quarter.
 With larger proportions of ammonia than this, up to a saturated
 solution, we found a very slight positive electrification, never amount
 ing to more than a small fraction of a volt, and therefore negligible
 in the circumstances.
     § 21. Seven experiments with sulphuric acid of different strengths
all showed small positive electrification, the amount gradually de
creasing from ^ volt, in 10 minutes, with 0-5 per cent, acid in water
to -fa   volt, in the same time, with acid of      full strength.
     Seven experiments with hydrochloric acid solution of different
strengths all showed a small negative electrification, the amount
gradually increasing from ^ volt, in 10 minutes, with             per cent, acid
solution in water to      \\ volts, in the same time, with acid solution of
full strength.
     Nine experiments with calcium chloride solution were made. A
saturated solution and a solution diluted to 75 per cent, of full
strength gave no result; bnt solutions of gradually • diminished
strength, from 50 per cent, down to -j^ per cent., showed a negative
electrification from fully     \  volt, in 10 minutes, down to -jL- volt.
     Additions of very small quantities of washing soda to water greatly
reduce the positive electrification obtained.
     Loch Katrine water, supersaturated with carbonic acid, and placed

in the insulated jar, showed, when air was bubbled through it for                   ten
minutes, a negative electrification of volt.   J
    § 22.   Ten drops of paraffin oil added to water reduced the electri
fication to about half of that obtained from water only. Thirty drops
reduced it to about a tenth, which as it amounted to only 0-4 volt
during the time of the experiment is negligible.
    § 23. Ten drops of benzene reduced the electrification to half, and
thirty drops to about a third of that taken by pure water.
    § 24. A saturated solution of granulated phenol (carbolic acid)
was made, and small portions of it added to the water in the jar.
Several experiments showed no diminution in the electrification as
long as the quantity of the phenol solution present in the water was
under 10 per cent.         With 25 per cent. the electrification was reduced
to a third. With strengths greater than this up to saturation the
electrification was reduced to one-sixth.
    § 25. A saturated solution of common salt was prepared.                  Blowing
air through 200 c.c. of water containing the quantities of the salt
solution mentioned, gave us in 10 minutes the following electrifi
cations : —

    § 26.   Several experiments showed that with 200 c.c. of water con
taining not more than ten drops of absolute alcohol, practically the
same amount of positive electrification (4 volts in ten minutes) is
obtained as if pure water were used. With fifty drops less than
2 volts were got, and with 100 drops less than 1 volt.                   25 and 50
per   cent.  alcohol  in the   water   gave   very   small   and hence     negligible
positive electrification.
    § 27. One drop of saturated solution of copper sulphate in 200 ex.
of water showed 1 volt positive in 10 minutes.                With      per cent, of
it in the water, the electrification was reduced to a fraction of a
volt positive. With greater proportions of copper sulphate present,
up to saturation, slightly negative electrifications were obtained, but
never amounting to more than about one-tenth of a volt, and hence
negligible.
    § 28. On blowing carbonic acid gas, from a cylinder obtained from
the Scotch and Irish Oxygen Company, through pure water in the
glass jar, the water became electrified to 8f volts positive in ten
minutes.      Blowing the breath through water gave an electrification
of 3 volts positive in the same time : this diminished result is doubt
less due chiefly to the diminished rate of bubbling.

    § 29.  The blowing of oxygen from a cylinder, obtained from the
  Oxygen Company, through water, gave as a mean of fonr experiments,
  a positive electrification  to the water of half a volt in 10 minutes.
  When continued for 55 minutes, it gave the very decided result of
  5 volts positive.
    § 30.  Hydrogen prepared from zinc and dilute sulphuric acid was
 passed into a large metal gas-holder ; and was passed on from this to
 bubble through the water in the insulated jar.         In two experiments
 this was done immediately after the preparation of the hydrogen ; in
 another it was done after the hydrogen had remained 18 hours in the
gas-holder.      In each of the three experiments the water was electrified
 to 2 volts positive in 10 minutes.
    When the hydrogen was allowed to pass direct through a tube
from the Wolffe's bottle where it was generated, to bubble in the in
sulated jar, the magnitude of the effect obtained was very much
larger.     In one case a mixture of muriatic acid and sulphuric acid
and water was used, and the reading went off the scale positive in
30 seconds (more than 10 volts). In other two experiments, with dilute
sulphuric acid and zinc in the Wolffe's bottle, the electrifications
obtained were 6 volts positive in 7 minutes, and 7-3 volts positive
in 13 minutes, in the last of which the hydrogen was allowed to
babble through caustic potash contained in a small bottle between
the Wolffe's bottle and the insulated jar.
    The hydrogen was next generated in the insulated jar itself, the
tube for ingress of air used in the ordinary experiments being taken
away.      200 c.c. of pnre water, along with some granulated zinc, was
put into the jar.        Then some pure sulphuric acid was added, and
electrometer readings were taken.           In two experiments with no
screen in the jar (§ 16) the reading went off the scale negative (1)
in 2 minutes and (2) in 4 minutes (more than 9 volts in each case).
In another experiment, in other respects the same, but with a copper
screen 7 cm. above the surface of the liquid, the electrification
showed 2 volts negative in 2 minutes, then came back to zero in
5 minutes, and in the next 6 minutes went 4 volts positive.        The jar
and pair     of quadrants connected with it were then metallically con
nected    with the outer case of the electrometer for a few seconds, and
reinsulated ; in 5 minutes the reading went up to 2 volts positive.       A
little more sulphuric acid was added to the jar,        which was  disinsu-
lated for a short time and         reinsulated ; the reading went up to
7 volts positive in 4 minutes.       The jar was again disinsulated for a
few seconds and reinsulated ; the reading went up in 4| minutes to
6^   volts positive.

quantity of water in the bottom of the jar it was noticed that the
electrification did not commence to be perceptible generally till abont
the end of the first minute ; and that it went on augmenting per-
ceptibly for a minute or more after the bubbling was stopped.        The
following experiment was therefore tried several times. One of
ns stood leaning over the jar, with the head about 10 ins. above                it,
and the mouth so partly closed that breathing was effected sideways             ;
another blew the bellows and another took the readings of the
                                  ;
electrometer. After bubbling had been going on for some minutes,
and the readings were rising gradually        volts per 10 minutes, as in
                                               (4
§  18), blowing was stopped.    As soon as the bubbling ceased, the
first-mentioned observer,  without   moving his head or his body (see
§   7,regarding the necessity to have the electrometer screened from
outside influences) blew into the jar to displace the negatively
electrified air in it. In every case the electrometer reading showed
instantly a small rise in the positive direction.
    In the carrying out of these experiments we have received much
valuable help from Walter Stewart, M.A., and Patrick Hamilton,

 natural   to borrow the first letter of Lord Rayleigh's and Professor
 Ramsay's names to give to the unknown lines, and in the measure
 ments of the photographs which showed the lines well, there appears
an"R" against seventeen lines out of sixty-one measured, the re
 maining lines being known to belong to Hg, H, N, and nitrocarbons.
 It transpires now, as I learnt from reading the abstract of the paper
in which Lord Rayleigh and Professor Ramsay describe their con
summate researches on- argon, that the symbol
                                                  " A " should have been
used instead of

                           designate the lines on my photographs.
the lines are Argon lines.
    The conditions under which the spectrum of argon has appeared
in my investigations are of interest at the present time, and I hope a
description of them may not be unacceptable.
    A glass bulb was sealed hermetically to a mercury pump of the
Hagen-Topler form, in which there was strong sulphuric acid floating
on the surface of the mercury.        The bulb was exhausted as low as
possible and refilled with air.     The pressure was reduced to about
 180 Millionth s of an atmosphere (= 0"14 mm.), at which pressure a
bright discharge could be passed through the residual gases by means
of Professor J. J. Thomson's method of surrounding the bulb by a
 c0l of wire, which carries a very rapidly alternating current produced
by the discharge of a condenser.
    The discharge was passed for thirty minutes, during which time a
photograph of the spectrum was taken. The pressure of the gas in
the bulb fell during the passage of the discharge from the value
174 M (= 0-13 mm.) to 112 M (= 0 085 mm.).           The spectrum shows
the bands of nitrogen strong, also mercury lines and nitrocarbon
groups strong, hydrogen weak, no oxygen or argon.
   Again the discharge was passed for thirty minutes and a new pho
tograph was taken.      The pressure fell from 100 M (= 0-076mm.) to
20 M (= 0-015 mm.) ; the nitrogen spectrum had faded considerably,
and there had appeared a number of fine lines which        I was unable,
in spite of careful efforts, to identify with the lines of any known
substances.
   The nature of my method of investigation of spectra is such that
it is not difficult to pick out of the numerous spectra which appear
superposed on the photographic plate, the lines which belong to any
one spectrum.      [The photographic reproductions sent herewith show
clearly the ease with which this may be done.]
   The results of measurement made in the last few days of seventy-

by side are given the measurements of the wave-lengths determined
by Mr. Crookes for the argon lines.
   The agreement of the measurements shows conclusively that we
have been measuring the same spectrum.           Between HY and wave-

length 370, the agreement is all that we could hope for, taking into
account the fact that my measurements were not made with a view of
giving a final and carefully-considered set of measurements of wave
lengths, but between Hy and Hp there is a systematic difference of
about 3 tenth-metres, which          I am unable at present to account for.
The agreement of grouping and intensity, however, leaves no doubt
as to the identity of the spectrum of my low-pressure lines with the
spectrum of argon.         I have reduced my measurements with reference
to Rowland's scale of wave-lengths, and I infer from the value
adopted for the Hp (F) line, that Angstrom's scale has been used in
Mr. Crookes' reduction. The difference between the scales is not
enough to account for the discrepancies above referred to.
   The expariments were repeated, with slight variations, several
times with results which, so far as the spectrum of argon is concerned,
 were constant.       But it was noted that continued passage of the dis
charge appears to result in the attaining of a certain minimum pres
sure, after which there is slight and slow rise to a tolerably-fixed
pressure.     It is not necessary to dwell on these points in the present
note.
   It  is interesting to find argon asserting itself, unsolicited, in quite
new circumstances, and under conditions which practically constitute
one more mode of separating argon from nitrogen —namely, the
getting rid of nitrogen by passing electric discharge through it in
the presence of hydrogen or moisture and acid.

 1895.]         Iron and Steel at Welding Temperatures.            351
 IIL " Iron and Steel at Welding Temperatures." By THOMAS
        Wrightson, Memb. Inst. C.E.          Communicated by Pro
        fessor   Roberts-Austen,     C.B.,  F.R.S.     Received   Feb
        ruary  2. 1895.
                               (Abstract.)
   The object of this paper is to demonstrate that the phenomenon of
welding in iron is identical with that of regelation in ice.
   The author recapitulates experiments made by him in 1879-80,
described in the proceedings of the Iron and Steel Institute for those
years.
   These experiments were upon cast iron, and proved the fact that
this form of iron possessed the property of expanding while passing
from the liquid to the plastic state during a small range of tempera
ture, and then contracted to the solid state, and that the expansion
amounted to about 6 per cent, in volume.
   The experiments were carried out under two distinct methods, the
first being by the suspending of a cast-iron ball on a spiral spring,
and lowering the ball under the surface of a vessel filled with molten
iron of the same quality    ; the change of volume was registered by
the contraction of the  spring as the varying displacement of the ball
varied its buoyancy.
   The second method was by casting 15-in. spheres of cast iron,
and measuring the changing diameter as the sphere cooled, then
laying down on paper a curve of changing volume, which in general
character was found to be similar to the curves produced by the
instrument used in the first method.
   This property of iron resemblesi the similar property of water in
freezing, which, within a range of about 4° C, expands about 9 per
cent, of its liquid volume, and then contracts as the cooling proceeds.
   This property of water was investigated by Professor James
Thomson and by Lord Kelvin.           The former showed that from
theoretical considerations there was reason to expect that in the case
of a body exhibiting the anomalous property of expanding when
cooled and contracting when heated, it should be cooled instead of
heated by pressure or impact.
    Lord Kelvin investigated the problem experimentally as affecting
freezing water, and completely demonstrated the truth of his brother's
 reasoning.
    The experiments made by the author in 1879 and 1880 suggested
the view that this property of ice was connected with the property of
welding in iron, but this was only hypothetical, as the experiments
 had been made on cast iron, which, probably on account of the

352            Iron and Steel at Welding Temperatures.      [Feb.  21,
presence   of carbon, does    not   possess the property of welding.
Further, it was not practicable to experiment with wrought iron in
the same way as with cast iron on account of the difficulty of dealing
with that substance in its liquid form.
   Professor Eoberts-Austen has, however, given metallurgical re
search a recording pyrometer, and this has enabled the author to
resume the investigation at the Mint, where be had the advantage ot
Professor Roberts-Austen's     assistance and advice.    The method
adopted was the heating of bars in an electric welder, and as soon as
the junction of the bars was at a welding temperature, end pressure
was applied by mechanical power, and the weld effected.
   The temperature at the point of welding was observed by placing a
thermo-junction at this point consisting of a platinum wire twisted
into a second wire of platinum alloyed with 10 per cent. of rhodium.
The electric current produced at the thermo-junction deflected a
galvanometer, which by means of a mirror threw a spot of light
upon a sensitised plate which moved by clockwork uniformly in a
direction transverse to the spot of light. This produced a curve, the
ordinates of which represented time and temperature.
   These curves appear to show that a molecular lowering of tempe
rature took place immediately the pressure was applied to the bar
when in the welding condition.
   Photographic curves are exhibited which show that this fall in
temperature varied in these particular experiments from 57° C. to
19° C, according to the circumstances of temperature and pressure.
   This appears to prove that wrought iron at a welding temperature
possesses the same property of cooling under pressure which was
proved by Lord Kelvin to exist in freezing water, and on which
demonstration the generally received theory of regelation depends.
   The author distinguishes the process of melting together of metals
from that of welding.
   Either process forms a junction, but the latter takes place at a
temperature considerably below the melting point.
   The well-known and useful property of welding in iron appears,
therefore, to depend, as in the case of regelation in ice, upon this
critical condition, which exists over a limited range of temperature
between the molten and the plastic state.

 1895.]       Extinctive Atmospheres produced by Flames.            353
IV. "  The Composition of the Extinctive Atmospheres produced
      by Flames."       By Frank Clowes, D.Sc. Lond. Communi
      cated by Professor Armstrong, F.R.S. Received February
      7, 1895.
   In a   former     paper (' Roy. Soc. Proc.,' vol. 56), the author
communicated the results obtained by mingling gases, which were
extinctive of flame, with air, until a flame burning in the air was
just extinguished.     The gases used in the experiments were carbon
dioxide and nitrogen.       Each of these gases was separately intro
duced into the air, and the composition of the atmosphere thus pro
duced, which just extinguished flame, was determined by chemical
analysis.
   The general results arrived at were  : —
   1. That  n  ick-fed flames require atmospheres of very similar com
        position to extinguish them: while gas-fed flames require
        atmospheres of widely different composition.
   2. That nitrogen must be added in larger proportion than carbon
        dioxide, in order to extinguish the same flame.
   3. That the minimum proportion of extinctive gas which must be
        mingled with air in order to extinguish a flame is independent-
        of the size of the flame.
   A supplementary sei ies of experiments has now been undertaken
in order to determine the composition of the atmosphere extinctive
of each flame, which is produced by the flame itself when burning in
an inclosed volume of air at atmospheric pressure.
   Preliminary trials showed that in order to secure trustworthy
results, the atmosphere must not be in contact with water.       It was
further found necessary to avoid change of pressure in the inclosed
atmosphere during the combustion of the flame.
   These necessary conditions were complied with by allowing the
flames to burn in a bell- jar, the bottom of which was closed by
dipping into a sufficiently deep vessel of mercury.     The neck of the
bell-jar was closed by a cork bearing a      JJ -shaped mercury gauge,
and a glass tube with a stopcock.
   While the flame was burning, the pressure of the air within the
bell-jar was maintained uniform by raising or lowering the bell-jar
sufficiently to maintain the mercury levels unchanged in the pressure
gange.     As soon as the flame was extinguished by the atmosphere
around it, the vessel was allowed to stand until the atmosphere within
had become uniform in temperature with the air around.        A portion
of the gases within the bell-jar was then removed by      means   of the
stopcock-tube to a Hempel gas-bureite, and was subjected to ordinary

 volumetric analysis by absorption.       Each experiment and analysis
 was repeated in duplicate, and frequently in triplicate.     The results
 obtained were  either identical or closely concordant, except in the case
 of methane ; but the flamo of ethylene could not be maintained under
 the conditions of the experiment.
   The gas was burnt from a tube passing through the mercury and
terminating in a jet just above the surface of the mercury. The
liquids were burnt from wicks contained in small shallow vessels
floating upon the surface of the mercury.
   As in the previous series of experiments (loc. cit.) the combustible
substances used were chiefly those which are burnt for ordinary
heating and lighting purposes.
   The mean results are tabulated below.

     In the above table the results are given, which were obtained by the
 analysis of the residual atmospheres, in which the flame had burnt until
it was extinguished. Since the proportions of carbon dioxide contained
in these atmospheres are small, the composition of the artificial atmo
spheres consisting of nitrogen and oxygen only, in which the flames
were just extinguished when they are inserted, are also stated for
comparison. It will be noticed that the general agreement in com
position shown by the two classes of extinctive atmospheres, so
differently produced, is well maintained ; and when the conditions of
the experiments are taken into account the recent series of results are
confirmatory of the general accuracy of those previously obtained.
     I have to acknowledge the assistance rendered by M. E. Feilmann,
B.Sc, in carrying out          the    experimental     work involved      in this
investigation.
     [February 18, 1895.]     It  is noteworthy that the composition of the
extinctive atmosphere produced by the flame of a candle, or of oil, or
of alcohol, closely corresponds with the average composition of air
expired from the lungs.        The composition of the last portion of air
which is expired varies somewhat with the length of time during
which the air has been retained in the lungs. The following percentage
composition by volume waB determined : —

    According to the statements published by Dr.        J.   Haldane (' Roy.
Soc. Proc.,' December 6, 1894), an atmosphere of the average com
position of expired air, or of that left by the combustion of candles or
lamps, although it is extinctive of the names of candles and of lamps,
can be breathed by most people without producing any distinctly
noticeable effect.         With some people, the increased proportion of
carbon dioxide would cause the inspirations to be somewhat deeper
than usual, but in no case would injury to health result from breath
ing such an atmosphere.
    The statement made by the author in a previous paper ('Roy. Soc.
Proc.,' vol. 56), that men could apparently breathe with safety an
atmosphere which just extinguished the flame of a candle or of a
lamp, is therefore fully borne out by the above results.          This agrees
with the statements made by experienced mining authorities.
Accordingly the extinction of such ordinary illuminating flames can
not be considered as proof that an atmosphere is not respirable with
safety.
    The      residual atmosphere produced by the hydrogen flame is
 undoubtedly not respirable, on account of the greatly diminished
 proportion of oxygen which it contains. The colour of the hydrogen
 flame undergoes a distinct change in colour from reddish-purple to
 blue as the proportion of oxygen in the atmosphere is diminished.
 Since a similar change of colour is noticed when carbon dioxide is
 present in the atmosphere, it is probably due to the lowering of
 temperature of the flame : all attempts to detect the production of
 carbon monoxide by this flame, when it is burning in air containing
 carbon dioxide, have failed.
    The conclusions which may be drawn from the above results              are
 that : —
     1.   The flames of the combustible gases and liquids, which were
            experimented upon, produce, at the point of extinction in au
            enclosed atmosphere, a change in the proportion of oxygen in
            the air generally corresponding to that produced by preparing
            extinctive atmospheres by artificial mixture.

       burning in a confined      space of air, produce an atmosphere of
       almost identical composition with that of air expired from the
       lungs.
  3. The extinctive atmospheres produced by the combustion of the
       flames of candles and of lamps, and the air expired from the
       luDgs after inspiring fresh air, are respirable with safety.
  4. The extinction of an ordinary candle or lamp flame is not neces
       sarily indicative of the unsuitability of an atmosphere to
       maintain life when it is breathed.

females from the same locality (' Roy. Soc. Proc.,' vol. 54, pp.
318 — 329) ; and it seemed worth while to compare the frequency of
abnormalities in young individuals at various stages of growth with
the frequency of the same abnormalities in adult life, so as to deter
mine whether any evidence of selective destruction during growth
could be discovered or not.
    About 7000 females, varying in length from 7"00 to 13-95 mm.,
were chosen (at random, except as regards their size), and two
dimensions were measured in each. The results were then compared
with those of the corresponding measurements, made upon a sample
of 1000 adult females from the same locality, which are recorded in
the paper just referred to.

   The dimensions chosen were: — (1) the "frontal breadth" — the
distance in a straight line between the tips of the extra-orbital teeth
of the carapace (from the point A, fig. 1, to the corresponding point
on the opposite side) ; and (2) the " right dentary margin" measured
in a straight line from the apex of the first to that of the last
lateral tooth (from A to B, fig. I). The "length" of each crab was
taken as the length of the carapace, from the tip of the middle inter-
orbital tooth to the posterior margin (from C to D, fig. ] ). This is,
of course, not the total length of the body ; but the curvature and
flexibility of the abdomen render an exact determination of the real
body length very difficult.

   In order    to compare the variability of a dimension in crabs whose
carapace    is  only 7 mm. long with that of the corresponding dimen
sion in adult crabs, whose carapace length is from 40 — 50 mm. or
more, it is evidently necessary to adopt some method of picturing the
crabs as of one standard size ; and accordingly the measures obtained
have always been expressed in terms of the carapace-length of the
crab to which they belong, taken as 1000. The measurements were
made by means of a screw, of 1 mm. pitch, carrying the object across

 (he field of a microscope, and by means of graduations on the head
 of the screw the observations were recorded to the nearest hundredth
 of a millimetre.     It is believed that the probable error of any obser
 vation is not much more than one hundredth of a millimetre. In
 order to minimise the effect of errors of observation, the results, after
 being expressed as fractions of the carapace-length, were sorted into
 groups, such that the measures in each group did not differ by more
 than 0-004 of the carapace-length, and all measures in the same group
  wore treated as identical.       The unit employed in tabulating the
  results was therefore O004 of the carapace-length ; but in what
 follows the results are expressed, for the greater convenience of the
  reader, in thousandths of the carapace-length.         It will be noticed
  that the principal effect of this alteration upon the results is to
 diminish their apparent regularity — an aberration of one unit of
 measurement appearing as four units in the tables below.
                        1. Variation in Frontal Breadth.
     An initial difficulty in determining the error of distribution of
  frontal breadths about their mean in young crabs, arises from the
 Lrreat rapidity with which the mean itself changes during growth.
 The mean frontal breadth in the smallest specimens was found to be
 X.r>3-14 thousandths of the carapace-length, while at maturity it is
 imly t>04-94 thousandths.       The rate at which this change occurs can
 l>e gathered from the following table of the crabs measured,       and the
 same result is graphically shown in fig.     2,
     Prom this table it appears that the mean frontal breadth changes
a  t such a rate that when the carapace-length has increased 0 2 mm., the
 frontal breadth has almost always diminished by less than four thou
sandths, that is to say, by less than one of the units of measurement
 bere employed. For the purpose of the present investigation the mean
was therefore considered stationary during every period of increase
in size of not more than 02 mm., and the young crabs were accord
 ingly sorted into groups, the individuals of each group differing by
loss than 0 2 mm. in respect of their carapace-length.        The distribu
tion of frontal breadths about the mean was then exnnrined in each
group separately.
     As the difference in size between the largest and the smallest of
t lie growing crabs was 7 mm., it follows that the material was divided
into thirty-five groups. This subdivision of the material had great
disadvantages, because, instead of a single group of over 7000 indi
viduals, varying about the same mean, from which a fairly reliable
indication of the law governing frequency of deviation might have
heen expected, the average number of individuals in any one of the
available groups was only 200 ; and from so small a number of obser-

 necessary, before proceeding further, to ascertain with some certainty

 values of the quartile. The quartile deviation changes so slowly with
growth, that it may without serious error be assumed to be constant
during the period represented by 1 mm. of growth in carapace-
length : that     through the period covered by five of the groups

    The values here given are probably          not very reliable, but they
 show that in the youngest individuals the quartile deviation is dis
 tinctly less than at maturity ; that it increases with increase of size,
 until a time arrives when it is distinctly greater than in adult life;
 and that finally it diminishes again.
    The initial features of this result, — the smallness of the quartile
 error at a young age, indicating relative infrequency of deviations,
and the increase during growth, have been observed by Bowditch in
 the case of human stature.        The result obtained by Dr. Bowditch
 and that here described are both simply confirmations of Darwin's
 statement, that many variations appear at a late period of develop
ment.
    The initial increase in the quartile error may be attributed to the
fact that average young         produce upon the whole average adults,
while animals which exhibit a deviation of known amount in the
young state, exhibit on the whole a greater deviation with advancing
age. If this view be the true one (and it is hoped that next year it
may be possible to test it by observation of living crabs, which can
be measured at various periods of growth), then, in a Plymouth crab,
which is of unit deviation when its carapace is 7 mm. long, the most
probable deviation when it has grown to be 12'5 mm. in length will
be 10*79/9-42 = about 1-15 units.         The probable error of this expec
tation is the expression of irregularities in the rate of growth, which
cannot at present, for want of knowledge, be adequately discussed.
    From the age represented by a length of 12'5 mm., the quartile
   * Of the four very abnormal values shown in the table, three occurred in this
group. They hare been omitted in the determination of the quartile deviation,
which would otherwise become 9 92.

368       Report of   the Committee  for  conducting Inquiries     [Feb.  28,
error diminishes, and the parallel between the behaviour of the
frontal breadth in Plymouth crabs and that seen by Bowditch in the
stature of civilised human beings ceases to hold. The obvious sug
gestion by which to account for this seems to be that in the United
 States, where Bowditch made his observations, human beings are
 under conditions of such civilisation that there is considerable pro
tection of the physically unfit ; and that here, as in other civilised
countries, any influences which might in a savage race produce selec
 tive destruction are reduced to a minimum, whereas in the case of
the crabs such selective influences are active.
    It is, of course, possible that the deviation of " abnormal " young
may in each individual case first attain a maximum and then
 diminish with advancing age ; if this is the case, wc cannot know
 without experiment.        In the absence of such experiment, the hypo
 thesis may be provisionally adopted that the diminution in the fre
quency of individuals of given deviation is due to a selective destruc
tion, and the consequences of this hypothesis will be examined.
    Consider a population of crabs, measured at the time of their
maximum variability, and suppose the distribution of deviations
among the population to be accurately represented, for a particular
organ, by a probability equation of modulus ci. Now, let the number
of individuals of deviation lying betweon ± a be represented by the
area ahgd (fig. 4) ; then, if gd = 2a be small, compared with the ob
                                           area
served range of variation, and ki =             o.bgd^ ^ ot]\er  WOrds,  if h
 be  the height of the median ordinate BD of the generalised curve,
then the whole number of individuals in the population will be
    Now, suppose any destruction, which. acts unselectively with re
gard to the organ in question, to reduce the number of individuals
                 •
whose deviation lies between ± a, to cdef, and let the                —
                                                                area- cdcf
                                                                         - =
kt,  or the height of the median ordinate BD1. Since this destruction
is unselective,    it will destroy an equal percentage of animals of every
deviation, and will therefore not alter the modulus.         The population
will therefore be reduced to fc2fi        in number.    This  unselective de
struction cannot be directly measured.
    The selective destruction is most simply conceived as follows : —
    In fig. 4 let AD'HE represent a curve of modulus cu and let BD1
 = &2, so that the area of the whole curve AD'HE =                 represents
the population left after unselective destruction has occurred.         Then
suppose the modulus to be reduced during growth to ce, where f> is
less than cj, and let AD'KE be a curve of modulus <h- The minimum
 number of individuals which it is necessary to destroy, in order to
 affect this reduction in the modulus, is evidently represented by the

 shaded area of the figure. The population after such destruction is
  kfii \/V in number, and the shaded area represents a number of in
  dividuals equal to k1^ir(cl — c2), so that the ratio of animals selec
 tively destroyed to animals which survive all unselective destruction
 is cl         a quantity which can be experimentally        determined.
         cl
     From the data given in Table       III,  this ratio, for frontal  breadths
                                    10-79      9-96

                                         10-79
 the hypothesis of selective destruction involves a death-rate of about
 77 per thousand between the age corresponding to 12-5 mm. in cara
 pace-length and maturity, as a consequence of deviation in frontal
 breadths, and in the group of structures, whatever these may be,
 which are directly correlated with it.
    This total death-rate does not affect individuals of all deviations
 alike ; an inspection of the figure will show that the death-rate is a
 function of the deviation, and that function is quite simply deter
 mined.      Consider any ordinate Eg of the curve ABEC, and let its
 abscissa, DG, be of magnitude x ; then the Tength of Eg is k^e^l't'
 and the number of individuals of deviation between x and as + dx is
k&~*l*. dx. In the same way, the height of the ordinate Eg is
and the iiumber of individuals of abnormality within unit distance
of x after selection is
                                  he-*2'*1 .  dx.
    The ratio between the number of animals of abnormality x which
 survive the unselective destruction         and those which are selectively
destroyed is therefore
               Eg-EF     _~ e-sV.'-e-^fa'
                            '  -             _~ _   6
                  Eg             e~*W
    So that if g is the selective death-rate among animals of abnor
mality x, then that death-rate increases as x increases according to
the equation
                                  g = i-e~*",
where h is the numerical value of ci—<hjc?e%, ci and c? being the
values of the modulus at the time of its maximum value and at.
maturity respectively.
    For the frontal breadth of Plymouth crabs, the value of h is about
0-015 ; so that of the whole number of animals which attain the size
               having an abnormality x of their frontal breadth, the

      It will, of course, be understood that little trust can be placed in
  the absolute    numerical results which are here put forward ; the point
  which seems worthy of confidence, and which if it be indeed a reality
  is of very great importance, is the form of the result.      For by purely
  statistical methods, without making           any assumption as to the
  functional importance of the frontal breadth, the time of life at
  which   natural selection must be assumed to act, if it acts at all, has
  been   determined, and the selective death-rate has been exhibited as a
 function of the abnormality, while a numerical estimate which is at
 least of the same order as the amount of the selective destruction has
 been obtained.
      The method by which the result described has been arrived at is
 likely to be capable of application to a very considerable number of
 cases.      Mathematically    considered, the conditions which were at
 first assumed     and then proved to obtain in the organ discussed are by
 no    means general.      It is necessary for the employment of this
 method that the variations should be distributed on each side of the
 mean with sensible symmetry, and that the position of minimum
selective destruction should be sensibly coincident with the mean of
 the    whole   system.    Such statistical information as is at present
available leads to the belief that these conditions may be expected to
 hold for a large number of species, which are sensibly in equilibrium
 with their present surroundings, so that their mean character is
sensibly the best, and the change of mean from generation to genera
 tion is at least very small .    They cannot be expected to hold in cases
 of rapid change such as those induced artificially by selection under
domestication, or naturally by rapid migration or other phenomena
resulting in a rapid change of environment.
     For the investigation of such rapid change, it would be necessary
to treat the more general case, in which the chances of deviations of
opposite sign are not sensibly symmetrical, and in which the mean is
not necessarily the position of minimum destruction.         The treatment
of thisNcase requires the help of a professional mathematician.
     It will be well to mention here a curious indirect confirmation of
the result just described, based on evidence derived from a quite
different source.
    An attempt has been made to show that physiological accidents of
a   kind leading to change in the length of a portion of the carapace
affect a crab at a rate measured by the value of the quantity 1 — e-**2.
The symmetrical distribution of variations from the mean which has
been shown, especially by Mr. Galton, to occur in dimensions of
weight, length, muscular strength, and other characters of various

 372     Report of the Committee for conducting Inquiries       [Feb. 28,
 organs in men, moths, sweet peas, and other things at various periods
of life, made it seem probable that if selective destruction could
be shown to occur in these cases, the expression for intensity of
 destruction, in terms of the deviation, would in all these cases be of
 the same form as that already arrived at.            That is to say, the
 expression    for  the effect of physiological accidents of a number of
 different kinds, affecting a number of organisms in no way specially
alike, is probably always of the same form.          The question at once
 occurred, whether this expression might not be of general applica
 tion, as a measure of the effect of physiological accidents upon the
animal body.
    The most convenient case in which to look for an answer to this
 question is the case of muscular tissue, in which the effect of acci
 dents of stimulus can be readily measured.          The recent paper of
 Cyboulski and Zanietowski          (Pfliiger's ' Archiv f. Physiologie,'
 Bd. 56, p. 45) gives an excellent series of data for determining the
relation between energy of stimulus applied to a nerve, and effect
upon the muscle, as measured by energy of external work performed
in contraction.       These observers give a large series of tables, in
which the energy of stimulus, applied by discharging a condenser
of known electrical capacity through a nerve, is given in one
column, and in another is the work done by the muscle stimulated,
measured by the height through which a known mass is lifted.
    As is well known, the application of stimuli of less than a certain
magnitude produces no muscular contraction ; but if the maximum
stimulus which can be applied without causing a contraction be
reckoned as zero, the subsequent relation between stimulus and con
traction does, in fact, agree very closely with that indicated by suc
cessive values of the quantity 1 — e~kx'.
    In spite of the evident care and skill with which Cyboulski and
Zanietowski      have performed their experiments, their curves are
slightly irregular. In order to minimise the effect of these slight
irregularities, three of their results were treated in the following
way : — In each system of observations the maximum subliminal
stimulus was subtracted from the magnitude of the applied stimulus
in each case ; the three numbers representing the height of the
muscle contraction for unit stimulus beyond this point in the three
cases were added together; and so on throughout.            The result is
plotted   in fig. 5, the height of the sum of three contractions being
indicated by the ordinates of the points © ; the intensity of the cor
responding stimulus, minus the subliminal stimulus, being measured
along the abscissa.
    The dotted curve is given by

                      " modulus " of the system of ordinates, determined

the two, rough as it is, is surely more than accidental !

   The most interesting       relation to be investigated in the light of this
result would       undoubtedly be the relation between sensation and
stimulus in man ; but existing data seem too imperfect to give any

374     'Report of the Committee        for  conducting Inquiries   [Feb. 28,
trustworthy result.        It  may be remarked that a few years ago
measurements of the relation between muscle contraction and nerve
stimulus, made with an imperfection comparable with that which
characterises attempts to measure sensation, were held to obey a
logarithmic      law closely similar to the formula of Fechner and
Weber.
                  II. Variation in    the Eight Dentary Margin.
   The mean size of the right dentary margin was found to change,
with increase of carapace-length, at such a rate as to render neces
sary the same subdivision of the material as that adopted in the case
of frontal breadths.        The change of mean will be gathered from
Table IV, where it is seen that the change is slightly slower and less
regular than in the frontal breadths, while its direction is reversed —
the right dentary margin becoming larger, the frontal breadth
smaller with increase of size.

vidual of deviation equal to — 7 times the modulus, would make the
 sum of the positive and negative squares almost exactly equal.
    The mean error of the whole system is 0"5688 instead of 0-5642, or
nearly 1 per cent, too great. The error of mean squares is 0"7276
 instead of O7077, or 2-8 per cent. too great.
    From these values of the mean error and error of mean squ;uv.
as well as from the presence of a deviation so great as seven times the
modulus, it is evident that some cause has been at work, producing
large abnormalities with a frequency greater than that indicated by
the theory of chance.         Reference to the table shows that deviations
of more that 2-5 times the modulus do in fact occur twenty times,
instead of five or six times, as they should do          So that deviations of
this magnitude        occur about  three  and  a half times too often.
    The sporadic occurrence of considerable deviations, which do not
obey the general law of frequency of variation, is a phenomenon

 1895.]      into the Measurable    Characteristics of Plants,  fye.     377
 which has been supposed by many naturalists to be of great im
 portance in evolution, and the present case is therefore worthy of
 discussion.
    The following suggestion is offered as an explanation of the large
 'iegative deviations.     As shown in Fig. 1, there are normally five teeth
in the dentary margin ; but occasionally (in over 1 per cent. of
individuals) only four teeth occur. The reduction in teeth may
apparently be effected in various ways : sometimes it is impossible to
say that one tooth rather than another is missing ; and the case then
resembles those cases of variation in the segmentation of a vertebral
column, for example, recently discussed by Bateson (" Materials for
the Study of Variation," passim, especially, however, p. 124).            In
other cases, the reduction appears to be effected by a process re
sembling the filling up of the interval between two teeth, so that the
pointe of the teeth project only very slightly.       A careful outline of a
specimen exhibiting this condition is given in fig. 7. It is evident that
                                     Fig. 7.
in this case the    little tubercle S which indicates the position of the
fifth tooth is the point from which the measurement should be taken ;
but if the obliteration of the fifth tooth had progressed but a little
further, no indication of its presence would remain ; and the dentary

378          The Measurable Characteristics         of Plants,         [Feb. 28,
margin, measured from the tip of the first to the tip of the last visible
tooth, would really have been measured from a to 6. Such a measure
would not be homologous with the rest, and ought not to be included
in the scheme. But, since reduction in the number of teeth may take
place in other ways, and since it is impossible in a given case to
distinguish the manner in which it has occurred, the measurements
were necessarily recorded .
    Another frequent cause of disturbance is the breakage of the last
tooth, followed by its regeneration.          All cases of obviously recent
injury were of course excluded ; and for this reason the total number
of individuals discussed is reduced from 8069 to 8020. But the
selection of material was felt to be so dangerous a proceeding that
all cases in which there was any doubt as to the occurrence of an
 injury were included. The wrongful inclusion of a dozen such cases
would account for the excess of positive abnormalities : for it is
evident that a breakage of the tip of the last tooth would increase
the distance AB in fig. 1.
    While, therefore, the observations admit of the interpretation that
                                 "       " of
 about once in 500 cases a sport               magnitude greater than that
 provided   for  by the  theory    of chance  does    regularly occur, the con
 siderations which have been submitted make this interpretation at
least doubtful.
    The value of the probable error, as an indication of percentage
abnormality, is diminished by the existence of the large deviations
discussed ; but the values obtained are of considerable interest: they
are as follows : —

    It will be seen from this table that the      error of distribution   at th¦
ages measured is always less than in adult life, except among crabs,
whose carapace length is between 9 and 10 mm.                 Of the fourteen
superfluous deviations of great magnitude, three occur in this group,
and the result is a quite untrustworthy determination.

 1895.]       Remarks on Variation in Animals and Plants.             379
    Evidently, therefore, in spite of the abnormally great frequency
with which large deviations occur, the whole percentage of abnor
malities, among crabs between 7 and 14 mm. in length, is less than
it is in adult crabs; and there is a rough agreement between the
result obtained from these measurements and that obtained by
Bowditch from the measurements of human stature already referred
to.    So that among female crabs in Plymouth Sound, during the
period of life to which these observations refer, there is no indication
of any destructive agency which acts selectively upon the dentavy
margin.     Whether such selective destruction occurs among males, or
among females at a later period of life, is for the present an open
question.
    Variation in frontal    breadth may, therefore, for the present be
considered to be of more importance in the economy of female cral s
than variation in the length of the dentary margin — a view which
receives confirmation from the dimorphism already shown to exist
(- Roy. Soc. Proc.,' vol. 54, p. 324) in the frontal breadth of crabs
from Naples, while it is a striking justification of the accepted
system of classification, in which the characters of the great groups
into which the Brachyura are divided are almost entirely those
associated with changes in this dimension.
    In conclusion, an important feature of the method employed may
be pointed out.     The increase of death-rate, associated with a given
abnormality    of frontal breadth, has here been roughly determined ; in
the previous paper, already referred to, the effect of abnormality in
this dimension upon several other organs of the body was deter
mined ; and by the method of that paper it would be possible to
 determine the effect of parental abnormality upon the offspring.
These are all the data which are necessary, in order to determine the
direction and rate of evolution ; and they may be obtained without
introducing any theory of the physiological function of the organs
 investigated.    The advantage of eliminating from the problem of
evolution ideas which must often, from the nature of the case, rest
chiefly upon guess-work, need hardly be insisted upon.

    1. The importance of variation as a factor in organic evolution is
not seriously disputed ; but, if one may judge from the expressions
contained in recent essays, naturalists are not agreed as to the

manner in which variation among individuals is associated with
specific modification.
   The view originally put forward by Darwin and "Wallace is that
specific modification is at least generally a gradual process, result
ing from " the accumulation of innumerable slight variations, each
good for the original possessor" ('Origin of Species,' chap. xv).
This view rests on the assumption that each of those small differ
ences which are to be observed among a group of individuals be
longing to the same species has generally some effect upon the chance
of life.    " Can we doubt
                            (remembering that many more individuals
are born than can possibly survive) that individuals having any
advantage, however slight, over others, would have the best chance of
                                                 "
surviving and of procreating their kind ?           (' Origin of Species,'
chap. iv).
    Of late years, another view has received support from various
writers.     An examination of any series of animals of the same
species preserved in a museum shows in most cases a large majority
of specimens which are superficially alike : those individual differ
ences, upon which stress is laid by Darwin and by Wallace, are often
so slight as to escape attention unless minute comparison is made
between individual and individual, But there will commonly be
found a few individuals which differ so remarkably from their fellows
as to catch the eye at once.     Such large duviations differ from the
smaller ones, at least in most cases, by their extreme rarity; but
they have been extensively collected, and most museums contain
numerous examples of their occurrence.        Some naturalists have been
led, from the striking character of such variations, to assume for
them a preponderant share in the modification of specific character.
These persons assume, if    I understand them rightly, that the advani-
tages    or  disadvantages which  accompany the more frequent slight
abnormalities are in themselves of necessity slight; and that the
effect of such slight abnormalities may be neglected, in comparison
with the effect produced by the occasional appearance of considerable
deviations from the normal type. They regard change in specific
character as an event which occurs, not slowly and continuously, but
 occasionally and by steps of considerable magnitude, as a consequence
of the capricious appearance of " sports."
    Without presuming to deny the possible effect of occasional
 "
   sports" in exceptional cases, it is the object of the present remarks
 to discuss the effect of small variations, as it may be deduced from
 the study of two organs in a single species.
    The case chosen is the variation, during growth and in adult life,
of two dimensions of female Carcinus mamas, recently investigated
by a Committee of the Royal Society ; and what is here said may        be
considered an appendix to the report of that Committee.

   2. The questions raised by the Darwinian hypothesis are purely
statistical, and th9 statistical method is the only one at present
obvious by which that hypothesis can be experimentally checked.
   In order to estimate the effect of small variations upon the chance
of survival, in a given species, it is necessary to measure first, the
percentage of young animals exhibiting this variation ; secondly, the
percentage of adults in which it is present. If the percentage of
adults exhibiting the variation is less than the percentage of young,
then a certain percentage of young animals has either lost the
character during growth or has been destroyed.       The law of growth
having been ascertained, the rate of destruction may be measured ;
and in this way an estimate of the advantage or disadvantage of a
variation may be obtained.      In order to estimate the effect of devia
tions of one organ upon the rest of the body, it is necessary to
measure the average character of the rest of the body in individuals
with varying magnitude of the given organ ; and by the application
of Mr. Galton's method of measuring correlation, a simple estimate
of this effect may be obtained. In the same way a numerical measure
of the effect of parental abnormality upon abnormality of offspring
may be obtained by the use of Galton's correlation function, and such
measurements have been made, in the case of human stature, by
Mr. Galton himself;
   It is to be observed that numerical data, of the kind here indicated,
contain all the information necessary for a knowledge of the direction
and rate of evolution.      Knowing that a given deviation from the
mean character is associated with a greater or less percentage death-
rate in the animals possessing it, the importance of such a deviation
can be estimated without the necessity of inquiring how that increase
or decrease in the death-rate is brought about, so that all ideas of
" functional adaptation " become unnecessary. In the same way, a
theory of the mechanism of heredity is not necessary in order to
measure the abnormality of offspring associated with a given parental
abnormality.      The importance of such numerical statements, by
which the current theories of adaptation, &c, may be tested, is
strongly urged.
    3. The report itself describes an attempt to furnish some of the
numerical data referred to for two dimensions of the shore crab. The
data collected give an approximation to the law of frequency with
which deviations from the average character occur at various ages.
The conclusions drawn are (a) that there is a period of growth
during which the frequency of deviations increases, illustrating
Darwin's statement that variations frequently appear late in life ;
 (6) that in one case the preliminary increase is followed by a decrease
in the frequency of deviations of given magnitude, in the other case
 it is not ; and that (c), assuming a particular law of growth (which

382           Mr. H. M. Vernon.         Effect of Environment        [Feb. 28,
remains, as is admitted, to be experimentally tested), the observed
phenomena imply a selective destruction in the one case, and not in
the other.
   It is not contended that the law of frequency at various ages,
adopted in the report, is exact.       It is, however, hoped that the ap
proximation is sufficiently exact to give numerical estimates of the
quantities measured, which are at least of the Fame order as the
quantities themselves, and for this reason it is hoped that the method
adopted may prove useful in other casos.

                                 (Abstract.)
   The conditions of environment under which an organism develops
are   known to be of considerable influence in the production of
variations.   It was thought to be of interest to determine by exact
measurement the effects which such slight changes in the environ
mental conditions as might occur naturally would produce in the
growth of some organisms. The animal chosen was the larva or
platens of the sea-urchin Strongylocentroius           lividus.   These larvae
develop readily from artificial fertilisations, and they can, more
over, be obtained at all times of the year, irrespective of season-
The method adopted was to shake pieces of the ovarie3 and testes of
several sea-urchins in small jars of water, and then mix the two
liquids.    After standing for an hour, portions of the water con
taining the impregnated ova were poured into jars holding 2 to
    litres of sea water, and these were transferred to a large tank of
running sea water.       The larvae were generally allowed to develop
for eight days, as the aboral and oral arms reach their maximum
length in this time.    The larvoa were killed by the addition of corro
sive sublimate to the water, and were then, after washing in distilled
water, preserved in 70 per cent, alcohol.            They were mouuted in
glycerine   and  measured   under   the  microscope, the body-length, the
aboral arm-length, and the oral arm-length being in each case
measured. The larva; were measured in sets of fifties, and the means
taken. The aboral and oral arm- lengths were calculated as percentages
on the body-length.      In all 10,000 larvae were measured.
   The effects of temperature on development were first studied. It

1895.]           on the Development   of Echinoderm Larvae.              383
was found that      if the  ova were placed  in water at about 8° or 25° C.
for an hour, or even for a minute, at the time of impregnation, the
resulting larvae after eight days development were, on an average,
4-6 per cent. smaller than those impregnated at from 17° to 22°,
though all the subsequent conditions of development were identical.
If kept at the abnormal temperature for only ten seconds during
impregnation, the resulting larvae were only l-7 per cent, smaller,
probably because the time was too short for all the ova to become
impregnated under the abnormal conditions.          Differences of tempera
ture during the course of development have in comparison a much
slighter influence.      Thus larvse allowed to develop in water at 17"
to 22° are only about 2 per cent. larger than those allowed to develop
at 15-7° to 17°, or at 22° to 23 7°.
    The time of the year when the artificial fertilisations are prepared
has a very marked influence on the size of the larvae.           Thus, those
obtained in the middle of August are about 20 per cent. smaller than
those obtained in April, May, and October, whilst those obtained in
Jane and July are intermediate in size. This is probably due to
the comparative immaturity of the ova and spermatozoa in the off-
 breeding season.
    The salinity of the water has a great influence on the development.
 Larvaj allowed to develop in water containing 50 c.c. of distilled
 water per litre are 15 6 per cent. larger than those grown under
 normal conditions, and those in water containing 25 c.c. per litre
 9-5 per cent. larger.     On the other hand, in water containing 150 ex.
 of distilled water per litre they are 4-3 per cent. smaller.       In water
 more concentrated than the normal they remain practically un
 changed, but larvse grown          under normal conditions from ova
 impregnated in concentrated water are 1"6 per cent. larger.
    It was thought to be of interest to determine the effects which the
 various colours of the spectrum have upon development, though these
 are not conditions of environment which occur in nature.              Larvae
 allowed to develop in the blue light of copper sulphate solution are
 4-5 per cent. smaller than the normal, and those in the violet-blue
 light of Lyons blue solution 7-4 per cent. smaller.         Those grown in
 the green light of nickel nitrate solution are 4-8 per cent. smaller,
 and   those   in red and yellow lights respectively 6"9 per cent. and
 8 9  per  cent.  smaller.   The development of the larvae seems to be but
 little affected if it is carried out in absolute darkness, the size only
 being diminished by 1"3 per cent. Larvae grown in semi-darkness
 are apparently 2-5 per cent. larger than the normal.
    The body-length of the larvae appears to be uninfluenced by the
 number of larvae developing together in a given volume of water, if
 it be kept below 30,000 per litre.      The arm-lengths are, on the other
 hand, considerably affected.       The aboral and oral arm-lengths of

384               The Development     of Echinoderm Larvce.       [Feb.   28,
larvae grown     in water containing 4,000 per litre are respectively 13-4
and 15.9 per cent, shorter than of those in water containing 500 per
litre ; in water containing 17,500 per litre they are 25-9 and 23-3 per
cent. shorter, and in water containing over 30,000 per litre 53-0 and
432 per cent, shorter.
    Certain prodncts of metabolism exert a favourable influence on the
developments of the larvae, and not, as would be naturally expected,
a harmful one.       Thus larvae allowed to develop in water containing
1 in 70,400 of uric acid are 12 2 per cent. larger than those grown in
ordinary water. It is only when the proportion of uric acid is in
 creased to 1 in 28,000 that an unfavourable influence is exerted, the
larvae being in this case 2-l per cent. smaller than the normal.           In
water containing about 1 in 60,000 of urea the larvae are about 3 per
cent. larger. Again, the amount of carbonic acid gas dissolved in the
water may be increased by some 18 per cent., so that it is only just
insufficient to kill off the larvae entirely, and yet no diminution in the
 growth is observed.      On the other hand, some of the products of
 metabolism may produce a considerable decrease in the size of the
 larvae, for larvae grown in water in which other larvae had previously
  developed were 7-6 per cent. smaller than the normab
     Thus far the effects of environment on the body-length only of the
larvae have been mentioned.        As the arm-lengths were also measured,
the effects upon them can also be determined.         As a rule, the tissues
of the arms seemed to be much more sensitive to environmental con
 ditions than the tissues of the body, and considerable changes were
 frequently found to occur in them without any obvious cause.            The
  conclusions to be drawn from these measurements are therefore not
  so unequivocal as from those of the body-length.        The most impor
 tant point established is that one and the same change of environ
  mental condition may frequently produce opposite effects on the arm
  and body-l-ngths;       Thus the body-lengths of larvae allowed to
  develop at temperatures above 22° are about 2 per cent. smaller thau
  of those at about 20°, but the aboral and oral arms are respectively
  10-8 per cent. and 8"5 per cent. longer>       Again, the body-length of
  larvae developed in diluted water is on an average increased by
  91 per cent., but the arm-lengths are decreased by 7"7 per cent. and
  10-5 per cent., or, as the arm-lengths are percentages on the body-
  lengths, they are practically not affected at all.        Also the arm-
  lengths are not affected    to  the  same extent by   the same change of
  environmental condition.       Thus the ratio between the arm-lengths
  is 4 3 per cent. higher at temperatures above 22° than at those
  below  18°.
     As the number of measurements made was so large, it was thought
  to be of interest to subject them to statistical examination.        It was
  found that with the body-length and oral arm-length measurements

                                                                       * ¦

 the deviations from the average occurred with a frequency indicated
 by the theoretical law of error.             The measurements of the aboral
 arm-length     did   not   agree   so  well,  possibly owing to dimorphism.
  The relative probable error of the smaller larvae was greater than
 that of the larger ones, in the proportion of 63 to 57.               As most of
 the smaller larvae were obtained in the summer months, with pre
 sumably not quite mature ova, it is probable that the variability in
 the size, as well as the actual size of the larvae, is affected by the
 time of the year in which the fertilisations are made.                 The varia
 bility is also affected by the temperature of development, it reaching
 a maximum at 18° to 20".            The variability of the organs of echino-
 derm larvae is much greater than in the case of higher animals.
 Thus the probable error of the body-length is 6-l per cent., of the
 aboral arm-length ll-3 per cent., and of the oral arm-leDgth 9-4 per
 cent.

   This memoir embodies the results of a series of investigations
which were initiated by the Right Hon. Viscount Cross, sometime
H.M. Secretary of State for India, shortly after the annexation of
Burma by the British Government. The researches were undertaken,
with a view to the determination of the value of the celebrated ruby
mines of that country, and of the conditions under which the gem is
found. One of the authors, Mr. C. Barrington Brown, visited
                                                                2  F 2

  Upper Burma in 1887, and, under the auspices of the Governor-
  General of India — the Marquis of Ava — and with the assistance of
 the military and civil authorities of Burma, was enabled to make a
 geological survey of the district and prepare a report for the use of
 the Home Government.       The large series of specimens collected to
 illustrate this report was entrusted to the other author for descrip
 tion, and he has prepared the portions of this memoir dealing with
 the petrology and mineralogy of the district. -
    It was in a memoir read before this Society in 1798 that the crys
 tallised oxide of aluminium was shown by Greville to be a definite
 mineral species, to which he gave the name of " corundum ;" while,
 in an appendix to this memoir, the Count de Bournon exactly deter
 mined the crystalline form of the mineral. Four years later, the last-
 mentioned author submitted a second paper to this Society, in which
 the mode of occurrence of the mineral in Ceylon and in the Salem
 District in Southern India was fully discussed.     Twenty years later,
 Leschenault de la Tour, while on a scientific mission to Southern
 India, collected and sent to Paris a remarkable series of rocks from
the gem-bearing districts.    Quite recently, an able French mineralo
gist and petrographer, M. A. Lacroix, has described the series of
specimens in the collections made by de Bournon and Leschenault de
la Tour. Much light has been thrown on the mode of occurrence of
the corundum in India by the labours of Mr. F. M. Mallet, Dr. V.
Ball, and other members of the Geological Survey of that country ;
the remarkable emery deposits of Asia Minor have been thoroughly
studied by the late J. Lawrence Smith and Professor G. Tschermak;
while the occurrence of corundum in the Eastern States of North
America has formed the subject of important memoirs by Dr. Genth
and other authors.
    The famous ruby district of Upper Burma was almost unknown to
.Europeans before the annexation of the country by the British. It
is situated about 90 miles N.N.E. of Mandalay, and about 11 miles
E. of the military post of Thebayetkin, on the Irrawaddy. The
tract, so far as explored, is about 26 miles long and 12 broad, and
lies at elevations varying from 4,000 to 5,500 feet above the sea-level.
The principal mining centre in this district is Mogok, and the present
workings for rubies extend over an area of 45 square miles ; old
workings, however, being found over an area of 66 square miles. The
principal mining operations are carried on in the three valleys of
Mogok, Kathay, and Kyatpyen ; but there are some smaller outlying
districts, in which mines were formerly worked, in the Injouk Valley,
near Bernardmyo, at Wapudoung, 11 miles E. of Thebayetkin, and at
Lnnnzee, 8 miles S.W. of Kyatpyen. There is also a small tract of
rnby-bearing rocks (crystalline limestones) at Sagyin, 24 miles N. of
Mandalay ; and it is asserted by the natives that two other lime

 1895.]      The Rubies   of Burma and Associated Minerals.            389
stone   hills, 15 miles N. of Sagyin, have yielded rabies; while old
ruby workings were found in making the railway at Kauksay, 30
miles S. of Mandalay.       It  is also probable that ruby-bearing lime
stones, and the alluvial earths derived from them, may be found in
portions of the adjoining Shan States.         Indeed, at a point about 25
 miles southward from Mogok, in the Shan State of Maingl6n, Dr. F.
 Noetling, of the Geological Survey of India, has found that rubies
 have been obtained from the alluvium of a stream that flows from the
 mountains that lie considerably to the S.E. of the Mogok District.
   The rubellite (red tourmaline) of the same district was found by
 Mr. Barrington Brown not to occur in association with the rubies,
 but to come from certain gneisses and schistose rocks.        The locality
 which yields this gem, so highly prized by the Chinese, is Nyoun-
gouk, 10 miles S.E. of Mogok ; the alluvium which yields the rubel
lite appears never to contain rubies and spinels.         Black tourmaline
 (schorl)  has  been  extensively  worked,  as   shown  by Dr. F. Noetling,
in the Shan State of Maingl&n, not far from the rubellite locality.
   In the mountainous tract which includes the ruby districts, the
general trend of the hill ranges is from east to west.       The bottom of
the Mogok Valley, in which the principal workings are situated, lies
at a height of 4,100 ft. above the sea; while the loftiect mountains of
the range to the north and east are the Chenedoung Peak, 7,362 ft.,
and the Taungnee Peak 7,775 ft. above the sea-level.         The alluvia of
the valleys of Mogok, Kathay and Kyatpyen are formed by streams
flowing southwards from this mountain chain ; while those of tho
valleys of Injoak and Kabein are deposited by streams flowing in the
opposite direction.     The district, which is a somewhat malarious one,
bas an annual rainfall of about 80 inches ; but in March, April, and
May, the supply of water for mining operations is deficient.
   The mountains are composed of various gneissic and granulitic
rocks, occasionally passing into schists.       Subordinate to the general
mass of gneisses,      often   containing garnets, are certain peculiar
varieties of foliated and massive rocks, including both acid and basic
types, with limestone bands, often of a highly crystalline character.
It was in these limestones that the rubies and spinels were found to
be embedded,      associated with graphite, phlogopite, pyrrhotite, and
many other minerals.       The sides of the hills are found to be shrouded
in a deposit of hill-wash, often 50 ft. in thickness, composed of
fragments, derived from the mountains, embedded in a clayey matrix.
On the bottoms of the larger valleys there are extensive level
deposits of alluvial matter, consisting of brown, sandy clay, resting
on coarse gravels, which in turn cover other argillaceous beds.        It is
in these lower clay beds of the river alluvia, and in similar deposits
formed in gallies in the hill-wash, that the rubies, spinels, and other
gems of the district are found.

390              Mr. C. B. Brown and Prof.       J. W. Judd.        [Mar.  7,
    Mining operations for the obtaining of rubies are carried on in
Burma in four different ways.             (1.) In the alluvia, "twinlones,"
square pits    from  2 to 9 ft. across, ingeniously timbered with bamboo,
are sank to the ruby earth, the drainage of the pits and the removal
of material being effected      by baskets attached to balance poles,   both
made of bamboo.         (2.) In the hill-wash long open trenches,      called
"
   hmyaudwins," are carried from the sides of a gully, and the earth
is washed out by streams conveyed into the trenches by bamboo
pipes. (3.) In the caves and fissures filled with earth which abound
in the limestone rocks, regular mines — " loodwins " — are opened, and
the productive ruby earth is followed for long distances by means of
shafts and galleries.       (4.) The limestones which contain the rubies
are at one or two points quarried, and the gems are obtained by
breaking up the rock masses.
    The extensive rubellite mines at Nyoungouk are worked in a
somewhat similar plan to the " hmyaudwins."             Water is delivered
by a number of bamboo pipes at the head of the almost vertically
exposed faces of alluvium ; and as the masses of the latter are
loosened, the miners dash water upon them from shovel-shaped
baskets, and are able to detect and pick out by hand the brilliantly
coloured stones exposed on the washed surfaces.
    The petrology of this district of Upper Burma, in which the rubies,
 spinels, and rubellite occur, presents features of the greatest geolo
gical interest. In many respects the petrology of Burma exhibits close
analogies with that of the corundiferous localities of Ceylon, the Salem
 District, and other portions of the Indian peninsula; but some of the
phenomena presented by the rocks of the Burma ruby district do
 not appear to find a parallel in any of the gem-yielding tracts
 described by de Bournoa and more recently by Lacroix.
    The general mass of gneissic rocks composing the mountainous
 district in which the ruby localities are situated are of intermediate
 chemical composition, and consist of biotite-gneisses, biotite-granu-
 lites, and, more rarely, biotite sohists — rocks in which hornblende is
 rare or altogether absent, but which, on the other hand, are often
 remarkably rich in garnets. Neither corundum nor spinel have been
 certainly detected in these rocks.
    Interfoliated with these ordinary gneissic rooks, which form the
 great mass of the mountains, we find rocks of much more acid com

 aplites and granulites (leptynite or Weiss-stein), granular quartzites,
 and orthoclase-epidote rocks. The orthoclase of these rocks fre
 quently contains inclusions of fibrolite and other minerals, it often
 exhibits the " murchisonite

no means     uncommon. In the rubellite district of Nyonngouk the3e
acid rocks contain pink and blue tourmaline (rubellite and indicolite),
often beautifully zoned, and it is probably from rocks of this class
that the fine gem rubellites are derived.
    Of still greater interest are certain other subordinate rocks of basic
and sometimes ultra-basic composition.         These include the remark
able pyroxene-gneisses and pyroxene-granulites, which have in recent
years been described as occurring in so many widely- scattered regions
—such as Ceylon, Southern India, Central and Southern Europe,
Norway and Sweden, Brittany, Spain, Algeria, Eastern, Western,
and Southern Africa, the United States and Canada, Brazil, and New
Caledonia.      In these rocks the felspars are for the most part basic
ones, near to anorthite ; the crystals almost always exhibit the phe
nomenon described by French petrographers as "quartz of corro
sion," and the partial or complete transformation         of these felspars
into scapolite (" werneritisation ") can frequently be traced.         The
ierro-magnesian silicates are represented by many varieties of augite
(sablite, diopside, and aegerine), of enstatito (bronzite and hypers-
thene), and more rarely of hornblende.         Garnets are a frequent and
abundant constituent in many of these rocks, which, in their acces
sory minerals and their structures often exhibit many features of
striking interest.     By the gradual disappearance of the felspars from
these rocks, they pass into remarkable varieties of pyroxenites and
amphibolites.       The chief varieties of these rocks, which are now
described from Burma, are the following : — Augite-gneiss             (with
sahlite, green diopside, &c.), augite-granulites     (very rich in garnet),
t-ustatite-gneiss    (with bronzite or hypersthene), enstatite-granulites
 (rich  in  garnet),  scapolite-gneisses, scapolite-granulites, pyroxenites
and amphibolites of many varieties, and lapis-lazuli (lazurite-diopside-
epidote rock).      Many of these rocks contain crystals of calcite scat
tered through them.
    It is with these basic rocks, and more especially with the ultra-
 basic types last mentioned, that the remarkable crystalline limestones
 that contain the rubies and spinels are most intimately associated ;
 indeed the passage of rocks consisting of various silicates with a
 few calcite crystals into masses principally composed of calcite, but
 with the silicate minerals and oxides dispersed through them, is of
 the most insensible kind.        Some of the ruby-bearing limestones are
 highly   micaceous   (" cipollinos "), others are " calciphyres," in some
 of which the individual calcite crystals attain enormous dimensions.
 With the rubies and spinels are found a great number of oxides and
 nilicates, both original and secondary, with much graphite and pyi-
 rhotite.
     In the gravels and clays of the district fine specimens of the mine
  rals derived from the atmospheric degradation of the limestones and

other rocks are found, sometimes broken and waterworn, at other
times almost uninjured.
   The study of the extensive series of minerals brought from the
 ruby mines of Burma is calculated to throw light upon many im
 portant scientific problems.
   The association of minerals in the remarkable crystalline lime-
atones of Burma is worthy of the most careful consideration.           Cor
 undum  —  in  its various   forms  of  ruby, sapphire,  white    sapphire,
oriental amethyst, oriental topaz, &c. — is found associated with red,
purple, brown, black and other spinels, the relative proportions of
the minerals composed of aluminium oxide and of magnesium alu-
minate being very variable.       The other minerals present in the crys
talline limestones are zircon       (rare) ; garnets (abundant in some
places) ; a remarkable bine apatite ; felspars, of many species and
varieties (including murchisonite, moonstone, sunstone, &c.), and in
every stage of alteration ; quartz (in many varieties, and exhibiting
some remarkable peculiarities of crystallisation) ; micas (phlogopite,
fucbsite, with muscovite and other secondary and so-called hydro-
micas) ; hornblende and arf vedsonite ; augite (sahlite, diopside, and
segyrine) ;   enstatite    (bronzite and hypersthene) ; wollastonite ;
lapis-lazuli ; fibrolite ; scapolite ; with graphite and pyrrhotite. In
addition to muscovite and other secondary micas, we find the follow
ing alteration products : — Diaspore, margarite, and other clintouites,
chlorites, vermiculites, and carbonates.
   It is a noteworthy circumstance that none of the silicates com
bined with fluorine and boron compounds — such as topaz, tourmaline,
chondrodite and humite, axinite, or datholite have been certainly
detected in these limestones.         Beryl (aquamarine) and danburite
have been said to occur in the ruby earths, but there is reason for
doubting the correctness of the statement. The limestone which, in
the association of minerals found in it, most closely resembles the
rock of Burma, is the remarkable white limestone of Orange County,
N. Y., and Sussex County, N. J. ; but in the American rock the
c >rundum and spinels are associated with tourmalines and chon-
drodites.
   In considering the question of the origin of the corundums and
spinels of Burma, there are several very important facts to be borne
in mind. The gems, when found in situ, always appear to occur in
the limestone, and this limestone is of a very remarkable character.
There are no facts which point to the conclusion that the limestone
was originally of organic origin, but many circumstances suggest
that it may have been formed by purely chemical processes going on
at great depths within the earth's crust.           The highly-crystalline
calcareous rock, besides containing so many silicates and oxides, is
associated in the most intimate manner with pyroxene-gneisses and

  1895.]      The Rubies of Burma and Associated Minerals.                393
  granulites  containing anorthite, and with various         pyroxenites and
  amphibolites.     The  lime   felspars  and  lime-soda    felspars of these
 rocks show the greatest tendency to undergo change — passing into
 scapolites by the process known as
                                         " werneritisation," and eventually
 giving rise to the separation of calcium carbonate and hydrated
  aluminium silicates.       That from the last-mentioned salts the
  bydrated oxides of aluminium (diaspore, gibbsite, bauxite, <fec.) may
 be separated has been shown by the studies of Liebrich and others,
 while the conversion of these substances into the anhydrous alu
 minium oxide has been shown to take place by H. St. Claire Deville,
 Stanislas   Meunier, and others.
    Crystallised aluminium oxide (corundum) has now been formed by
 chemists by no less than 20 different processes, and in some cases,
 like those     described by Senarmont, Weinschenk,             Bruhns, and
 Friedel, the formation and crystallisation of the substance has been
 effected at very moderate temperatures under pressure.             By one or
 other of these or similar methods, it is probably that the formation
 of the Burma corundum and spinel has been effected, the source of
 the minerals being the decomposition products of basic and easily-
 altered lime felspars in the pyroxene-gneisses.
    Of still greater interest than the question of the origin of the
 corundums and spinels are the problems connected with the remark
 able changes that these minerals undergo in deep-seated rock masses.
 The rubies     of Burma, when found in situ in the limestones, are
usually seen to be enveloped in a mass of materials produced by the
alteration of their superficial portions.     Nearest to the unaltered gem
is a zone of diaspore— the hydrated aluminium oxide — and this is found
to pass insensibly into various hydrous aluminous silicates — mar-
garites and other clintonitos, vermiculites, muscovites, kaolinites, Ac.
While, in some instances, the corrosion of the rubies appears to have
gone on in a seemingly irregular manner, in the majority of cases
a very definite mode of metamorphosis may be detected by the study
of the various examples. There are evidently certain planes of " chemi
cal weakness
                 "
                   (analogous to the cleavage planes, gliding planes, and
other directions of physical weakness) along which decomposition
goes on most readily.        The principal of these solution planes is the
basal plane, and parallel to it we find the gems eaten away in a
series of step-like surfaces. Other less pronouneed planes of chemical
weakness exist parallel to the prism faces.          Unaltered corundum is,
like quartz, destitute of true cleavage, and breaks with a perfectly
conchoidal fracture.        If, however, gliding planes and lamellar
twinning     be developed in corundum (like those so easily produced in
the same way in calcite), parallel to the fundamental rhombohedron
of the crystals, then these gliding planes become " solution planes,"
along which chemical action takes place most readily.               Along the

394                          Prof. V. B. Lewes.                         [Mar.   7,
primary or secondary solution planes, hydration of the aluminium
oxide takes place, and diaspore is formed, as shown by Lawrence
Smith and Genth, and this unstable mineral enters into combinatiou
with silica and other oxides present to give rise to the numerous
pseudomorphs of corundum, which are so well known to mineralo
gists.
   There are certain crystals of corundum and spinel from Burma,
which present illustrations of corrosion of a very remarkable and
interesting character.      Commencing with the formation of naturally
etched figures (" Verwitterungsfiguren ") the work of corrosion goes
on till the whole crystal is broken up into an aggregate of simple
forms — these being, in the case of the spinel, the octahedron, and
in the case of the corundum, a combination of the rhombohedron,
basal plane, and prism.
    It is interesting to note that the quartz, felspars, and other minerals
associated with the rubies and spinels of Burma, exhibit phenomena
of external etching and internal chemical change similar to those we
have been describing in the case of the gems.                   The study of the
whole of the phenomena throws much new light on the remarkable
changes which take place, at great depth in the earth's crust, in
minerals which, at the surface, appear to be of a very stable
character.
IL    «  The Action of Heat upon Ethylene.                  II."   By VmAN      B.
       Lew¦s,      Professor of Chemistry at                the   Royal    Naval
       College, Greenwich.          Communicated by Professor T. E.
       Thorp¦, F.R.S.        Received January 10, 1895.
    In  a paper communicated to       this Society in the spring of      1894,*   I
 showed that ethylene, when subjected to heat, was converted                 into
acetylene and methane, according to the equation
                           3C2H4   = 2C,Ha+2CHt,
 and that the acetylene so formed either at once polymerised, forming
 a large number of secondary products, or else decomposed to carbon
 and hydrogen, according to the temperature at which the action was
 being carried on.
    The fact that ethylene is one of the principal products in many
 cases of destructive distillation, renders a knowledge of the conditions
 affecting these changes of considerable importance, and the experi
 ments described in this paper were made with the view of ascertaining
 the effect of rate of flow, area of heated surface, and dilution upon
the changes taking place.

     The apparatus and methods of analysis employed were the same as
  described in the former paper, with the exception that a platinum tube,
  14 mm.    in diameter and 73'6 cm. long, was used as the decomposing
 chamber, and that an easily regulated gas combustion fnrnace was
 employed as the source of heat.             The temperature of the gas in the
 tube was measured as before, by the Le Chatelier thermo-couple,
 and every precaution was taken to keep it constant during the
 experiments.
     The ethylene       in each case was prepared by heating a mixture of
 'lb  parts, by weight, of alcohol and 150 of strong sulphuric acid,
 purifying, and storing in a large glass holder.
     The first set of experiments was to ascertain the influence of
 area of heated surface upon ethylene when passing through a tube
 heated to the temperature most often employed in the destructive
distillation of coal and hydrocarbon oils, and also to find the result
of varying the rate at which the gas was passed through the zone of
heat.

    The first thing that strikes one is the enormous amount of decom
position which takes place in the first inch of flow through the heated
tube, and the small effect which an increase in the length of the
heated surface has upon the further decomposition of the unsaturated
hydrocarbons.
    This result might be caused by the methane and hydrogen formed
during the decomposition diluting the remaining ethylene, and so
rendering the decomposition more difficult ; it may also arise from
secondary actions taking place amongst the primary products, and
again forming ethylene, or it may be due to both these causes acting
together.
   In order to trace the effect of dilution, a series of experiments was
made in which ethylene, diluted with hydrogen, was passed through
6 inches of the same tube as was used in the previous experiments,
heated     to the same temperature, and under precisely similar
conditions.
   The store holder of ethylene used for making the mixture contained
a gas which gave, on analysis,

 points to its being radiant heat, and not contact with the heated sides
of the tube, which is responsible for the largest proportion of the
 decomposition ; since, had contact been the active factor, dilution, by
 reducing the number of impacts of the hydrocarbon molecules with
 the heated surface, would have shown a considerable decrease in
 decomposition.
    Some information can be obtained as to the secondary reactions
 which accompany the main decomposition, by studying the propor
tions in which the products, other than ethylene, are present in the
 gases after heating.
    Taking the experiments made upon the effect of length of heated
tube and rate of flow, and tabulating the percentages of saturated

  It  seems probable from the figures          that when dilution reaches above
  50   per cent., not only is decomposition of the methane retarded, but
  formation as a secondary product commences.
      Ever since water gas has been in use it has been well known that
  it contained traces of methane and acetylene, under conditions which
 render it impossible for them to have been formed from hydrocarbons
 remaining in the incandescent fuel, and the probabilities are that
 they have been produced, the acetylene by direct combination of
 carbon and hydrogen, and the methane by its partial decomposition.
     The formation of ethylene from nascent hydrogen and acetylene
 takes place at such temperatures as those employed, and the amount
 bo formed and again broken up by the radiant heat is purely a func
                               I
 tion of mass ; so that conceive from these experiments, the ethylene
 at once to a great extent decomposes                    under the influence of
sufficiently high radiant          heat according   to the  equation : —
                                 3C2H«  = 2C2Hs+2CHi,
and that the acetylene partly decomposes, the nascent hydrogen again
uniting with more acetylene to reproduce ethylene, whilst other por
tions of the acetylene polymerise to benzene and other more complex
hydrocarbons, and that, if the flow of this mixture be continued
through a heated chamber, the action continues, the amount of ethyl
ene regenerated becoming less and less, until it ceases to exist as a
product of the decomposition.

   It  is well known that hydrogen will diffuse through ignited
platinum into a vacuous space or even into other gases, and although
no change in volume was observed when a mixture of 95 per cent,
hydrogen and 5 per cent. ethylene was passed through the tr.be
heated to 900° C, it seemed advisable to make special experiments to
ascertain if any loss of hydrogen from this cause did take place at
the temperature employed.
   The apparatus having been fitted up as before, 6 in. of the tube
were heated to between 900° and 1000° C, and a carefully measured
volume of pure hydrogen was made to pass through it three times at
a slow rate of flow, with the result that, after being brought back to
its original temperature and pressure, it measured 99-5 per cent. of the
volume taken, showing that error from this cause is not likely to
have taken place.
   A  new series of experiments was now undertaken to ascertain, if
possible, how increase of contact with the heated walls of the con
taining vessel affected the amount and character of the decomposition
taking place.
   In order to do this, a small platinum tube 2-5 mm. in diameter and
45"72 cm. long was taken in place of the one used in the previous ex
periments, which was 14 mm. in diameter. The area of the big tube
therefore, as compared with the area of the small tube, was as V54 to
0-049, and in order to obtain the relative amount of decomposition it
is manifest that the rate of flow must be the same in both tubes.
   If the rate of flow in the big tube be 40 c.c. per minute, then
                                  2^1x40 =

  From the results of these experiments it may be stated that —
   1. The initial decomposition of ethylene by heat is very rapid, and
        requires but a short flow through a heated containing vessel,
        such primary decomposition, however, being but slowly com
        pleted, owing to secondary reactions, which tend to re-form
        ethylene.
  2.  Dilution has but little effect in retarding the decomposition of
        ethylene, unless it be very large.
  3.  Increase in rate of flow diminishes the amount of decomposition
        when the heated area is small, but rapidly diminishes in
        effect as the length of flow through a heated area increases.
  4.  The decomposition of ethylene is chiefly caused by radiant heat,
        the effect of which is very great as compared with the decom
        position due to contact with heated surfaces.
   I  desire to acknowledge the valuable aid given mo by Mr. F. B.
Grundy in this investigation.
TIL " On the Measurement of Pressures by the Crasher-Gauge."
      By W. Kellner and W. H. D¦ering. Communicated by
      Dr. W. Anderson, F.R.S.          Received January 21, 1895.
   The object of the experiments, the results of which are given in
this paper, was to compare the indication of pressure (produced by
the firing in a closed vessel of a guupowder) by the crusher-gauge
with a simultaneous estimation of the same pressure by another and
simple method. This latter consisted in ascertaining the weight
which was equal to the maximum pressure of the gases of the fired
cordite (the smokeless gunpowder used in these experiments) acting
on a valve closing gas-tight an opening in the explosion-vessel of
area small enough to allow of the use of weights of manageable
amount, not so small a fraction of the unit of surface (1 sq. in.)
as to have to use a veiy large multiplier.        "Within the explosion-
vessel, on the top of which were the valve and weights, was placed
the crusher-gauge, the firing of the charge of cordite giving the
two indications of pressure. In the " weights
                                                   " method, a series of
short steps was taken, weights in excess of that required being
placed on the valve, the cordite fired, and it being observed whether
the gases of explosion were blown out of, or kept in, the vessel.
The amount of compression of the copper-crusher was then
measured, and the corresponding pressure ascertained from the
existing tables. In the next experiment the weights were lightened-
and so on, until the gas blew out of the vessel, the mean of the
pressure at the blow-out point and of that in the last experiment in

  1895.]    Measurement     of Pressures   by the Crusher-Gauge.        405
 which the gas was kept       in the vessel being taken as the pressure
 required.    A pressure by copper-crusher was taken in each experi
 ment made,    and the mean of the series taken ; the compression of
 the crusher was the same in the experiments of a series, whether
 the gases blew out of, or were kept in, the explosion-vessel, the
 weights apparently not being raised before the compression of the
 copper had come to an end.
    It may be not superfluous to mention that the copper-crusher is a
 small cylinder of copper, before compression 0"5 in. long and
 0"326 in. in diameter, one end of which rests on the base of a steel
 case in which it is contained, the other end being in contact with one
 end of a movable piston of 0"461 in. diameter (a sq. in. section), on the
other end of which the gases exert their pressure ; suitable provision
is made to prevent entrance of gas to the gauge-case, and to hold
the copper-crusher in position while allowing room for its widening
in the middle by compression.            The coppers are used previously
pressed   to about  a  ton short of   the pressure to be measured.
   Eumford, in 1797, used a      "           " method to ascertain the rela

charges of guupowder from 1 to IS grains in weight, density of
charge varied from 0-04 to 0-76, and the pressures measured were
consequently very high ; the weight just lifted by the pressure of the
powder gases was found by a series of trials.
   Bunsen also (' Gasometrische Methoden ') used the same method,
of course very much altered in details, to ascertain the pressures
produced by the combustion of some gases in oxygen ; the gaseous
mixtures were at 1 atmos. pressure, the increase of pressure pro
duced on firing the mixtures was at highest about 10 atmos. (about
     ton per sq. in.).
    In our experiments,    the gases of the fired explosive served   only as
a medium     for comparing the two methods of estimating pressure, so
that the question of any lowering of temperature by heating of the
explosion-vessel did not come into consideration.
   This direct experimental method of checking the crusher-gauge
indications is preferable to calculation of pressure from the ascer
tained amounts of permanent gases, water, and quantity of heat
produced at the pressures in question, because the calculation requires
knowledge of the specific heat of the gases of combustion at (in the
case of cordite) about 3000° C, and although there is valuable
information on the subject, it is scarcely sufficiently accurate for this
application of it. Again, the compression of the copper-crusher
measures the maximum pressure of the gases, when (at the tempera
ture mentioned) some dissociation of carbonic acid would occur (or

406            Messrs. W. Kellner and W. H. Deeriiig.              [Mar. 7,
rather   some   oxygen and carbonic oxide would co-exist), while the
quantity of heat is measured in the cooled-down gases when all
oxygen and carbonic oxide have combined ; here, also, it would not
be practicable with existing information to make an accurate allow
ance for difference of heat-quantity      under the conditions of the
experiment.     Further, in calculating the pressure of the gases from
their calculated temperature, it is assumed that their coefficients of
expansion which were determined for 0° to 100° C. are valid at
3000° C.    (At 0°, air is only about 190° above, and water is 100°
below, its boiling temperature.)
   If temperature were independently known, the drawbacks just
mentioned in the use of the coefficient of expansion, and of the
volume of gases, still apply to the calculation of pressure; and,
conversely, to the frequent case of calculating temperature from
ascertained pressure.
   The steel explosion-vessels used in our experiments were of about
120 c.c. capacity ; they were closed by screw stoppers of about
4 ins. total length (the screw portion about H ins. long), the end of
which was screwed down to gas-tight contact with the circular seat
ing forming the mouth of the explosion-chamber.        The stoppers had
a square head at starting 2 ins. long ; the whole stopper was per
forated axially with a cylindrical hole  J in. in diameter. The mouth
of the hole in the stopper was closed by a steel ball of ^ in. in diameter
(which formed the valve), a ball such as is used for ball-bearings; on
the ball a 1-in. thick iron plate, abont 15 ins. by 15 ins., was placed
                                                                    J
(the centre of the plate being perforated by a cylindrical hole in. in
diameter, resting on the top of the ball), and on the plate the weights.
The latter consisted of lead cylinders, weighing about 5 cwt. and
8 cwt. respectively (diameters 14 ins. and 12 ins.) ; of the former, at
 the most three (placed on top of each other), and of the latter, two,
were used.     The weight was made up with half-hundredweights and
 smaller weights placed on the top of the upper lead-cylinder ; all the
weights, lead-cylinders, iron plate, and iron rod, were weighed at the
beginning and end of the experiments by standard weights.
    The explosion-vessels had externally a collar and a hexagonal por
tion fitting into a hexagonal hole in an iron plate, which was screwed
to a balk of timber, held in place by weights ; this held the explosion-
vessel while the screw-stopper was hammered down, and formed the
base of the apparatus.     The lead cylinders had an axial cylindrical
hole to their centre ; in the hole of the top cylinder an iron rod
(about 1 in. diameter, 4 ft. long) was placed, the upper end of the
rod passing loosely through a hole in a cross-beam kept in position
by iron uprights on either side of the base of the apparatus. The
weights were carefully balanced, so that pressure of iron rod against
cross-beam was reduced to an inconsiderable amount.              The lead

 1895.]     Measurement    of Pressures   by the Crusher-Gauge.         407
 cylinders were readily placed     in position on the iron plate (held hori
 zontal  hy wedges   until   cylinders and weights were in position) by
 means   of a movable crane.
    The firing of the cordite charge was effected by means of a wire-
 bridge heated to redness by an electric current ; on the centre of the
 wire-bridge a small piece of the cordite was firmly hung.          One end
 of the wire-bridge was soldered to the end of a steel pin forming part
of the stopper, the other end was soldered to the end of a steel wire
of fa in. diameter cemented by a suitable resinous cement in a hole of
tj   in. diameter   passing through the length of the stopper. By
reducing the area of the insulated wire to this small amount, the
cement held the wire gas-tight against the highest pressure (16 tons
per sq. in.) employed.        In the 14-ton and 16-ton experiments, the
stopper was cooled by a little ice placed on ita upper surface, to pre
vent softening of the cement.
   The area of the mouth of the hole in the stopper was measured by
means of a microscope with a cross-wire, the microscope moving
horizontally on a graduated scale and carrying a vernier.          The pres
sure of the weights on the steel ball and stopper slightly bevels the
mouth    of the latter  ; at the commencement of a series of experiments,
weights to about the maximum amount to be used were placed on the
steel ball, and four diameters of the inner and lower circle of the
bevelled contact-ring      were then measured with the microscope-
vernier.     The area was re-measured in the course of several of the
series, and found to be unchanged.
    One hundred and twenty-six experiments in all were made ; a few
of these were lost by the weight required having been under-estimated
and the gases blowing out on the first experiment of a series being
made.      A few of them also were lost by the blowing out of the
insulated wire, or by other causes. The remainder form twenty-seven
series (a series consisting of at least two experiments : in one of which
the gases were kept in, and were blown out in the following one),
the results (viz., the mean of the last two experiments) of which are
given below.       Eight series consisted of two experiments, two of
three, six of four, three of five, six of six, one of seven, one of eight.
    The gases were either wholly kept in, or wholly blown out of, the
explosion vessel.      In the former case there was no report and no
damage to the steel ball, which could be used for all the experiments
of a series ; in the latter case there was a loud report, and the mouth
of the hole in the stopper was slightly injured (the steel being melted
and blown away by the gases), and a ring melted in the steel ball.
A new steel ball was, of course, used for each series of experiments.
For the experiments at the lower pressures of o and 6 tons, the hole
in the stopper was (after damage by the blown-out gases) enlarged
 at the top (to a depth of ^ in.) to 035 in., and subsequently to 0 40 in.

   The pressure by weights was invariably higher than by crusher ;
at 5 tons (by crusher) the difference was about 11 per cent., at 6 tons
about   9  per cent., at 13 tons about 11 per cent., at 16 tons about
16 per cent. At 5, 6, and 13 tons there is usually (but not always)
less difference between the individual pressures by crusher given
above than between the weights pressures ; at 16 tons there is
decidedly greater regularity in the crusher results than in those by
weights ; the crusher pressures are, however, the means of series,
which favours them somewhat.

 Croonian Lecture. — " On the Nature of Muscular Contrac
       tion." By Th. W. ENGELMANN, Professor of Physiology
       in the University of Utrecht. Received February 25,
       1895.
   I  beg   your kind attention for a few moments to some observations
and considerations on the nature of muscular contraction.            Besides its
general biological interest, the subject may claim a particular interest
for the members of this Society, for the venerable institution of these
Croonian Lectures is especially devoted to the furtherance of the
study of muscular life, and, moreover, the Royal Society has, through
its Fellows, from Robert Hooke down to our friend Professor Schafer,
produced numerous researches on muscular structure and action which
may be said to belong to the most valuable part of our scientific
property.
   It will not be my task to recall to your mind all those eminent
Fellows of this Society who have helped us to get a clearer insight
into this subject, yet   I cannot refrain from reminding you of one of
these men, who is honoured throughout the whole world as one of

the founders of our present doctrine of muscular structure and
action —a man whose name will live on, in my home in Holland, of all
countries, associated with the memory of his great brotherly friend,
Donders, and whom, to my great grief,         I may see here no more — I
mean Sir William Bowman.
                         I
    But a few year-s ago had the happiness of seeing him in Utrecht,
and of observing how the interest which he took in a province of
science in which he had gained his first laurels remained unchanged,
even after the lapse of half a century.        To behold him among this
audience would have been my greatest joy and pride, and his judgment
would, in my eyes, have been invaluable.                           I
                                                May that which am now
going   to say be commended     to you   at the same time as homage paid
to the memory of the discoverer of the sarcous elements and of the
 waves of contraction.
    The subject of my lecture is an inquiry into " The Nature of
Muscular Contraction."       Like all vital phenomena, muscnlar con
traction is a most complicated process, composed of mechanical,
.chemical, thermal, and electrical changes in living matter.          Hence
it will be our task to become acquainted with these changes as com
 pletely and exactly as possible, and to ascertain their causal con
nection. Our inquiry must not be restricted to one special kind of
muscle : it will have to extend to all the different forms, the highest
as well as the lowest — muscles in every stage of development, muscles
¦either sound or unsound, — for there can be no doubt but that in all
these cases the principle of activity is the same. Nay, it will be necessary
to deal even with the other phenomena of so-called contractility, such
as protoplasmic and ciliary motion, for all those different types of
 organic movement, however much they may differ from each other in
 details, are yet connected by states of gradual transition, so that, to
 all appearance, one principle of motion, essentially the same, is
applicable to all of them.
    Only such properties and processes as all contractile structures
 have in common will consequently have a right to be considered
essential to the process of contraction, and only such will be allowed
 to form the basis of our endeavours to explain muscular motion.
    The general mechanical principle on which muscular contraction
 is based, will apparently be discovered when we shall have ascer
 tained in what way the power of shortening proceeds from the
 potential chemical energy which disappears upon stimulation of the
 muscle. There can be no doubt as to the fact, that the potential
chemical energy of the component parts of muscular substance is
alone the ultimate source of this power, for the existence of any other
source cannot be proved.
    The quantity of energy which is imparted to the muscle by the

 1895.]          On the Nature      of Muscular Contraction.
 stimulus  is too small to be taken into consideration.          The early
opinion that the power required for contraction was imparted to the
muscle through the medium of motor nerves, was refuted by experi
ments, such as, e.g., those on the persistence of contractility after
degeneration of the motor nerves, and on the effects of direct artificial
stimulation of the muscles ; and it had even been refuted long ere
the law of conservation of energy had thrown its light on the mutual
connexion between the phenomena of the living organs.
    This law teaches that all the actual energy which appears in the
muscle in consequence of stimulation, must originate in an equivalent
quantity of some other form of energy.
    Now this form of energy is, in fact, given in the muscular substance
liable to physiological combustion.       The quantity of the latter is not
only theoretically sufficient    to  produce that actual energy, but it has
even been proved         experimentally    that during contraction the
material gives rise to combinations, such as carbonic acid, in the
development of which potential chemical energy must have passed
into other forms of energy.          So far as the phenomena have been
examined quantitatively, they confirm the conclusion that all muscular
force must be derived from chemical energy.
   Hence there is no difference about all these points.       But with this
result we have as yet gained only a basis for the proper solution.        As
soon as yon inquire in what way, by what transformations, does the
mechanical force of contraction arise from chemical energy, diffi
culties and differences of opinion begin to present themselves.
    A great many physiologists hold, with Pfluger, Fick, and Chauveau,
that mnscular force is a direct manifestation of chemical attraction ;
others, e.g., Solvay, think that it is produced through the medium of
electricity ; oth ers again, following J. R. Mayer, believe that the muscle
is a thermodynamic machine, not -unlike our caloric or steam engines.
    The Chemiodynamic Hypothesis. — The first hypothesis, according to
which contraction of muscle is a direct manifestation of chemical
attraction — we may call it the chemiodynamic hypothesis — has to
assume that the molecules, on the chemical combination of which this
contraction is based, are regularly arranged within the contractile
Bubstance in such a way that they necessarily approach each other,
during that combination, in the direction of the axis of the muscular
fibres.
    I think that this hypothesis of the identity of chemical attraction
and muscular force meets with a fundamental difficulty in the fact
that, in a. single contraction, only a relatively infinitesimal  part of the
muscular substance is chemically active.          70 to 80 per cent, of the
muscle (and even more) consists of imbibed water, the rest contains
substances (albumin, salts, &c.) which, for the greater part, so far as
can be proved, are not chemically concerned        in the contraction.

    414                   Prof. Th. W. Engelmann.                  [Mar.          14,
      This quantitative composition and this minute consumption             of   the
    active muscle compel us to assume that relatively only very                  few
    molecules of the muscular substance can be considered as sources              of
I   energy, and of these again    it    generally but a small part that at
                                       is
    a certain moment perform their function.     How else were    it
                                                                   possible
    for a severed bloodless muscle to continue to carry out, without any
    perceptible decrease of weight, many thousands of contractions, and
    how else could a frog's beart, isolated and all but bloodless, beat on
    for days together, with a nearly constant frequency and -rat slowly
    sinking power   ?
       With certain presuppositions we may compute the quantity                   of
    matter through the chemical action of which the amount of actual
    energy, produced at a certain contraction, must have been generated.
       If we prevent a muscle from doing external work during the
    contraction, the whole actual energy will present itself in the shape
    of heat. When there but a slight contraction, the muscle of frog,
                           is                                           a
    e.g., will grow warmer by about 0-001° C.        Supposing the specific
    heat of the muscle to be equal to that of water (in fact      it   is
                                                                       less),
    we find that to produce a rise of 0"001° C. in temperature a quantity
    of heat of 0"OOl cal.is required for each gram of muscle. No matter
    whether this quantity of heat results from combustion of carbo
    hydrates, fats, or albuminous matter,       it  can be but an infinit-
    esimal part   of the  muscular  substance   that  produced it. If, e.g.,
    as is  ordinarily supposed, the combustion of a carbohydrate into
    CO2 and H2O produced that heat, taking the heat of combustion of
    one gram of carbohydrate to be broadly 4000 cal., no more than                 a
    four thousandth part of a milligram will have been consumed in each
    gram of the muscle.     Hence only about a four millionth part of the
    muscular substance could have been the source of the actual energy,
    set free by the stimulus, and have served at the same time, according
    to the above hypothesis, as the seat of direct attraction.
       But whatever may be our conception of the size, form, position,
    and sphere of action of this four millionth part with regard to the rest
    of the soft, watery mass, only passively moved,   I  fail to understand
    how, through direct chemical attraction, this one particle should set all
    those other four million parts, less one, moved, as in fact  itdoes.
       We must not forget that we have to deal with enormous changes
    of form.     Muscles of insects are sometimes shortened by local
    contraction to one twentieth of their length during rest. The
    myopodia of Acanthocystis can be reduced to a fiftieth part of their
    length by the action of even a weak stimulus         ; in this case an
    extremely long,   thin   fibre    in  a  moment  changed into a short
    cylinder, about as broad as itis islong.
       That this can ever be brought about by direct chemical attraction,
    seeing that but a relatively infinitesimal part of the soft watery sub

1895.]            On the Nature    of Muscular  Contraction.           415
stance   of the fibre is the seat of this chemical attraction, seems to me
difficult to understand, even if we assume — as      I believe we must do
— that the number of the chemically active molecules is, even in the
smallest visible particle, so large that the distances which separate
them from each other and from the passively moving molecules lying
between them, fall within the limits in which molecular mechanical
influence can be exercised.
   The adherents of the chemio-dynamic hypothesis have not as yet
answered this objection. And since they can give but an unsatisfactory
account or no account at all of many other facts (I will refer to some of
these facts further on), we may be allowed to cast about for some
other explanation.
   The Electrodynamic Hypothesis. — Since Galvani's discoveries the
electric phenomena of the muscles have frequently been suspected
to contain the solution of our problem.       And indeed, it is not so very
difficult to mention a series of facts which seem to bear out the
suggestion that the mechanical work done by the muscle may be
created from chemical energy through the medium of electric forces.
   There is, in the first place, the fact that muscles, when in action,
produce regular electric effects.        These effects are indeed the first
phenomena we can observe after the stimulation. They seem to begin
at the very moment of stimulation, shortly before the contraction ;
hence they might in so far be the cause of the mechanical process.
   Moreover, the value of the electromotive force, as du Bois-Reymond
proved, is very high, and in the active particles is probably much
higher than the force of the currents we can derive from the surface
of the muscle.
   Add to this that the economic coefficient of the muscle may attain,
just as in the case of electric motors, a considerable proportion.       As
ranch as 25 per cent, and more of the potential energy which has been
consumed may be transformed into mechanical work.
    However, there are weighty objections to this hypothesis also.       In
the first place, there is the fact that these very same electromotive
 forces, of equal intensity and direction, appear, nnder the same influ
 ences, not only in the muscles, but also in nerves, glands, and other
 organs, which do not possess the least contractility. Then there is the
 important discovery of Biedermann, that the contractility of muscles
 may be completely neutralized by water or ether vapour, without
 doing any perceptible harm to the electromotor phenomena.
    In the same way the development of the electric organs supplies ns
 with important proofs of the independence of the electric and the
 mechanical processes.       In most cases these organs are developed out
 of striped muscular fibres.         Now, in this process of development,
 contractility is gradually       lost, whereas the power of producing
 electrical effects attains a yet higher degree of perfection.

     The Thermodynamic Hypothesis.            — More probable than               the chemical
and the electrical               hypothesis   may be deemed       a suggestion,                first
pnt forward by Jul. Rob. Mayer, though in an nntenable form,
according to which the muscle is a thermodynamic machine. Physio
logists, however, generally object that this view is not compatible
with the second law of the theory of heat, for we cannot expect
differences in temperature in the muscle so great as this law requires
they should be.
     Now   I
           think that, on the contrary, we must assume exceedingly
large differences of temperature in the stimulated muscle. What
holds good of the whole body holds good of the muscle also ; the
temperature, measured with our instruments, is but an arithmetical

   From the fact that at the contraction an infinitesimal part only of
the muscular mass is chemically active, we infer that the temperature
of these particles must, at the moment of combustion, be an
uncommonly high one.         Great as the specific heat of muscular
substance is, it would otherwise be impossible to account for a rise
in the temperature of the whole mass even of 0 001° C. only. Without
any exaggeration we may assume that the temperature of the
chemically active particles may, at the moment of combination, exceed
the average muscular temperature by hundreds of degrees.
   Since each thermogenic particle is surrounded by a relatively
enormous cool mass, conducting heat and diathermanous, the prin
cipal condition for the transformation of heat into mechanical work
has been satisfied, and, on account of the enormous differences in
temperature which we have to assume, in such a high degree, that
even an economic coefficient of 30 per cent., nay, 50 per cent., and
even more, seems to be theoretically possible.
   Supposing we have to deal with a Carnot's cycle, the theoretical
                                                                      rj\        rji

                           is
 + 37° =  310°,  the  mechanical effect might at T, = 410° amount to
25 per cent., when tho temperature of the active particles would
consequently exceed the average temperature of the normal muscle
by 100° C. only.
   The objection that these high temperatures must necessarily
destroy the life of the muscle, since the latter becomes rigid and dies
even at 50° C,       for the same reasons, of small value only. For
                           is,
it    ever an infinitesimal part only of the muscular mass that
     is                                                                                          is
exposed to these high temperatures.     At small distance from these

  harmless.    The muscle will no more be destroyed by stimulation
 than a steamship will be destroyed by beating the furnaces.                     The
  material  of combustion only will be destroyed ; the vessel as a whole
 remains    unharmed.
     However likely it may thus seem that nature should avail herself
 of these favourable terms on which mechanical work may result from
 muscular heat, we have had up to the present time no direct proof that
 this is actually the case, nor do we know in what way it takes place,
 if in any. But      I venture to think that the proof can now be given,
 inasmuch as it is possible to demonstrate how, through the medium
 of peculiar arrangements of the material of the muscle, a transforma
 tion of chemical energy into mechanical work by means of heat not
 only can, but actually must, be brought about.*
                Muscular Structure in relation      to Contractility.
     The Fibrils  are the Seat of the Shortening Power. — For this we need
 firstly to pay attention to the peculiarities of the microscopical
 structure of muscle. All muscular fibres of all animals are composed
 chiefly of two parts : extremely thin, long, albuminous fibrils, and an
 interfibrillar plasmatic substance, the so-called sarcoplasm.                    The
quantitative relations of both vary, but the fibrils always occur in
 great number, forming very often the greatest part of the whole mass
 of the muscle.      They always run parallel to each other throughout
 the length of the fibres.
     This fibrillar structure is also presented by all the other formed
contractile substances, such as the myonemata of Infusoria and of
 other Protozoa, the cilia and vibrating membranes of cells, the tails
of spermatozoa, nay even, at least, when not in a state of contraction,
 by the amoeboid protoplasm of Pelomyxa, Myxomycetes,                     and other
forms.
    Direct microscopical observation during life teaches us that the
fibrils, and not the sarcoplasm, are the seat of the shortening power.
The fibrils in a state of relaxation are long and thin, and often run
 in winding curves, but grow short, thick, and straight, in conse
quence of stimulation.             The sarcoplasm passively follows their
movements. Moreover, completely isolated fibrils can shorten.
     The Fibrils are Contractile because they contain Doubly Refractive
Particles. — Thus the question arises : can there be demonstrated in
the fibrils arrangements such that by means of them contractile force
may originate in a thermodynamic mode ?

   Light — lux optimum reagens, as Buys Ballot said — solves this ques
tion for us. If we examine the optic properties of contractile fibrils,
with the aid of the polarising microscope, we find that all of them
are double-refractive, with one optical axis parallel to the direction
of contraction.    This property, long ago discovered by Boeck in the
striated muscles of the higher animals, has now been proved to apper
tain to the muscular fibres of all the animals examined for that end,
to the contractile fibrils of Protozoa, e.g., to the muscle of the stalk
and the myonemata in the subcuticular layer of Vorticella, to all
kinds of ciliary apparatus, and in many cases to contractile proto
plasm also.
   This general occurrence of double-refracting power is the more
indicative of relations to contractility, since non-contractile cells, as
a rule, lack double refraction, even where we meet with a fibrillar
structure, as in the axis-cylinder of a nerve-fibre.
   Our conjecture gains, I believe, a very high degree of probability
by the following series of observations, which are the more convincing
since they relate to quite different categories of phenomena, inde
pendent of each other.
   In the first place, there is the fact that contractility and double
refraction in the course of ontogenesis always appear at the same time,
e.g., in the heart of the chick on the second day of incubation ; in the
muscles of the trunk and skin on the fifth or sixth day; in the
muscles of the tails of tadpoles when the length of their body is
3 to 4 mm. ; in the muscles of the stalk of Vorticella, and in cilia
so soon as these organs become visible.
   Other evidence seems to me to be afforded by the behaviour of
the striated muscles. Here the fibrils consist of the doubly-refractive
sarcous elements and the singly-refractive material which joins these,
the two alternating regularly.        The two are wholly different as
regards   their optical, mechanical, and chemical properties ; and these
properties, moreover, during contraction,      change in an opposite
way.      Hence the functions of     the two must  be different.    And
since the changes of form, volume, &c., of the doubly-refractive
parts during contraction prove that in each case these parts mnst
be the seat of contractile power, the singly-refractive junctions will
most probably have another function.       We will come back to these
changes further on.
   A third evidence is afforded by the observation that the specific
force of contraction in different muscles      in general, greater, the
                                              is,
better developed the power of double refraction, comparison, of course,
in each case being made with parts of the same thickness.

striated muscular fibres, one of the signs of the incipient change
structure and function   is the vanishing of double refraction in the

  1895.]          On the Nature         of Muscular Contraction.                      419
  sarcous elements.       In an early      stage    of development this vanishing
  is,  with Raja clavata, the very first and the only sign that the fibre              is
  about   to be transformed from a contractile into an electric organ.*
      But particularly significant seems to me to be the behaviour of the
 obliquely striated muscles of      Molluscs and other Invertebrata. Here
 the     doubly  refractive fibrils do not run parallel to the axis of the
   fibre, but describe spiral lines round       and during contraction the
                                                   it
                                                    ;              a
   steepness of the curves decreases, so that the angle formed by the
   longitudinal axis of the fibril and the longitudinal axis of the fibre
   may increase from 5° in the relaxed state to 60°, and even more, in a
   state of powerful contraction.         But the optic axis of the fibril,
  instead of assuming, in this case, a more oblique position also, as
  might be expected on morphological grounds, remains parallel to the
  longitudinal axis of the fibre, and consequently to the direction of
  shortening of the fibre. Hence        is not the morphological axis of the
                                         it
  fibrils, but the optical axis of their donbly refractive constituents,
  which coincides with the direction of the contracting force.

  than a score of years ago pointed out the fact that even non-muscular
                              I
 elements, elements not possessing irritability in the physiological
 sense of the word, nay, even lifeless, unorganised elements which are
 doubly refractive and uniaxial, may, under certain influences, contract
 in   the direction of the optical axis, all thickening at one time, and
 contracting with a force and quickness and to an extent rivalling that
 of muscles, if not surpassing it.       Instances of this are the fibrils of
 connective tissue, of the tendons, and of the cornea and others.
 The same contractile power was found by von Ebner in a great many
 other doubly refractive histological elements, nay, even in substances
 capable of imbibition and thereby made doubly refractive, e.g., dried
 colloid membranes and finally by Hermann in fibrils of fibrin.
                      ;
I       have in this way shown that singly refractive, or only feebly
doubly refractive histological elements, such as fibres of elastic
tissue, in the same way as caoutchouc, obtain the power, when
made doubly refractive by extension, of contracting under certain
influences, and further that the force of shortening will generally be
greater iu proportion to the amount of the double refraction thus
artificially produced.
   Since, according to Mitscherlich's discovery, similar changes of
form may be observed in doubly refractive crystals, we have appa
rently to deal with       aproperty pertaining to all doubly refractive
bodies as such.

mechanical energy of shortening is elevation of temperature. Cooling
has the opposite effect.
    Particularly instructive is the thermal contraction of fibrillar con
nective tissue, on account of its similarity to muscular movement,
even with regard to details.           This tissue, like muscle, consists of
doubly refractive fibrils and of an inter-fibrillar singly refractive
isotropic substance. The fibrils have about the same dimensions
as muscular fibrils, and, for the rest, show, in their optical and
mechanical behaviour under various influences, a great likeness to
muscular fibrils, especially to the doubly-refractive sarcous elements.
    In tendons and many membranes the fibrils, as well as those of
most muscles, are arranged into bundles, all, or nearly all, parallel
to each other. For this reason such objects are extremely well fitted
for a closer examination of the phenomena of movement.             The most
suitable material     I  know is furnished by the catgut string of a violin,
which consists chiefly of such bundles, running in steep spiral lines
round the longitudinal axis of the string. Such a string is dis
tinguished from the greater number of naturally occurring objects by
its very regular cylindrical shape and its elasticity.        On these pro
perties is based its suitability for musical purposes, especially for
 the so-called " perfect fifth

    The Muscle-Model. — With the aid of such a string we can compose
a model which in a simple way explains bow in the muscle me
chanical energy of contraction may result from heat without any
 perceptible rise of the average temperature of the muscle.
    The following sketch (fig. 1) presents this model of the muscle dia-
 grammatically simplified : —
     A piece of an E string of a violin, about 5 cm. long and previously
 swollen in water, is fastened to the end, a, of the short rigid arm of
 a steel rod, ah, while the upper end of the string is fixed on
 the shorter arm of the lever, H, turning round the horizontal axis, c.
     To this string different tensions may be imparted by weights
  (d, di), or springs, acting upon the lever, and since the point of appli
 cation of the string may be changed at will, its contraction, with all
 the conditions of isometry, isotony, and auxotony may be examined.
     Round the string, but without touching it, runs for a length of
  about 20 mm., and in about twenty curves, a spiral of thin platinum
  wire.    Its ends may be connected by means of two binding-screws
  of the ebonite or ivory piece, /, with the two wires coming from the
  poles of a Grove or Bunsen battery of throe or more cells.        The rod,
  ah, bearing     lever,  string, and   spiral wire, is placed in a glass of
  about 50 c.c. content. filled with water of about 55 — 60° C., and closed
  at the top by an ebonite lid.          Through an aperture in the lid, a
  thermometer is placed in the water in such a position that it will
  remain at a distance of about 1 cm. from the spiral wire.

   The string is now observed for some minutes at a tension of 25 or
50 grammes, and at a constant temperature, until no further change in
the position of the lever can be discerned.      If we now close for some
seconds the circuit of the battery through the spiral, the lever rises.
Upon opening the circuit, it falls.    The thermometer in the glass indi
cates a liardly perceptible rise in temperature, or no rise at all.
   We see the doubly-refractive string of our model corresponds with
the doubly-refractive     muscular particle, which we suppose to be the
seat of the force of contraction,          and therefore may be called
"             "
  inotagma ; the water in the glass represents the watery isotropic
substance round the inotagma, doing duty as refrigerant ; the spiral
wire supplies the place of the chemically active thermogenic mole
cules ; the closnre of the galvanic circuit corresponds with the
process of the stimulation of the muscular element.
   The experiment may be simplified by heating in the air a string
previously made to swell by being dipped in hot water and then
soaked in concentrated glycerine.          The movements will then take
place more quickly on account of the quicker heating and cooling.
Moreover, the experiment may be repeated almost as often as one
likes.   If we fasten to the lever a little metallic hook, which when

  sinking closes the circuit of the spiral by dipping in mercury,       and
  breaks it again when rising, contraction and relaxation of the     string
 will alternate regularly for hours, just as with a beating heart.
     The movements may be inscribed on a rotating cylinder.             We
 then obtain curves of the same character as contraction- curves          of
 muscles (fig. 2).

    Such a chordogram presents, like a myogram, three periods, viz.: —
    1. A period of latent energy, the duration of which, just as with
 the muscle, decreases with the increasing energy of the stimulus (i.e.,
with the intensity and duration of the electric current), with rising
temperature and with decreasing load.
    2. A period of augmenting energy, in which contraction takes
place with a rapidity, first increasing, afterwards diminishing, the
contraction being, within certain limits, more rapid and larger in
extent the stronger the stimulation.
    3. A period of declining energy, in which the string relaxes with a
gradually decreasing rapidity.

Muscle. The points of resemblance between our model and a muscle
extend much further yet, and amongst other to peculiarities which
seem to bear important testimony to the identity of the mechanical
 process in the two cases.
    Such a resemblance   I  find, in the first place, in the fact that the
strength of the shortening power, developed by a certain stimidus,
increases with the load within certain limits. Both muscle and string
present the paradoxical phenomenon that, under a stimulus of equal
energy, heavier weights may be lifted higher than lighter ones.
    Adolf Fick first detected this surprising fact in the muscles of
Ancdonta ; and Rudolf Heidenhain, almost at the same time, observed
it in the striated muscle of Vertcbrata. It has been generally con
firmed, and seems to hold good for all kinds of muscles.
    Neither the chemical nor the electrical hypothesis of the origin of

1895.]           On the Nature     of Muscular  Contraction.          423
muscular force can give a sufficient explanation of this fact. On the
basis of our theory, on the contrary, it can be predicted, because
every influence v.lweii augments- ibe doubly-refractive      power must
 raise the powei fc'f contraction.
   Now, von Ebner has proved experimentally that the doubly refrac
tive power of tendons and also, between certain limits, of muscles,
increases with the load.      The same is the case with fibres of elastic
tissue and with caoutchouc, and here also the contractile power
increases with the load.
   The differences of force which depend on the load are by no means
insignificant.   According to Fick the lifting heights for 5, 8, and
10 gr. were, with a muscle of Anodonta, related to each other as
8.3 : 10 : 16"3.  With E strings, swollen in hot water,       I obtained,
when heating them from 20° to 80° C, at an initial load of 5 gr., a
contractile power of but 55 gr. ; at a load of 50 gr. one of 80 gr. ;
and at a load of 90 gr. one of about 120 gr.
   For E strings swollen in lactic acid of 0"25 per cent. the rates of
power, corresponding with the initial tensions of 5, 90, and 125 gr.,
amounted to about 100, 125, and 154 gr.         A strip of elastic tissue,
2 mm. thick, heated at 80° C, gave for an initial tension of 10 gr., at
which the double refraction of fibres is just beginning to be per
ceptible, a power of but 61 gr., for 100 gr. one of 162 gr., for
185 gr. of initial tension, at which double refraction is very strong,
one of 238 gr.      A strip of vulcanised caoutchouc, 2 mm. thick,
which, unloaded and hence singly refractive, did not, even when
heated to 100° C, tend at all to become shorter, developed with an
initial load of 90 gr., put on at 20° C, a contractile power of 110 gr.
at a temperature of 80° C, while at the same time a strong power of
double refraction had been acquired by it.
   Now, it is true, that Heidenhain has found that — at least in the
stimulated striated muscles — not only mechanical energy but also
the development of heat and the formation of lactic acid increase
together with initial tension.        But, according to his experiments,
mechanical energy increases much more rapidly than does the pro
duction of heat. This difference at least might be explained by the
influence of extension on the doubly-refractive power. An influence
of extension on chemical action may very well be associated with the
influence on double refraction, as a consequence of the changes in the
local arrangement of the thermogenic particles which are produced
by the extension. Such changes must be effected to a considerable
degree, even when the shortening of the muscle is prevented by
resistance (isometric contraction of Fick), and especially in the case
of striated muscles, to which Heidenhain's statements refer. For
not only fibrils, interfibrillar substance, and sarcolemma, but also the
singly and the doubly -refractive portions of the fibrils differ much

                  would be yery strange if these shiftings did not
manifest themselves also in \changes of the chemical processes, and
if these changes were not conformajfl*1 to. the nnr^ose.
   Connected with the point we have jnst discusst*"^ another fact,
                                                          --:
viz., that the amount of shortening produced in our model- by means
of a given rise of temperature,    isthe smaller the more th¦ string
has already contracted.     The maximum of force is, at all events,
displayed when the extension of the string       brought about by the
                                                is
whole load being applied at once at the very beginning of the heating,
not after the string has already contracted with a smaller load.
   The very same thing, as Schwann's experiments showed many
years ago, holds good of muscle. On the hypothesis of chemical
attraction we should decidedly expect the reverse     viz., increase of
                                                      :
force with an increasing mutual approach of the combining molecules     ;
so also in the same way on every hypothesis which pronounces
contraction to be caused by attractive powers increasing in inverse
ratio to the square of the distance.
   In the fact discovered by Schwann, Johannes Miiller thought he
had found a refutation of the old electro-dynamic hypothesis of
Prevost and Dumas, as well as a valid reason for assuming               a
fundamental relation between the vital power of contraction and
physical elasticity.
   However, as Hermann has observed, we might in this case get
over the difficulty by supposing that between or in the length of the
parts attracting each other, there are elastic layers opposing that
attraction with increasing force. It    is evident that our view of the
matter does not require such an auxiliary hypothesis, because,
following Eduardj Weber, we regard muscular contraction as only.
a special case of elastic shortening.
   A closer experimental comparison of the changes undergone, on the
one hand, by the elasticity of our string during thermal shortening,
and, on the other, by muscular          elasticity during physiological
conduction, will teach us that, in each case, those changes are         of
exactly the same kind.
   As regards striated muscles,   it  was Eduard Weber who, by his
classic researches, established that their extensibility increases during
contraction.    The same is now proved to hold good of strings and
other organic doubly-refractive substances during thermal shortening.
   The curve of lengthening of all these objects inclines more sharply
towards the abscissa of the loads the higher the temperature.         Both
curves converge and may finally even cross, i.e.,    a  certain load being
exceeded we do not get contraction of our string, but lengthening
as the effect of heating.
   This circumstance explains the fact, sometimes observed              by
E. Weber, that living, tired, heavily-loaded frogs' muscles, lengthen

 1895.]          On the Nature   of Muscular Contraction.             425
 instead  of shorten as a result of electric stimulation.      Considered
 from other theoretical points of view, this observation seems so
 paradoxical that its very validity has been questioned by some
physiologists ; but in the face of the direct and exact measurements
of so scrupulous an observer and inquirer as Eduard Weber,             we
hare no right to do this. Moreover, Charles Richet and de Varighy
have confirmed the observation with different kinds of muscles of
Invertebrata. According to our view of the origin of muscular force
the fact is not paradoxical at all, but might be foreseen.
    The decrease of the shortening power and the increase of extensi
bility with increasing thermal contraction is, in the case of our life
less  doubly-refractive objects, accompanied by a decrease in the power
of double refraction. According to von Ebner's careful measurements,
confirmed by Alex. Rollett, the same thing is the case with muscles
daring vital contraction.      We may consider this fact, too, as an
important proof of the fundamental resemblance between the process
of contraction in our model and in the muscle, and at the same time
as a further evidence of the existence of a causal relation between
double refraction and contractility in general.       But it is the physi
cist's task, and not the physiologist's, to penetrate further into the
relations between optic and elastic properties.     The physiologist may
deem his purpose attained when he succeeds in tracing a certain vital
phenomenon back to processes which may also be observed in lifeless
bodies.
    However, though we should, perhaps, be inclined to infer from the-
foregoing that we have successfully acquitted ourselves of this task
with regard to muscular contraction, we will be careful not to over
look the numerous important respects in which a muscle as a living
body, that is, one subjected to constant chemical transformation,
differs from our lifeless strings.      The study of these differences is
most instructive, since it throws a new light on a series of processes
nearly allied to contraction, especially on the phenomena of rigor
mortis and tonus of muscle.
    But before entering into this we shall first have to meet another
important objection to our views. It is based upon the absolute
amount of muscular force.       This amount may, as you know, be very
high. Human muscles at the strongest tetanic contraction can
shorten with a force of about 10 kilogrammes to 1 sq. cm. of trans
verse section.     Now such a force must, according to our view, be
produced by a very small part only of the transverse section of the
muscle.
    With a maximal tetanus, it is true, the temperature of the whole
 muscle does rise 1° C. or more. Hence there are, perhaps, 1,000 times
 more particles chemically active than with a moderate simple con
 traction, where the temperature     rises 0"001° C. only.  Consequently,.

426                     Prof. Th. W. Engelmann.                  [Mar. 14,
during such a tetanus, a much greater part of the muscular substance
— perhaps     1,000 times as much — will be heated to such a degree
.as is required for an obvious contraction of the inotagmata.          But
even in this case the greater part of the whole substance will be only
moved passively.
    This holds good also, though in a less degree, of the single fibrils or
of the single sarcous elements, which, on account of their containing
doubly refractive inotagmata, we believe to be the sole producers of
shortening power. For it is beyond question that the sarcous element*
in toto are not subjected, even during the strongest tetanus, to a tem
perature so high as is required by our hypothesis. Hence the specific
force of contraction of the individual doubly-refractive          elements
must be comparatively much greater. We cannot properly calculate
how much greater the absolute force of a muscle would be if the
transverse section consisted of nothing bnt contractile inotagmata,
 we can only assume that it would, in general, be many times as great.
     Can such very important mechanical powers as we are obliged to
assume in the inotagmata be developed through the thermal contraction
.of doubly-refractive    bodies ? Do we not, as Fick says, go beyond
 the bounds of legitimate analogy in making such a supposition P
     Of course nothing but the measurement of the forces developed by
 lifeless doubly-refractive     bodies under thermal contraction will
decide this question.      I have made many of these measurements on
 various objects, and  I  think the results furnish us with a refutation of
 the objection. Strings, moist but not yet contracted through lying in
 water, with a diameter of 0-7 mm., and loaded with 1 kilogramme,
lifted up the weight in a perceptible degree when rapidly heated up
 to 130° C. ; that is to say, they exerted a force about twenty times at
 least as great as the maximum force of a human muscle of the same
 thickness. This is all the more striking, since in Rtrings also it is not
 the whole transverse section, but the sum of the sections of the
 fibrillae, and even a part of every section only, which is the seat of
 the power of shortening.
     Still greater forces may be exerted by strips of caontchoue
 rendered in a high degree doubly refractive by strong extension.
  Even merely heating from 20° to 40° C. produced results sixty times
 as great as the maximum afforded by human muscles of the same
  transverse section.
     Hence we may sufficiently account for the greatest display of
  force of which muscle is capable, without having to attribute to the
  inotagmata higher elastic forces than we observe in highly extended
  threads of caoutchouc of the same thickness, nay, without even
  having to assume temperatures reaching the degree necessary for
  the coagulation of albumin.
     Influence of Heat on the Dead Muscle Fibres. — It is a pity that we

   1895.]          On the Nature    of Mtiscular Contraction.            427
  are   not able to subject the isolated doubly-refractive      parts of the
   muscle in an unimpaired          condition to the influence of heat.
  Together with the elevation of temperature there occur changes in the
  chemical processes, and therewith in the material composition and
  mechanical properties of the whole muscle substance, which compli
 cate the changes dependent only on the heating of the doubly-
  refractive particles, or even prevent our clearly recognising them.
     We may, it is true, exclude these chemical influences by previously
  killing the muscles by means of alcohol or some other medium, the
  action of which preserves the finer structure of the non-contracted
  muscle, and above all the double refraction.     But in this case, too, the
  mechanical properties of the fibrils,      as well as of the sarcoplasm,
 change so considerably that the explanation of the phenomena
  becomes very difficult.      A great part of the soft muscular substance
  becomes solid by coagulation or precipitation, and these solid parts
  will act in opposition to a thermal shortening, nay, perhaps com
  pensate it, in consequence of their own expansion through heat.
  Moreover, the phenomena are rendered complicated by the thermal
 changes of other elements of the muscular tissue, such as connective
  fibrils, blood-vessels and nerves.
     The results, however, agree very well with the hypothesis that
 even in a dead muscle the doubly-refractive particles tend to contract
 when heated to a certain degree, and to lengthen again when cooled.
The degree of heat at which quite dead, lightly loaded frogs' muscles
 begin to shorten, does not lie much higher than those sufficient to
 produce rigor, mostly below or near to 60° C. Contraction increases
 with the temperature, occasionally amounting to 20 per cent, of the
 initial length.
     Very important contractions of the sarcous elements — to the half
of the length and more— are shown by the microscope in the striated
 muscles of insects, when these are very rapidly heated to 55°, or
 higher.      The singly-refractive layers do not contract, or at least to a
much less degree. However, we will not attach too much importance
to these facts, because the conditions are very complicated.
     Tetanus and Rigor by Heat. — Living muscles, when being gradually
 heated, are, as you know, thrown into tetanus so soon as the tempera
 ture has attained the height of a little below 50° C.        This so-called
 tetanus    of heat passes by prolonged heating into the lasting contrac
 tion   of rigor, accompanied by definitive loss of irritability.
     This contraction through heat agrees in so many points with physio
 logical contraction, especially with physiological tetanus, that it was
long held to be the last manifestation of muscular life. Such points
of    resemblance    are, e.g., the amount and the force of shortening,
•which in both cases are at least of the same order, and the increased
production of heat, of carbonic acid, and of a fixed acid.

428                     Prof. Th. W. Engelmaun.                  [Mar. 14-
   No doubt in this case a very important and general rise of       tempe
rature of the contractile particles will take place so soon as rigidity
begins to announce itself. Consequently, according to our hypothesis,
we must expect a strong and general contraction of the inotagmata.
    That the force, with which the muscle as a whole will shorten, is
not quite so great as with physiological tetanus, is sufficiently
explained by the fact that the inotagmata do not contract simul
taneously, and by the increase of internal resistance which occurs, due
to coagulation and precipitation in the muscle plasma during the
development of rigidity by heat.       The latter circumstance seems to
explain, too, why the rigid muscle does not perceptibly, or only very
little, lengthen upon cooling.
    Turgescence by Imbibition as a General Cause of Contraction of
Doubly-refractive Organised Elements. — On a closer examination, how
ever, we find that matters are still more complicated, and likewise
that there is still an important circumstance which, besides the rise of
temperature of inotagmata, may act as a cause of contraction, even
of permanent contraction.         This circumstance, the fundamental
importance of which to muscular contraction was disclosed a score of
years ago by a rigorous microscopical examination of the processes
taking place in the muscle fibres during contraction, is the turgescence
of the doubly-refractive elements by the imbibition of watery liquids.
    All histological elements possessing doubly-refractive power tend,
even at an ordinary low temperature, to contract in the direction of
the optical axis when their volume is enlarged by the imbibition of a
watery fluid, and to lengthen when their volume diminishes by loss
of liquid. The extent, power, and rapidity of the changes of form
depend on the nature and on the dimensions of the turgescent object,
and on the nature and quantity of the imbibed liquid.
    For the examination of these relations our violin strings again
yield fit material.     A long series of measurements has now shown
that there is a very close resemblance between contraction by im
bibition and thermal and physiological contraction.        I may mention
the marked extent of the shortening, the high value of the force of
contraction, its increase with the initial tension and its decrease with
increasing shortening, the increase of extensibility, the decline of
 refractive power and of doubly-refractive property. The resemblance
is by no means exclusively of a qualitative, but also of a quantitative
 kind.
    A  change of form generally takes place when the composition of
the imbibed liquid changes, and it is of great importance to our
question that even the slightest changes of composition can cause
marked contractions and great mechanical effects.
    Unloaded E strings, e.g., contract in pure water to nine-tenths, and

fifths of the initial length.    At 15° C. they exert, in the first case,
forces of ahont 80 gr., in the second of about 110 gr.       With initial
tensions of 105, 335, and 450 gr., forces of 226, 365, and 496 gr. respec
tively were produced by swelling in distilled water at 15° C. ; and by
imbibing a 0-25 per cent. solution of lactic acid at initial tensions
of 5, 215, and 425 gr. forces were exerted of 115, 350, and 490 gr.
respectively, i.e., forces very much higher than a muscle of the same
thickness can produce during tetanus.       Even in a watery solution of
only 0.1 per cent. of lactic acid, the strings contract to about 70 per
cent., as also in highly-diluted acetic and hydrochloric acid or in
potash.
  Upon neutralisation or dilution the old length and volume return.
The doubly-refractive fibrils, or the sarcous elements of muscles,
contract considerably, also under the same conditions, swelling at the
same time ; this is the case even with muscles which have been killed
in alcohol.    In such instances  I  measured in the striated fibres of
insects, distinguished by especially long sarcous elements, shortenings
to 50 per cent, and more.
   Since, according to many inquirers, lactic acid is formed during
the rigor of striated muscles, and at all events the reaction of the
muscular plasma grows acid, the doubly- refractive elements must
necessarily swell more and tend to shorten, and this contraction will
remain until the acid has been neutralised or removed by diffusion.
   Similar results will be obtained in other cases of rigor characterised
by shortening and by the production of much acid, such as the ordinary
rigor mortis, the rigor produced by distilled water, the rigor which is
caused by excessive stimulation,      &c.   Nay, in a bloodless muscle
even a physiological stimulation, when sufficiently strong and long,
may be expected to produce a lasting shortening, on account of the
gradually increasing acidity.     Indeed, the well-known incomplete
relaxation of such muscles seems to me to be a symptom of this
chemical contraction, as it may be called, in contrast with the thermal.
   In a muscle in which the blood stream is maintained this will not
so easily take place, not even under a strong and prolonged stimula
tion, because the acid is immediately neutralised or removed through
diffusion.   Even in the isolated, bloodless muscle the acid, which is
 produced by stimulation, may, in the beginning at least, be rendered
 harmless through the very large quantity of non-acid fluid imbibed
by the muscle.      Consequently we must expect in these cases an
 immediate and complete relaxation after contraction. The facts agree
absolutely with these suppositions.
   It is,perhaps, not unnecessary to remark that all these observa
tions would also hold good   if  the material affecting the turgescence
were not lactic acid, but another substance arising during the chemical
action in the muscle, e.g., water.

      The different parts played by "Thermal" and by "Chemical'' Con.
   traction in the different kinds of muscular contraction. — Bat now the
  question may be raised : Is not physiological contraction dne to tur-
  gescence    by imbibition solely ? Do not we find a sufficient explana
  tion of all kinds of contraction in the change of the conditions of
  imbibition, a change which must necessarily result from the chemical
  action caused by the stimulus ?
     We have all the more reason to put this question, since we can
  prove, that in the physiological contraction of striated muscle-fibres
  the doubly-refractive layers swell at the cost of the watery isotropic
  layers. The microscopical examination of active living muscles and
  of fixed waves of contraction has proved this fact beyond all question-
  however much the opinions of different observers may diverge
  on other points.       The swelling would, moreover, account for the
 slight decrease of musoular volume observed in strong tetanic con-
  traction.    For, according to the experiments of Quincke, the imbi
 bition of water by organised bodies generally leads to a slight
  condensation.*     By this condensation further heat is developed, and
 this heat might, by raising the temperature of the doubly-refractive
 elements, be partially transformed into mechanical energy, and in
 this way contribute to the production of muscular force.
          I
     Yet cannot consider this explanation as sufficient for all the facts.
 The same argument which in our eyes seems to dispose of the hypo
 thesis of the identity of chemical attraction and muscular force,
 viz., the infinitesimally small quantity of substance which is chemically
 active during a simple contraction, seems to me to present a funda
 mental difficulty here also.       It is hard to understand how through a
 change in the material composition, effected at one infinitesimal point
 within a soft watery substance, the whole mass should shorten and
 thicken, unless there proceeds from the centre of chemical activity a con
siderable amount of kinetic energy throughout the substance.
     The microscopic appearances which prove the turgescence of the
doubly-refractive refringent elements during a contraction, do not
exclude a direct thermo-dynamical effect.            For the almost complete
identity in the changes of form, and of optical and mechanical
properties, which the doubly refractive constituents of all histological
elements undergo during chemical and thermal contraction, seems
to bear out the hypothesis, that in the thermal shortening of doubly-
refractive elements, through the imbibition of watery fluiil, we
get a shifting of solid and liquid substances analogous to that of
turgescence.       In most of the microscopical phenomena, especially
the so-called fixed contraction waves, we have, moreover, to do
with a high degree of tetanic contraction, or even with rigor, in
    * In the thermal contraction of tendons and strings I have not yet been able to
convince myself of a decrease in volume.

which,   on   account   of   the  greatly-increased   chemical action, a
  chemically-caused turgescence may be accompanied to a considerable
 extent by thermal contraction.
    Moreover, it is doubtful if we have in this case to deal with a
 phenomenon common to all kinds of muscular fibres.         Most probably
 the mutual relations of the two processes differ with different kinds
  of muscle.
    Hence, we may conclude that chemical contraction by turgescence
 of the inotagmata is most likely a constant concomitant of the thermal
 contraction of living muscle, but that compared with the latter, in a
 single contraction, at least of striated fibres, the former is of little
 or no consequence as regards the shortening effect.
    Chemiotonus and Thermotonus. — Both processes will probably also
 take part in varying proportion in the tonus of mnscle, which in some
 cases will approach more to pure chemiotonus, in others more to pure
 thermotonus.    Experimental researches in this direction are wanted.
    Causes of the Relaxation of Muscle. Theoretical Considerations. Con
 clusion. — With regard to the relaxation of muscle, according to our
 theory this must be caused either by cooling, or by the withdrawal
 of water from the doubly-refractive particles.         Indeed, we have
 found that doubly-refractive histological elements in general, even if
 they be lifeless, like our violin strings, lengthen again upon cooling
after they have been contracted by heat, and that they lengthen
 npon neutralisation or diffusion, after they have been contracted by
 imbibition at an ordinary temperature.
    In a normal relaxation the muscle seems to return completely to
 its initial state. Of course its store of energy has diminished in
 proportion to the quantity of mechanical work and heat which has
proceeded from    it,    but, on account of the relatively infinitesimal
quantity of substance which        is thereby consumed, this return will
necessarily seem     to be complete even in the case of an isolated muscle.
    If we analyse the phenomena of relaxation more exactly, we
shall light on several possibilities, the discussion of which would
be very interesting with regard to the theory of muscle-life.     I   shall
restrict myself to the phenomena of the relaxation following on
thermal contraction.
     Here, in the first place, we might conceive that the doubly-
refractive inotagmata are destroyed in the thermal shortening, so
that each of them performs its function once only. The lengthening
of the muscular fibrils would then probably be caused solely by the
elastic powers of the parts passively extended or compressed by the
shortening of the inotagmata.          Upon a fresh stimulation, other
inotagmata would, in consequence of the combustion of other ther
mogenic molecules, become active, perish, &c. Through the activity of
 the formative matter of the living muscle-fibre, the place of the lost

432             On the Nature   of Muscular     Contraction.      [Mar. 14,
inotagmata would be continually or periodically filled by others,
probably through the same process of organic crystallisation by which
during ontogenesis the doubly-refracting particles in the muscle are
produced and arranged.
    Against this hypothesis, however, or at least against its general
validity, various objections may be put forward.         I will mention but
two of the most important of them.
    There seems to be no doubt but that the doubly-refractive
particles of the muscle consist of an albuminous substance, and that
they together make up a sensible part of the whole albumin of the
muscle-fibrils.   In that case it would be most improbable that a
great increase of muscular work should not at all, or only very
slightly, increase the elimination of nitrogen. To account for this, we
should have to recur to an auxiliary hypothesis, and assume either
that the nitrogenous remainder of the destroyed inotagma is retained
within the body — perhaps in the muscle — for purposes of anabolism,
or, which is indeed most improbable, that other organs saved just as
much albumin as was decomposed above the normal quantity daring
the contraction of the muscles.
    A second objection consists in the fact that after heating or tetanis-
ing muscles until they are rigid, the doubly-refractive power of the
sarcous elements will be found still very great.
    The other possibility is that the inotagmata may be preserved, and
consequently on cooling may return to their former state, and
therefore will do work by shortening as often as we choose. In thin
case muscle would not only seem to offer, but would in fact offer a
most striking resemblance to a thermodynamic machine, the solid
particles of the framework of which are not destroyed through the
chemical process producing the actual energy. No more than such a
machine would the muscle require a perpetual renewal of its
framework for the continuation of its activity ; it would only want a
periodic supply of fresh combustible material.
    This representation, as you see, will sufficiently account for the fact,
which would otherwise remain surprising, that muscular work has
such a small influence on the elimination of nitrogen.         The facts of
microscopic observation also agree with it.
    But a further discussion of the two possibilities would lead us too
 far. The purpose of this lecture was not to give a complete account
of all the phenomena of muscular activity.           I  have wished chiefly
to draw your attention tb a series of facts which      I hold to be of great
importance for a deeper insight into the essence of muscular con
tractility, in so far as they prove the existence of certain material
dispositions and processes (admitting of closer experimental examina
 tion), by means of which mechanical work may be generated in the
 muscle by chemical energy.

I. " On the Diselectrification of Air." By Lord Kelvin,          P.R.S.,
       Magnus Macl¦an, M.A., F.R.S.E., and Alexand¦r Galt,
       B.Sc, F.R.S.E. Received March 14, 1895.
    § 1. The experiment described in § 14 of our paper on the " Elec
trification of Air and other Gases by bubbling through Water and
other Liquids" (' Roy. Soc. Proc.,' February 21, 1895), proves that
air, electrified negatively by bubbling throngh water and caused to
pass through a metallic wire gauze strainer, gives up some, but not a
large proportion, of its electricity to the .metal.  We have now made
a fresh experimental arrangement for the purpose of investigating
 diselectrification of air which has been electrified, whether positively
 or negatively, by other means than bubbling through water : witb
 apparatus represented in figs. 1 and 2, which is simplified from that
 of our former paper by the omission of the apparatus for electritiea-
                                   Fio.  1.

tion   by bubbling,      and for collecting     large quantities of electrified
air.
    § 2.  In  fig. 1 , A B represent the two terminals of a Voss electric
machine connected, one of them to a metal can, CC (a small biscuit
canister of tinned iron), and the other to a fine needle, of which the
point n is in the centre of the can. The wire making the connection
to the needle passes through the centre of a hole in the side of the
can, stopped by a paraffin plug.        Air is blown from bellows through
a pipe, E, near the bottom of the can, and allowed to escape from
near the top through an electric filter, F, called the tested filter,
from which it passes through a long block-tin pipe, GGr, about
3f metres long and 1 cm. internal diameter, and thence through a
short tunnel in a block of paraffin, K. From this, lastly, it passes
through a second electric filter, R, into the open air. This second
filter, which we sometimes call the testing filter, sometimes the electric
receiver, is kept in metallic connection with the insulated terminal, I,
of a quadrant electrometer, Q. The metal can and the block-tin
 pipe are metallically connected to the outer case and uninsulated
 terminal, T, of the quadrant electrometer.
     § 3. The testing filter or electric receiver consists of twelve discs
 of brass-wire cloth fixed across the mouth of a short metal pipe
 supported on the end of the paraffin tunnel in the manner represented
 in fig. 2, on a scale of twice the size of the filter which we have
 actually used, or of true size for a filter on a tube of 2 cm. diameter,
  which for some purposes may be better. One of eleven similar discs,
 of size adapted to a tube of 2 cm. diameter, and an outermost disc
 with projecting lugs, are shown, true size, and with the gauge of the
  wire-cloth which we have actually used, shown true size, in fig. 3.
  The eleven little circular discs of wire cloth are held in position by
  bending over them the four lugs belonging to the outermost disc, and
  all are kept compactly together by a short piece of india-rubber tube
  stretched over them outside as shown         in fig. 2.
     § 4.  We commenced with a few experiments to test the efficiency of
  the testing filter, R, with no tested filter at F, and merely continuous
  block-tin pipe, FGG, from the can to the paraffin tunnel. First,
  working the bellows with no electrification of the needle point, we
  found no sensible electric effect on the electrometer, which proved
  that, whether from natural electrification of the air of the laboratory,
  or by the action of the bellows, or by the passage of the air through
  the long metal pipe, no electrification sensible to our test was pro
  duced.     After that we kept the needle point, », electrified, either
  positively or negatively, for five or six minutes at a time by turning
   the little Voss machine, and we found large effects rising to about
   3£ volts in five minutes, positive or negative, according as n was
   positive or negative.

   § 5. The apparatus is now ready to test the efficacy of 61ters
                                                                   or
other appliances of different kinds placed at F for the purpose of
diselectrifying air which has been electrified, whether positively or
negatively, by the electrified needle point n. We began with a filter
of 12 wire-gauze discs, placed at F and kept in metallic connection
with the tin pipe outside. This nearly halved the electricity shown

]
  895.]    Conditions affecting Bacterial   Life  in Thames Water.     439
by the electrometer. We then tried 24, 48, 72, 96, 120 wire-gauze
discs, successively, placed in groups of 24, and separated from one
another by short lengths of 2 cm. of lead tube, in the line of the flow of
the air between F and G (fig. 1), all kept in metallic connection with
the block-tin pipe and the outer case of the electrometer. We were
surprised with the smalluess of the additions to the diselectrifying
efficiency of the 12 strainers first tried ; for example, the filter of 120
wire gauzes only reduced the electrical indication to a little less than
one-half of what it was with the 12 which we first tried.
    We found that cotton-wool between the spaces in the groups of
24 wire gauzes largely increased the diselectrifying effect.          Thus,
with 72 wire gauzes and cotton-wool we succeeded in reducing the
electrical effect to about one-twelfth of what it was with only a filter
of 12 wire gauzes ; but hitherto we have not succeeded in rendering
imperceptibly small the electricity yielded by the outflowing air to
the testing filter R in our method of observation.
    § 6. We intend trying various methods of obtaining more and more
nearly complete diselectrification of the electrified air flowing out of
the can at F ; and this for air electrified otherwise than by the needle
point, as shown in the diagram : for instance, by an electrified flame
in place of the needle point ; or again by bubbling through water or
other liquids. Meantime, the mere fact that the electricity, whether
 positive or negative, given to air by an electrified needle point, can be
 conveyed through 3 or 4 metres of small metal tube (1 cm. diameter),
 and shown on a quadrant electrometer by a receiving filter, is not with
 out interest.   We may add now that, with the receiving filter removed
 and merely a fine platinum wire put in the mouth of the paraffin
 tunnel, we have found that enough of electricity is taken from the
 outflowing air to be amply shown by the quadrant electrometer ;
  which renders even more surprising the fact that the diselectrifying
 power of 120 strainers of fine wire-gauze should be so small as we
 have found it.
  II. "On the Conditions affecting Bacterial Life in Thames
        Water."     By E. Frankland, D.C.L., F.R.S. Received
        January 31, 1895.
     Since May, 1892,  I have been making monthly determinations of
  the number of bacteria capable of development on a peptone-gelatine
  plate in a given volume of Thames water collected at the intakes of
  the Metropolitan water companies at Hampton.            The number of
  microbes per cubic centimetre of water varied during this time
  between 631 and 56,630, the highest numbers having, as a rule, been

440                Dr. E. Frankland.    On the Conditions       [Mar. 21,
 found in winter or when the temperature of the water was low, and
 the lowest in summer or when the temperature was high.
    Amongst the conditions which favour or retard the development
 of microbial life in river water, temperature, rainfall, and sunshine or
 gloom are probably the most important, sunshine having been
 recently shown by Dr. Marshall Ward to be, under certain circum
 stances,    extremely potent in the destruction of bacteria. The
 following tables contain the Tesults of these microbe determinations
 placed in juxtaposition with (A) the temperature of the water
 at the time the sample was taken, (B) the number of hours of sun
 shine on the day and up to the hour when the sample was drawn
 and on the two preceding days, and (C) the flow of the Thames over
 Teddington Weir on the same day expressed in millions of gallons
 per 24 hours.
    The samples for microbe cultivation were collected at about 9 in.
below the surface of the water in partially exhausted and sealed
tubes, the ends of which, when the tubes were lowered to the desired
depth, were broken off by an ingenious contrivance devised by my
assistant, Mr. W. T. Burgess.       On being withdrawn from the river,
the tubes were immediately hermetically sealed and packed in ice
for conveyance to my laboratory, where the cultivation was always
commenced within four hours of the time of collection.
                                  I
   For the records of sunshine am indebted to the kindness of Pro
fessor E. J. Stone, M.A., F.R.S., the Badcliffe Observer at Oxford,
and to Mr. James B. Jordan, of Staines.        Finding that the Oxford
observations differed but little from those at Staines, and as Staines
is nearer to, although higher up, the river than the place where my
samples were collected,     I have used the Staines records in the table,
except on a few dates when Mr. Jordan's observations had been
intermitted.
    The gaugings of the Thames at Teddington Weir were kindly
furnished by Mr. C.J. More, the engineer to the Thames Conservancy
Board.
   Without the data giving the conditions of sunshine and flow of the
river, it was impossible to draw any trustworthy conclusion as to the
cause of the increase and diminution of the number of microbes per
cubic centimetre of Thames water at Hampton, because the condi
tions supposed to be favourable for microbial life all, approximately,
attain the greatest intensity at the same season of the year ; thus,
whilst the temperature is lowest in winter, so also, as a rule, are the
minimum amount of sunshine and the maximum amount of flood
water. The following collateral observations, however, afford definite
evidence as to which of the three conditions — temperature, sun
shine, and flow of the river — has the predominant influence upon
       : -1

the water at the time the samples were taken.   In this diagram the
ordinates express the numbers of microbes and the temperatures,
whilst the abscissae denote the months when the samples were taken.
For obvious reasons the ordinates expressing numbers of microbes
and temperature are numbered in opposite directions.
   From this table and diagram, high temperature would appear                             to
have been unfavourable to microbes in May, June, July, August, and
September, 1892, when the number per cubic centimetre was small; but
in October and November the number still remained small, although
the temperature in these months was much lower.    In December,
however, of the same year the temperature remained much the same
as in November, but the microbes underwent an enormons increase.
Again, in the following year (1893), the temperature in January on
the day when the sample was collected was still lower, being at the
freezing point, but the microbes were considerably less numerous.
On the other hand, in February, when the temperature was higher.

the microbes were much more numerous than even in the previous
 December.    In March, whilst the temperature remained practically
the same as in February, the number of microbes per cubic centi
metre fell from about 14,000 to about    700.
                                           3-, Again, in April, whilst
the temperature was still moderate (11"6° C), the number of
microbes fell still further to less than 2,000 per cubic centimetre.
In May, June, July, and August, the temperature was high and the
number of microbes uniformly small, but in September there was a
great reduction of temperature, but accompanied also by a consider
able diminution in the number of microbes. In October there was
again, as in February, an enormous development of bacteria whilst
the temperature was only slightly lower than in the previous month,
when the number was remarkably small.       In November again, with
a much lower temperature, there was a reduction in the number of
microbes from about 14,000 in the previous month to about 1,750 per
cubic centimetre. During the following months of November and
December, 1893, and January, February, and March, 1894, whilst
the temperature remained low and nearly constant, the microbes
were sometimes as low as 1,789, and sometimes as high as 56,630     ;
but, during the following months — April, May, June, July, August,
September, and October — the increase of temperature and diminution
of microbes, and vice versa, marched very much pari passu.        In
Nov¦mber, however, with no alteration of temperature as compared
with the previous month, the nnmber of microbes increased from
3,800 to 20,080 per cubic centimetre, whilst in December there was a
diminution alike in temperature and microbes.
  Thus it  is evident that, although coincidences between a high
number of microbes and      low temperature are not wanting, some
                            a
other condition entirely masks the effect of temperature.

                                                 a
number of microbes and the hours of sunshine to which the water
has been exposed.    The diagram    constructed on the same lines as
                                      is

   Reference to the table and diagram shows that, whilst during the
months May to November, 1892, there was an enormous variation in
the amount of sunshine, namely, from 23£ hours in June to none in
November, there was practically no corresponding variation in the
number of microbes. In December of that year, there was much
more sunshine than in the previous month, but the microbes, instead
of being diminished thereby, increased from less than 2,000 to over
11,000 per cubic centimetre and, although there was no sunshine on
                              ;
the three days previous to the taking of the sample in January,
1893, the number of microbes actually decreased about 3,000 per
cubic centimetre.   In the following month of February, however,
about 14,000 microbes per cubic centimetre coincided with but little

more    than an hour of sunshine. In the following month of March
again, an enormous increase of sunshine was followed by a corre
sponding decrease of microbes, and this relation was continued in the
following month ; but in May, with a great diminution of sunlight,
there was practically no increase of microbes, and in June, with an
enormous increase of sunlight, there was the anomaly of an increase,
though slight, of bacteria. .
   In the following July and August, there were enormous alternations
of sunshine and gloom with no corresponding difference in the
number of microbes      ;  whilst in September, with a great diminution
in  sunshine, there was observed one of the smallest numbers of
microbes recorded.        In the following month of October, however, a
small diminution of sunshine was accompanied by a very large in
crease of microbes.        On the other hand, in the month of November,
with a still smaller amount of sunshine there was an enormous
reduction in the number of microbes.
   In January, 1894, a small amount of sunshine was followed by an

446             Dr. E. Frankland.      On the Conditions       [Mar.  21,
 enormous number (56,630) of microbes. In the following month of
 February, however, this number was reduced to about 7,000, although
the amount of sunshine was not very much greater. In the following
month of March, there was a great increase both of sunshine and
bacteria, whilst in April, there was an increase of sunshine and a
great diminution in the number of microbes. In May, however,
there was a great decrease of sunshine, but a very slight increase of
microbes.     In June there was rather less sunshine than in the
previous  month,  but also fewer microbes ; whilst in July, an increase
of sunlight was accompaned by an increase of microbes. In August,
September, and October, with each diminution of sunshine there was
a corresponding increase of microbes ; but in November, with a very
moderate amount of sunlight, there was an enormous increase of
microbes from 3,800 to 20,080 per cubic centimetre, whilst in the
following month of December a considerable diminution of sunlight
was found to be compatible with a marked decrease of microbes.
   Thus it is evident that, as in the case of temperature, there is some
other condition which entirely overbears the influence of sunlight in
the destruction of microbes in the river water.     This condition is the
amount of rainfall higher up the river, or, in other words, the volume
of water flowing along the river bed, as is seen from the companion
presented in the following table and diagram (pp. 447, 448).
   This table and diagram show very conclusively that the volume of
water flowing in the Thames is the paramount influence determining
the number of microbes in the water.       They compare the volume of
water in the river, as gauged at Teddington Weir, with the number
of microbes found in the raw Thames water at Hampton on the same
day. In the diagram, the numbers representing the flow of the river
in millions of gallons and the number of microbes per cubic centi
metre of water both run from the bottom of the diagram upwards.
   Comparing the numbers in the table and the curves on the diagram,
it is seen that, with a few exceptions, a remarkably close relation is
maintained between these numbers and curves respectively ; thus
during the months of May, June, July, August, September, and
October, 1892, the river was low and the number of microbes small.
In December of the same year, the daily flow of the river had risen to
2,105 millons of gallons, and the microbes to 11,158 per cubic centi
metre ; whilst in January 1893, the flow had decreased to 915 millions
of gallons, and the microbes to 8,210 per cubic centimetre. In February
of the same year, the flow of water over Teddington Weir had risen to
3,255 millions of gallons, and the number of microbes simul
taneously to 13,947 per cubic centimetre ; whilst in March, with a
reduced flow of 1,175 millions of gallons, the number of microbes
came down to 3,737 per cubic centimetre, and this was followed in
April by a further diminution to 1,763 per cubic centimetre, whilst

the flow of the river was simultaneously reduced to 985 millions of
gallons daily.
   In the following months, May, June, July, August, and September,
the river remained low, and so did the number of microbes ; but in
October, with an increase of flow from 159 to 543 millions of gallons,
the number of microbes increased from 1,158 to 13,790 per cabic
centimetre ; whilst, in the following month of November, the flow
of the river was reduced to 249 millions of gallons and the microbes
to 1,789 per cubic centimetre.                       Again, in the following month of
December, the flow of the river increased to 375 millions of gallons,
and the microbes to 6,316 per cubic centimetre.
   In January, 1894, the flow of the river was augmented to 1,510
millions of gallons, and the microbes to the enormous nnmber of
56,630 per cubic centimetre.                  In the following months of February,

Then came the tremendous flood of November, the highest on record,
the flow of the river over Teddington Weir, on the 18th, having
reached nearly 20,136 millions of gallons. The sample for microbe
cultivation was, however, taken on the 5th, when the flow only
amounted to 4,462 millions of gallons per day, but this increase from
396 millions of gallons in October to 4,462 millions on the 5th of
November was accompanied by an increase in the number of microbes
from 3,800 on the 10th of October to       20,080 per cubic centimetre on
the 5th of November ; whilst, in      December, the flow of the river had
fallen to 2,058 millions of gallons per day, and the number of
microbes to 16,300 per cubic centimetre.
    The only exception of any importance to the rule, that the number
of microbes varies with the flow of the river, occurring during
the thirty-two months through which these observations have been
continued, happened in November, 1892, when the flow increased
from 501 millions of gallons in October to 1,845 millions in November,
whilst the microbes actually diminished in nnmber from 2,316 to
 1,868 per cubic centimetre. Neither the sunshine nor the temperature
 records of these two months, however, afford any explanation of this
 anomalous result, for there was a good deal of sunshine in October
 before the collection of the sample, and the temperature was higher      ;
 whilst in November, no ray of sunshine reached the Thames during
 the three days preceding the taking of the sample, and the temperature
 was nearly 4° C. lower than in the preceding month.
    These comparisons, therefore, demonstrate, I think satisfactorily,
 that the number of microbes in Thames water depends upon the
 rate of flow of the river or, in other words, upon the rainfall, and
 but slightly, if at all, upon either the presence or absence of sunshine
 or a high or low temperature.
     With regard to the effect of sunshine upon bacterial life, the in
 teresting researches of Dr. Marshall Ward leave no doubt that sun
 light is a powerful germicide ; but it is probable that its potency, in
 this respect, is greatly diminished if not entirely annulled, when the
 solar rays have to pass through a stratum of water even of compara
 tively small thickness before they reach the living organisms. If
  this be the case, it can be no matter for surprise that the effect of
 sunshine upon bacterial life in the great mass of Thames water should
  be nearly,  if not quite, imperceptible.

     Since this paper was written,      I  have ascertained that between
  October 17 and November 22, 1892, when the sample for microbe
  cultivation was collected, the river had several times been in such
  high flood as to be bank-full.          Thus, between October 30 and

November    2, the flow was never less than 3,000 millions of gallons
per day, and    on November 2 it reached 4,240 millions.        Again, on
the 17th the flow was 3,305 millions, and on the 18th, 4,165 millions.
It then gradually decreased to 1,845 millions on the day when the
sample was drawn.       Thus the Thames basin had been twice verr
thoroughly washed out immediately before the time when the
November sample was taken.        There had previously been no such
floods after the 5th of January in that year. This condition of things
affords a fairly satisfactory explanation of the anomalous result
yielded by this sample,
III.  " The Cause of Luminosity in the Flames of Hydrocarbon
      Gases." By Vivian B. Lewes, Professor of Chemistry at
      the Royal Naval College, Greenwich.            Communicated by
      Professor Thorpe, F.K.S. Received February 14, 1895.
   In  a paper read before the Chemical Society in 1893,         I showed
that in the inner non- luminous zone of a flame of ordinary illuminating
gas, the hydrocarbons originally present in the gas, and consisting of
ethylene, butylene, benzene, methane, and ethane, became converted by
the baking action of the walls of flame between which they had to pass
into acetylene, and that at the moment when luminosity commenced,
over 80 per cent. of the total unsaturated hydrocarbons present
consisted of this compound.
   The presence of acetylene at the point where luminosity commenced
naturally suggested that it was in some way due to actions in which
the acetylene played the principal part — either that it split up into
carbon and hydrogen under the influence of heat, and so supplied the
flame with the solid particles necessary, according to Sir Humphry
Davy's theory of the cause of luminosity, or else by its polymerisation
it formed the dense vapours required by Dr. E. Frankland's more
recent hypothesis.
   In order to elucidate this point,   I carried out the long series of
experiments upon the action of heat upon flowing ethylene and other
 hydrocarbons, which formed the subject of communications to the
 Royal Society in 1893 and early this year, in which       I showed thai
 whilst flowing through a heated area (the temperature of which was
 between 800° and 1000° C), ethylene decomposed according to the
 eqnation
                         3C2H1  = 2C,H,+2CH4,
 and that the acetylene then polymerised into a large number of more
 complex hydrocarbons, amongst which benzene and naphthalene were
 conspicuous, whilst at temperatures above 1200° C, no polymerisation

1895.]            in  the  Flames of Hydrocarbon Gases.                      451
took place, but the acetylene formed from the ethylene decomposed
at once into carbon and hydrogen, whilst the methane, which up to
this temperature had been but little affected, decomposed into
                               2CH1= C2H, + H;St
and   this fresh supply of acetylene at once broke up to carbon and
hydrogen, so that at temperatures above 1200° C. the complete
action might be looked upon as being
                                C2Hi =    C2 + 2H2.
   These results    have an important bearing upon the cause of the
luminosity in the flame, as it is manifest that if the temperature
of the luminous zone is above 1200° C, the light emitted must be
due to incandescent particles of carbon, and not to incandescent
hydrocarbon vapours.
   On determining the temperature of an ethylene flame whilst burn
ing from a small fish-tail burner by means of the Le Chatelier thermo
couple, used in the way described in my paper* on the luminosity of
coal-gas flames,  I  found that the temperatures were as follows : —

showing that luminosity commenced at 1340° C, and continued even
at 1875° C, temperatures at which the incandescent vapour theory
becomes untenable.
   It might be urged that the heavy hydrocarbons already produced
at a lower temperature in the non-luminous zone are not so easily
decomposed by heat as acetylene, and that these may be causing the
luminosity, even though carbon particles be present from the decom
posed acetylene ; but this would hardly be possible, as so little besides
acetylene is to be found at the top of the non-luminous zone of an
ethylene flame, and it can be experimentally shown that even when
benzene vapour is formed and is largely diluted it begins to break up
aud deposit carbon at 1200° C.

   The supporters of the solid particle             theory of luminosity agre¦
 in concluding that the liberated       carbon,   existing as it does in a con
dition of molecular division, is heated to incandescence partly by its
own combustion, and partly by the combustion of the hydrogen and
carbon monoxide going on around the finely-divided carbon particles.

 452        Prof. V. B. Lewes.       The Cause      of Luminosity [Mar  21,
     As has been pointed out by many observers, it is clear that the
 carbon particles themselves undergo combustion, otherwise they would
 escape unburnt from the flame, whilst it is manifest that the com
 bustion of hydrogen and carbon monoxide, which plays so important
 a part in the flame, must add its iota to the temperature attained hy
 them.
    Both these sources of temperature, however, would be manifest in
 the flame itself, and with flames of given size burning from the same
 description of jet we ought to find that their luminosity is governed
 by-
             A. The temperature of the      flame.
             B. The number of carbon particles in a given area.
    Moreover, we should expect that the higher the temperature of the
 flame, the whiter would be the light emitted, so that a comparatively
 low temperature flame, even when rich in carbon particles, would
 be yellow and lurid as compared with a flame containing the same or
 a smaller number of particles, but which had a higher temperature.
    It has been pointed out by Professor A. Smithells* that it is
 erroneous to consider the temperature of a flame as being the tem
 perature recorded by thermometric instruments inserted into the
flame, as by such devices you only obtain the mean temperature of a
considerable area of the flame uncorrected for loss from conduction.
    It is also perfectly well known that in a flame a thick platinum
 wire may only be heated to redness, whilst a thin wire may even be
fused, and this suggests that flame temperatures taken by the Le
Chatelier thermo-couple of platinum and platinum-rhodium wires
may be totally incorrect.         In using this beautiful and convenient
device,   I  have found that the length of the wires twisted together
made piactically no difference in the recorded temperature, and that
one twist was as good as six.
    In all my flame experiments        I   have made the twist as short as
possible, and by always using wires of the same thickness have
obtained results which are at any rate comparable if not correct, and
in order to find what difference the thickness of the wires would make,
I   got Messrs. Johnson and Matthey to draw for me wires of O-OIS,
0"Oll, and 0-003 of an inch diameter, and having calibrated the
galvanometer scale for temperature with thermo-couples of the same
length of twist made from each of them, obtained the following
results with the same portion of a Bunsen flame.

   These results show that the diameter of the wire seriously affects
the  temperature recorded under these conditions by the thermo
couple, the same degree of heat being recorded by the fine wire as
being 248° hotter than is shown by the thickest wire employed, this
discrepancy being probably chiefly due to loss by conduction.
   In taking the temperature of heated gas flowing through a tube
this source of error is but small, as some considerable length of wire
being heated on each side of the twist, conduction has but little effect
on the thermo-couple itself, but in determining the temperature of
flames it is manifest that the finest usable wire must be employed in
order to reduce the error from conduction.           Test experiments also
showed that no part of the thermo-couple must project beyond the
flame, as if it did a considerable diminution in the recorded temperature
took place.
   For these reasons it was manifestly best to use the finest wire
which could be employed without the risk of fusing at the tempera
tures existing in the flames to be tested ; and all temperatures
recorded in this paper were made with wire 0"Oll in. in diameter,
the  twist being as short as possible, so that it is probable that,
although the temperatures may be from 100° to 200° too low, yet the
results are strictly comparable.

   Experiments which have lately made with pure acetylene, prepared
by the action of water upon calcic carbide, show it to be the most
powerful illuminant to be found amongst the gaseous hydrocarbons,
as when burnt in a small flat flame burner under the most suitable
pressure, and its illuminating power calculated to a flow of 5 cubic ft.
an hour, its value is equal to about 240 candles.
   The colour of the flame is pure white, and an ethylene flame beside
it looks yellow and dull — the purity of the light at once suggesting
a very high condition of incandescence in the particles of carbon
present in the flame.
   On now taking the temperature of the various portions of the
flame, and comparing these with the temperatures obtained in the
same way with the ethylene flame and a coal-gas flame of the same
size, the following results are obtained : —

    Here then we have the anomaly of three gases, which not only         do
not conform to the preconceived expectation, but which have their
ratio of temperature and illuminating value directly opposed to each
other.
    In the case of the acetylene and ethylene, moreover, the molecules
contain the same number of atoms of carbon, and yet we obtain so
enormous a discrepancy in their illuminating value.
    The fact that there is no apparent relation existing between the
temperature of the flame, or the probable number of carbon particles
contained in it and its illuminating value, at once suggests that the
luminosity must be in great part governed by some thermo-chemical
changes taking place in the flame itself, and which do not of necessity
affect the average temperature of the flame to any great degree.
   The researches of Hittorf* and Siemens show that air, steam, and
the oxides of carbon, even when heated to temperatures above those
existing in luminous hydrocarbon flames, are perfectly non-luminons,
and the fact that the Bunsen flame, when supplied with sufficient air,
has a temperature exceeding 1800° C. in its hottest part, and yet
emits no light, shows us that it is exceedingly unlikely that any
interactions leading to luminosity take place amongst these ordinary
flame gases.
   The fact that most of the unsaturated hydrocarbons in the flame
are converted into acetylene before luminosity commences, naturally
draws one's attention to this body, and the fact that it is highly
cndothermic, at once suggests the idea that it may be the liberation
of heat during its decomposition that endows the carbon particles
produced from it with an incandescence far higher than any which
could be expected from the temperature of the flame.
   Berthelot has calculated that the temperature developed by the
detonation of acetylene at constant volume is no less than 6220° C,
and if this be imparted at the moment of its liberation to the products
of its decomposition, the incandescence of the carbon particles is at once
explained.
   If luminosity be even partly due to this cause, the detonation of
pure acetylene first recorded by Berthelot should develop light. In
order to see if this were so, a thin glass tube, closed by a cork, had

a detonator          containing one-tenth of a gram of mercuric     fulminate
suspended        in it by two copper wires, which were connected by     a   thin
platinum  wire in contact with the fulminate, and on firing the
detonator by the electric current the flash of the fulminate was
found to emit but a feeble light.
  The same charge was fixed in a similar tube filled with pure
acetylene collected over mercury, the result          being a flash of intense
white  light and the shattering of the tube, the pieces of which were
thickly coated with the carbon produced by the decomposition of the
acetylene.
   Moreover, the small piece of white tissue paper used to contain the
fulminate was only scorched at the points where the explosion of the
fulminate had burst through        showing that in the instantaneous
                                        it,
decomposition which had taken place, the intense heat which had
been developed either was confined to the products of decomposition,
or else had not had time to scorch the paper.
   The experiment at first sight seemed conclusive evidence that              it
was the endothermic nature of the acetylene which, during its decom
position in the flame, endowed the particles of carbon with the
necessary incandescence, but the objection presented itself that, when
exploding mixtures of oxygen and hydrogen in the eudiometer, a
distinctly luminous flash      produced, and, although the light so
                                   is
obtained    feeble as compared with the intensity of the white light
               is
produced by the detonation of the acetylene, still farther proof              is
necessary before this action can be accepted as the prime factor in
producing luminosity.
    It also manifest that
        is                  would not do to assume that the rapidity
                                 it
of the decomposition of the acetylene in   flame was nearly so great
                                                  a
as when the undiluted gas was detonated, and the question arose as
to whether   would be possible to obtain evidence as to acetylene,
                    it
when exposed to heat alone, liberating carbon in a luminous con
dition.
  Although the instantaneous liberation of heat on the decomposition
of the gas by detonation appears to confine the temperature to tlu>
products of its decomposition,   was to be expected that, on being
                                        it
decomposed by heat, and probably, therefore, at a slower rate, the
increase       in temperature might be detected.
    To try this, pure acetylene was passed through a platinum tube
2   mm. in diameter and 40 cm. long, in which the Le Chatelier
thermo-couple   was arranged as follows — The two wires were twisted
                                              :
together for a length of     mm., and the wires on either side of the
                                 3
twist are then passed through thin glass tubes, which are fused on to
them; having been in this way coated with glass so that only the
twist     exposed, they are passed through the platinum tube, the
          is
glass insulating the wire from the metal of the tube, and also keeping

the thermo-junction in such a position that it registers the tempera
tures of the gas in the tube, not that of the wall of the tube. To
each end of the platinum tube glass ~f*~P'eces are fitted, down the
stems of which the wires pass to mercury seals ; from the metal seals
conducting wires lead to the resistance coils, the key, and a reflecting
galvanometer.
   A steady flow of acetylene was allowed to pass through the tube,
and was led into water at the other end.     The tube was slowly and
carefully heated for about 4 in. of its length, and, as the tempera
ture reached 700° C, white vapours began to flow from the tube,
and these, as the temperature rose, increased in quantity. The
.source of heat had been so regulated that the temperature had risen
about 10° per minute, but, almost immediately 800° C. was passed, the
galvanometer registered a sudden leap up in temperature to about
1000° C, whilst finely-divided carbon poured from the tube.      This
seemed to indicate that 800° was about the temperature at which the
pure acetylene broke up into its constituents, and an experiment was
now made to see if this developed incandescence in the liberated
carbon.
   A small glass combustion tube was well supported, and heated to
the highest temperature attainable with one of Fletcher's big blow
pipes, whilst pure acetylene was slowly flowing through                the        it,
heating   not  being commenced   until the tube was  filled with the  pure
gas, all air being thoroughly rinsed out.    As the temperature reached
the softening point of the glass, the acetylene apparently burst into                   a
lurid flame at the point where it entered the zone of heat, and clouds
of carbon swept forwards through the tube but, although the carbon

point that the luminosity was developed, proving beyond doubt that
it was the heat evolved by the decomposition, and not the external
heating, which caused the carbon particles to emit light.
   If it is   the decomposition of the molecule of acetylene which
develops    the  heat which     the cause of the incandescence of the

that this might be done by so diluting the acetylene that            wonld      it
require a much higher temperature to break it up.

when    diluted with indifferent gases, requires to be maintained at a

than when it is undiluted with such gases."
   Dr. Percy Frankland, in his researches on the effect of diluents
upon the illuminating value of hydrocarbons, f showed that ethylene,
which was capable of developing a light of 68-5 candles power when
burnt by itself, became non-luminous when diluted with about: —

results which all show that excessive dilution by inert gases destroys
luminosity.
    In order to see if dilution had the same effect upon acetylene,
experiments were made by diluting it with pure hydrogen.                           The
gases were mixed over water, the proportion of acetylene actually
present in the gas being determined by analysis at the burner, and
although the water in both holder and meter was, as far as possible,
saturated with the gas, yet, as the analyses show, the precaution was
an important     one.

Showing that dilution with between 80 and 90 per cent. of hydrogen

    In order to determine the point at which luminosity was destroyed
 when consuming the mixture in a burner suited to develop the light
 from a gas of low illuminating power, the experiment was repeated,
using a 3-in. flame burning from the London argand, and also from a
No. 4 Bray union jet, the latter being employed as it is difficult to
determine the temperature in the argand flame.

so that  luminosity would be destroyed in the argand by dilution with
about 90 per cent. hydrogen, and in the No. 4 Bray with about 88

    The next point to be determined was whether the destruction of
luminosity in the diluted acetylene flame was in reality due to dilu
tion rendering it necessary to employ a higher temperature for the
decomposition of the acetylene, or to other causes.
    In order to do this, a tube made of specially infusible glass 4 mm.
in diameter was taken, and the Le Chatelier thermo-couple was
fitted into it in the same way as before, used with the platinum tube,
and all air having been rinsed out by a current of the mixture to be
experimented with, the gas was allowed to pass at a steady rate of
flow through the tube, the point at which the thermo-couple was
situated being steadily heated by the Fletcher blowpipe, whilst the
temperature recorded on the scale was noted the moment that incan
descent liberation of carbon commenced.

    It was found impossible to obtain a glass tube which would stand
temperatures higher than this ; but on plotting out the points so
obtained, and which give a fairly straight line, it is seen that even if
the increase in temperature only continues for increased dilution iu
the same ratio as shown in the experimental determinations, which
is extremely unlikely, the reason of the destruction of luminosity in
highly-diluted hydrocarbon gases is at once explained, as an increase
of each 10 per cent. in the dilution would necessitate an increase of
100° 0. in the temperature of the flame, and with 90 per cent. dilo-
lution a temperature of over 1700° C. would be required to bring
about decomposition.
    My reason for believing that it is highly improbable that when
dilution is great it only requires the same increment in temperature
to bring about decomposition as when the dilution is small, is that in
                I
all the work have done on the effect of diluents upon luminosity,
and also in Professor Percy Frankland's researches upon the same

subject,  dilution with hydrogen and carbon monoxide acts regularly,
and decreases    the value of the illuminant in a direct ratio down to
about 50 per cent., whilst when the degree of dilution exceeds 60 per
cent, a rapid falling away in the luminosity takes place, a fact which
1 think points clearly to a
                              regular pro rata rise of temperature being
needed for increase in dilution up to between 50 and 60 per cent.,
whilst higher degrees of dilution need a far greater rise of tempera
ture in order to bring about decomposition.
   Moreover it would be manifestly incorrect to look upon the per
centage of acetylene present in the gas issuing from the burner as
being any guide to the degree of dilution existing at the point at
which luminosity commences.       As the two small streams of gas issuing
from the holes in the union jet meet and splay themselves out into
the flat flame, they draw in with them a considerable proportion of
air, the quantity being governed by the pressure of the gas at the
burner.
   This can be clearly seen by the fact that a high value gas which
burns from a union jet burner of a given size with a smoky flame,
under a gas pressure of half an inch of water, will burn with a
bright, smokeless, and rigid flame of greatly increased illuminating
value when the pressure is raised to 2 in., whilst an ordinary coal
gas of 16-candle value must be burnt from a flat flame burner at a
pressure of about 0'75 in. if the best results are to be obtained, the
increase in air drawn in, if the pressure rises to a much higher degree,
 diminishing the illuminating value.
   Then, again, the area of non-luminous combustion in a mixture of
 gases like coal gas means that some at least of the hydrocarbons are
consumed before the required temperature for their decomposition is

of the flame are mixed with the flame gases, partly by diffusion and
partly by being drawn into it by the upward rush.
   When a simple hydrocarbon like ethylene or acetylene is burnt

tion has to be generated by the combustion, without decomposition,
of a considerable proportion of the hydrocarbon, and this means con
siderable dilution at the spot where the luminosity commences, so

is only some 14 or 15 per cent. of acetylene present, diluted with
nitrogen, hydrogen, water vapour, and the oxides of carbon, whilst,
with a mixture of 10 per cent. acetylene and 90 per cent. of hydrogen,
in some cases little or no acetylene could be found at the top of the
inner zone of the flame, it either having diffused with the hydrogen
and been consumed, or polymerised to other compounds.
   It is manifest that the luminosity of a flame will be governed,
not by the percentage of acetylene in the gas, but at the point at
which the temperature is sufficiently high to bring about decom
position.
   If, instead of making a mixture of 90 per cent. hydrogen and 10
per cent. acetylene, the hydrogen is burnt at the end of an open
platinum tube, which has a fine platinum tube passing np the centre
to the top of the inner zone of the flame, and if the acetylene be
passed into the flame at the rate of one volume for every ten of the
hydrogen, not only do we obtain an intensely luminous, but a very
smoky flame.
   In this experiment the gases were issuing from their respectiv¦
tubes at the same pressure, but the small tube soon choked from
deposited carbon, and it was found that the same results could be
equally well attained by drawing down the inner tube to the level of
the hydrogen tube, and making the acetylene issue at a slightly
higher rate of flow, which hurried it in a compact stream through
the inner zone of the hydrogen flame.
   In order to see if the percentage of acetylene present at the top of
the non- luminous zone bore any ratio to the illuminating value of the
mixture, experiments were made in which mixtures of hydrogen and
acetylene were burnt at a small flat flame burner, and the percentage
of acetylene was determined by gently aspirating out some of the
flame gases from the top of the non-luminous zone.

On plotting ont            these    results, they certainly seem to point to
the fact that, with flames of the same size burning from the same
burner, the light emitted by the flame is directly proportional to the
percentage of acetylene present at the top of the non-luminous zone
of the flame, provided always that the temperature is sufficiently
high to complete its decomposition.

    It is perfectly possible for the         temperature of a flame to be so little
above the point necessary to decompose the diluted acetylene that,
whilst some decomposes and renders the flame faintly luminous, the
larger portion burns without decomposition. A good example of this
is to be found in the combustion of alcohol, the flame of which con
tains as much acetylene            as is to be found   in a good coal-gas flame,
but which is practically almost non-luminous.                If alcohol in a small
dish be ignited, it burns with a faintly luminous flame, and if a bell-
jar is placed over it, some of the products of combustion mingling
 with the flame still further cool it and render it non-luminons ; but
if now a stream of oxygen be introduced under the bell-jar the
                                                                   becomes highly
temperature of the flame is at once increased and
 luminous, whilst a cold porcelain vessel held in the flame is coated
with     soot.
    In    all the experiments in which light was developed in heated
tubes by the decomposition of acetylene, the glow of the carbon was
 red and lurid, the light emitted being of the same character and
 appearance as that developed by the combustion
                                                                  of potassium in
 carbon dioxide, and entirely lacking the pure            white   incandescence   of
 the acetylene flame as burnt from a flat-flame burner.
    This may be due to the fact that in the open flame the tempera
 ture of the carbon particles is presumably due to three sources of
  heat : —

462        Prof. V. B. Lewes.     The Cause  of Luminosity   [Mar. 21,
   A. Heat derived from the decomposition of the acetylene molecule.
   B. Heat derived from the combustion of hydrogen, carbon mon
         oxide, and some hydrocarbons in the flame.
   C. Heat derived from the combustion of the carbon particles
         themselves,
 whilst in the tnbe experiments the heat of the walls of the       tube
and the heat of decomposition alone are acting, and it is evident
that the intensity of the heat finding its way through the walls of
the tube will be very different to that exercised by the walls of burn
ing gas which enclose the luminous portion of the flame, and there
can be but little doubt that the temperature of the carbon particles
will vary enormously with the rate at which the acetylene decom
poses, as the more quickly the action takes place, the greater will be
the localising action upon the heat evolved, and the higher the incan
descence of the carbon particles.
   That this is so seems certain from the whiteness of the flash of
light emitted when the acetylene is detonated, and experiments
were made in order, if possible, to gain an idea as to how much
of the incandescence of the carbon particles was due to the
endothermicity of the decomposing acetylene, and how much to
the action of heat and combustion on the carbon particles after
formation.
   In order to do this, a non-luminous flat flame of large size was
desired, and was obtained by using coal gas de-illuminated by slowly
passing it through bromine, well washing with sodic hydrate solution
and water, and then passing it through strong sulphuric- acid, the
gas so treated having an illuminating value of 1"2 candles for 5 cubic
feet when burnt in the London argand at such a rate as to give a
3-in. flame, whilst in a fish-tail burner it gave a non-luminous
flame.     This gas gave on analysis the following percentage compo
sition : —

so that   its combustion would give practically the same temperature
and flame reactions as those in an ordinary gas flame.
   A very fine platinum tube was now obtained, closed at one end, and
with five minute holes bored in a line close to the sealed end, and

1895.]              in the Flames of Hydrocarbon Gases.               463
this having been so arranged that the holes were buried in the flame
just at the top of the inner     zone, acetylene was then gently allowed
to flow through them into the flame.
    At   the points where the acetylene issued into the flame, small areas
of intense luminosity were produced, whilst the liberated carbon
streaming up between the flame walls of the upper zone produced
dull red bands of very low luminosity.         It may be suggested that
the carbon particles supplied in this way to the flame may have
agglomerated and formed masses larger than those produced in the
ordinary way, but I do not think this, as they were completely
consumed, and no smoke escaped from the crown of the flame,
whereas if a flat flame is interfered with in such a way as to cause
the carbon particles to roll themselves together, smoking of the flame
is produced.
    I  think the inference to be drawn from this experiment undoubtedly
is that it is the heat of decomposition which gives the high incan
descence and light emitting value to the carbon particles, and that
the temperature of the combustion of the other flame gases and finally
of th¦ carbon itself plays but a secondary part.
    In considering these results, it seems remarkable that if acetylene
owes its power of rendering hydrocarbon flames luminous to its
high endothermic properties, that cyanogen, which is still more
endothermic, should burn under all conditions that have at present
 been tried with a non-luminous flame.
                                              Heat of formation.

                    Cyanogen              C,Na   —65,700
 It   is clear that if the rapidity of decomposition localises the heat
 evolved to the products of decomposition, and that this renders the
 liberated carbon particles incandescent, whilst the hydrogen plays at
 best a very subsidiary part, it ought not to matter whether it be
 hydrogen or nitrogen which is combined with the carbon.
    Berthelot showed that cyanogen like acetylene could be detonated
 by a small charge of mercuric fulminate, but he notes that the test is
 not always successful, which points to the decomposition of this
 body requiring a greater expenditure of energy to break up the
 molecule than is the case with acetylene, and known facts would
 lead ns to expect that this would be the case, as although exothermic
 compounds become less and less stable with rise of temperature,
  endothermic      bodies on the other hand become more stable,
  and the     endothermicity of cyanogen being greater than that of
  acetylene, would lead one to expect that temperatures which would
  decompose acetylene would have no effect on cyanogen, and that,
  as during the combustion of cyanogen, the liberation of nitrogen

464       Prof. V. B. Lewes.         TJie Cause of Luminosity          [Mar. 21,
would probably have a diluting and cooling action, the cyanogen
would burn directly without liberating any carbon which could emit
light.
    In order to see if the temperature of the cyanogen flame when
burnt from an ordinary flat flame burner differed much from that
of hydrocarbons when consumed in a flame of the same size and
kind, the temperatures were experimentally determined by the same
method employed, and in the same parts of the flame as had before
been done with acetylene, ethylene, and coal gas.

 Showing that the cyanogen flame was actually hotter than the
acetylene and ethylene flames, and about the same as the coal gas
flame, but that the heat was differently distributed, the inner zone
being far hotter than in the other gases, whilst the maximum
temperature of the flame was at the apex of the inner zone, instead
of being nearer the top of the flame.
    An experiment was now made to ascertain if it were possible to
decompose cyanogen with luminous deposition of carbon, by passing
it through a hard glass tube heated by means of the blowpipe ; but at
the highest temperature attainable no trace of any deposition of carbon
took place, showing how far more stable cyanogen is under the influence
of high temperatures than acetylene.
    The structure and characteristic appearance of the cyanogeu flame
have been explained by Smithells* and Dent, who conclude that the
inner zone of peach blossom tint is caused by the combustion of
 the cyanogen to carbon monoxide and nitrogen, whilst the outer bine
cone is formed by the oxidation of the monoxide to dioxide, the green
 fringe to the outer cone being attributed to the presence of small
quantities of oxides of nitrogen ; and if this explanation be accepted,
it is clear that we could not obtain luminosity iu the portion of the
flame immediately above the inner zone, as all cynogen has been
destroyed without decomposition before that point is reached. It is
conceivable, however, that although no luminosity can be detected
in a cyanogen flame, and although the temperature which can be
obtained in a glass tube is insufficient to break up the compound with
 luminous separation of carbon, yet if cyanogen could be heated to a
considerably higher temperature, it might be possible to decompose
it in such a way as to develop luminosity.
    In order to try this point, a hydrogen flame was burnt from the
end of an open platinum tube        9 mm. in diameter, and a thin platinum
                        * '
                            Chem. Soc. Jour.,' 1894, p. 603.

  tube 2-5 mm. in diameter was passed up through the broad tube to
  the apex of the inner zone, and a slow stream of cyanogen was
  admitted, with the result that the flame at once became luminous,
 and on surrounding the hydrogen flame                with an atmosphere of
 oxygen to increase the temperature, the luminosity was considerably
 increased.
    This experiment at once explains the cause of the non-luminosity
 of the cyanogen flame,       and shows that it is purely a question of
 temperature, and the probabilities are that, burnt in a flame which
 gave sufficient heat to rapidly decompose            it, nearly as high an
 illuminating   value   as that of acetylene would     be obtained.
    I think the explanation of the apparent anomaly of the cyanogen
 flame having a higher temperature than the acetylene and ethylene
 flames, is to be found in the fact that the molecules of cyanogen
 are consumed without previous decomposition, so that the heat
 absorbed during the formation of the cyanogen is added to the
 heat of combustion, and raises the average temperature of the flame,
 whereas with acetylene the instantaneous decomposition of the
 molecule before combustion confines the heat evolved to the liberated
products, and the average temperature of the flame is but little more
 than the heat of combustion.
    If the luminosity of a hydrocarbon flame is principally due to the
localisation, during intensely rapid decomposition, of the heat of
formation in the products, the illuminating values of such hydro
carbon gases as contain two atoms of carbon in the molecule should
 bear a simple ratio to their heat of formation.           The gaseous hydro
carbons are —

and although     they may undergo many changes in the flame, they will
all ultimately    be reduced to carbon and hydrogen again before the full
luminosity of     the flame is developed.
    When the      acetylene into which these hydrocarbons is converted
by   heat  is  decomposed, the action takes place with such enormous
rapidity that one would expect the heat evolved to simply divide itself
amongst the liberated atoms, so that the question of specific heat at
high temperatures may be omitted.
    With exothermic compounds like ethane, considerable heat will
have to be developed by its own combustion before it is converted
into the acetylene, which, by its decomposition, endows the flame
with luminosity, and if we take the ethane and call its light pro
ducing energy 1, we can then obtain a ratio of such energy for the

   The determination of the illuminating value of a gas become* more
and more difficult the higher its illuminating value, owing to the
cooliDg effect of the small burners that must of necessity be used in
order to ensure complete combustion. Dr. Percy Frankland* assigned
the illuminating value of 35 candles to ethane as the mean of four
tests, which varied considerably amongst themselves, and, adopting

the thermal value of the change from gaseous to solid carbon, and are
of no value except as showing that a ratio does exist between heat of

 a very high temperature to bring about its conversion into acetylene
 and decomposition into carbon and hydrogen, and that a large
 portion of the gas must be burnt without decomposition to do
 this.
    The facts which        I   have  sought to establish in this paper
 are  :—
    1. That the luminosity of hydrocarbon flames is principally due to
 the localisation of the heat of formation of acetylene in the carbon
and hydrogen produced by its decomposition.
    2. That such localisation is produced by the rapidity of its decom
 position, which varies with the temperature of the flame and the

 would not be sufficient to produce the incandescence of the carbon
particles within the flame.
    In my paper on the action of heat upon ethylene, brought before
 the Royal Society this spring,       I showed that the decomposition of
ethylene    into acetylene and simpler hydrocarbons was mainly due to
 the action of radiant heat, and was but little retarded by dilution,
 whilst   I have shown in this paper that the acetylene so produced
 requires   a  considerable increase in temperature to bring about its
 decomposition when diluted, and it is possible with these data to
give a fairly complete description of the actions which endow hydro
carbon flames with the power of emitting light.
    When the hydrocarbon gas leaves the jet at which it is being burnt,
those portions which come in contact with the air are consumed and
form a wall of flame which surrounds the issuing gas. The unburnt
gas in its passage through the lower heated area of the flame under
goes a number of chemical changes, brought about by the action of
radiant heat emitted by the flame walls, the principal of which is the
conversion of the hydrocarbons into acetylene, methane, and hydro
gen.     The temperature of the flame quickly rises as the distance from
the jet increases, and a portion of the flame is soon reached at which
the heat is sufficiently intense to decompose the acetylene with a
rapidity almost akin to detonation, and the heat of its formation,
localised by the rapidity of its decomposition, raises the liberated
carbon particles to incandescence, this giving the principal part of
the luminosity to the flame ; whilst these particles, heated by the
combustion of the flame gases, still continue to glow, until finally

        and Nitrogen." By E. C. C. Baly, A.I.C., 1851 Exhibition
        Scholar in University College, London.          Communicated
       by Professor   Ramsay,    F.R.S. Received February 27, 1895.
                                (Abstract.)
    The two spectra of oxygen are shown to be of a different nature.
 They behave differently, and reasons are given for their being in all
 probability the spectra of different gases. They may either be two
 spectra produced by different vibrations of the oxygen molecule, or
they may be the spectra of two different modifications of oxygen, or
 the spectra of two distinct gases resulting from a dissociation of
oxygen, a combination of which is called oxygen.
    It appeared worth while to undertake experiments with a view of
testing the last of these.     Oxygen was sparked in an apparatus
similar to that used by Professor J. J. Thomson in his experiments
on the electrolysis of steam.     Hollow platinum electrodes were used,
each one of which was connected with a Sprengel mercury pump. In
the first experiments, the distance between the electrodes was 35 mm.,
and the highest pressure compatible with the appearance of the two
spectra was made the starting point of the experiments.          In these
first experiments it was 380 mm. The density of the oxygen before
sparking was determined, and taken as a test of its purity. The
fractions obtained from the anode and cathode were weighed, and the
results are given.   They follow the lines of J. J, Thomson's results,
inasmuch as with long sparks a lighter fraction was obtained at the
cathode, and with short sparks a heavier fraction.    The fractions from
the anode were not so definite as from the cathode, though the differ
ence was in the right direction.       The probable maximum error of
weighing   was  0"OOOl  gram.   This   meant exactly one in the second
decimal place of the density obtained.         The general accuracy of
the results may be gauged from the densities of uusparked oxygen
obtained.

    The condenser on which the following experiments were made is
the one referred to in a paper by one of us read before the Royal
Society on June 1st, 1893 ('Roy. Soc. Proc.,' vol. 54, p. 7). It is a
5-microfarad condenser of tinfoil and paraffined paper, made by Messrs.
Muirhead.      In the paper referred to it was shown that when it is
allowed to discharge itself through a coil containing induction the
rate of dissipation of energy (calculated from the damping of the
oscillations that occur) is greater than that due to the resistance of
the outside circuit : the additional dissipation being equal to what
would have taken place if about 59 ohms had been added to the
circuit resistance.
    The following experiments were made with the idea of ascertaining
whether this additional dissipation is the result simply of viscosity in
the dielectric of the condenser or to true hysteresis of the charge
with respect to the potential difference between the condenser plates.
A sharp distinction is not always made between the two phenomena;
it cannot be too clearly borne in mind that, on the one hand, viscosity
is a " time " effect —i.e., it depends on the rate of change of the
variables ; while, on the other hand, the phenomenon of hysteresis
does not in any way involve the rate at which the changes in the
quantities are made.

oscillatory discharge, are hence unseated for discriminating between
the two canses : to test whether true hysteresis exists it is essential
to so arrange the experiment that all viscous effects shall have had
time to subside before any measurement of charge is made. Hence
the interesting experiments made during the last three years by
Riccardo Arno,* in which a dielectic cylinder begins to rotate when
placed in a rotating electrostatic field, as well as the experiments
                        f
made by P. Janet, and by one of us using oscillatory discharges, do
not serve as test experiments on this question.
    The arrangement which we adopted to test for hysteresis is as
follows : —

terminals.    The charge that the condenser possesses at any time can
he ascertained by discharging it (by means of the switch) through a
ballistic galvanometer.
    Since the methods for testing for hysteresis consist in patting the
thing tested through cyclic series of states, it is essential that any
change of state involved in the measuring operations should itself
form part of a cycle. This was accomplished by making the cycles
in the manner indicated in Fig. 2, which has been drawn as it might
appear if considerable hysteresis were present.

    Commencing at the point R in the cycle (i.e. with no difference of
potential between the terminals), the potential difference is gradually
increased until the point P on the curve is reached ; the condenser is
then discharged ; the portion of the curve PIT is traced during the
" instantaneous "
                   discharge, and the galvanometer indicates the loss
of charge PT, which includes whatever viscous flow takes place
during the time of throw of needle (2\ seconds).        While the galva
nometer is still in connection with the condenser a further viscous
flow takes place, until, if the cyclic state has been set up, the start
ing point R is arrived at.      Before allowing the switch to again
connect the condenser to B (Fig. 1) the rheostat is unwound so as
to bring B back to A ; there is then no potential difference between B
and A, and the condenser receives no charge when the switch
completes connection.     After this connection has been made the
 potential difference is again gradually increased, but to a higher
value than before — to S (say) ; it is gradually diminished till it has
 the same value as at P ; we thus arrive at a point Q ; the condenser
 is then discharged through the galvanometer; the throw of the
 needle measures the loss of charge QT, which includes the same

472            Messrs. A.   W. Porter and D. K. Morris.        [Mar.   21,
viscous effect as before ; the point U is reached during the throw of
needle : after which, a further viscous flow takes place, until (if the
cyclic state be set up) the point R is returned to once more.
   The contact B is moved back to A while the condenser is still
detached from it ; and this series of operations is then many times
repeated.
   If the dissipation of energy in the condenser is due to hysteresis,
then, as in the magnetic analogue, we know that the cyclic curve
will embrace an area, and the point Q will not coincide with the
point P ; and the converse of this is also true if time has been given
for viscous effects to subside.
   If, on the other hand, experiment shows no difference in the
charge when at Q from what it is at P, there can be no hysteresis,
unless of an amount so small as to elude this method of detecting it.
   The following figure (Fig. 3) shows the kind of curve that will be
traced if hysteresis be absent.
    The experimental results are given in Table I.
   The point P was so chosen that the charge was then almost exactly
 half of the maximum charge.      The duration of a cycle of operations
 was never less than     five minutes.   The galvanometer throws were
 read by a telescope and scale, and are expressed in centimetres.      As
 both galvanometer mirror and telescope are of fine quality there   is  no
 difficulty in detecting a tenth of a millimetre on the scale.
    It will be observed that the throws fall off gradually throughout
 the experiment in consequence      of gradual failure of the battery
 power ; but as this affects both series to the same extent it has no
 influence on the ratios. Individual values of the ratio Throw at
 Q/Throw at P differ amongst themselves by small amounts, being
 below unity in 11 cases, above in 12, and equal to unity in one case.

  Hence the position of the point Q in the diagram is indistinguish
able from the position of the point P ; and we may conclude that
when time has been given for viscous effects to subside the charge of
the condenser is the same for a given value of the potential difference,
whether that value has been arrived at from higher or from lower
values than itself.

   Since, until further experiments be made, this conclusion can only
be taken as applying to the condenser when under the conditions of
this experiment, it is necessary to form an idea as to the highest
value of the electromotive intensity which was produced in the
dielectric.     Only a very rough estimate of its value can be made
without dismounting the condenser.              If we assume that the thickness
of the paraffined paper is about -01 cm., then with 11 volts potential
difference between the plates, the electromotive intensity equals 1,100
volts per cm., or about 3"7 electrostatic units.         If we take the dielectric
constant of paraffined paper as 2, the corresponding electrostatic induc
tion is 7-4 electrostatic units.          It may be mentioned that in the
experiments       of Signor   Arno   the   induction ranged from -03 to 14-58
electrostatic units.
   In order to give an idea of the viscous effects which come into play

       Hemisection of the Spinal Cord in the Cat." By Charles

       fessor V. Horsley, F.R.S.          Received January 31, 1895.
                                  (Abstract).
    The present research was undertaken in order to determine more
 exactly the nature and origin of epileptiform convulsions and the
paths in the spinal cord by which both afferent and efferent impulses
are transmitted.
    The method employed was as follows : —
    Hemisection of the spinal cord was performed in the lower dorsa
region on the right side, the animals being anaesthetized with ether
and strict antiseptic precautions being observed.
    The animals were kept alive for different periods of time after the
 operation, and the effects produced on the voluntary movements,
 sensibility, and the reflexes were carefully noted.
    After death the spinal cords were at           once  removed, and after
 hardening and staining, by Marchi's method, both the lesion and the
 tracts of degeneration were investigated by microscopic examination.
 There were 16 experiments performed.
    The following results are briefly what were obtained.
    (o.) Motion. — After hemisection of the cord there is immediate
 paralysis of the limb below, and on the same side as the section, this
 remains for a time, and then gradual recovery takes place to a greater
 or less extent ; sometimes the recovery is so complete that it is with
 difficulty that one can determine which was the paralyzed limb. At
 other times more or less permanent weakness is left so as to cause a
 limp when walking, foot-drop is not infrequently seen and the
 animal does not appear to appreciate correctly the position that the
 leg occupies.
    (6.) The Reflexes are, as a rule, greatly exaggerated below and on
 the same side as the lesion, and sometimes continue so for a long
 period ; in many cases they get less as time goes on ; occasionally
 they are not so well marked as on the opposite or uninjured side.

   (c.) Sensation.
                   — This is always interfered -with on the side of the
lesion. Painful sensations, such as those produced by the prick of a
pin, or by touching the foot with a piece of wire which is slightly-
heated, appear to be felt on both sides, and this was well seen in the
monkeys which were used as control experiments ; but the evidence
seems to show that these painful sensations are more quickly felt on
the non-paralyzed than on the paralyzed side, and also that the
animal does not localize the painful spot on the injured side with
anything like the precision that it does on the unaffected side.
   Tactile sensations, such as those produced by the presence of a
small clip applied to the skin, are only felt on the non-paralyzed side ;
the animals were frequently seen to remove the clip from this side,
but unless their tails touched it when placed on the paralysed limb,
or their attention was directed to its presence in some such way, no
 notice whatever was taken of it.
   The same result was seen with the cold-water test.       When water
 was brought in contact with the feet, the unaffected limb was at once
 withdrawn and the water licked off        it,
                                         while on the opposite side the
 foot was allowed to stand in a pool of water without any notice being
 taken of it.

almost entirely to the side that was cut, and they occupied the direct
and crossed pyramidal tracts; a few scattered degenerated fibres
were seen in the antero-lateral tracts of both sides this was especially

.entirely confined to the side of the lesion.
   The tracts that contained most of the degenerated fibres were the
column of Goll, the direct cerebellar tract and the antero-lateral tract.
 Some degenerated fibres were usually found in the opposite column
of Goll, and also in the antero-lateral tract of the uninjured side.

VII.   " On the Analysis of Voluntary Muscular Movements by
      certain new Instruments.". By William R. Jack, M.D.r
      B.Sc.     Communicated by Professor J. GL MoKendrick,
      F.R.S. Received January 25, 1895.
        (From the Physiological Laboratory of the University of Glasgow.)
                                  (Abstract.)
   The object of this investigation was to determine the greatest
speed of which the voluntary muscular movements were capable, and
how far the speed was influenced by age and education. It was de
cided to limit the research to a study of the movements of the fingers,
as being the easiest parts to examine of the muscular system.              The
writer has to acknowledge his indebtedness to Professor McKendrick
for much valuable    assistance    and advice.
   The first instrument used was one devised by Professor McKendrick,
and figured at p. 78 of his ' Life in Motion (first edition, 1892). It
                                                   '
consisted essentially in a tuning fork, carrying a smoked microscopic
slide, and set in motion by a bichromate cell. With all its loads,
the fork made 117 double vibrations per second, as determined by the
chronograph.      Lines drawn upon the attached slide perpendicular to
the plane of vibration were, therefore, thrown into waves, each of
which represented the space passed over in 1"/117. The different
movements investigated in this way were the following : — (1.) The
greatest velocity attainable by the single contraction of one finger,
to which a finely-pointed needle was affixed.               (2.) The greatest
velocity attainable by the single contraction of the fingers in com
bined action. For this purpose the needle was fixed in a penholder,
and held like a pen, care being taken to see that there was no move
ment of the wrist, but only of the fingers. (3.) The greatest velocity
obtainable in ordinary writing.        In this way, therefore, the velocities
of a series of movements increasing in complexity could be com
pared. The velocity of curves and of curvilinear figures was also
compared with that of straight lines.
    Twenty -three normal and two pathological cases were examined.
The normal cases were divided into three classes             : those  of special
manual     education (musicians), those of average manual education
(the  ordinary   educated classes), and those of inferior manual educa
tion (working men), in whom the hands were accustomed only to
coarse movements, and the fingers had no special training. Of the
first class there were five examples ; of the second and of the third,
nine.    The ages varied from 18 to 62.
    While the tracings were being made the hand rested on a little
 table at the height of the recording slide. It was found that the

 478     Dr. W. R. Jack.     On the Analysis of Voluntary       [Mar.  21,
 velocity of the more complicated movements could be increased to
 some extent by practice.    Only a few preliminary tracings, to accus
 tom the hand to the instrument, were therefore allowed to each sub
 ject, in order that all might be as much as possible on the same
 footing.   Full details of the velocities attained in each case, and
 figures of the apparatus used, are given in .the original essay. In
 this abstract only a statement of the results attained will be made.
    It is not contended that the figures there given represent the
 absolute velocities of the movements made, for the retarding influ
ence of friction on the slide has to be allowed for, and the increase
 in the space travelled over through the extension of the needle beyond
 the end of the fingers.   But, as all the subjects were under the same
conditions, a comparative estimate of the velocities may be arrived at.
    Beginning with the influence of training upon the velocity of the
 movements, the pen-movement was first studied, and the rate at
 which a distance of 3 cm. in the middle of the slide was traversed
 was taken as the standard of comparison. Unfortunately no tracings
 of this movement were taken from musicians, but, on comparing the
 average of the tracings derived from those of average and those of
 inferior manual education, the following conclusions were arrived at.
    (1.) That in those of inferior manual education (whose two hands
were both untrained) the velocity is equal in both hands (3-4"/117 for
the right and 3-5"/117 for the left hand).
    (2.) That in those of average manual education the velocity is
greater in the right hand, which has been trained (as in writing)
than in the left, which has not (2 9"/U7 for the right and 3 6711 7
for the left hand), an exception being found in the case of the author,
both of whose hands had been pretty equally trained, in which case
both had the same velocity (3"/H7).
    (3.) That the velocity is greater in the right hand of those of
average education than in the right hand of those of inferior educa
tion.
    (4.) That the velocity in the left hand (which has been little
trained) of those of average education is practically identical with
that in the left hand of those of inferior education.
    The velocity of contraction of a single finger was next examined
with the following results : —
    (1.) That the velocity is equal, or nearly so (2"/117) in the first
and second fingers, and is greater than that in the third and fourth,
which have also a nearly equal velocity. This may be due to the
special arrangement of the tendon of the extensor communis digito-
mm for the third finger, and for the fourth to the awkward position
in which it was placed.
    (2.) The velocity of each finger is practically identical for the two
hands.

  1895.J    Muscular Movements ly certain new Instruments.             479
     (3.) That the velocity of the finger-movements is not appreciably
 affected by manual training.      The most rapid single contraction of
the fingers of a trained pianist is very slightly, or not all, faster than
that of a working man.
    (4.) The velocity of movements of flexion is on the average
 slightly greater than that of movements of extension, although in
 two of the eight cases examined the velocities were identical.
    (5.) The velocity of the finger-movements, as a whole, is greater
 than that of the pen-movements.
    In examining the more complicated movements of writing it was
 found : —
    (1.) That the average velocity is practically the same in musicians
and in those of average education, their training in this regard being
nearly equal.
    (2.) That the velocity in the untrained working-classes is much
 less than in the two former.
    (3.) That the velocity in all classes is much less than in the pen-
 movements.
    (4.) That the curved parts of letters and figures are more slowly
formed than the rectilinear parts, and that the velocity of a curve
varies, roughly speaking, with the radius of curvature.
    The difference, then, between edncation and the want of it is
 greatest in writing, less in pen-movements, and scarcely noticeable
in the simple finger-movement. And the average velocity for all
 classes is least in writing, much greater in pen-movements, and
 greatest in finger-movements.       The velocity therefore diminishes,
and the difference between the various classes increases as the move
ments become more complex.         The more nearly they approach to a
simple muscular contraction,      the  less is the difference noticeable;
though it would, doubtless, be found that the musician is able to
repeat a series of simple muscular contractions much more rapidly
than one with untrained fingers.
    The influence of age upon the velocity of the movements was next
investigated, and it was found, with regard to writing : —
    (1.) That the velocity of the movements of writing becomes slower
with advancing age.
    (2.) That it is greatest between the ages of 20 and 29, and decreases
with every decade thereafter.
    (3.) That this decrease is greater in the uneducated than the
educated.
    With regard to pen-movements it was found : —
    (1.) That the decrease in velocity is less marked than in the case
of writing.
    (2.) That the velocity is greatest between the ages of 20 and 29.
    (3.) That the difference in the rate of decrease between the

480          Analysis of Voluntary Muscular Movements.             [Mar. 21,
educated and uneducated classes       is not so marked as in the      case of
¦writing.
   With regard to finger-movements it was found that           they retained
nearly the same velocity for all classes between the ages of 20 and
 50 ; aDd that in the one case of a man over that age (a labourer,
set. 62) there was a decided decrease.
   In the two pathological cases investigated, one of lateral sclerosis
in a man of 41, and one of tremor of the hands, following upon
syphilis, in a man of 50, similar results were obtained.             For the
complex movements of writing were most seriously retarded, the
pen-movements less, and the finger-movements least of all.
   It appears, then, that as a movement increases in complexity, and
involves in its performance the associated action of a greater number
of muscles, its velocity diminishes, and the influence of education
becomes more distinctly manifest.           And as complex movements
require a longer education   for their  rapid performance, so they appear
to become sooner defective than the simpler movements.           For it is in
writing that the retarding effect of age is most apparent, while it is
least so in the finger-movement.
   In the second part of the investigation it was desired to obtain
tracings from a larger series of contractions than could be registered
upon a microscopic slide.      For this purpose new instruments were
required, and owing to the long delay in making these, but few
experiments have been recorded.          The instrument finally adopted
consisted in a long steel bar, held firmly in an iron clip, and carrying
in a clamp attached to one end a smoked glass plate 6 inches square.
It was set in motion by an electro-magnet through which passed the
current from a storage battery, and, as determined by the chrono
graph, it made fifty-four double vibrations per second.        At Professor
McKendrick's suggestion it was determined rather to investigate
with this instrument the phenomena of fatigue, a purpose for which
he thought it very suitable.       With this object, Mosso's ergograph
was adapted to the instrument, the recording part of which could be
pulled on rails slowly away from under the registering lever, which
worked up and down with the movement of the weighted finger.
Thus a series of contractions and relaxations, divided by the oscilla
tions of the bar into fifty-fourths of a second, was registered on each
plate. The plate could be taken out, and a new one substituted,
beneath the lever, without stopping the movement of the finger.            A
key was interposed in the circuit to shut off the current while the
plates were being changed.
   Four normal and two pathological cases were investigated, series
of tracings being taken with a     \ kilo., a 1 kilo., and a 2 kilo, weight.
They show in a very striking manner the diminution in height of
the contraction, and the coincident diminution in its velocity, due to

 fatigue.      The measurements which were taken of the rates of
 velocity at different parts of the tracings afford somewhat varying
 results, and the number of cases is too few for any definite conclu
 sions to be drawn from them.              But it would appear that while the
 diminution is gradual and uniform in the case of small weights, in
 that of larger weights it occurs, as a rule, more rapidly, and that
 the rate of diminution does not remain the same throughout the
 tracing.                              ,

      Movement       and Nutrition of the Limbs.             Preliminary Com
     munication."           By F. W. MOTT, M.D., F.R.C.P., and C.

    In  the 14th of the ' Lecons sur la Physiologie et la Pathologie du
 Systeme Nervenx,' Claude Bernard draws attention by experiments
on the frog and on puppies to the degree of impairment in movement                   y
undergone by a limb that has been rendered insensitive by section of
the sensory roots of its spinal nerves.
    In a series of experiments carried out during the last eighteen
months, we have examined the same thing in the monkey, using
chiefly Mamcns rhesus, and observing the animals for periods up tot/
four months from the time of operation.* We propose to give here a
brief account of the results obtained.
    Our experiments deal separately with the lower limb and with the
upper limb. The phenomena observed in the two limbs do not
essentially differ, but are rather more marked and much more acces
sible to examination in the case of the upper limb.

from the 4th cervical to the 4th thoracic inclusive ; in the lumbar
from the 2nd to the 10th post-thoracic inclusive.
    Trom the time of performance of the section onwards, as long as
the animal may be kept, the movements of the hand and foot are
practically abolished ; the movement of grasping, which is so fre
quent and useful to the monkey, both with the hand and foot, never
occurs at all in our experience. On the other hand, the movements
at the elbow and knee, and especially the movements at the shoulder
and hip, are much less impaired.               The fore limb hangs from the
shoulder partially flexed at the elbow ; the hind limb is flexed at hip

    and knee.    As the animal runs about it does not attempt to use the
    leg; the fore limb swings helplessly, with flexion at elbow and wrist
    and adduction at shoulder, in much the same position as if carried
    in a sling. The hind limb looks as if it were being held up so as to
    be kept off the ground while the animal runs on three legs ; we are
    inclined to think that this appearance is deceptive, and that the
    position results from an equilibrium of the action of the muscles, in
    which purposive action on the part of the animal does not play a
    rdle.  When the animal is allowed to climb a rope or the side of the
    cage, the fore limb swings more or less helplessly, and is not used fov
    the climbing ; similarly, the hind limb is kept more or less flexed at
    hip or knee, and is not used for the climbing.          If
                                                        the feeding-time be
     deferred, and an animal, in which the apaesthete* limb is an arm, be
     tested by offering it fruit after the sound arm has been secured
     behind the back, there is no attempt to use the apaesthete limb for
    reaching the food, but the neck is thrust forward in order for the
     mouth to seize it.  If the fruit be placed in the hand of the apaesthete
    arm, the animal does not lift the hand, and appears quite unable to
    do so, even though encouraged. If, however, the hands of a tame
    normal monkey be secured behind its back, and, as it lies on the floor,
    fruit be placed near     the fruit
                                it,      usually taken at once with the foot;

    but if the leg     isapaesthete the fruit cannot be taken, although
    in one monkey the attempt used to be made. The foot was rapidly
    thrust toward the fruit by extension of hip and knee, but the foot
    missed its object widely, i.e., by several inches, and the digits were
    not moved, though the ankle appeared to be slightly plantar-flexed.
    The impairment of motility in the limb ensues immediately upon
    completion of the section; that         to say, directly the effects of the
                                            is

    anaesthetic have passed off sufficiently to allow requisite examination
    of the animal's ability to move its limbs, the above-described
    inability is discoverable as fully developed as at any subsequent
    period. We have kept the animals alive for various periods up to
    and over three months, and there has been no obvious change in the
    condition, either in the direction of improvement or the reverse.
    In the case of the lower limb, after two or three months, the constant
    position of flexion of hip and knee, on two occasions, gradually
    induced a change in the muscles of the thigh, which prevented
    hip and knee being properly extended, even by passive stretching.
       As to the nature of the disturbance of motility in the limbs, one
    feature, namely, its peculiar topographical distribution,           salient
                                                                          is
    and constant. The defect in motility increases from the attached
    base to the free apex of the limb so that, for instance, while com-

  ankle, and greatest (amounting as regards volition to absolute loss)
 in the digits.
    In this respect it curiously closely simulates the impairment of
 motility ensuing upon ablation of the limb region of the cortex
 cerebri ; but it is, in the monkey, somewhat more severe than the
 impairment following cortical ablation.
    We find, however, that forcible and rapid movements, even of the
 fine joints at the end of the limb, can be induced in the animals by         .
                                 "
causing them to " struggle ; for instance, while recovering from
ether inhalation, or while trying to free themselves on being held
awkwardly, the whole limb at all its joints may exhibit movements ;
bat even under these circumstances it is only once or twice that we
have seen "graspiDg" movements of the digits, although sharp exten
sion of the digits is not nearly so infrequent.
    We are led from these and other considerations, which will be
detailed in a fuller paper, to conclude that associated movements in the
limb (" Mitbewegungen ") are comparatively little impaired by loss of
the sensation from the limb in which they occur ; but that the inde
pendent and more delicately-adjusted movements which employ pre
ponderantly the smaller and more individualised muscular masses
of the hand and foot, and serve to move the digits, especially the
hallux and the thumb — in fact, just those movements which are repre
sented most liberally in the limb area of the cortex, are extremely severely
impaired, and, in some instances, are abolished.
                                                                            '
                                                      We say ' abolished
advisedly, because we are persuaded from our observations that, in
the case of certain movements, e.g., grasping movements of the hand
and foot, opposition of pollex and hallux, the animal is rendered
absolutely powerless to perform them, even under the strongest
possible inducements.        This conclusion has been gradually forced
upon    us. Although    we  are aware of the danger of introducing terms
relating to consciousness into descriptions based almost solely on
motor reactions, we believe that we cannot more lucidly state the
condition of the animals than by saying that the volitional power for
grasping with the hand, <tc, had been absolutely abolished by the
local loss of all forms of sensibility experimentally produced. Further,
that this volitional power was lost immediately from the time of
operation, and that there was not the slightest evidence of any
recovery of it during the longest periods to which our observations
extended (about four months).
    This being so, it is natural to inquire what influence, if any, is
exerted by the section of the posterior spinal nerve-rpots of the limbs
upon the reactions obtainable from the limb area of the cortex 'i
That no diminution, but rather a slight increase of the excitability of
the cortex, is the immediate result has been shown by one of us

    previously.*     But the question remained, what will be the result
    when, for many weeks, the severance of the roots has led (as above
    shown) to disappearance from the limb of those very movements
    which the cortex, when experimentally excited, is especially able to
    produce ? We have answered this, both by electrically exciting the
    cortex and by giving absinthe intravenously to produce epilepsy
    (Magnan).      On exciting the cortex cerebri of the hemispheres in the
   appropriate regions for eliciting movements of the thumb, hallux, or
   digits, the responsive movements have been as easily elicited from the
   apfflsthete limb as from the normal limb, and it has several times
   seemed to us rather more easily, that is to say, with a slightly less
   intensity of faradic current (the rate of interruption always remain-
   the same,
      As to the absinthe epilepsy, it always affected the apaesthete
   limb in a manner not distinguishably different from the normal
   limb.     Convulsions sometimes started in the normal and desensi
   tized limb simultaneously, sometimes a little earlier in one or the
   other ; but no indubitable predominance or preference was shown by
   either limb.     In a very few of our experiments (three) no movement
   was obtained in the apaesthete limb on excitation of the cortex;
   this was found to be explained subsequently by naked-eye degenera
   tion of the pyramidal tract as revealed after hardening in Miller's
   fluid.   This degeneration was due to injury accidentally inflicted
   upon   the  lateral colnmn of the cord by the operation.                  The spinal
   tonus in the muscles of the apaesthete limb is undoubtedly much
   diminished.
      These observations seem to us to point to the profound difference
>
  existing between the production of the finer movements of the limb
  in volition on the one hand, and by experimental stimulation of the
  cortex on the other. The fundamental importance of sensation for
  those finer movements of the limb, which are so especially well repre
  sented in the cortex of the ape, has by no authority been more
  forcibly emphasized than by Dr. Bastian.                  We think these experi
  ments go even further than his arguments in pointing to the influence
  of sensation upon voluntary movement, inasmuch as they indicate
  that not only the cortex, but the whole sensory path from periphery
  to cortex cerebri, is in action during voluntary movement.

      This is the case even when the largest and most important sensory

    root of the series   is chosen for section ; namely, in the upper limb
    the  8th cervical, and in the lower limb the 6th post- thoracic. (These
    are the nerves that supply the skin over the whole of the hand and
   foot respectively.     It is to be remembered, however, that hand and
   foot respectively are each of them supplied with sensation by at least
   three sensory roots, the middle root covering the whole surface in
   each case.)
       We attribute the fact that section of these large roots with their
   wide distribution over hand and foot produces so little appreciable
   effect, to the fact that the distribution of all the spinal nerves in the 1/
   skin is an overlapping one.         The extent of overlapping is great
   enough to prevent the section of any one nerve, even of the largest,
   producing actual anaesthesia of the skin in any part.
       We further find that even if a field of absolute anaesthesia be
   actually produced by section, for instance, of the 7th, 8th, and 9th
   post-thoracic roots, or, in some cases, by section of the 7th and 8th ,
   cervical and 1st and 2nd thoracic roots, the impairment of move
   ment resulting in the limb is comparatively slight.             This is the
  more remarkable when the region deprived of sensibility includes
  some of the most highly sensitive parts in the limb, namely, those of
  the   palm.
      In such  a case the   retention of sensibility, although in an impaired
  degree, by the radial side of the palm, including pollex, is the cause,
  in our opinion, of the remarkable quantity and quality of movements          •
  still executed by the limb in spite of that impairment.         In the case
 of section of the 7th, 8th, and 9th post-thoracic sensory roots, it was
 almost impossible, even on the closest examination, to detect any
 defect of movement whatever ; the animal used both its feet appa
 rently equally well in climbing or running, there was no clumsiness
 in picking up small objects (as a kernel) with the foot, and no
 hesitation in so doing.          The chief detectable muscular difference
 between the limbs was that the knee-jerk was more brisk upon the
 operated side, and the calf and ham and back of the thigh were very
deficient in sensation.
      In the case of section of the sensory roots of the 7th and 8th
 cervical and 1st and 2nd thoracic, besides the ulnar border of the arm,
the hand, with the exception of the thumb and radial side of . index, is
also quite insensitive ; and the sensitiveness of the skin of the thumb
and index, where present, is below normal in degree.                Neverthe
less, although impairment of movement (especially clumsiness) is
obvious, yet the condition is strikingly different to that obtaining
afteT the wholo series of roots has been cut through.                 Food is
easily taken up from the hand and picked up from the floor with the

    move the limb, described at the outset of this communication,                   is
    obtained in (as far as we can see) its full extent. This result has its
    converse in the following, which we have also noted —         :
       (3.) Effect     ofSection  of  the whole Series of   Sensory Moots belonging
    to a Limb, with the exception      of   a Boot that supplies the Sand or Foot.
    —    Ifthe sensory roots of the whole series of the spinal nerves
    belonging to   a  limb be severed, with the single exception of,           in the
    upper   limb,  the   8th   cervical   (distributed  to the  whole extent   of the
\/ hand), and in the lower limb the 6th post-thoracic (distributed to the
    whole extent of the foot),    a   certain degree of impairment of movement
    of the limb results, which appears rather as weakness than clumsi
    ness, but the degree of impairment         is   altogether quite slight. The
    Jimb     used freely for progression, for climbing, for picking up food,
              is

    hand      easier to detach from the cage than that of the hand of the
              is
   normal side.
       The question naturally arises whether in the interruption of the
   paths of afferent impulses these can be so dissociated as to decide what
   share the muscular sense takes in the results observed             ? The afferent
   nerve fibres from muscles per se run, in every case in which they have
   been examined, in the corresponding spinal roots to the motor.                   It
    is possible, therefore, in the hand and foot to sever the sensory roots
   supplying the muscles, while only partially interfering with those
   supplying other structures — the skin, sheaths of tendons, joints, Ac.
   The converse         also true.
                       is              On leaving intact the afferent fibres from
   muscle for the greater part, but interrupting all other afferent channels,
   we find that the defect of movement produced           is nevertheless extreme,
   as, for instance, when the lowest four cervical and the first thoracic
   roots are severed.       In the same way, when the 5th, 6th, and 7th post-
   thoracic   roots  are   divided,   the sole of the foot  is   apaesthete, and the
   defect in movement        is extreme, although the afferent fibres from the
  plantar muscles remain to a large extent intact.
      Conversely, when the 7th, 8th, and 9th post-thoracic roots are
  severed, the afferent fibres from the plantar muscles are completely
  interrupted, but the sole of the foot remains sensitive all over, owing
  to the 6th and 5th roots.         In this case (and we have two instances         of
  the kind), the defect of movement, if       it   exists at all,is not appreciable.

   It must be remembered that other deeper structures are innervated
by the same nerves as the skin, and these we do not wish to dissociate
from the sensory channels still uninjured after interruption of all
afferent tracts from the muscle itself.
                                II.    On Nutrition.
   In   the experiments upon the lower limb we were at first led to
suspect that section of the sensory roots caused trophic changes in
the skin of the foot. After a time, varying from three weeks to three
months, an ulcer appeared over the outer malleolus ; the subsequent
experiments on the upper limb, which never led to such a change,
show, in our opinion, that the apparent trophic change in the lower limb
may more justly be attributed to the liability to pressure and microbic
infection.    No change in the hand was ever noticed which in the least
indicated trophic disturbance. Wounds accidentally inflicted by the
animal itself or its companions on the apoesthete part healed readily
when dressed.
   As to the condition of the muscles in the apaesthete limb, which
were themselves removed from all afferent connection with the central
nervous system, the following points were noticed : —
   There was a certain degree of wasting, but no appreciable altera
tion of colour ; and the muscles responded readily to the excitation of
their motor nerves. In some instances it was found that on excitation
of their motor nerves, after somatic death, muscular contractions were
evoked for a longer period than on the normal side.                       The time of
onset of rigor mortis was delayed in the apaesthete muscles, as one of
us has already noted in the cat.*
           III.  Preliminary Note       on the Degenerations      observed.
   It is of interest to remark that the bulk, if not all, the fibres of
Goll's column are derived from those sensory roots which contribute
to the innervation of the lower limb.              Certain of the sensory fibres
innervating the limb enter,         therefore,    into   the formation of a path
leading directly to the cortex by the posterior column nuclei, the fillet,
and the optic thalamus.
   On the other hand, section of a short series of five dorsal and upper
lumbar roots produced no appreciable degeneration in Goll's column.
This appears to us a most suggestive fact, because the fibres from the
limb thus entering Goll's column contribute to a path which leads via
Goll's nucleus and the fillet to the opposite optic thalamus and cortex
of the central convolutions.            But the fibres from the roots above
those entering the limb not contributing to Goll's column, their

  upward path must be via grey matter, and probably subsequently by
  one of the cerebellar tracts to the cerebellum.
     In the cases of section of the brachial and upper thoracic posterior
  roots no degenerated fibres go into Goll's column, nor into Goll's
  nucleus, but there is very extensive degeneration of Burdach's nucleus.
  The upward path from the arm resembles therefore that of the leg in
  respect to its upward projection toward the cortex.
    One of the chief results to which, in conclusion, we wish to draw
 attention is the following : — That afferent impulses, both from the
  skin and from the muscles, especially the former, as related to the
                                                         " highest level "
  palm and sole, are necessary for the carrying out of
  movements.
    It may be argued against this assertion that in animals it is impos
 sible to obtain definite information as to whether the animal can not
 or will not perform the movements the absence of which has been
 described.
    From observations on tame animals we are, however, ourselves
 firmly convinced that there exists actual inability to perform the
 movements in question. The reasons for this belief will be detailed
 in our fuller paper.
 IX.   u On the Development of the Branches of the Fifth Cranial
       Nerve in Man."       By A. Francis Dixon, B.A., M.B., Chief
       Demonstrator of Anatomy, Trinity College, Dublin. Com
       municated by Professor D. J. Cunningham, F.R.S. Received
       February   22, 1895.
                                 (Abstract.)
    The investigation,   the general  results of which are summarised
below, was suggested to the author by Professor His, and part of the
work was carried on in his laboratory in Leipzig in the summer of
1893.    Models were constructed of the cranial nerves in embryos of
different ages, and the branches presont noted and measured.       These
models were made up of glass plates, covered with varnish, on which
were drawn the outlines of the sections and the positions of the nerves,
&c.    Detailed descriptions of the fifth nerve branches are given for
five different stages of the human embryo, beginning with an embryo
of four weeks, at which time merely the three main divisions of the
nerve are represented, and ending with one of the eighth week.
The observations on the human embryo have been checked by farther
observations on rat embryos, and an almost complete correspondence
between the two has been made out.

 1895.]      Branches  of the Fifth Cranial Nerve in Man.           489
   1. Before the ophthalmic nerve is present in the embryo, a cellular
cord stretches upwards and forwards from the Gasserian ganglion,
and occupies the place of the future nerve. This is easily demon
strated in the rat, and a similar condition appears to prevail in the
human embryo.
   2.  Axis-cylinder processes grow out from the cells of the Gasserian
ganglion into this cellular cord, and in this manner the ophthalmic
nerve is formed.
   3. The axis-cylinder processes increase in number, while the cells
of the original cord become fewer and at the same time become
disposed around the developing nerve.
   4. The first formed ophthalmic trunk corresponds to the nasal
nerve of the adult. .
   5. The frontal nerve is formed later, and the proximal part in man
is united in a common trunk with the proximal part of the nasal
nerve ; in the rat, however, the nerves in the first instance take
separate origin from the Gasserian ganglion.
   6. In mammals no outlying part of the Gasserian ganglion is
present as a ganglion, either for the ophthalmic or nasal nerve, in the
sense of a ganglion of a posterior nerve-root.
   7. A single undivided Gasserian ganglion gives rise to all three
divisions of the fifth nerve.
   8. In the beginning of the sixth week all the important branches of
the ophthalmic nerve of the adult are represented in the embryo.
   9. The fourth and frontal nerves are from an early period closely
connected.
   10. The ciliary ganglion is first recognisable as a distinct cellular
mass at the beginning of the sixth week.
   11. The ciliary ganglion appears, in the first instance, to be more
closely connected with the frontal and fourth nerves than with the
nasal and third nerves.
   12. Later this ganglion shifts its position, and in the eighth week
it has established the connections and assumed the situation that
obtains in the adult.
   ] 3. The ciliary ganglion can in no sense be the bomologue of a
spinal ganglion.
   14. The superior     maxillary nerve appears as an independent
branch of the Gasserian ganglion in the embryo of four weeks.
   15. Soon the fibres of the superior maxillary nerve spread out
horizontally, and are not collected so compactly into a single bundle
as are the fibres of the other two divisions of the fifth nerve.
   16. All the important branches of the superior maxillary are
present in an embryo of seven weeks.
   17. Meckel's ganglion is present as a distinct cellular mass at the
beginning of the sixth week.

    18. Meckel's   ganglion in the embryo is closely connected with   the
 otio ganglion.
    19. The inferior maxillary nerve is at first unbranched.
    20. The first formed part of the inferior maxillary represents    the
 inferior dental of the adult.
    21. The lingual nerve is formed later, and is still very small in the
fifth week.
    22. Meckel's cartilage presents a close relation to the branches of
 the inferior maxillary nerve, and seems to determine the directions
which they take.
    23.  All the important branches of the inferior maxillary nerve are
 represented in the embryo at the beginning of the sixth week.
    24. At the beginning of the sixth week the otic and submaxillary
 ganglia are present.
    25. The chorda-tympani, the Vidian, and the nerve of Jacobson
are not branches of the fifth nerve, inasmuch as they are not developed
from it.
    26. The chorda-tympani and Vidian nerves are branches of the
 facial, being developmentally derived from this nerve ; the nerve of
Jacobbon is in like manner a branch of the glossopharyngeal.
    27. The origin of these nerves in man is precisely similar to that of
tho corresponding nerves in the rat.
    28. There is no direct evidence to prove that the cells of the
accessory ganglia of the fifth nerve are derived directly from the cells
of the Gasserian ganglion.
    29. The sympathetic associated with the carotid artery in         the
adult is represented in the embryo by fibres chiefly derived from     the
trunk ganglion of the vagus nerve.
X. "Is Argon contained in Vegetable or Animal Substances?"
       By G¦orge W. MacUonald, M.Sc., and Alex. M. Kellas,
       B.Sc.    Communicated by Professor           William     RamsaT,
       F.R.S.    Received March 19, 1895.
   At Professor Ramsay's suggestion, experiments were        undertaken
to see whether argon could be obtained from nitrogenous vegetables
or from animal    tissues.
   Method : — A   few grams of the substance, after  drying if necessary,
were ground to    a fine powder, desiccated at 110° C, until the weight
was constant,     and   a  nitrogen estimation performed by Dumas'
method.      It was supposed that any argon compound would be
decomposed, when the argon vvould come off along with the nitrogen.
The gas was collected in a nitrometer over well-boiled concentrated

  1895.J     Is   there Argon in Vegetable or Animal Substances?             491
 potash    solution, whence it was transferred to a small gasholder
  containing water which had been boiled for some hours.                The gas
 holder was connected with an apparatus similar in general arrange
 ment to that used by Professor Ramsay in July last, which enabled
  the gas to be dried and purified from hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide
 or hydrogen, the nitrogen being absorbed by being passed and
 repassed over magnesium turnings kept at a temperature of about
 600° C.      A three-way stopcock enabled the magnesium tube and the
 purifying and drying tubes adjoining it to be connected either with
 the second gasholder or with a
                                        "
                                           Sprengel," so that any residual gas
 could be pumped off, and the tubes exhausted before admitting the
 gas.    The gas pumped off was collected in a piece of hard glass
 tubing ; it was then mixed with oxygen prepared by heating potas
 sium permanganate, and sparked down until no further diminution
 of volume occurred, when excess of oxygen was known to be present.
 The remaining gas was transferred by a gas pipette to a tube standing
 over mercury, and the oxygen                present absorbed by potassium
 pyrogallate solution.      Only one experiment was carried through to
the end in each case as the results seemed conclusive, although
several determinations of nitrogen were made.
    Peas were selected as a typical vegetable, and the following is a
summary of the results : —
              Weight of        Volume of nitrogen        Weight   Percentage of
  Eipt.   desiccated peas    collected (corrected for       of     nitrogen in
                 taken.          temp, and press.).     nitrogen.  dried peas.
                grains.                 c.c.              gram.

                8 "9455                466-8             0-5856        6-55
    342 c.c.  of the volume collected in the first experiment (which was
done in two parts) was passed over the heated magnesium until so
much nitrogen was absorbed that both gasholders were full of water,
and the residue was then left for about 12 minutes in the tubes, the
magnesium being kept heated so that absorption of nitrogen might
continue.         On connecting with the pump, a pressure of about
2 in. was registered, and the volume of gas pumped off had a
volume of nearly 8 c.c. After sparking down with excess of oxygen
6-8 c.c. of gas was left, and on absorbing by a strong solution of
potassium pyrogallate (stronger than Hempel recommends for com
plete absorption) 0'12 c.c. of gas remained, which is less than 0-04
per cent, of the volume taken. To see if this bubble of gas consisted
of carbon monoxide, two experiments were performed with the oxygen

492     Is there  Argon in Vegetable or A nimal Substances t              [Mar. 21,
used  :  9 c.c. gave 0-2 c.c. residue, and     11 -2 c.c. gave 0-25 c.c. residue,
with about the same strength         of pyrogallate.
   As the quantity of oxygen used in sparking down was over 20 c.c.
it might safely be concluded that there is no appreciable quantity of
argon in peas (or at least that the argon cannot be obtained with
the nitrogen by Dumas' method).
   The experiment with regard to the presence of argon in animal
tissues was also negative in its results. Mice were selected for the
experiment, because the nitrogen from the whole animal could be
conveniently collected by Dumas' method. The crucial experiment
was carried out      in the same way as before.
   From three mice 550 c.c. of nitrogen was obtained.                      This was
absorbed by heated magnesium as usual, but the residual gas was
loft for over an hour in the tnbes after the gasholders had been
emptied, so that on connecting up with the pump only a few mm.
of pressure was registered, and the total gas pumped off occupied
about 1 c.c. After sparking down with large excess of oxygen
about 10 c.c. remained, which gave a residue of 0-2 c.c. with alkaline
pyrogallate, which would be abont 0"036 per cent, of the volume
taken.
   Very careful experiments were undertaken to determine the ¦xact
percentage of nitrogen contained in mice, as the volume from the
first experiments seemed too high.            Two experiments with complete
 mice gave the following results      : —
                                Percentage of water        Percentage of nitrogen
           Weight of mouse.        lost at 110° C.          in desiccated animal.

    A Kjeldahl     determination    of the nitrogen in a small quantity of
 mouse    A, by Mr. Frye,    gave  9"6  per cent., so that the high percentage
 seems confirmed.
    The Society then adjourned over the Easter Recess to Thursday,

Report     of   the Incorporated Kew Committee            for   the  Year
                     ending December 31, 1894.
   The operations of The Kew Observatory, in the Old Deer Park,
Richmond, Surrey, are controlled by the Incorporated Kew Committee,
which is constituted as follows : —
                         Mr. F. Galton, Chairman.
   Captain  W. de W. Abney, C.B.,      Mr. R. H. Scott.
      R.B.                             Mr. W. N. Shaw.
   Prof. W. G. Adams.                  Lieutenant-General    R.  Strachey,
   Captain E. W. Creak, R.N.              C.S.I.
   Prof. G. C. Foster.                 General   J. T. Walker, C.B.
   The Earl of Rosse, K.P.             R-ar- Admiral W. J. L. Wharton.
   Prof. A. W. Riicker.
   The Committee much regret the loss of the services of Admiral
Sir G. H. Richards, K.C.B., formerly Hydrographer to the Admi
ralty, who has found it necessary to retire, after having served on
the Committee from the date, 1871, when the Royal Society under
took the administration of the Observatory.
   The vacancy thus occasioned has been filled by the appointment of
Mr. W. N. Shaw, Tutor of Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and Univer-
uity Lecturer in Physics.
   The work at the Observatory may be considered under the fol
lowing heads: —
   1st.  Magnetic observations.
   2nd.  Meteorological observations.
   3rd.  Solar observations.
   4th.  Experimental, in connexion with any of the above departments.
   •5th. Verification of instruments.
   6th.  Rating of Watches and Marine Chronometers.
    7th. Miscellaneous.
                        I. Magnetic Observations.
   No change of importance has been made in the magnetographs
during the past year. The curves representing the Declination, Hori

   zontftl Force, and Vertical Force variations have been obtained unin
   terruptedly, and, as in former years, the scale values of all the
  instruments were determined in January.
      The ordinates of the various photographic curves were then found
  to be as follows : —
             Declinometer   : 1 inch  =   0° 22'-04.   1 cm. =  0° 8'7.
     Bifilar, January 17, 1894, for   1  inch eH   = 0-0280 foot  grain unit.
                                   „  1    cm. „   = 0 00051   C.G.S. unit.
     Balance,  January 16, 1894, for  1   inch cV=   0  0287 foot grain unit.
                                   „  1   cm.    „ = 0  00052 C.G.S. unit.
      In the case of the balance magnetometer it was found necessary to
  re-adjust the instrument, and as at the same time its sensibility was
  slightly altered, the scale value was again determined with the
 following result    : —
    Balance, January 23, 1894, for      1   inch eV= 0 0276 foot grain unit.
                                    „   1    cm.  „ = 0 00050 C.G.S. unit.
     As regards magnetic disturbances, the most marked occurred on
 July 20 and August 20, though on the following dates the instru
 ments were a good deal disturbed           : —
     January 3—4, February 21, 23—25, and 28, March 30—31, April
 17—18, June 10, September 14—15, 19—20, and November 13.
     An examination of the photographic curves of April 27 and
 .Inly 10, made at the request of Mr. C. Davison, showed slight move
 ments in the horizontal force magnet, and smaller ones in the declina
 tion magnet.       These movements wero associated by Mr. Davison
 ('B.A. Report' for 1894, p. 151, and 'Nature,' vol. 50, pp. 450—451)
with the Greek and Constantinople earthquakes of the same dates.
 Similar examinations have since been made on one or two occasions
at the instance of Mr. Davison, and of Professor Tacchini, Officio
Centrale di Meteorologia, Rome, but with negative results.
     The hourly means and diurnal range of the magnetic elements for
 1894, for the quiet days selected by tho Astronomer Royal, will be
found in Appendix I.
     Tho following are the mean results for the entire year : —
        Mean Westerly Declination                    17° 23' 0
        Mean Horizontal Force                        0-18251   C.G.S. unit.
        Mean Inclination                             67° 26'-0
        Mean Vertical Force                          0 43914  C.G.S. unit.
     A   somewhat improved method has been adopted for standardising
the curves from the vertical force magnetograph. This introduces
                                                         "
no change in the tables of " Diurnal Ranges                in the case either of

502                  Report of the Kew Committee.
the Vertical Force or Inclination, but slightly affects the absolute
values of the " Hourly Means."     If the method previously in use Lad
been followed, the mean results for the year would have been
          Inclination                    67° 25' 0
          Vertical Force                 0-43881   C.G.S. unit.
   The observations of absolute declination, horizontal intensity, and
inclination have been made weekly during the year.
   A table of recent values of the magnetic elements at the Obser
vatories whose publications are received at Kew was communicated
to the July number of ' Science Progress,' and it is intended to con
tribute similar tables to the same magazine in future years. It is
hoped in this way to render magnetic data more generally accessible
to investigators than they have been hitherto.
   Mr. Armitage, of the Jackson-Harmsworth Polar Expedition,
was given a short course of instruction in the nse of magnetic
instruments immediately prior to the departure of the expedition in
July. A unifilar magnetometer and a dip-circle were lent to the
expedition on the condition of their being returned within a specified
time.
   Captain Lyons, R.E., practised for a few days the taking of mag
netic observations previous to his departure for Egypt, and Captain
Schiick, of Hamburg, made a few comparisons of his instruments.
   Mr. W. Watson, of the South Kensington School of Science, was,
at the request of Professor Riieker, afforded facilities for making
some comparisons of different magnetic instruments in the Experi
mental Magnetic House.
                   II. Meteorological   Observations.
   The several self-recording instruments for the continuous registra
tion of Atmospheric Pressure, Temperature of Air and Wet-bulb,
Wind (direction and velocity), Bright Sunshine, and Rain, have been
maintained in regular operation throughout the year, and the
standard eye observations for the control of the automatic records
duly registered.
   The tabulations of the meteorological traces have been regularly
made, and these, as well as copies of the eye observations, with
notes of weather, cloud, and sunshine, have been transmitted, as usual,
to the Meteorological Office.
   With the sanction of the Meteorological Council, data have been
supplied to the Council of the Royal Meteorological Society, the
Institute of Mining Engineers, the editor of ' Symons's Monthly
Meteorological Magazine,' Dr. Rowland, and others.

    Anemograph. — Early in the year a new "worm          spindle was fitted
to the direction fans, and the square-headed pricker was replaced
by a round one, made of extra hardened steel.            At the same time
the direction pencil was

    Barograph. — The analysis of the value of the residual corrections
mentioned in last Report showed that a re-determination of the
barograph scale was expedient. This was carried out at the Meteoro
logical Office, and showed that the old value of l-569 inches in the
curve ordinates to 1 inch of pressure should be replaced by P553
inches. The new value has been employed since January 1 , and the
irregularities of the residuals have been much less marked from that
date.
    Electrograph. — This instrument has been in regular action during the
year, with the exception of about eleven days in January and nineteen
days in August, and its general performance has been satisfactory.
Advantage was taken of the frost in January to dismount the whole
of the instrument, to remove the old acid in the jar and insulators,
and give the apparatus a general overhauling.
    At the same time the scale was slightly opened out. The suspen
 sion thread was accidentally broken on August 16, but it was replaced,
 and the instrument re-started on September 4.
    Determinations     of the scale value were made on March 30,
June 26,- and December 27 by direct comparison with the Portable
Electrometer, White No. 53.
    The value of the scale divisions of this latter instrument was
 kindly determined by Professor Carey Foster at University College
 Laboratory during February, and the value for one division found to
 lie between 197 — 205 volts.       These experiments confirmed the scale
 value heretofore employed, yiz., 1 scale division = 200 volts.
    Inspections. — In compliance with the request of the Meteorological
 Council, the following Observatories and Anemograph              Stations
                                 —
 were visited and inspected : Aberdeen and Glasgow, by Mr. Chree ;
 Stonyhurst, Armagh, Fort William, Valencia, Deerness (Orkney),
 Fleetwood, and Dublin, by Mr. Baker; and Oxford, Falmouth,
 Aluwick Castlo, North Shields, and Yarmouth, by Mr. Constable.
                          III.  Solar Observations.
     Sun-spots. — Sketches of Sun-spots have been made on 156 days, and
 the groups numbered, after Schwabe's method.
     Particulars will be found in Appendix II, Table IV.
     Time Signals. — These have been regularly received from Greenwich
 through the G.P.O., with the exception of a few days, on which
 occasions supplementary signals were transmitted at later hours.

504                   Report of the Kew Committee.
                         IV. Experimental Work.
   Fog and Mist. — The observations of a series of distant objects,
referred to in the last Report, have been continued.   A note is taken
of the most distant of the selected objects which is risible at each
observation hour. An analysis of the results for the period May,
1892, to December, 1893, has been prepared and forwarded to the
Meteorological Council.
   Electrical Anemograph. — At the instance of the Meteorological
Council the electrical anemograph referred to in the Report for
1890, with an improved arrangement for recording wind direction,
has been under    trial for some months.
   Atmospheric Electricity. — To throw light on the results obtained
with Lord Kelvin's water-dropper, a series of observations have
recently been made for the Meteorological Office on the distribution
of electric potential in the neighbourhood of the Observatory.
   Aneroid Barometers. — A grant of £30 has been obtained from the
Government Grant Committee for the purpose of conducting a research
on the behaviour      of aneroid barometers. The work of constructing
the air pump and other apparatus required was entrusted to Mr. J.
Hicks.      He has unfortunately experienced considerable mechanical
difficulties, which have delayed the construction of the apparatus.
It is hoped, however, that it will be ready for use at an early date.
   Thermometry. — Experiments are proceeding with a view to facili
tate, and put on a more certain basis, the " time-test " in clinical
thermometers — i.e., the measurement of the time required by a
thermometer to record the temperature of the body.
   A sub-committee is now considering the question of the degree of
accuracy to be aimed at in the comparison of thermometers, the
form and construction of Kew Standards, and the advisability of
supplying on the certificate forms fuller information than is given at
present.
   Lens Testing. — A large number of experiments have been made for
the purpose of devising a photographic object for the definition test
of lenses, which will supply more certain results than those hitherto
obtained. A photographic object, reduced by Messrs. Morgan and
Kidd, has given some fairly satisfactory results ; but it is hoped a
still further improvement may be effected by means of an         object,
suggested by Major Darwin, which is about to be constructed.
                     V. Verification of Instruments.
   The subjoined is a list of the instruments examined in the      year
1894, with the corresponding results for 1893 : —

50(5                  R¦port  of the Kew  Committee.
   3 Standard Thermometers have been supplied during the year.
   There were at the end of the year in the Observatory undergoing
verification, 74 Barometers, 595 Thermometers, 9 Sextants, 3 Hydro
meters, 2 Anemometers, and 3 Unifilar Magnetometers.
              VI.  Rating of Watches and Chronometers.
   As was anticipated in last Report, the number of watches entered
for the class B and C tests has been much reduced.
   Those, however, entered for the higher test, class A, have been
fully up to the average in number, and decidedly above the average
in quality, the movements obtaining the highest grade of certificate,
the class   A, especially good, being considerably in      excess of any
previous year.
   The 737 watches received were entered for trial as below : —
   For class A, 378 ; class B, 183 ; class C, 166 ; and 10 for the subsi
diary trial. Of these 7 passed the subsidiary test, 151 failed from
various causes to gain any certificate; 115 were awarded class C
certificates, 179 class B, and 285 class A; of the latter, 46 obtained
the highest form of certificate, class A, especially good.
   In Appendix    III  will be found a table giving the results of trial
of the 46 watches which gained the highest number of marks during
the year. The first place was taken by Messrs. Baume and Co.,
London, with a keyless, going-barrel, chronometer- watch, No. 103,025,
with the " Tourbillon " escapement, which obtained 88"8 marks ont of
a maximum of 100.
   The best performance of lever watches during the year was that of
No. 52,882 by A. E. Fridlander, Coventry, which gained 87"3 marks.
   The high position gained for several years past by Tourbillon
watches has led to increased interest being taken by English manu
facturers in this escapement, and some new forms and modifications
have been devised.
   Of these, one of the most successful at present appears to be that
known as the " Karrusel."        Specimens of this form have been sent
for the A trial by different firms, and given excellent results,
examples of which will be found in the list given in Appendix III.
   Non-Magnetic Watches. — Fifteen watches thus designated have been
examined during the year, both as to their ordinary time-keeping and
also as to their
                  " non-magnetic " properties, and although the trial
to which they are submitted is severe, in the majority of cases the
watches were found to perform very satisfactorily.
   Marine Chronometers. — The second trial of chronometers on the
Greenwich plan, mentioned in last Report, was finished in April.
Of the 12 entered, 1 was withdrawn, and 8 of the remainder attained
the limit prescribed by the Italian Government.        A similar trial for
the Portuguese Government was carried out from June to December.

                        Report of the Kew Committee.                   507
  A brief summary of the performance of the chronometers is given in
 Table   III, Appendix III.
    During the year 21 chronometers have been entered for the Kew A
 trial, of which 11 were certificated, 1 failed to pass, and 9 are still
 under examination.
                            VII.  Miscellaneous.
    Lens Testing.  — During the year 27 lenses have been tested ; of these
 7 received     class A and 20 class B certificates.           Some of the
 recent forms of Jena glass    lenses  have been  under  trial.  With these
 there appears to be a superposition of two curvatures in opposite
 directions, one predominating near the centre, the other at the edge of
 the field. The resultant curvature is generally unusually small near the
 centre and over the greater portion of the field, but in some instances
 at least it increases   rapidly near the edge of the field, and special
 attention should    be paid to the size of stop to secure the best results.
    Paper. — Prepared photographic paper has been procured and sup
 plied to the Observatories at Aberdeen, Oxford, Stonyhurst, Lisbon,
 Mauritius, St. Petersburg, and through the Meteorological Office to
 Batavia,    Fort William and Valencia.
    Anemograph      and rain sheets and sunshine cards have been supplied
 to the Hong Kong and Mauritius Observatories, and blank forms for
 the entry of magnetic observations to the Science and Art Depart
 ment, London, the India Office, the Jackson-Harms worth Polar
 Expedition,    and Captain Lyons, R.E.
    Exhibition of Cloud Photographs. — Some specimens of cloud and
 other photographs and lantern slides wero shown by the Committee
at the Royal Meteorological Society's Exhibition in April.
    Pendulum Observations.
                              — In December Mr. E. P. J. Love, of Mel
bourne, at the request of Mr. Ellery, was given the use of the sextant
testing room for a few days for the purpose of swinging a set of
half-second pendulums on the spot where observations were taken by
Major von Sterneck in April, 1893.
    House, Grounds, and Path. — The negotiations with Her Majesty's
Office of Woods and Forests, referred to in last year's Report, have
led to an increase of 5 acres in the area of the Old Deer Park leased
by the Committee.        The new lease contained the condition that the
entire holding should be enclosed in a substantial fence.           Au oak
park paling has accordingly been erected at a cost of rather more
than £350.       This expense, however, together with that of continuing
the existing roadway from Fuller's Gate, through the new holding,
has been wholly met by a gift of £400 made for the purpose by Mr.
F. Galton.
    Library. — During the year the library has received publications
from —

508                   Report of the Kew     Committee.
  34 Scientific    Societies and   Institutions    of  Great  Britain  and
         Ireland.
   113   Foreign and Colonial    Scientific   Establishments,  as well   as
         from several private individuals.
   Early in the year the library received from the Royal Society of
Edinburgh a present of its Proceedings and Transactions from 1882,
thus completing the series from 1867.       These books, as well as several
others, have been bound. The Konigliche Preussische Akademie der
Wissenschaften, Berlin, have kindly consented to forward periodically
the mathematical and physical numbers of their Sitzungsberichte.
The Meteorological Office presented several copies of meteorological
publications of which they had duplicates.          Lady Lefroy also pre
sented some books belonging to the late Sir J. Heury Lefroy.
   Back numbers of the Kew Reports have been sent to several
institutions at the request of their respective directors, and some new
names have been placed on the distribution list.
   The card catalogue has been proceeded with, 200 cards having been
entered during the past year.
   Loan Repaid. — The Kew Committee have repaid the Royal Society
the final instalment of the £400 advanced by them in 1893 to defray
the cost of the new building.
   Audit, tyc. — An audit of the Observatory accounts for 1893 was
carried out in May, 1894, by Mr. Keen, Chartered Accountant, on
behalf of the Royal Society. In consequence of his suggestions, some
changes have been introduced in the system of book-keeping.
   The accounts of 1894 have been audited by Mr. Keen on hehalf of
the Royal Society, and by General J. T. Walker on behalf of the
Committee.
   The balance sheet, with a comparison of the expenditure for the
two years 1893 and 1S94, is appended.
                         Personal Establishment.
   The staff employed is as follows : —

                 Magnetical Observations,         1894.
Made at the Kew Observatory, Richmond, Lat. 51° 28' 6"
   N. and Long.      0h lm 15"-1   W.
  The results given in the following tables are deduced from the
magnetograph curves which have been standardised by observations
of deflection and vibration.   These were made with the Collimator
Magnet K.C. I. and the Declinometer Magnet marked K.O. 90 in the
9-inch Unifilar Magnetometer by Jones.
  The Inclination was observed with the Inclinometer by Barrow,
No. 33, and needles 1 and 2, which are 3£ inches in length.
  The Declination and Force values given in Tables        I to  VIII  are
prepared  in accordance  with the suggestions  made  in the  fifth report
of the Committee of the British Association on comparing and
reducing Magnetic Observations.
  The following is a list of the days during the year 1894 which
were selected by the Astronomer Royal, as suitable for the deter
mination of the magnetic diurnal variations, and which have been
employed in the preparation of the magnetic tables : —

 Report of Magnetical Observations at Falmouth Observatory
       for the Year 1894. Latitude 50° 9' 0" N. and Longitude
                 '
       5° 4' 35 W. ; height, 167 feet above mean sea-level.
    These observations have been made by instruments purchased from
 the Government Grant Fund administered by the Royal Society.
    The Observatory having been comparatively recently established,
 the Vertical Force self-recording instrument is not yet in thorough
 working order. It is hoped in future to publish complete records of
 all three elements.
    Photographic curves of Magnetic Declination and of Horizontal
 Force variations have been taken regularly throughout the past year,
 and the magnets have worked satisfactorily.
    The scale values of the instruments were determined on 1st
January, 1895. The following values of the ordinates of the photo
graphic curves were then found : —
      Declination, 1 cm. = 0° 11'" 7.
      Bifilar, for 1 cm. S H., = 0-00050 C.G.S. unit.
   The principal magnetic disturbances recorded during the year
occurred on the following dates : — January 4, February 21, 23, 24,
25, March 30, 31, April 17, June 10, July 20, August 20, and
 September 14, 15.
   Observations with the Absolute         Instruments have     been made
monthly, of which the following is a summary : —
         Determinations of Horizontal Intensity, 35.
                   „         Inclination,          34 sets of four.
                   „         absolute Declination, 36.
   Following the method adopted in the three previous years, it         is
intended that the observations be reduced, and that the Declination
and Horizontal Force curves for five quiet days in each month of the
year — selected by the Astronomer Royal — be tabulated and prepared
for publication, in accordance with the International scheme. The
results will be printed in the Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society's
 Annual Report, and also in the " Proceedings " of the Royal Society.
   The following are the principal results of the magnetic       elements
for the year 1894 : —
         Mean Westerly Declination, 19° 0'-8.
         Mean Inclination,             67° 2'-4.
         Mean Horizontal Force,        0-18511 C.G.S. unit.
   The Declination and Horizontal Force are deduced from hourly
readings of the photographic curves, and so are corrected for the
diurnal variation.

                Falmouth    Observatory for the Year 1894.            531
     The Inclination is the mean of the absolute observations, the mean
  time of which is 3 p.m.
     In Table V, X is the mean of the absolute values observed during
 the month (generally three in number), uncorrected for diurnal
 variations and for any disturbance.    Y is the mean of the products of
 the Dips and X.
    The results in the following tables, Nos. I, II, III, IV, are deduced
 from the magnetograph curves which have been standardised by
 observations of deflection and vibration.       These were made with
 the Collimator Magnet marked 66a, and the Declinometer Magnet
 marked 66c in the Unifilar Magnetometer by Elliott Brothers, of
 London.     Table No. V is deduced from these observations.
     The temperature correction (which is probably very small) has not
  been applied owing to temporary change in the relation of the curve
 to the base line, caused by additions to the external gas-pipes.
    The Inclination was observed with the Inclinometer No. 86, by
 Dover, of Charlton, Kent, and needles 1 and 2, which are 3^ ins.
 in length, the results of which appear in Table VI.
    The Declination and Horizontal Force values given in Tables to    I
 IV are prepared in accordance with the suggestions made in tho
 fifth report of the Committee of the British Association on com
 paring and reducing magnetic observations, and the time given is
 Greenwich mean time, which is 20 min. 18 sec. earlier than local time.
    The following is a list of the days during the year 1894 which
 were selected by the Astronomer Royal, as suitable for the deter
mination of the magnetic diurnal variations, and which have been
 employed in the preparation of the magnetic tables : —

                December                 4. 11, 25. 26, 27.
    The whole of the instruments have been maintained in good order.
 The Magnetic Chamber and the Magnetic Hut in the garden have
been kept in a satisfactory state of dryness during the year, save
for six days in November, when the Chamber was flooded owing to
 excessive rainfall.

       OBITUARY NOTICES OF FELLOWS DECEASED.
    Robert Grant was born at Grantown, in Strathspey, on June 17,
 1814, and received his early education at a school established by the
  Earl of Seafield, which provided, for the children of the district, in
 struction in those branches of education which are required to enter
 the Scottish Universities.      But at the age of 13 his studies were
 interrupted by a serious  illness  ;  and it was not until the completion
 of his 19th year that his health was sufficiently restored to enable
 him to continue his studies with success.        After a course of private
 study, Grant     entered  King's     College,  Aberdeen,    but before the
 completion of the University course he removed to London and
 became engaged in business pursuits under his brother.             At this
 time,  Grant  commenced   to  collect  materials  for a history of physical
 astronomy, and in 1845, in order to obtain access to further sources
 of information, he removed to Paris, where he supported himself by
 teaching English.      In Paris, Grant had the great advantages of
 attending the astronomical lectures of Arago and Le Verrier, and
 the use of the books in the library of the Institute, of which he
 availed himself in the collection of the materials for his history.
    Grant returned to London in 1847, and devoted himself to the
preparation of his History of Physical Astronomy.             This work was
                               '
first published in parts in The Library of Useful Knowledge:' the
first part appeared in September, 1848, and, although the author was
previously unknown to most of the leading English astronomers, it
immediately attracted attention, and led to Mr. Grant being elected a
Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society. The history was pub
lished in a separate form in March, 1852 ; and in the following Novem
ber Grant was elected a member of the Council of the Royal Astro
                                                    '
nomical Society, and was appointed editor of The Monthly Notices ;'
and in 1856 the Gold Medal of the Society was awarded to him for
bis work. Grant's History of Physical Astronomy had certainly no
rival in the English language at the time of its publication ; it can
still be consulted with g»eat advantage upon any of the points with
which it treats, and its impartiality is unquestionable.
    In November, 1859, Grant was appointed Regius Professor of
Astronomy and Director of the Observatory in the University of
    VOL. Lvn.                                                       u

                                     11
Glasgow, and after a short course of practical instruction at Greeu-
wich, he took charge of the Observatory at Glasgow, and continued
to hold that post until the time of his death in 1892.
   The Observatory was provided with an Ertel Transit Circle of six
French inches aperture, and the chief astronomical work of the
Observatory during Professor Grant's tenure of office was done with
this instrument.     The staff at the Glasgow Observatory was not a
large one, and the salaries attached to the assistantships were so
small that Grant had great difficulty in retaining for any length of
time the services of skilled assistants, but he was able, by great per
severance and personal devotion to tho work, to complete a catalogue
of 6415 stars, reduced to the epoch 1870, and a catalogue of 2156
stars for the epoch 1890. The last proof sheet of the second catalogue
was only passed by him on the morning of his death.        Many of the
stars in these two catalogues have not been recently observed at any
other observatory, and the places are, therefore, comparatively of
greater value than would otherwise be the case, and the results have
already been found valuable for very closely approximate determina
tions of the proper motions of many stars not before known, and for
the reduction of comet observations.
   The results, however, can hardly be regarded as strictly indepen
dent determinations.     For reasons which appeared sufficient to Grant
it was thought expedient to compare the places of the stars observed
at Glasgow with existing recent observations at Greenwich of the
same stars, and to deduce corrections for the Glasgow places ob
served since 1865 to render them in mean results identical with the
Greenwich results.     The corrections thus found were then applied to
the places of the Glasgow catalogue, which should, therefore, not
differ systematically from those which would have been obtained
 had these stars been observed at Greenwich.       There are, of course,
advantages    in such  a method   of  proceeding when  the observations
have been made with an instrument of a class not suitable for inde
 pendent work, but much is lost by the want of independence of the
results if the instrument is a reliable one. It is, however, impossible
 for anyone not well acquainted with the Glasgow instrument to judge
of the necessity for the course pursued by Grant in this case.
    Besides the observations made with the Transit Circle, many extra-
meridional observations were made with the 9-inch equatorial by
Cooke, the public clocks of Glasgow were controlled from the
Observatory, and regular photographic meteorological observations
maintained.
    Professor Grant took part in the Solar Eclipse expedition to Spain
in 1860. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1865.
   Professor Grant married September 3, 1874, Elizabeth Emma,
daughter of A. C. Davison, of Newcastle, New South Wales, by

                                    iii
  whom he leaves one son and three daughters. He died at Grantown
 on October 24, 1892, in the 79th year of his age.
    With Admiral Smyth and Professor Baden-Powell, he published a
translation of Arago's 'Popular Astronomy,' two vols., 1855 — 1858,
and a volume of 'Biographical Notices of Scientific Men.' He
 greatly contributed to the exposure of the Pascal forgeries (see
 -
   Comptes Rendus,' 1867), by calling attention to the data extracted
 from Newton's published works and used by him, which were quoted
 in the forged letters, but which were not in existence in Pascal's life
time ; he also communicated seventeen papers to the Royal Astrono-
mical Society.
                                                              E. J. S.
    A rthur Milnes Marshall     was  born at Birmingham on June 8,
 1852, and died on December 31, 1893.        He was the second son of
William P. Marshall, for many years Secretary of the Institution of
Civil Engineers. He entered St. John's College, Cambridge, in 1871,
and read for the Natural Sciences Tripos. In those days the Biolo
gical Sciences did not hold the prominent position in the University
curriculum which they do at the present time, but the influence
which has since brought about such a marked development of these
studies at Cambridge had already begun its work, and Marshall was
one of the first to take advantage of the new state of things.
    As an undergraduate his studies met with every success : he was
elected Scholar of his College in June, 1873, and in 1874 he was placed
at the head of the first class of the Natural Sciences Tripos. After
taking his degree in January, 1875, he went to Naples, having been
appointed by the University to their table at the recently-established
Zoological Station.     He returned in the summer of 1875, and in the
October    Term   joined with Balfour in giving a course of lectures,
accompanied by practical work, on Zoology.        He was elected Fellow
of St. John's College in 1877.
    In the same year he gave up — temporarily as it fortunately turned
out — the prosecution of his purely scientific studies, and went to St.
Bartholomew's Hospital to work at medicine. His medical studies
continued until 1879, when he was appointed to the newly-established
chair of Zoology in the Owens College.
    He was now able to devote himself wholly to the pursuit of
science.    He took up again the embryological work which he had
begun at Naples, and which had necessarily somewhat languished
during his medical studies, and published a series of memoirs in the
                                                '
-
   Quarterly Journal of Microscopical Science on the morphology of
                                             "
the vertebrate head. These were entitled :     The Development of the
                                            " The
Cranial Nerves in the Chick," 1878 ;                Morphology of the
                                        "

Spencer) ; " On the Head Cavities and Associated Nerves of Elasmo-
branchs," 1881 ; to which mast be added " The Segmental Value
of the Cranial Nerves,"       published in 1882 in the 'Journal of
Anatomy and Physiology.'       These memoirs all influenced in an im
portant manner the views and work of the cranial morphologists of
the time.
    But the principal part of his work at Manchester was connected
with the development of the zoological teaching, and of the Museum ;
and as Secretary, and later, Chairman of the General Board of
Studies, with the organisation of the courses of study of Victoria
University. These duties left him but little time for research, but
in spite of this drawback we have in the latter years of his life the
following works from his pen : —
    " On the
              Nervous System of Antedon rosacens," 1884.
    "Report on the Pennatulida, dredged by H.M.S. 'Triton,' and
H.M.S. ' Porcupine,' " published in the ' Transactions of the Royal
Society of Edinburgh,' vols. 32 and 33.
    " On the
                Development of the Kidneys and Fat Bodies in the
              "
Frog," and On the Development of the Blood Vessels in the Frog,"
both in 1890, and in conjunction with his pupil, E. J. Bles.
    Although his multifarious duties at Owens left him but little time
for research, he was fully alive to its importance ; and he encouraged
it in his pupils, and gave them every opportunity of prosecuting
work of the kind, as witnesses of which statement are the two
volumes of Studies from the Biological Laboratory of the Owens
College, published in 1886 and 1890.
    As a teacher, he was excellent —clear and accurate.        A good
 measure of his capacities in this direction may bo obtained by an
 examination of the three text-books which he wrote : " The Frog," th¦
 "
   Practical Zoology," and the " Vertebrate Embryology." Accuracy-
 clearness, and thoroughness in their various grades are the most
 characteristic features of these books.
    He was a man of great energy and determination of character, of
a kindly and cheerful disposition which made him very popular with
 his friends and colleagues ; and of an enthusiastic nature, which con
tributed largely to his success as a teacher.
    His death, which took place when he was climbing Scawfell with
 some friends, was due to an accident. Apparently the stone on which
 he was standing slipped from him, and he fell on to the rocks below
    His loss will be felt not only at Owens, but all over the North of
 England, where he was well known by his persistent advocacy of th¦
 extension movement, to further which he gave much of his own
 valuable time.
    He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1885, and served

                                       V
on the Council in the Year 1891-92. He was President of Section Dy
at the Leeds meeting of the British Association (1890), and was for
many years President of the Manchester Microscopical Society.           He
was D.Sc. of London University (1877) and M.D. of Cambridge
(1832).
                                                                    A. S.
   Charles Romley Alder Wright, who became a Fellow of th¦
Royal Society in 1881, was born at Southend, in Essex, in 1844.
His father, Romley Wright, a civil engineer, was at one time em
ployed on the Ordnance Survey of this country, and in the course of
his work made some observations on the geology of the county of
                                           '
Salop, which were published in the Transactions of the Geological
         '
Society for 1837. During the son's boyhood his parents removed
to Manchester, and in due time Charles Wright was entered at
Owens College to be educated for the profession of his father.
At that period — the early years of the 60's — the college was housed
in Quay Street, in the dingy, old-fashioned, red-brick building
which had served Richard Cobden as a residence. In the rear of the
building there had been erected a well-equipped chemical laboratory —
indeed, as things went at that time, it was held to be a very paragon
among such places — and here young Wright, under the stimulating
guidance of Roscoe and Schorlemmer, found ample opportunity to
develop the liking for experimental chemistry which had manifested
itself during his home life.        Quick-witted, bright and intelligent,
with a capacity for boyish fun, and a fertility of resource in the
exercise of it, which excited the admiration and at times, it must be
added, the amazement of his less-gifted fellows, Wright appeared to
overtake his college work with an ease and celerity that seemed to
them little short of marvellous.         Thanks, however, to his father's
training,  he had   been   early schooled   into the habit of doing with all
his might whatsoever his hand found to do, and this capacity for work
never left him.       His career at Owens was exceptionally brilliant ;
prize  after prize,  not  only in chemistry, but also in physics, which he
studied under Clifton, in mathematics, which he had from Sandeman,
and in classics, which he learnt from Greenwood, fell, session after
session, to his share.      His course in connexion with his graduation
work at the University of London was hardly less distinguished.
On matriculating, in 1863, he gained the highest place and prize in
chemistry ; and at the intermediate examination in the following
year he was awarded the Exhibitions both in chemistry and natural
philosophy, and was made an Associate of Owens College.
   Wright's first essay in experimental investigation was done under
Roscoe's direction.      It consisted of an enquiry into the relative sensi
tiveness of photographic paper salted with different haloids and

 mixtures of haloids, and was published in the 'Journal of th¦
                   '
 Chemical Society for 1866. All his tastes predisposed him towards
 an academic position, but circumstances compelled him to seek for
 employment in technology, and shortly after his first paper appear¦d
 he accepted a situation as chemist at the Weston Works of the
 Runcorn Soap and Alkali Company.            Here, with characteristic
 ardour, he at once began a number of investigations relating to th¦
 manufacture of sulphuric acid and alkali, the main results of which
 appeared in the 'Journal of the Chemical Society' and in the
 '
   Chemical News.'     He soon, however, turned his face towards
 London,   and  became   an assistant to the late Dr. Bernays, in th¦
 laboratory attached to St. Thomas's Hospital. Afterwards he joined
 Matthiessen, and the two chemists began the remarkable seri¦s
 of investigations on the opium alkaloids with which their names,
 as joint authors, are associated, and one outcome of which was th¦
 discovery of apomorphine, one of the most powerful and valuable
 emetics known.     In 1869 he was associated with Sir Lowthian Bell
 in an elaborate investigation on the theory of iron smelting, the-
 results of which are contained in Sir Lowthian Bell's well-known work
 -
   On the Principles of the Manufacture of Iron and Steel.'
    In 1871 Wright became Lecturer on Chemistry at St. Mary's
 Hospital, and he occupied this position at the time of his death.  He
 once more turned his attention to the chemistry of the alkaloids, and
 began the study of the essential oils, and during the next ten years
 memoir followed memoir in quick succession. Either alone or in con
junction with his pupils he contributed nine papers on Derivatives of
 Morphine and Codeine to the Royal Society (1871-74) ; six papers on
 Isomeric Terpenes to the ' British Association Reports' (1873-77) ;
six papers on the Action of Organic Acids and their Anhydride0
on Natural Alkaloids (1874-80) ; seven papers on Narceine, Narco-
tine, Cotarnine, and Hydrocotarnine         to the Chemical Society
 (1874-77)     four papers on the Alkaloids of the Aconites
 (1877-79) ; and three      on the Alkaloids of the Veratrnms
                   '
 (1878-79) to the British Association Reports,' in addition to occa
sional papers on other departments of vegetal chemistry.        During-
the latter portion of this period he also contributed a series of
Reports on Chemical Dynamics to the Chemical Society (1878-80).
Questions relating to chemical physics had always great interest for
him ; and he sent to the Physical Society, of which he was one of
the original members, a series of nine papers on the Determination
 of Chemical Affinity in terms of Electromotive Force, and, in con
junction with Professor Roberts-Austen, he made a number of
measurements of the Specific Heat of Hydrogeninm (1873).           For
some years back he occupied himself with the study of alloys, and
the Proceedings of the Royal Society contain a number of papers.

                                     vii
  by him on this subject.     Indeed, his last paper, written a few days
  before his death, on the invitation of the London Section of the
  Society of Chemical Industry, consists of a resume of the conclusions
  to  which his long-continued work on this subject had led him. He
  maintained his touch with technology until the last, and he was an
  acknowledged authority on those branches of manufacturing chemistry
  with which he had become practically acquainted during his career.
  Gifted with a remarkable literary faculty and power of exposition,
  Wright was much sought after as a contributor to the literature of
  chemical technology.     He wrote a number of articles on tar distil
 ling and tar products in 1 Muspratt's Dictionary ;' the articles on iron
 and steel in the last edition of the ' Encyclopaedia Britannica,' and
 the monographs on "Soap," "Sulphur," and "Sulphuric Acid"
 in Thorpe's ' Dictionary of Applied Chemistry.'      In 1878 he gave a
 series of lectures at the Royal Institution on "Metals and their
 Industrial Applications," which were subsequently expanded and
 published in book form ; and, in 1885, he gave a course of Cantor
 lectures at the Society of Arts on the "Manufacture of Soap," He
 was a frequent contributor to the proceedings of the London Section
 of the Society of Chemical Industry, and the Journal of the Society
 contains a number of his communications.
     Wright took an active share in the formation of the Association
which ultimately developed into the Institute of Chemistry, and he
 was a member of the Council of that body.
     Much of his work was done under the depressing conditions of
 indifferent health, and at times he experienced great physical pain.
 From his boyhood he had suffered from an affection of the hip joint,
which eventually ended in lameness, and the consequent inability to
take exercise reacted very markedly upon his general health. His
friends, however, were hardly prepared for the suddenness of his end.
After an illuess of a few hours' duration, he died on the 25th July,
1894, having barely attained his forty-ninth year.
                                                              T. E. T.
     George     John Romanes  was  born at Kingston, Canada West, on
May 20, 1848 ; but, his parents having soon- after removed to Eng
land, his childhood was spent in London or its immediate neighbour
hood. Ill-health having rendered it desirable that he should reside
in a warmer climate, the family subsequently left England, and, in
consequence, his education was somewhat irregular.         The surround
ings   of  his   boyhood and youth  were,  however,  both  enjoyable and
healthful, and conduced to the development of that love of out-of-
door life and intense interest in the external aspects of nature, which
were so prominent in his after life. Romanes entered at Caius
 College, Cambridge, in 1869, and subsequently obtained a scholarship
     vol. lvii.                                                  c

                                      vm
 in that college.      He graduated through the Natural Science Tripos
  in 1870.      After taking his degree he entered on the study of
 medicine, and threw himsolf into the work of the hospital and dis
 secting room with great ardour ; but in 1872 ho was completely dis
 abled by a severe and protracted illness, which led to his abandoning
  his intention of entering the profession of medicine.           The writer
 became acquainted with him in the autumn of 1874.              He had occu
 pied himself during the previous year in biological studies, and was
 above all an ardent disciple of Mr. Darwin, with whom he had
 already corresponded, and soon after came into personal relation.
 For a couple of years Romanes was a worker in the Physiological
 Laboratory at University College, London, and dated therefrom
 (1876) his first contribution to the Royal Society.        In the autumn of
 the same year he began his physiological experiments on Medusae
 and sea urchins, and erected for the purpose a convenient marine
 laboratory close to his house at Dunskaith, at the entrance of
 Cromarty Firth, where he spent many happy autumns, engaged
partly in pursuit of game, partly in serious work.            He first became
known to the general public in 1878, when he was invited to deliver
one of the evening lectures at the British Association at Dublin on
"Animal Intelligence," the substance of which took the form of a
book in 1881. This was followed by a volume on ' Mental Evolution in
Animals,' and, later, by ' Mental Evolution in Man.' He was admitted
to the Fellowship of the Royal Society in 1879. In 1885 he undertook
to deliver an academical course in Edinburgh, which comprised some
thirty lectures, and extended over three years. He was subsequently
(1888) appointed Fullerian Professor at the Royal Institution, and
brought together the substance of his London and Edinburgh lectures
in a treatise entitled ' Darwin and after Darwin.' His other works
will be referred to in the following paragraphs.
    Romanes died suddenly of cerebral haemorrhage on May 23, 1894.
Threatening symptoms of arterial disease had appeared                  in the
summer of 1892, which were followed by a formidable illuess in Jnly,
1893.     After this he travelled to the south of France, returning to
Oxford, where he had resided since 1890, in the spring in much
improved health.        Up to the end he preserved not only his mental
vigour,    but  the keenness of his interest in his scientific pursuits.
    It is proposed in the following paragraphs first, to give an account
of Romanes' physiological work, then of his contributions to what is
now understood by the term biology, and, finally, to refer very
briefly to his psychological writings.
    The subject of his first communication to the Royal Society (May,
1876) was "The Influence of Injury on the Excitability of Motor
Nerves."       Of this paper, it is sufficient to say that the observations

                                    iz
were   made   with great care, and that the new facts recorded have
been  fnlly confirmed by later observers.
   The first of the very extended series of researches relating to the
" locomotor system " of the Medusa, starfishes, and sea urchins was
                    '                            '
published in the Philosophical Transactions        the same year, 1876,
the last in 1881.    These are so well known in consequence of their
having been placed before the public in one of the volumes of the
International Scientific Series, that it is sufficient to notice one or
two points of interest relating to them.   As regards the Medusae, the
chief value of Romanes' numerous and varied experiments consisted
in the light they threw on elementary questions in physiology rela
ting to excitability and conduction. As regards the arrangement and
distribution of the nervous system, it is interesting to note how
closely his inferences from experiment coincided with the anatomical
facts brought to light a year or two later by the researches of the
brothers Hertwig. In the researches on the Echinodermata, which
were undertaken five years later, Romanes was aided in the anato
mical part of his inquiry by his friend Professor Ewart. Through
out, his mode of working was the same, and was characteristic of the
worker. His method was not to elaborate a plan of research before
hand, ascertaining what questions had been left uninvestigated by
previous observers, but rather to find out all he could, before he began
to experiment, about the phenomena which presented themselves to
his observation in the out-of-door study of animal life. Residing,
as has been said, at the entrance of Cromarty Firth, the animals that
he chose as the subjects of inquiry were those which most abounded
in its waters. In the study of starfishes and sea urchins, he began
by observing their mode of progression, the way in which the animals
recover themselves when placed in unnatural positions, the way in
which they encounter or escape from an attacking enemy, and then
proceeded by the ordinary methods of physiological experiment to
the investigation of the functions of the nervous system, and to the
determination of the way in which the movements of the animal are
co-ordinated.     Throughout, the value of his results was enhanced by
the circumstance that he availed himself freely of the opportunity
which his position afforded him of multiplying his experiments, and
confirming every observation by repeating it on individuals belonging
to a variety of species.
   Between 1882 and 1893 Romanes offered no further contribution
of any moment to the Royal Society ; but in the latter year (see
'
  Proceedings,' vol. 54, p. 333) he submitted summaries of two experi
mental inquiries, one of which, on Plant Excitability, was so closely
related to his early physiological studies that it may be most con
veniently noticed here. Its purpose was to prove that the bending of
plants towards any source of light is so little dependent on the quan
                                                               o 2

tity and so entirely on the suddenness of the illumination, that a
series of instantaneous exposures at intervals of two seconds produces
in a given time a greater effect than continuous illumination from the
same source for the whole period — a proof that in this case the action
in question is " liberated," not " maintained," by light.          The re
markable capacity for experimental investigation which was exhibited
in these and in his earlier physiological studies made it a matter of
regret to many of his friends that he did not continue them.
   An account must now be given of his work in the field of general
biology.     His interest in Darwinian questions dates from the time
which preceded and followed his becoming acquainted with Mr.
Darwin in 1874. This acquaintance soon ripened into a friendship,
to the reality of which the writer can testify.      It was promoted first
by the fact that in those early student days, Romanes' mind was, so
to speak, steeped in Darwinian doctrine ; but it owed its permanence
to his possessing certain rare and brilliant intellectual qualities which
Mr. Darwin highly appreciated.
   As he himself tells us (see ' Nature,' vol. 8, p. 432, 1873), it was in
discussing with Mr. Darwin some of the cases in which the effects of
disuse appear to be inherited, that his attention was directed to a
principle — now held by many biologists to be of great importance —
                                      "
that of the action of
                          "
                            panmixia or " negative selection " (Weis-
                                                 "
mann), or as Romanes at that time called it, cessation of selection."
His claim to priority in this matter was, however, weakened by the
circumstance that he did not set forth this principle as of universal
application — as the only way by which, consistently with the recogni
tion of the "all sufficiency of natural selection" (Weismann, ' Cont.
Review,' p. 334). the disappearance of superfluous organs can be
accounted for.      Another subject of interest to him was also of
directly Darwinian origin. It seems to have been suggested by a
well-known passage in which Mr. Darwin pointed out that specific
                                                                  "
characters which " do not affect the welfare of the species          cannot
be attributed to natural selection (' Origin,' 6th ed., p. 176). Romanes'
ideas on this point did not take form until, in 1886, he communicated
                                                            "
to the Linnean Society his well-known article on              Physiological
Selection ; an additional Suggestion on the Origin of Species."         The
title was perhaps   an unfortunate one, for it suggested a purpose which
was very far from being that of the writer.      It seemed like an attack
                                    '
on the fundamental doctrine of the Origin.' Notwithstanding its rather
                                        "                           " must
speculative character, the essay on       Physiological Selection
be considered as the most important of his biological writings, for
it sets before the reader, in terms which cannot be mistaken, that
if by species is meant an association of animals or plants which is
  -tinguished by the incapacity of its members to unite sexually with
         rs, the coming into existence of this disability as a barrier

                                    xi
between them is a factor in the origin of species of which sufficient
account has not been taken.
   Romanes' precise position in relation to this contentious subject
may be stated very shortly.         Other naturalists had shown that
isolation of part of a species, whether by geographical or other
external obstacles to sexual intercourse, inevitably led to the acquire
ment by the plants or animals thus separated, of characters different
from those of the remainder, and eventually to the setting up of the
bar of reciprocal sterility between them. To this, without professing
to explain  it,  Romanes added the statement that the setting up of
this  "  physiological
                       "
                          barrier may be the primary event, i.e., that   it
may come into existence between one part of a species and the rest
in the absence of any structural difference, or other external obstacle
to sexual union, and thus, having no cause itself, become the prime
cause of all other differences.   He himself admitted that his " theory "
was but a statement of what he believed actually to happen, leaving
the explanation of it, with that of variation in general, to the
                                                                   " future
of physiology" ('Linn. Soc. Zool. Proc.,' vol. 19, p. 337). During
the following half-dozen years he spent much time and labour in
bringing together confirmatory instances, the results of which will no
doubt soon be published.        The chief claim to consideration of this
theory consists in the prominence which      it   gives to what Romanes
calls  " mutual sterility, with fertility inter se," as that which consti
tutes the essence of species in other words, to the subordination of
                             ;
all other specific distinctions to the one primary and dominant one
—sterility to outsiders. Had he contented himself with showing that
whenever  a    variety ispromoted to the rank of a species, that promo
                                                           "
tion consists in the setting up of the " bar of sterility — that the pro
tection of this barrier, however set up,   is  essential to the progressive
modification by natural selection of the species — and that there are
reasons for believing that the functional disability may come into
existence in the absence of recognisable structural difference, no one
would have fallen into the mistake of supposing that           was his
                                                               it
intention to substitute a new doctrine for the Darwinian.
   As regards the question whether acquired characters are inherited,
it   sufficient to say that both the direct and the indirect evidence
     is
seemed to Romanes . to tend towards the affirmative.       His physio
logical training probably made him more alive than he would other
wise have been to the difficulties which present themselves in all
those cases in which the apparatus required for the performance of       a
complicated function must be in complete working order before   can it
be of the slightest use to the organism, and consequently must have
arrived at perfection of development independently of the operation
of natural selection. The particular case in which he emphasises
this difficulty    that of the complicated automatic and perfectly
                  is

                                    xii
 co-ordinated bodily movements of the higher animals, the performance
 of which involves the co-operation of a complicated system of sense
 organs, sensory nerves, centres, motor nerves, and muscles ; it being
 obvious that the power of so co-ordinating the actions of these various
 parts as to ensure the accomplishment of the required purpose is as
 certainly transmitted to offspring by inheritance as any morphological
 character. All that Romanes has written on this subject — volumi
 nous as it is— is in complete accord with Mr. Herbert Spencer's
 contention, that the " coadaptation of parts cannot be accounted for
 by the natural selection of variations arising fortuitously.
                                                                 " This
 doctrine he did his best to corroborate by new examples, considering
Mr. Spencer's line of argument exceedingly " cogent against all ultra-
Darwinians."
   In dealing with the much more difficult question of        the   direct
evidence    for or against the inheritance of acquired characters,
Romanes found the same difficulties as other naturalists.       It is well
known that for many years he sought, with praiseworthy persever
ance, to verify the experimental results obtained by the late Dr.
Brown-Sequard as regards the transmission to offspring of certain
structural defects and pathological tendencies, originally produced in
guinea-pigs by injuries of the central nervous system.         Although
some of the experiments made for this purpose jielded interesting
results, the appearances observed were not sufficiently constant or
decisive to enable him to confirm Brown-Sequard's conclusions. In
addition to these experiments of his own, he was unceasing in his
efforts to bring together all the experimental evidence that he could
get hold of, either by reading or correspondence, relating to the con
ditions under which structural modifications produced by environment
persist in the offspring of plants and animals for many generations,
independently of the external conditions which originally produced
them.      On the question of so-called Telegony, he endeavoured to
obtain information, partly by correspondence, partly by experiments
       '
(see     Contemporary Review,' 1893, p. 512). To what extent these
efforts were productive, the writer is unable to say, but there seems
reason to hope that the collected evidence, when published in the
forthcoming second volume of ' Darwin, and after Darwin,' will be of
considerable interest.    It may be noted that, although Romanes
agrees with Mr. Spencer in regarding telegony, if true, to be fatal to
the doctrine of " Germplasm," his idea of its mechanism is different.
   During the year which preceded his death, Romanes published the
work entitled ' An Examination of Weismannism.'          Its purpose, as
stated in the Preface, was not to discuss either the question of the
inheritance of acquired characters, with which Professor Weismann's
name is so closely associated, or the conception of the architecture of
germplasm, which is no less essential to his general theory. What

                                     xiii
he had in view was rather to trace, for the information of non-
biological readers, the successive stages through which that theory
has passed during the half-dozen years that it has been before the
reading public in England. Notwithstanding its polemical character,
it contains much that is of value and interest, particularly the com
parison between the theory of heredity, submitted to the Royal
Society by Mr. Francis Galton in 1872, with the doctrine now advo
cated by the great German naturalist.
    In conclusion, reference must be made to Romanes' numerous and
valuable contributions to the study of comparative psychology.         On
this subject Professor Lloyd Morgan has been kind enough to furnish
the writer with some valuable notes.
    Romanes first became known as a writer on comparative psychology
when he delivered, as already mentioned, one of the evening lectures
on " Animal Intelligence," at the meeting of the British Association
at Dublin in 1878. His first published work with the same title
appeared in 1881. In it he set forth conclusions as to the mental
endowments of animals, which were founded partly on his own
observations, partly on those of other persons, which he had collected
from a great variety of sources.        This preparatory volume was fol
                                     '
lowed in 1883 by a work on Mental Evolution in Animals,' in
which he lucidly and brilliantly set forth what he regarded as the
                                                       "        "
principles of the subject. Into this treatise were woven as quota
tions certain notes given to Romanes by Mr. Darwin during his life ;
                 "a
besides which        part of Mr. Darwin's chapter on Instinct, written
for the Origin
          '
                  of Species,' but afterwards suppressed for the sake of
condensation," was added as an appendix.
                                        '
    -
      Mental Evolution in Animals was followed in 1888 by an in
 stalment of a work on Mental Evolution in Man,' dealing with the
                            -
 origin of the human faculty.       It was the last work of the Mental
 Evolution Series which     the author   was ever to complete ; but it was
 his intention to widen the field of discussion at a later period. The
 book encountered its full share of criticism.     The author's views were
 objected to, on   the  one   hand, by    those to whom the evolution of
 human from animal intelligence was unacceptable, on the other, by
 those who, on scientific grounds, were unable to accept Romanes'
 interpretation of animal faculty. All, however, would be willing to
 admit that. to quote the words of Professor Lloyd Morgan, "-by his
 patient collection of data, by his careful discussion of these data in
 the light of principles clearly and definitely formulated, by his wide
 and forcible advocacy of his views, and above all by his own observa
 tions and experiments, Mr. Romanes left a mark in this field of
 investigation and interpretation which is not likely to be effaced."
     In the preceding paragraphs an endeavour has been made to give a
  concise summary of Romanes' contributions to biological science.

                                      XIV
    Such an account would not, however, completely enable the reader to
   form a just conception of the influence which he exercised during
    the last ten years of his life, by his writings and public utterances. It
    would, indeed, be doing scant justice to his memory     if,
                                                              even in record
   ing the dry additions to knowledge which resulted from his work, we
   were to forget what science owes to him for having awakened in the
   minds of thousands of readers, both in England and in America, that
   interest in the relations of man to his living surroundings, which          is
   so often the first step in the training of a naturalist.    AH who know
   Romanes' writings will agree that, quite independently of the subjects
   to which they relate, they possess qualities which sufficiently account
   for the favour with which they have been received on both sides of
   the Atlantic. Even those who are at variance with Romanes on
   fundamental questions, are charmed by the unconstrained and natural
   way in which his originality shines out in his language, and reconciled,
   in spite of their convictions, by the directness and simplicity of his
   reasoning.    A considerable share of the interest which the questions
   on which he wrote at present excite, may be directly traced to his
   writings, the popularity of which affords the best evidence of their
   adaptedness to their purpose.
      One word as to Romanes' personal qualities.             He had many
   opponents, no enemies.       Transparently honest himself and scarcely
   knowing    what  bitterness    meant, he looked for and fonnd the same
   kindliness and honesty in others and thus often made friends of hi*
   antagonists. The wide range of his interests and the number of the
   subjects about which he was able to talk suggestively, made him             a
   most attractive companion.         He was courteous to all, but reserved
                            —
   the best of his gifts his overflowing           charity and ungrudging
   sympathy —for his intimate friends.        To how many who stood in this
   relation to him is  his loss an irreparable calamity !
                                                                  J.   B. S.
      Alphonse de Candolle     : When the history of the progress of
   botany during the 19th century shall be written, no names will be
   more conspicuous for the value and extent of their united labours
   than those of the de Candolle's, father and son, Auguste Pyrame and
   Alphonse.   Their labours embraced every department of the science,
   morphological, physiological, systematic, geographical, and economic,
   and were uninterrupted during ninety-five years, those of the father
   extending from 1798 to 1842, and of the son from 1824 to 1893.
   And if the period during which their labours overlapped be taken
   into account, the total amounts to 113 years.
      The subject of this notice, Alphonse Louis Pierre de Candolle, was
          in Paris, October 27, 1806, and passed his earlier years at Mont-
'"V^orn
     ellier, where
        r,   w      his father, a Genevese, of Huguenot descent, and           a

                                          XV
Protestant, held the professorship of botany. In 1814 the father was
transferred to the botanical chair of Geneva, and there, in 1825,
Alphonse took the degree of Bachelor of Science, and commenced the
study of law. In 1829 he took his doctor's degree in that faculty,
                                                           "
selecting as the subject of his inaugural thesis Le Droit de Grace."
It should be observed, in passing, that his legal education had a
marked influence on his subsequent career, both as a citizen and as a
botanist ; on the one hand it qualified him to undertake civic duties
of inestimable advantage         to his canton and country, and on the other
it   contributed largely to the development of those qualities of exacti
tude in collecting and recording facts, of methodical arrangement of
these, and of cautious reasoning, that are predominant features in all
his scientific writings.
     From a very early age Alphonse de Candolle had developed a love
of botany, and, when only 18 years old, he published his first con
tribution to this science, in a paper on Agaricus tubmformis,* a
remarkable dimorphic fungus, found on the wood of thermal baths in
Piedmont, which appeared in the ' Annales des Sciences Naturelles '
 (vol. 1, p. 347).
     In 1830 he began to co-operate with his father in the elaboration of
the colossal ' Prodromus Systematis Vegetabilium,' by the prepara
tion of a monograph in advance of that work, on the Campannlacece,
which at once raised him to a high position as a botanist. It was
followed in 1832 by another monograph, supplemental to the ' Pro
dromus,' upon the very obscure and little known tropical family of
Anonaceoe, which, owing         to the want of materials, had been ineffi
ciently dealt with in that work. On his father's death in 1841 the
future conduct of the ' Prodromus ' was undertaken by Alphonse,
who for upwards of half a century zealously laboured towards its
completion as editor and part author of the eight succeeding volumes ;
and thereafter of its continuation in the ' Monographic Phaneroga-
marum,' in which he was zealously aided by his eminent son Casimir.
     Alphonse de Candolle's individual contributions to the ' Pro
            '
dromus consist of detailed descriptions of forty-five natural families,
containing 438 genera and upwards of 5300 species. Amongst these the
most important are the Myrsinacece, Lobeliacece, Apocynacece, Myri-
sticacece, Begcmiacece, and Cupuliferm. The judgment of botanists upon
these (and upon those not enumerated) is that they exhibit all the
best qualities of monographic work, scientific and scholarly.                  As an
example of the completeness of his work, the last mentioned order
 (Cupuliferm) may be instanced. It includes the great genus of oaks,
which had previously been represented descriptively by a chaos of ill-
    * Some of the most eminent botanists commenced the
                                                             study of plants with the
lower cryptogams, as did the elder de Candolle, the first of whose long list of publi-
  ations was on the nutrition of lichens.

                                      xvi
 defined species of the north temperate zone, and little more than indi
cations of the existence of a vast contingent of Oriental, Asiatic, and
 Malayan groups of species, specimens of which were scattered
 through various great herbaria of Europe.       These last presented the
 greatest difficulties,  and  as showing    how   successfully they were
 treated, it is instructive to find that in Dr. King's very recent mag
 nificent illustrated work on the oaks of India and the Malay Islands,
 and which is founded on materials immeasurably superior to what
 Alphonse de Candolle had access to, and on double the number of
 species, all but one-eighth of those described in the Prodromns are
 found to have been satisfactorily established upon sound scientific
 principles.
    Before concluding the subject of the Prodromus, it must be re
 corded that over and above the labour expended on his own contribu
tions to it was that involved in the editorship of the L7 volumes, in
the collection of materials for his collaborators, in the correspondence
with the latter, and in the revision of their work in MS. and in the
press — laborious and often       irksome duties — all scrupulously    per
formed.
    The knowledge and experience acquired during the progress of the
 Prodromua led to an exposition, for the guidance of monographers,
of his views as to the right method of proceeding in describing
plants. Three treatises may be classed under this head. The first is a
                                           " Etudes sur
paper published in 1862, and entitled                   l'espece, a 1'occa-
sion d'une Revision de la famille des Cupuliferes."      It is an interest
ing and instructive study of the meaning and application of the term
species as employed by naturalists, its limits and those of its mem
bers, in time and area, their origin, future, and modifications.       For
such a study he suggests the term epiontology.
    The second is entitled "La Phytographie, on Part de deerire les
vegetaux consideres sons differents points de vue," published in 1880.
Founded primarily on the principles so well laid down by Linnaeus,
this excellent work embodies the results of de Candolle's own long
experience and those of his predecessors and contemporaries, on the
methods that should be followed by biologists, whether botanists or
zoologists, in describing organised beings.       In this work the good
effect of de Candolle's legal training is conspicuous, for the prin
ciples which he would see adopted, besides being unexceptionable, are
laid down with judgment, precision, and moderation that leave
nothing to be desired.
    The third is his " Lois de la Nomenclature Botanique," which ap
peared in ] 867, and in which rules were given for selecting, amongst
conflicting claims and opinions, the name a genus or species should
bear, assuming that it had borne two or more.          So impressed was
de Candolle with the importance of this subject, that it was always

                                    xvii
uppermost in his thoughts during forty years of his life, during which
period he published twelve treatises on the subject. The result has
been the general acceptance of the principles he laid down, and the
adoption of the rules, except where expediency or exceptional condi
tions clearly require their modification or supersession.
   Turning from A. de Candolle's taxonomic labours, it is on his
'
  Geographie Botanique Raisonnee,' published in 1858, that his most
enduring claim, as a philosophical botanist, rests. The subject had
early attracted his attention. He was drawn to it both by inclina
tion and by his father's admirable - Essai Elementaire de Geographie
            '
Botanique (published in 1820).       An interesting chapter in his own
monograph     on Campanulacece (his  earliest systematic work) is devoted
to it ; a more important one is embodied in his ' Introduction a
l'Etude de la Botanique ' (1835) ; and in 1848 he published
(' Comptes Rendus ') a suggestive essay on the northern limitation
of plants, adopting as a leading principle the " Methode des Sommes
de Temperature," as laid down by Boussingault in his " Economie
Rarale."
   It is impossible in a notice like the present to give even a general
review of the contents of a work covering such a wide range of in
                                                   '
teresting and important considerations as the Geographie Botanique
Raisonnee,' and which enters into so many of these in extraordinary
detail.   The impressions left in the mind after a first perusal are of
surprise at the astonishing number of the valuable observations
collected and collated from apparently inexhaustible sources, the
precision and methodical subdivision of the subject matter, and the
scrupulous care with which the labours of every previous author
and reasoner are treated. It may truly be said of the author of the
'                                                    '
  Geographie Botanique,' as has been of Darwin's Origin of Species,'
that he has utilised to the best purpose the waste and the rejected
observations of scores of less sagacious reasoners.      Throughout the
work the search for general principles and laws is conspicuous. No
methods known to him are left untried, the statistical above all others,
and even when these all fail, the materials left for the analysis of
future thinkers are so well knit together and so absolutely trust
worthy that they have in numberless instances proved of great value.
The most conspicuous instance of this is to be found in the exhaustive
chapters devoted to the influences of heat and light on the
development of individuals and of species, and on the distribution of
the higher groups of plants.      Though not always leading directly to
a precise correlation of cause with effect in the desired direction, the
value of these researches appears in another chapter, where it is
shown by a reference to them that the limitation of species, whether
on plains or mountains, is determined by the amount of heat above
the freezing point of water, that is absorbed during the months

                                   xviii
occupied in growth, and not by the means or extremes of annual tem
perature. Influenced, no doubt, by his early legal studies, there is
                 -                        '
throughout the Geographic Botanique a disregard, almost amount
ing to a negation, of speculative and theoretical considerations, but,
under this point of view, it must be remembered that the ' Origin of
         '
Species had not as yet appeared ; that Forbes' and Lyell's pregnant
suggestions, as affecting the dispersion of species, were not generally
accepted, and that the doctrine of the multiple origination of indi
viduals of a species was entertained, if not formally adopted, by de
Candolle as the more probable theory of creation ; as also that genera
were considered by him to be more natural (better limited) groups
than species.
   In 1882 appeared the - Origine des Plantes Cultivees,' an expan
sion of Chapter IX of the Geographie,' but which, being published
                              -
thirty years later, and containing a vast amount of additional matter,
is really a new and independent work. It is prefaced by two chapters,
one on the supposed origin of the art of cultivation in different
countries, the otber on the methods he employed in tracing the
sources whence cultivated plants have been obtained. These methods
are botanical, archaeological, palseontological, historical, and linguistic,
in the application of all of which the author has shown great learning
and judgment, and the result is a work of extraordinary interest and
value. It has already gone through three editions, and a fourth is
urgently needed, because many tropical cultivations have still to
 be dealt with, and because some very important supplemental facts,
especially as regards plants of American origin, have been published
in an elaborate review of de Candolle's work by Dr. A. Gray and
J. H. Trumbull, in the -American Journal of Arts and Sciences'
(April— August, 1883).
   Another work, though more of a literary than of a purely scientific
character, must not be omitted in a review of de Candolle's labours :
it is his ' Histoire des Sciences et des Savants depuis deux Siecles,
piecedee et suivie d'autres fitudes sur des sujets scientifiques, en par-
ticulier sur l'Heredite et la Selection dans l'espdce humaine," of
which the first edition appeared in 1873, and a greatly enlarged one
                                                              '
in 1885. It need not be said that the ' Origin of Species suggested
this fascinating work, and that the writings of Grove, Spencer, Galton,
and Wallace have all been largely drawn upon in its execution.
Both genius and originality are displayed in      whether in respect
                                                  it,                     of
the problem  it essays to solve or the views which    sets forth.
                                                        it          With
his undeviating preference for the statistical method, he enumerates
by name all the scientific men who had attained the honour                of
Associates and Correspondents of the Academies of Science of Paris
and Berlin, and of Foreign Fellowship of the Royal Society of London,
between 1664 and 1882, with their nationalities and the branches          of

                                          xix
science for which they were distinguished.              After subjecting the lists
to a severe scrutiny,       he finds  that  Switzerland     carries away the palm,
in respect of the number in proportion to its population, of the
recipients of these academical honours. England he considers to be
the country most favourably conditioned for intellectual culture,
especially due to the facility with which its language may be acquired
for reading purposes.          This led to an analysis of the chief European
                                                            "
languages, with the result that. owing to its                 comparatively simple
declensions and conjugations, its facility for forming compound words,
and its abundance of short declamatory expressions, English is likely
to become the universal language of the future."
     By editing the autobiography of his distinguished father, A. de
Candolle has euriched the history and literature of science. The
father was a man of genius aud varied attainments, a lover of society,
and an excellent talker, who cultivated the acquaintance of the most
intellectual people in France and England during the first forty years
of the present century, and his autobiography contains instructive
anecdotes, often racy and never injurious, of not a few of the most
eminent men of his time.
     A. de Candolle-s professional career as a botanist began in 1831,
when he was appointed Honorary Professor of Botany in the Academy
of Geneva, assistant to his father as Director of the Botanical Gardens,
and conductor of the students' herborizations. In 1841, on his father's
death, he succeeded him in the chair, which he held till 1850. In
 1835 he published, as a cla38 book, his Introduction a l'Etude de la
                                                   '
 Botanique,' an excellent work, conceived and executed in the spirit of
 his father's ' Organographie Vegetale.' It was reprinted in Belgium,
 and translated into German and Russian.
     A. de Candolle's labours were not confined to botany, for through
 out the active period of his life he was engaged in civic duties. As
 early as 1834 he was elected a representative of the Council of Geneva,
 later a member of the Constituent Assembly, and lastly of the Grand
 Council from 1862 — 1866. In all movements for the improvement
 of the city and well-being of his fellow-citizens and countrymen,
 especially the financial and charitable, he was a zealous and judicious
 advocate, and he published many well reasoned papers on these and
 kindred subjects. He was the first to advocate the Referendum in
  financial affairs, and the use of postage stamps in his canton, and
  subsequently in the Confedeiation. He was a zealous supporter of the
  Societe de Physique et d'Histoire Naturelle de Geneve, of the Societe
  Helvetique des Sciences Naturelles, of the Societe des Arts, and the
                                                                          '
  Societe de Lecture, and a perennial contributor to the Archives
  des Sciences Physiques et Naturelles.'             Of separate publications and
  articles in scientific and other journals, M. Micheli* enumerates 235,

                      '
of Scientific Papers up to 1883. These embrace an extraordinary
variety of subjects, and it can truly be said that all are thoughtful
and worthy of serious attention.
   Personally Alphonse de Candolle was distinguished for courtesy
and liberality in thought and deed.     Ever helpful, no one applied to
him in vain for aid. His vast stores of knowledge, his herbarium,
his library, and even his roof were at the service of all who could make
good use of them.     The herbarium and library were left to his son
Casimir, under the conditions that they be open to botanists, and
that he conducts the publication of the ' Monographiae Phanerogam-
       '
arum (continuation of the Prodromus).        He married in 1832, Made
moiselle Jeanne Victoire Kunkler, who pre-deceased him, and by
whom he had two sons.          His residence was Geneva during the
summer, and Valon, a few miles distant, in the winter, where he died
4lh April, 1893, in his eighty-seventh year. Amongst the numerous
honours conferred upon him was that of Correspondent of the Insti
tute of France, of which body he was afterwards elected one of the
eight Foreign Associates in succession to Agassiz. He was a Foreign
Fellow of the Royal and Linnean Societies of London, and of most
European and American academies, a Doctor of Laws of Oxford and
Cambridge, and the recipient of various medals and orders, including
the gold medal of the Linnean Society, and last, but not least, the
Prussian order of " Pour le Merite."
                                                              J. D. H
   Pjkrre Joseph Van Beneden        was born at Malines    on the 19th of
December, 1809, and died at Louvain on the 8th of January, 1894.
His long life is one record of indefatigable industry in the pursuit of
his favourite science, but otherwise was singularly uneventful.       He
received a medical education, and almost immediately after taking
his degree, was, in 1831, appointed curator of the Natural History
Museum of the University of Louvain, and in 1836, Professor of
Zoology and Comparative         Anatomy in the Catholic University
founded in   the same  town, after the suppression of the ancient State
University. He continued steadily to discharge the duties of this
office, combined with an uninterrupted course of scientific research,
until within a few days of bis death, which resulted from a somewhat
sudden attack of bronchitis.     He rarely quitted his home except for
the purpose of visiting museums, or with some other scientific object
in view.
   The jubilee of his professoriate was celebrated with great honour,
both at Louvain and at his native town, in 1886, seven years before
the termination of his career.
   His earliest scientific work was devoted to the anatomy and de

                                  xxiii
stationed  first at Montreal, and afterwards at Hamilton, on Lake
Ontario. Returning to England in 1868, he was appointed Assist
ant-Instructor in Signalling at Chatham.         His appointment was
changed in 1871 to that of Assistant- Instructor in Telegraphy.
General electricity and submarine mining were included in his
educational duties,      which he carried out with energy and
enthusiasm.      He  liked  the work, and, without doubt, he was
specially fitted for it.   During the succeeding twelve years, under
his hands and those of his colleagues, the application of electrical
science to military engineering received extraordinary development.
He became a Captain on the 3rd August, 1872, and four years
later succeeded Colonel Malcolm, R.E., as Instructor in Telegraphy,
an important post which be held for nearly seven years.
    To properly appreciate Armstrong's work during these years, it
must be remembered that electrical science was comparatively in a
backward condition.      The instruments in use in the military tele
graph service were obsolete.     The methods of exploding charges for
demolitions and for land mines were crude in design and uncertain
in action. The use of the arc light for purposes of coast defence had
scarcely been thought of, although the general subject of defence had
been for some years attracting attention, and the desirability of
employing booms and submarine explosives for the protection' of
ports had been considered.     As the result of an exhaustive mintue
 by Sir John Burgoyne, the Floating Obstruction Committee carried
 out a number of experiments, and finally decided to introduce the
 principle of submarine mining.      The organisation of the first sub
 marine mining company fell to the lot of Armstrong and his stall at
 Chatham. Powers of invention, energy, and zeal were requisite, and
 fortunately for the public service he possessed them all.
    The records of the War Office Torpedo Committee, 1871-1876,
 and the Proceedings of the Royal Engineers Committee, show clearly
 the important nature of his work in connection with the carefully-
 conducted experiments that were necessary in order that the appa
 ratus might be brought to a high state of efficiency.   He introduced
 the system of testing submarine mines by means of relays.
    In 1879 he, with others, carried out a series of experiments pre
 paratory to the employment of the arc light for coast defence.
    He became a Major on the 9th October, 1879, and in January,
  1883, he was appointed Electrical Adviser to the Board of Trade.
 The introduction of electric lighting made it necessary to pass an
 Act of Parliament. He advised the Board on the difficult points
 that arose in connection with the efficiency of supply and the public
 safety.
    He succeeded Colonel Malcolm as Inspector of Submarine Defences
 at the War Office in June, 1 884, and continued also to advise the
                                                                e

                                   xxiv
Board    of Trade.   However, in 1888, by reason of the increased
vitality exhibited by electric lighting companies, he fonnd his duties
becoming so onerous that he resigned his post at the Board of Trade,
and devoted the whole of his attention to the War Office.             He
received the thanks of the Board for the valuable services he had
rendered the department.
   He gave most arduous work to the organisation, both in personnel
and materiel, of the submarine defences.       He served on many com
mittees appointed to report upon special questions of defences. He
represented the War Department at many electrical exhibitions at
home and in foreign countries.
   He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1891.
   On the 1st July, 1890, he had been promoted to the rank of
Colonel in the army ; and on the 3Uth May, 1891, had been gazetted
a civil C.B.
   On the 1st July, 1891, he was appointed Royal Engineer memb¦r
of the Ordnance Committee.         His health, however, failed, and he
retired on a pension on the 7th December, 1892. At first, the rest
appeared to act beneficially, but early  in 1894 he caught a chill, from
which his delicate constitution never recovered.          He gradually
became weaker, and passed away on 1st November, 1894, at Prospect
House, Omeath, Ireland.
   He was buried at Mount Jerome Cemetery, Dublin.
   Armstrong was a man of high personal character, of affectionate
disposition and gentle manners, and the most pleasant of companions.
He was greatly beloved in his own corps, in which he had numerous
friends, and also by those with whom he was associated in the many
important posts he held. By them he is deeply mourned.
                                                             P. A. M.
   Bisskt Hawkins was born in London, in the year 1796, and was
at the time of his death, on December 7, 1894, the oldest Fellow of
our Society, having been elected on December 18, 1834, as well as
by some fourteen years the oldest Fellow of the Royal College of
Physicians.
   Dr. Hawkins' placo in the history of science and of medicine is as
a student of public medicine, at a time when sanitary authorities
and general register offices had not been devised.         Returning to
London, after his graduation at Oxford in 1825, he presently took
an interest in medical statistics, a subject then in its infancy, and in
a volume enlarging his Gulstonian Lectures, of 1828, he brought
together what records of disease and death were obtainable about
various communities, and found in them — to use his own words —
proof of the empire of human art over disease.          In 1831, when
cholera was threatening St. Petersburg, he made a serviceable col

                                     XXV
lection of facts, so far as they conld be learned, rospecting the
march of the disease from India through Russia, and was able to end
his story by telling of a Board of Health established for England,
with Sir Henry Halford, President of the College of Physicians, at
its head.
    Dr. Hawkins' professional knowledge, combined with his regard
for numerical accuracy, was recognised by his appointment succes
sively to office as Factory Commissioner and Inspector of Prisons.
 He rendered useful service in these capacities, particularly in pleading
 for abridgment of extravagant hours of labour by women and children,
and by preventing serious sanitary mistakes by the Government of
 the time in its dealings with prisoners. He afterwards became a
Commissioner in Lunacy.
    When, in 1836, provision was made for registering births and
                                                                  —
 deaths throughout England, Dr. Hawkins was in a position in the
counsels of the College of Physicians and of the Government
                                                                     — to
speak with authority in favour of a proposal to record the fatal
disease in the death register ; along with the mere facts of identity
and of time and place. Of course it could not be long before the
value of this record was felt ; and the column — at first reserved experi
                                   "
mentally for " causes of death — has long been seen to be the most
 important of all the columns of the register for the purposes of the
community.
    Dr. Bisset Hawkins, in 1838, urging on England a greater interest
                                                         " and her allied
 than she then took in the affairs of Germany
countries," had to coin a phrase to distinguish the wider idea of
 social life taken in Germany from the subjects which formed the
political economy of England at that period. He would have English
men study the "state economy" of Germany, her natural history,
 her educational, medical, and other concerns, that were at the begin
ning of the century much better cared for in Germany than in his
own country. He lived to see his distinction well nigh effaced; and
 we may credit him with having helped to the effacement.
    He spent the later years of his life at his residence at Bourne
 mouth, in Dorsetshire, a deputy-lieutenant of the county, the ideal of
an English country gentleman and retired scholar.
                                                                  G. B.
    Albert William     Beetham was born in London, on August 20,
  1802, being the eldest son of William Beetham, F.R.S., Deputy-
 Lieutenant for the county of Middlesex. He was elected a Fellow          v
 of the Linuean Society on February 6, 1827, and of the Royal
  Society on February 5, 1835.         He was appointed Clerk of the
 Cheque     and Adjutant   of   the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-
 at-Arms     on July  3, 1835.     In November, 1836, he was called

                               xxvi
to the Bar at Gray's Inn, and practised as a special pleader ou
the Western Circuit. He was appointed Recorder of Dartmouth in
1860, and at the time of his death was Deputy-Lieutenant   for the
Tower Hamlets, and Jnstice of the Peace for Middlesex and the
Tower Hamlets.    He married, in 1827, Caroline Jane, daughter of
John Caplin, Master of the Leathersellers' Company, of the City of
London, and died at West Cliff, Dawlish, Devonshire, on March 11,
1895.
