   The President then addressed the Society         as   follows : —
      Gentlemen,
We meet, at length, in Apartments to the occupation of which we have
long looked forward, and in which we hope to find scientific, literary, and
social accommodation superior to that which we have hitherto enjoyed.
And   I  trust that we may consider ourselves established here with a
degree of permanency at least comparable to those which the Society ex
perienced in Crane Court and in Somerset House. In congratulating the
Society on this important step of localization,          I would express my hope
that  our continued westerly movement will not be misinterpreted.
Much of the practical vigour of the Society has always depended on the
action of Fellows engaged in the transactions of busy life ; and our
movement from Somerset House, and in a certain degree from the
regions frequented or inhabited by those able men, will                  I trust be
ascribed  to its proper  cause —  the  difficulty  of   finding a suitable place in

 1873.]                       President's Address.                             a
those parts of this great city in which commerce or manufacture is most
active, or in which the demands of the State are most imperative.
    Our Foreign Secretary, Professor \V". H. Miller, has intimated to the
 Council his wish to withdraw from the duties and the labours of the
 office which he has held for many years with advantage to the Society,
 and for which he is eminently adapted.        In offering to Professor Miller
 your thanks for his long-continued services,      I have to add my confidence
 that the office will be well sustained by the gentleman whom the Council
 submit for your election.
    It has not been usual for your Presidents to allude by name to those
 of your Ordinary Members whose decease the Society has had to lament
                                         I
 during the year last elapsed. But hope that an intimate friendship of
 more than fifty years will justify me, in your opinion, in alluding to one,
 the only Copley Medallist in our British List lost in the last year, the
 late Professor Sedgwick.       I  cannot sufficiently express my veneration
for the unselfishness, the love of truth, the kindliness of heart, which
 distinguished that extraordinary man ; and       I  cannot conceal the expres
 sion of my admiration of his general ability, and my strong confidence in
 the soundness of his judgment on controverted points which might come
 before him.    After this notice, I am bound to allude briefly to others
 whose names      will appear in our official Obituary. Confining my re
 marks to those who have furnished papers to our ' Transactions,' there
are : — the Bev. Ot. Fisher, first known by magnetic observations in an Arctic
 Expedition, and afterwards by bis instructions to our Naval Service ;
 Sir Henry Holland, the senior Fellow of the Society, equally distin
guished by his reputation in the Medical profession, by his fame as a
traveller, by his literary records of political and personal life, and by the
 mixture of science and sociality which endeared him to all who knew
him.     Dr. H. Bence Jones will be remembered for his labours in
reference to urinary chemistry, — W. J. M. Bankine for his mathematical
labours in problems of engineering and in the motions of fluids, — Sir F.
Bonalds for his knowledge of electricity, his introduction (collaterally
with others) of photographic self -registration, and his attempts at esta
blishing a telegraph not by galvanism but by electricity, — and A. Smith,
a Boyal Medallist, for his general mathematical acumen, and for the
application of it to the theory of the induced magnetism of iron ships.
    But nothing prevents me from alluding to the losses among our
Foreign Members.         The Baron Liebig, a Copley Medallist, was the
founder of a branch of chemical science, not entirely new, but carried
out by him to an extent and perfection that have given it importance
which we could hardly have expected it to attain. Professor Hansteen
personally observed terrestrial magnetism over a great extent of country,
and was    I believe the first person in modern times who endeavoured to
combine all the magnetical observations in different parts of the earth
then available, his own attempt to explain them being founded            on an
                                                                  b 2

assumption      as to the action of two great magnets.     On the merits of
Von    Mohl,   Rose, and  Poulletier  de Verneuil information  will be given
by Officers of the Society, who can speak with greater accuracy than        I
 could assume for my own statements.
     The Council of the Society, and its various Committees (for disposal
 of   the Government Grant, for the Library, for management of the
 Donation Fund, and of that appropriated to Scientific Relief), have been
 working with their usual activity. The principal grant recommended
 by the Government-Grant Committee, and sanctioned by the Council,
 was for the construction of a Siderostat, an instrument frequently de
 sired, but of which the expense is too great to be borne by an individual.
 It is  believed, however, that the cost may now be materially reduced.
                                I
     In my Report of last year alluded to the Catalogue of Scientific Papers,
 completed to 1863, and in progress to 1873 ; perhaps the following sin
 gular instance of its value may be interesting to the Society. In settling
 an international boundary, some years ago, reference was made to certain
 astronomical determinations.        The Government of the present day, on
 taking steps for ascertaining the boundary so defined, were unable to
 discover the official report of the astronomical observations.       On the
 application of the Government to me,      I carefully examined the papers of
 the Royal Observatory and those of the Board of Longitude ; but the
 Report was not found.        I  then requested our Assistant Secretary, Mr.
 White, to examine the papers of the Royal Society ; he was equally nu-
 successf ul. It occurred, however, to Mr. White to refer to the Catalogue of
  Scientific Papers for the published works of the astronomer who was known
 to have conducted the observations in question ; and there he discovered
  the desired Report, published under circumstances of solemn authenticity
 in a foreign periodical.    It is not improbable that the pecuniary value
  of this discovery may have many times exceeded the whole expense of
  forming the Catalogue.
      The Council have not been engaged during the past year in any cor
  respondence with our own Government or with Foreign Bodies ; they
  have, however, at the request of the President and Council of the Royal
  Geographical Society, appointed a Committee to confer with a Com
  mittee of that Society, on the best methods of utilizing for Physical
  Science any future Arctic Expedition.      But the Council have not taken
  any step in urging the proposal of such an Expedition on the attention of
  Her Majesty's Government.
      The Official Scientific Commission, of which your Home Secretaries
  and other Fellows of the Society are Members, have issued an important
  Report on the means of making our great Universities more available for
  the conduct of scientific investigation.    Other proposals have been pub
  lished, by independent Fellows of the Society, for universal instruction
  leading to physical investigation, and for the establishment of physica
 serv atories   .

1873.]                         President's Address.                         5
    In  speaking of the scientific subjects which have occupied the Ordinary
Meetings of the Society, or which have been intended for publication in
its 'Transactions' or its ' Proceedings,'   I may perhaps notice individually
the following : —
    In  Astronomy, we have communications from Messrs. Lockyer, Sea-
broke, and Huggins, on viewing the solar chromosphere and prominences.
And we have the elaborate paper of the Earl of Rosse on the heat
radiated from the Moon, with all the mbdifications depending on the
lunar phases and on the absorption produced by our atmosphere at
different elevations of the moon.
    In Oceanic Science, Mr. Wells has communicated observations on
the temperature of the sea between Greenland and Spitzbergen, esta
blishing the unexpected fact that the water on the Spitzbergen coast is
considerably    warmer than that on the Greenland      coast ; and Commander
Wharton      has ascertained with certainty that the outwards current of
the superficial waters from the Black Sea through the Bosphorus and
the Dardanelles is accompanied by an inwards current of the deeper
waters.
    In   Biology, we have experiments and remarks by Dr. Bastian and
 Messrs. Ray and Lankester on the development of life in organic infu
 sions, bearing partly on the disputed subject of spontaneous generation ;
and we have also a paper by Dr. Ward Richardson " On Muscular
 Irritability after Systemic Death," with other medical and physiological
 discussions.
    In  Palaeontology, Professor W. C. Williamson has continued his exa
 minations of the structure of fossil plants in the Coal-measures ; and
 Professor Owen has extended his description of the Fossil Mammals of
 Australia to those which may properly bo referred to the same family as
 the Kangaroos.
    In Botany, the more complex forms of leaf-arrangement around the
 parent stalk have been referred to the primary form of leaves arranged in
 two opposite ranks, by mechanical considerations of a simple character.
    In Chemistry we have numerous analyses and experiments, but,             I
 believe, no establishment of new general principles.
    In Optics, Messrs. Stearn and Lee have described the effects of pressure
 on   gases, in altering the character of their spectra.
    In Magnetism       I believe that the only memoir is one describing the
 internal magnetic influence of the largest iron tubes in existence, namely
 the great tubular bridges of Bangor and Conway.
    In Mechanics there is much information by Sir W. Fairbairn on the
 durability of iron ships, and on the strength of riveted joints ; and, in
 combination of meteorological facts with mechanical invention, Mr. F.
 Galton has planned a machine for indicating the best course for a ship.
    I  scarcely need to remark that a limited list of communications, like
 that which time permits me now to offer, must be very incomplete.

6                             Anniversary Meeting.                  [Dec. 1,
    The present appears, however, to be a proper opportunity for inviting
the attention of the Society to the progress of Sciences, of the same class
as those which it specially adopts for the subject of its own labours, in
the external world.
    Commencing with Astronomy. —It is very gratifying to Gravitational
Astronomers to learn that M. Le Verrier has communicated to the French
Acad^mie des Sciences (I believe in externa) his theories of Jupiter and
Saturn.  —In  Cometary Astronomy, the most striking fact is the unexpected
meteor-shower which occurred on November 27th, 1872.               Professor
Klinkerfues     telegraphed the report of this shower and its apparent
course to Mr. Pogson at Madras ; and Mr. Pogson, directing his telescope
in that line, discovered a comet receding from the earth, and (appa
rently beyond doubt) the representative of the meteor-shower.            The
course of this comet is so near to that of the lost Biela's comet as to
make it probable that it is really the same. — Dr. Huggins some time
 since found, from spectroscopic observations, traces of carbon in the
composition of comets ; this has been verified by Herr Vogcl and Mr.
Plummer in observations of comets in the present year. —Dr. Huggins
has employed the telescope supplied by this Society in scrutinizing seven
nebulse for discovery of motion or change, and in observations of their
 spectra, with the view of ascertaining their apparent motion to or from
our system ; and facility has been given to this research by the proxi
 mity of a spectral line of the nebul® to a line in the lead-spectrum :
 the results have not indicated any discoverable motion. — Father Secchi
 has remarked the sudden appearance of a brilliant point in the sun,
 which gave reversion of spectral lines, indicating ignition, with such
 a distortion of a line as appears to show that the igneous matter ap
 proached us ; that is, that there was explosion. — On the constitution of
 the sun there has been much controversy. — The Transit of Venus
 December 8th, 1874, has engaged much attention.           The Russian Go
 vernment is preparing to equip twenty-seven stations, all on land.
 The American Government proposes to establish three stations in the
 north and four or five in the south. The British original scheme of five
 stations has been extended, contingently, to eight : —two being regarded
 as subordinate to Honolulu, for strengthening       that important station ;
                                                                              '
 and one, at Heard Island (if information expected from the ' Challenger
 shall report it practicable), or at a second point of Kerguelen's Island,
 for strengthening that of Christmas Harbour. The French Government
 has proposed to establish five stations, and the German Government four.
 Some of our colonies and colonial observatories are taking up the matter
 with interest.     It is understood that Lord Lindsay is preparing a well-
 equipped private expedition to the Mauritius.        For ocular observation,
 the largest telescopes     are about 6 inches aperture ; with some of these,
 double-image measures of cusps, &c. are proposed, either by helio-
  meter, or by an eyepiece arranged by me many years ago.         For photo

  graphic records, some     will employ Mr. De La Eue's photoheliograph ;
 some   will endeavour to arm it with M. Janssen's arrangement for taking
 numerous pictures of Venus at small intervals ; some prefer a horizontal
 telescope 40 feet in length, into which the sun's rays will be thrown by a
 large plane mirror moved by a heliostat, and by which the primary
image    of the sun will be photographed.      A working model of the Transit
has been established at the Royal Observatory, by means of which the
singular optical phenomena are well seen.         My own estimate, and that
of my experienced friends, on the amount of uncertainty, reduces it
low ; but    I believe that my younger observers are not so successful. —
German astronomers have proposed to make use of observations of the
Minor Planets (Flora in the present year) for measuring the Solar
Parallax ; but    I conceive that Mars in 1877 will be very far superior. —
The publication of the Eclipses of 1870 and 1871 is still delayed, mainly
                                  I
by troubles with engravers. — am happy to state that, at the instance of
the Smithsonian Institution, and by the liberality of the Anglo-American
Company (who have declined all commercial remuneration), telegraphic
announcements of astronomical discoveries are now made direct from the
United States to Europe, and vice versd.
    In Geodesy and related subjects an important repetition of Caven
dish's experiment has been made by MM. Cornu and Bailie, using, for
the attracting material, hollow spheres filled with mercury, which was
transferred from one sphere to the other; the mean density of the
 earth thus obtained is 5-56. —It is proposed in France to repeat the
 observations for the great arc of meridian. — Allusion was made in the
 last two Addresses to the interruption of the Indian pendulum-observa
 tions by the death of Captain Basevi ; the pendulums (two the property
 of this Society, and two belonging to the Russian Government) have
  been brought to this country ; and observations of them have been made
  at Kew Observatory by Captain Heaviside. It is proposed,         I believe, to
  combine with these observations a re-observation of Rater's double-
  knife-edge pendulum.
     Geographical research    has been very active. — The ' Challenger,' after
  three times crossing the Atlantic, was last reported at Bahia.     One result
  of her operations is the establishment of a general uniformity of depth,
  averaging perhaps 2300 fathoms.         A second is, the ascertaining of the
  temperature    at different  depths ;  in some places in low latitudes tho
  deep-sea temperature is lower than in high latitudes.         A third is, the
  dredging up   of  Crustacea  of new   forms.   A fourth  is, the ascertaining
  the character of the soft bottom of the Atlantic : this will probably
  require the examination of the geologist. — Dredgings made among the
  banks of the New-England coast by Mr. Verrill have given results very
  similar to those of Dr. Carpenter. — The Congo expedition, fitted out,        I
  believe, by Mr. Young, and organized by the Royal Geographical Society,
  was last heard of at some distance up the country, at a point on the

 8                           Anniversary Meeting.                    [Dec.   1
 river which was gained, not by passage from its mouth, but by crossing
 from another landing-place. — Of the precise discoveries by Sir Samuel
 Baker, and the last year's movements of Dr. Livingstone, little seems to
 be known. — Political circumstances have stimulated much research in
 Central Asia. — But the interest of all these sinks before that of the
 Arctic explorers.     In the instance of the American ship ' Polaris,' nine
 teen men, women, and children, fortunately furnished with provisions,
 lived upon an icefloe (hopelessly separated from the ship in latitude
 80° 2') through the darkness of Arctic winter, drifting down Smith's
 Sound and Baffin's Bay, from October 15, 1872, to April 1, 1873,
                                                                          '
 then betook themselves to a boat, and were rescued by the ' Tigress on
 April 30, in sight of the coast of Labrador. Subsequently, eleven of
 the crew who had been left in the ship, then beset in the ice, built boats
 for themselves, and were picked up by the whaler ' Ravenscraig,' were
 transferred to the ' Arctic,' and were safely carried home.       Some addi
 tions were made to our knowledge of the regions north of Smith's
 Sound. —And another Swedish expedition, in the Polheen and Gladan,
 under the direction of Professor Nordenskiold, fast locked in a bay near
 the northern extremity of Spitsbergen, was rescued by the ' Diana.'          I
 must avow that the fortunate termination of these two enterprises does
 not in any degree blind me to the dangers of Arctic exploration in
 general.
    In  Geology, while the usual activity has been shown in collecting
 details, and the usual accuracy in discussing them,     I  am not aware of
 the introduction of any new principle, except in the theory proposed by
 Professor Dana, explaining the elevation of mountain-ground and con
 tinents   generally by the forced contraction which must have taken place
 in the crust of the earth in consequence of the cooling of the interior.
    In the maritime part of the publications of the Meteorological Office,
 an addition to the ten-degree square mentioned last year, applying to the
regions adjacent to that square, is now in the press.       Sir James Boss's
 observations south of the latitude 60° S., made in the expedition
 1840-1843,     have been published in an orderly form.      As regards local
meteorology,     a  new  and valuable  station has been  established at Stor-
noway    ;  the daily results of all stations are communicated, and proper
warnings given, to 129 places on the British coasts, and (at the request
of the French Government) to various ports from Dunkirk to Nantes.
In 1872, eighty per cent, of these warnings were successful. The daily
charts (first introduced by M. Le Verrier, but now issued on a highly
extended plan by the Meteorological Office) are circulated among a large
list of subscribers.    I think that comparison of the records of the various
atmospheric elements upon these charts, continued from day to day,
would be more likely than any thing yet published to throw light upon
the difficult question of causes and effects in Meteorology. — Dr. Daniel
Draper has traced the courses of rectilinear waves of cold and of storm

across    the United    States.   He has also shown that wind-storms            are
propagated from the shores of the United States to the shores of Britain ;
and in eighty-six predictions of storms to occur on the British coasts,
only three were failures. — At the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, a
laborious discussion of the photographic meteorological records 1848-1868
is now far advanced.
    In Anatomy, the most striking subject appears to be Professor Terrier's
experimental discussion of the actions of different parts of the brain,
explained at the late Meeting of the British Association.
     In Natural History, much has been added to our knowledge of birds
 by the works of Buller on New Zealand, Viscount Walden on Celebes,
 and the termination of Gould's labours on Great Britain. — Murie, Owen,
 and Newton have done much on special points in Comparative Ana
 tomy. — It seems probable that considerable knowledge of the habits of
 fishes may be gained from the large Aquaria lately established.
     Palaeontology has made considerable advances.            The most important
 publications are the following : — With the assistance of the Imperial
 Academy of St. Petersburg, Professor Von Brandt has given the results
 of a long series of researches on the fossil Cetacea of Europe, a work
 almost forming a supplement to Cuvier's ' Ossemens Fossiles.'               Aided
 by the Public Museum       of  Buenos Ayres,   Dr. Burmeister     has almost com
 pletely   restored  the  extinct  species  originally   indicated   by the names
  Toxodon, Glyptodon, Macrauchenia.        Professor Owen, in the ' Zoological
 Transactions,' has continued his restoration of the extinct Birds of New
 Zealand, and appears to have discovered evidence of the former existence
 of a wingless bird of great size. The principal advances in fossil Botany
 are those by Professor Williamson, already mentioned.
     Medicine, in its practical character and on the broad scale, has raised,
 but has not always solved, questions of great importance.             We are not
 yet able to assert   that contagious  diseases  can  or  cannot  commence with
 out antecedent contagion ; but the organization for tracing the course of
  contagion   is much improved, and may enable us ultimately to answer
                                                       "

  mometer, have given information which has led to improved treatment :
  the spectroscope promises to be useful in medical jurisprudence. —

  Surgery, as understand, has been made milder than formerly ; morbid
  fluids are more easily extracted ; large ulcers are healed by placing
  healthy skin upon them ; medicines are sometimes injected into the skin ;
  and there is general activity in the examination of surgical methods.
      The advances of scientific Botany have been principally in the follow
  ing directions : — Dr. Hooker and Mr. Bentham continue their Catalogue
  of the Genera of all known flowering plants ; Mr. Bentham has also ad
  vanced with his publication on the Australian Flora.            Discussions have
  arisen on the question whether Lichens are or are not parasites of a

 simpler form of Algae.      Much attention has been given to the Bacteria,
 and to    their  supposed agency in producing putrefaction. The mode of
 reproduction of Fungi has been a subject of examination and specula
 tion. The curious fact appears to be ascertained that movement of the
 leaf of the Dioncea muscipula produces electrical phenomena analogous to
 those in the movement of muscle.
    In   Chemistry, though a great number of analyses &c. have been
         I
 made, do not learn that any step of system or fundamental science has
 been taken, except in the doubts expressed whether the existence of four
 isomeric    lactic acids, apparently demonstrated by Wislicensis, can be
 made consistent with the present theory of organic chemistry.
    In the science of Optics a new determination of the velocity of light
 has been made by M. Cornu, using the method of transmission of a ray
 of light first directly, and then by reflection, between the teeth of a
 rotating wheel.       The velocity thus found in vacuo is 298,500 kilo
 metres per second of mean solar time. — M. Quincke, in experiments on
 diffraction, has shown that there is frequently an unexpected accom
 paniment of polarization.
    The practical science of Galvanic Telegraphy undergoes continual im
provement, especially in the power of transmitting numerous words in a
 short time, and in the arrangement of sympathetic clocks. — But the
 point to which     I would more particularly call attention is, that the prac
ticability of duplex telegraphy by simultaneous currents in opposite
 directions appears to be established, at least in many circumstances.       If
they are accurately simultaneous, the conclusion (previously entertained
by theorists) appears to be inevitable that the so-called currents are
 waves.
    M. D'Abbadie's Magnetic Survey of Abyssinia and Brazil, made several
years past, has lately been published.
    I have now to announce     the award of the Medals.
    The Copley Medal has been awarded by the Council to Professor Her
mann Ludwig Ferdinand Helmholtz, M.D., For. Memb. E.S. It would be
difficult for me, within the limits of this Address, to state the number and
the importance of the claims of Professor Helmholtz to our recognition.
His published books on the Conservation of Energy and the Theory of
Music, and his ' Handbook on Physiological Optics,' have assisted greatly
in the progress of their respective sciences. His memoirs have ranged
through nervous physiology, hydrodynamical theory, instruments (as the
ophthalmometer and the ophthalmoscope) for exact measurement and for
medical examination of the eye, and other important subjects, and have
been generally recognized as giving real additions to our knowledge.

 Helmholtz, and assure him that we appreciate very highly the services
 which he has rendered to various branches of science.
    A Royal Medal has been awarded to Professor Allman, F.R.S., for his
numerous         zoological investigations,     and more especially for his work
upon       the  Tubularian      Hydroids.     The  subject of these labours is one
upon which few persons are qualified to enter ; and the Council are im
pressed      with the delicacy of the work and the value of the scientific
results.
        Professor Allmast,
    In the name of the Council of the Royal Society,               I  present you with
this Medal,       in token of their appreciation        of your valuable services to
Zoology.
    A Royal Medal has been awarded to Professor Henry Enfield Roscoe,
F.R.8., for his various Chemical Researches, more especially for his in
vestigations       of the Chemical Action of Light, and of the Combinations
of Vanadium.
         Professor, Rosoob,
     I have much pleasure, as the organ of the Council of the Royal
Society, in presenting you with this Medal, in testimony of the value
 which the Council attach to your various Chemical researches.
     And now, gentlemen,          I have to make    an announcement which        I could
 wish     I had been     able to defer for some years.      I must ask you to accept
 my resignation        of the office of President.     I do this with great regret, for
 more     than one reason.        I scarcely need to say that    I  received with great
pride your honourable call to that office, and that         I should have valued even
 more highly a series of repetitions of the expression of your confidence.
 It   is   matter of much grief to me, personally, that            I  feel myself com
 pelled to abandon         this gratification ; but  I  am more grieved because        I
 feel that the Presidential office has not been properly sustained, and that
 a continuance of tenure by me might permanently endanger its efficiency.
 The primary causes of this failure are : — the severity of official duties,
 which seem to increase, while vigour to discharge them does not increase ;
 and the distance of my residence.               It has resulted from these causes
  that    I have been unable to attend Council and Committee Meetings and
  Meetings of the Society, and Trust Meetings connected with the Presi
  dency, so    fully  as I could have wished — that I have     been unable to establish
  that personal acquaintance           with my colleagues which     I hold to be almost
  essential    for the good conduct of a      Society — and that    I could not hope to
  carry out     any measure beyond the merest routine.           The difficulties which

I have mentioned      might have been met in some degree by properlyarranged
expenditure, if such had       been legitimately in my power ; but another
cause now comes on which                I fear   cannot be met, a difficulty of hearing,
which unfits me for effective action as Chairman of Council.
     I
    respect the sentiment which has prompted the Society to seek                           for
its President a man of supposed scientific character, and, perhaps in pre
ference, a man in official scientific position ; and            I
                                                     join in the unanimous
feeling of the Council that, this principle being admitted, its application
could never have      been          better made than in the selection of the Fellow
whom they recommend to you as successor to myself.           But still think  I
that, practically viewed, the principle is not the best that can be adopted—
and that considerations on the leisure which the President can devote
to the concerns of the Society, on the proximity which enables him at
any moment to enter into its business, and on the personal vigour which
he may be expected to bring into all his transactions with     ought to       it,
hold   very important place.

   But, in retiring from the Presidency, and practically from the Council,
I do not, gentlemen, retire from the Society.   There are other positions
in which     may hope to render service.

cated to them and in this capacity my power of meeting the wishes of

                             October 31, 1873.
The only change of consequence affecting           the management of the
 Observatory during the year has been caused by the resignation by
Mr. Spottiswoode of his seat on the Committee.        The vacancy thus occa
sioned has been filled up by the appointment of Major-Gen. Strachey,
while the Earl of Rosse has been nominated      as an additional  member  of
the Committee.
   Magnetic Work. — The series of automatic records of the several Mag-
netographs, viz. Declinometer, Horizontal-Force, and Vertical-Force instru
ments, have been continued, and the independent absolute determinations
have been, as usual, made monthly. This latter duty has been, as hereto
fore, performed by Mr. G. M. Whipple, B.Sc, First Assistant, who also
takes charge of the General Magnetic Work, in which he has the assist
ance of Mr. Cullum.      The salaries of these two gentlemen, whose time
is chiefly devoted to magnetic work, amounted during the period under
consideration to £249 12s. 6c?., leaving a balance of about £350 out of the
sum of £608 0s.    Id. received from the Royal Society to meet the general
expenses (£1979 10s. Id.) of the Observatory.         £673 4s. 5d. of this
amount has been defrayed by the Meteorological Office ; and £613' 0s. Id.
has been   obtained from other sources, such as fees for verification of
instruments, and payments for new instruments for foreign observatories,
leaving a balance in hand of £522 3s.    Id. on the 31st of October.

                        Report of the Kew Committee.                         21
     On the 2nd of December the suspension-thread         of the Declinometer
  gave way and was replaced by a new one.
     Arrangements have been made to dismount the Magnetograph instru
  ments   in the course of the ensuing year, on the occasion of painting
  the basement story, in order to have them thoroughly examined and
  readjusted — a step which has become necessary, as their continuous action
  has not been interrupted for 15 years.
     As regards the Magnetic Seductions, the Tabulations of Declination
  have been continued to the end of 1872 ; and copies of the results have
  been intrusted, for discussion, to the two Sergeants of the Royal Artillery
  who are located at Kew, as explained in the last Eeport. Magnetic data
  have been supplied to Prof. Balfour Stewart, F.R.S., Owens Coll.,
  Manchester, Prof. Atkinson, R. Mil. Coll., Sandhurst, Mr. W. Gee,
 Cheetham Hill, Manchester, Mr. H. Proctor, N. Shields, Mr. Reid, and
 to Dr. Stein of Frankfort.
     The stock of forms having become exhausted, care has been taken in
 ordering a fresh supply to procure a quantity sufficient to meet possible
 requisitions from other observatories.
     AUnifilar and Dip-circle, formerly in store at the Observatory, have been
 repaired and set to rights, preparatory to their being lent to the Eev.
 S. J. Perry for use on the expedition to observe the Transit of Venus.
    Meteorological Work. — The several self-recording instruments, register
 ing respectively the Pressure, Temperature, Vapour-tension, Rainfall, and
 Wind, have been maintained in constant action under the superintendence
of Mr. T. W. Baker, Second Assistant, aided by Mr. Figg ; and the daily
standard eye-observations for control of the photographic records have
been made regularly.
    The instrumental traces with hourly tabulated values are sent monthly
 to the Meteorological Office as in former years. The Barograms and Ther
mograms are printed off in duplicate, and one copy is preserved at Kew.
As regards the Anomograms and Rain-records, the copy has been ob
tained by the method of tracing.
    In addition to the regular work of Kew as a Magnetical and Meteoro
logical Observatory, the duty of examining and checking the work of all
the seven Self-recording Observatories in connexion with the Meteoro
logical Office has been carried on, in accordance with the method described
in the Eeport of the British Association for 1869. This portion of the
work has been performed by Messrs. Rigby and Foster.
    A series of experiments are being carried on at the expense of the
Meteorological Committee, at the Pagoda in Kew Gardens, to test the
influence of height above the ground on temperature.       The thermometers
are placed at three different levels, viz. 22 feet 6 inches, 69 feet, and
128 feet 10 inches above the ground.
    Copies of Meteorological data have been supplied to Mr. G.      J. Symons
and the Secretary of the Institute of Mining Engineers.

22                    Report of the Keiv Committee.
  Photoluliograph. — As soon as the experiments with this instrument
mentioned in last Beport were completed it was taken down, and, on
application from the Astronomer Boyal, intrusted to him for use at
Greenwich, in taking sun-pictures pending the return of the new instru
ments to be used in observing the Transit of Venus. The scale of equal
parts, erected on the Pagoda in Kew Gardens, in order to test the optical
distortion       any) of the Kew Photoheliograph, has been taken down
                (if
by  the  direction  of Mr. De La Eue, and any slight damage done to the
building has been made good at the expense of that gentleman, and to
the satisfaction of the Clerk of the Works at Kew.     The scale itself has
been made over to the Astronomer Boyal by Mr. De La Bue.
   The thanks of the Committee have been conveyed to H.M.'s Office of
Works for the facilities kindly afforded for the above experiments.
   The eye-observations of the sun, after the method of Hofrath Schwabe,
have been made daily by Mr. Foster, when possible, as described in the
last Beport, in order, for the present, to maintain the continuity of the
Kew record of sun-spots.
   An additional series of positives, from the Kew negative pictures,
is  now being printed           photographer, at the expense of Mr. De
                                     by   a
La Bue.
   A statement, embodying the usual data respecting the spots &c. on the
sun's disk, has been, as usual, published in the 'Monthly Notices of
the Boyal Astronomical Society.'
   Prof. Spoerer, of Anclam, has applied for the measurements of sun-
spots for the months            of
                           January and February 1872, during the period
of his own illness and Mr. De La Bue has kindly promised to furnish
                          ;
them as soon as their reduction has been effected.
   Electrometer. — This instrument, the property of the Meteorological
Committee, which was returned for readjustment to the maker, Mr.
White, of Glasgow, in September 1872 (Beport, 1872),          isstill in his
hands.      The instrument,     self-recording one, has never yet been in
                                          a
working order.
                   — This department of the Observatory has been in full
   Verifications.
activity and the work has increased largely as regards barometers and
          ;
clinical thermometers, so that almost the entire time of Mr. Baker and
a junior assistant     occupied therewith.
                          is
   The following magnetic instruments have been verified and constants

     3 Dip-circles for Mr. L. P. Casella, Loudon.
     2 Dipping-needles for H.M.S. ' Challenger.'
    An Azimuth Compass for Mr. Ney Elias, F.B.G.S.
    Determinations     of the Moments of Inertia have been made of two
 magnets    used by Capt. F. J. Evans, C.B., F.B.S., when swinging iron
 ships.
    Several  instruments are on hand awaiting verification.         Among them
 may be   mentioned a Unifilarand Dip-circle received from Prof. Stewart,
for use abroad, and a set of Magnets, for determination of their con
 stants, destined for the observatory of Don Luiz at Lisbon.
    At the request of the Eev. S. J. Perry, a complete set of Magneto-
graphs have been ordered for transmission to Zi-ka-wei, near Shanghai,
to the Eev. A. M. Colombel, who received instruction at Kew in the year
 1868.
    The meteorological instruments        which   have been verified are as fol

    In addition, nine Kew Standard Thermometers            have been     calibrated
 and   divided at Kew, and two      glass tubes have    been   graduated to milli
 metres.
     The following miscellaneous instruments       have also been verified    : —
                       Bain-gauge,   1, with graduated glass.
                       Bobinson's  Dial-anemometer, 1.
    Allusion was made in the last Beport to the difficulty of testing ane
 mometers, owing to the limitation of space at disposal for the purpose.
 In the course of the year a grant was obtained from the Government-
 Grant Committee for the purpose of carrying on a series of such experi
  ments ; and a piece of ground in the Park has been rented.                Several
 anemometers, of various constructions,         have  been   erected therein,    and
 experiments are still in progress.
    A Pressure-plate Anemometer,        by Mr. Oxley, of Manchester,      has been
 tested,   but not with satisfactory results.

24                      Report  of the Kew    Committee.
   Experiments      were  made with a spare Barograph       belonging to the
Meteorological Committee, in order to ascertain the amount of optical
distortion,   if any, produced by the lenses.
    "Waxed paper for photographic purposes has been supplied to the
Meteorological Office (3 reams), to the India Office (1 ream), and to the
Badclifle Observatory        ream).
    Instruction  in the use of magnetical or meteorological instruments has
been given to the following gentlemen : —
   Dr. E. van Bijckevorsel in magnetical work.
   Nav. Lieut. Dixon, B.N., H.M.8. ' Nassau,' in magnetical work.
   Staff Comr. Creak, B.N., made observations with a Fox's Circle for
H.M.S. « Challenger,' and with a Fox's Circle for H.M.8. ' Nassau.'
    Capt. Evans, C.B., F.B.S., made some observations with a magneto
meter constructed after his own design.
   Photographs of the portable magnetic instruments, of the most ap
proved patterns, have been taken for the use of persons seeking in
formation.
   In the month of May a request was received from Col. J. T. "Walker,
F.B.S., Superintendent of the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India,
through the Chairman of the Committee, for provision to be made at the
Observatory for vibrating pendulums.
   In the year 1865 two pendulums lent by the Boyal Society for use in
India had been vibrated at Kew by the late Capt. Basevi   ; and it was neces
sary that these pendulums should be vibrated again on their return, and
that at the same time two pendulums obtained from the Imperial Aca
demy of Sciences at St. Petersburg should also be vibrated.
   The Committee at once complied with the request ; and at the expense
of the Indian Government preparation was made for the experiments in
the south hall on the basement story, by removing for a time the appa
ratus for testing sextants, and building up from the foundation-arches
two solid isolated supports for the Bussian clock and pendulum.
   Capt. Heaviside, B.E., the officer charged with the duty of making
the pendulum experiments, arrived in England in July, and, finding all
the arrangements satisfactory, at once commenced his experiments, which
are still in progress.
   Endeavours were made, in connexion with the arrangements just
mentioned, to obtain      an electrical time communication     between Kew
and the Boyal Observatory        at Greenwich   ; but the proposal failed of
success.
   Instruments.   —The Kew     Standard Barometer, Newman 34, has been
cleaned by    Messrs.  Negretti and Zambra.
   In January a new Minimum Thermometer by Casella was obtained to
replace the old instrument, which had been accidentally broken.
   The several pieces of Mechanical Apparatus, such as the "Whitworth
Lathe and Planing Machine, procured by Grants from either the Govern

 ment   Grant Fund or the Donation Fund, have been kept in thorough
order   ; and many of them are in constant use at the Observatory.
   A supply of filled thermometer-tubes, of various ranges, has been pro
cured for ultimate graduation as required.
   The Committee have, through their Hon. Secretary Mr. Scott, who
was present at the Meteorological Congress at Vienna in the month of
September, as one of the Delegates from this country, professed their
readiness to graduate standard thermometers for any of the Continental
observatories      which  may require them, on condition that the tubes
supplied for graduation are sufficiently old.
   Library. — The usual Donations of English and Foreign Scientific
Publications have been received, and a few standard works purchased.

   Staff. The Staff employed at Kew is as follows : Mr. Samuel Jeffery,
Superintendent ; G. M. Whipple, B.Sc, First Assistant ; T. W. Baker,
8econd Assistant; A. J. Eigby, J. E. Cullum, J. Foster, F. Figg, E.
Constable.
   Note. — Mr.      F. J. Page resigned   his appointment in January,  and
B. Bensted was appointed       as Junior Assistant. This gentleman has also
left, and his place has been filled by E. Constable.
   In accordance with a precedent established by the Kew Committee of
the British Association, by a Eesolution passed in October 1867, Mr.
B. Loewy was employed to give instruction to the Assistants. The
present Committee, in March last, resolved to resume this practice, and
Mr. G. M. Whipple was appointed to give a course of instruction in
 Mathematics ; and he commenced his Lectures in April.
   Mr. Robert H. Scott, F.E.S., continues to act as Honorary Secretary
to the Committee.
    Visiters. —The Observatory has been honoured during the year by the

       College, Belfast. Communicated by Sir William Thomson,
       LL.D., F.R.S.            Received   June 20, 1873.
     In two communications made by me to the British Association at its
Meetings at Edinburgh in 1871, and at Brighton in 1872, and printed as
abstracts in the Transactions of the Sections for those years, considera
tions were adduced on relations between the gaseous, the liquid, and the
solid states of matter. The new subject of the present paper constitutes
a further development     of some of those previous considerations ; and a
brief sketch of these     necessary here as an introduction for rendering
                          is^
intelligible what    to follow.
                     is
   Taking    into consideration  any substance which we can have in the
three states, gaseous, liquid, and solid, we may observe that, when any
two of these states are present in contact together, the pressure and
temperature are dependent each on the other, so that when one    givenis
the other  fixed.
           is      Then, we denote geometrically all possible points of
                                 if
temperature and pressure jointly by points spread continuously in planea
surface, each point in the plane being referred to two axes of rectangu
lar coordinates, so that one of its ordinates shall represent the tempera
ture and the other the pressure denoted            by
                                            that point, we may notice
that there will be three curves — one expressing the relation between
temperature and pressure for gas with liquid, another expressing that for
gas with solid, and another expressing that for liquid with solid. These
three curves,   it   appears, must all meet or cross each other in one point

  of pressure and temperature jointly, which may be called the triple
  point *.
      The curve between gas and liquid, which may be called the boiling-line,
  will be a separating boundary between the regions of the plane corre
  sponding      to the ordinary liquid and those corresponding to the ordinary
  gaseous state.            But by consideration of Dr. Andrews's experimental
  results (Phil. Trans. 1869), we may see that this separating boundary
  comes to an end at a point of temperature and pressure which, in
  conformity with his language, may be called the critical point of pressure
  and temperature jointly ; and we may see that, from any liquid state
  to any gaseous state, the transition may be gradually effected by an
  infinite variety of courses passing round the extreme end of the boiling-
  line t.
      The accompanying figure serves to illustrate these considerations in
  reference to transitions between the three states, the gaseous, the liquid,
  and the solid.          The figure is intended only as a sketch to illustrate prin
  ciples, and is not drawn according to measurements for any particular
  substance, though the main features of the curves shown in it are meant
  to relate in a general way to the substance of water, steam, and ice.
  A X and A T are the axes of coordinates for temperatures and pres-
     * In making this statement, that it appears that the three curves mast all cross each

  other in one point, would wish to offer it here (as previously did in the 1871 British-
  Association paper) subject to some reserve in respect of conditions not yet known with
  perfect clearness and certainty.        I have to suggest that we might not be quite safe in
  assuming    that,  within    a cavity  containing   nothing but pure water-substance       partly
  gaseous,  the melting     temperature   and  pressure  of ice solidified from  the  gaseous state
  would bo the same as the melting temperature and pressure of ice frozen from the liquid
 state, and in making other suppositions, such as that the same quantity of heat would
 become latent in the melting of equal quantities of ice formed in these two ways, and in
                                  I
 neglecting conceivable but, presume, as yet imperfectly known distinctions of capillary
 conditions between ice amply wet with water and ice only moistened with the last
 vestiges of water before the whole liquid may be either evaporated or frozen. It might
 be a question in like manner whether wo can be sure that there can be theoretically a
 condition of repose in a cavity containing only perfectly pure water-substance in which
 the three states are present together, each in contact with the other two, so that there
would be ice partlj wet with water, and partly dry in contact with gaseous water-sub
stance, or steam as it may be called, while the water and steam were also in contact with
each other.     I   offer these remarks by way of caution, as they foroe themselves into
notice when we attempt to sketch out the features of the three curves under considera
tion, and because they may serve to suggest questions for experimental and theoretical
investigation which may have been generally overlooked before.              In the present paper,
however,    I proceed on assumptions, such as are usually tacitly made, of identity in the
thermal and dynamic conditions of pure ice solidified in different ways, assumptions
which, so far as is known, may be, and probably are, perfectly true ; and proceed onI
the supposition that there can be theoretically the condition of repose here alluded to,
of the solid, liquid, and gaseous states, present together each in contact with the other
two — and consequently that the three curves would meet or cross each other in one point,
which    I have called the triple point.                                          »

represents the boiling-line terminating in the critical point E.   The line
T M represents the line between liquid and solid. It is drawn showing
in an exaggerated degree the lowering of the freezing temperature of
water by pressure, the exaggeration being necessary to allow small
changes of temperature to be perceptible in the diagram.      The line T N
represents the line between the gaseous and the solid states of water-
substance.    The line  LTN    appears to have been generally (in the dis
cussion of experimental results on the pressure of aqueous vapour above
and below the freezing-point) regarded as one continuous curve ; but it
was a part of my object in the two British- Association papers referred
to, to show that it ought to be considered two distinct curves (L T P
and   NT   Q) crossing each other in the triple point T.
   In the second of the two British-Association papers already referred
to (the one read at the Brighton Meeting, 1872),    I gave demonstrations
showing that these two curves L T and N T should meet, as shown in
the accompanying figure, with a re-entrant angle at T, not with a salient
angle such as is exemplified in the vertex of a pointed arch, and offered
in conclusion the suggestion that the reasoning which had been adduced
 might be followed up by a quantitative calculation founded on experi
mental data, by which calculation the difference of the pressures of steam
with water and steam with ice for any given temperature very near the
triple point may be found with a very close approximation to the truth.
   In the month of last October (October 1872)          I explained to my
brother, Sir William Thomson, the nature of that contemplated quanti
tative calculation : I                                      I
                       mentioned to him the method which had prepared
for carrying out the intended investigation, and inquired of him for some
of the experimental data, or data already deduced by theory from experi-

meats, which          I
                 was seeking to obtain.    On his attention being thus
turned to the matter, he noticed that the desired quantitative relation
could be obtained very directly and easily from a simple formula which
he had given in his paper on the Dynamical Theory of Heat, Transac
tions of the Eoyal Society of Edinburgh, March 17, 1851, § 21 (3), to
express the second law of thermodynamics for a body of uniform tem
perature throughout, exposed to pressure equal in all directions.

crease per unit increase of temperature, the volume being kept constant ;
C denotes Carnot's function ; and M denotes the rate of absorption at
which heat must be supplied to the substance per unit augmentation
of volume, to let it expand without varying in temperature. The body
may be either homogeneous throughout, as a continuous solid, or liquid,
or gas ; or it may be heterogeneous, as a mass of water and aqueous
vapour    (t.   e.   steam), or ice and water, or ice and aqueous vapour                            (i.   e.
steam).
   Now apply that formula, 1st, to steam with water, and, 2nd, to steam
with ice, the temperature of the heterogeneous body in each case being
that of the triple point or we may, for the present purpose, say 0° Centi

                                                                     is

brought under consideration,                it    is   a   matter     of indifference whether the
volume be kept constant or not                    ;    because      the pressure of steam in' con
tact either with water or with ice, for any given temperature,    inde                         is
pendent of the volume of the whole heterogeneous body      so  that the                ;
change of pressure for change of temperature                             is   independent   of whether
there be change of volume or not.   As             function of the tempera

notation as before, but modifying           by the use of an accent where

by Regnault, is 606-5 thermic units, the thermic unit being here taken
as the heat which would raise the temperature of one pound of water
one degree Centigrade ; and the latent heat of fusion of ice is about 78 or
79 of the same thermic units. Hence, though M and M' belong each to

   This shows that for any small descent in temperature from the triple
point (where the pressure of steam with ice          the same as that of steam

as does the pressure of steam with water.

fit very closely to the results exhibited in that curve, and of his final

 Tables    of results at the close of bis memoir; and by every mode of
  scrutiny which     I have brought to bear on the subject (in fact by each
 of some seven or eight varied modes)         I  have met with clear indication
 of the existence of the expected feature ; and by some of them                I   have
 found that it can readily be brought prominently into notice.                      The
 engraved curve drawn on the copper plate by Eegnault himself is offered
 by him as the definitive expression of his experiments, as being an expres
  sion which satisfies as well as possible the aggregate of his observations —
 subject, however, to a very slight alteration, which he has pointed out as
 a requisite amendment in the part of the curve immediately below the
 freezing-point, a part with which the investigations in the present paper
 are specially concerned.
     After telling (page 581) of the great care with which he had marked
 the curve on the copper plate and got it engraved, he says : — " Je n'ai
 pas pu eviter Dependant quelques petites        irregularites dans les courbes ;
 mais une      seule   de ces irregularites me parait assez importante pour
 devoir etre signalee.      Elle se presente pour les basses temperatures com
 prises entreO°et —16°; la courbe creuse trop vers l'axe des temperatures,
 elle laisse, notablement au-dessus d'elle, toutes les determinations experi-
 mentales qui ont 6t6 faites entre 0° et —10°. Ainsi les valeurs, que cette
 petite portion de la courbe donne pour les forces elastiques, sont un peu
 trop faibles, et j'ai eu soin    de les augmenter, de la quantity       convenable,
 dans les nombres que je donnerai plus loin."           Whether we are now to
 think that this bend downwards * of the curve towards the axis of tem
 peratures, involving what Eegnault regarded as a small faulty departure
 of his drawn curve from his actual experiments, was introduced merely
 by a casual want of accuracy in drawing, or whether we may suppose
 that possibly there may have been some experimental observations which
 attracted the curve downwards, but were afterwards rejected on a suppo
 sition of their being untrustworthy, it appears that such a bend is a
feature which the curve really ought to possess, and is one which even
 after being partially smoothed off by way of correction is not obliterated,
 but still remains clearly discoverable in the final numerical tables of results.
    This is best brought to light by means of the empirical formula)
devised and employed by Eegnault for the collating of his results.
He proceeded evidently under the idea of the curve being continuous in
its nature, so that a single formula might represent the pressures of
aqueous vapour throughout the whole of his experiments; but before
seeking for such a formula he proceeded to calculate several local for
mula) of which each should represent very exactly his experiments
between limits of temperature not wide apart ; and afterwards he worked
out several general formula), each adapted singly for the whole range of
his experiments.

   In regard to the one of these general formulas which he designates as
formula (H)*, he says that it represents the aggregate of his determina
tions of the pressures of the vapour of water, referred to the air-ther
mometer, and extending between the extreme temperatures of —33° and
+ 232° with such precision that there could not be any hope of attaining
to representing them better by any other mode of interpolation, because
the differences, he says, between the calculated numbers and the numbers
deduced from his graphic constructions are always smaller than the pro
bable errors of observation.  Still, for making out his final general Table
of pressures of steam for every degree of the air-thermometer from —30°
to +230°, he used three local formulae, finding that by them he could
get slightly closer agreements with his experimental determinations than
by using the single formula (H) for the whole range. Thus between
 —32° and 0° he used his formula designated as (E) ; from 0° to 100° he
used his formula (D) ; and between 100° and 230° he used his formula
(H). He points out (page G23) that he might have calculated this Table
throughout its entire extent by the single formula (H), and that he would
thus have got almost identically the same values by it from 100° down
to 40° as those he calculated by the formula (D), but that between +40°
and —20° the pressures given by the formula (H) would be slightly too
small.   This gives indication of the existence of the feature which it is
my object at present to bring into view ; and an examination of the
column of Differences in Regnault's Table on his page 608, adapted for
comparing the pressures got from experiments as expressed by his graphic
curve with those got from the formula (H), shows distinctly a re-entrant
angle, or at least a flattened place, in the curve at or about 0°. Several
other like comparisons, by means of his other formula), give like indica
tions ; but most of these may for brevity be passed over without further
mention here. The most decisive indication comes out in the following
way. We may observe that for temperatures adjacent to the freezing-
point and extending both ways from           it,
                                          Eegnault finally adopted as fitting
best to his experiments the formula (E) for temperatures descending
from 0°, and the formula (D) for temperatures ascending from 0°. He
tried (at pages 598, 699 of his memoir) the continuing of the application
of his formula (D) beyond the inferior of the two limits 0° and 100°, for
which he had specially aimed at adapting        to his experimental deter
                                                    it
minations and he found that in calculating by
            ;                                        the pressures which

would give for temperatures below 0°, these pressures come out always
slightly in excess of those which were given             by
                                                  his experiments.      have    I

1-10; while its value brought out in the earlier part of the       present
paper by my brother's quantitative calculation was 1-13 ; and       so the
feature expected shows itself here in Eegnault's results almost      in the
full extent in which theory shows that it ought to exist.
   Eegnault gives in the same memoir (page 627 and following        pages)
another Table, one intended chiefly for meteorological purposes,    and in
which the pressures are stated from —10° to +35° for every             of  a
degree. In this Table the numbers inserted as representing the pressures
below the freezing-point are slightly different from the corresponding
ones in his general Table already referred to ; and he mentions that this
slight discrepance has resulted from the fact that the two Tables were
formed at different periods, and were not calculated by the same formula ;
but he remarks that the differences are insignificant, as they scarcely
amount to -02 millimetre. Here, too, as in the general Table, the feature
expected shows itself, though in a diminished degree. By a careful
examination of its column of Differences for -jij of a degree, and by
making a few small arithmetical adjustments which may be regarded as

36    On the Gaseous, Liquid, and Solid States       of Water.    [Dec. 11,
amendments     in the way of interpolation in that column,      I  find that,
according   to the experimental    results as they are represented    in this
Table, the value of      at the freezing-point would come out to be about
                     dp
                     dt
 1*05 or 1-06.   We have   seen by the new calculation,  based on theory, in
the present paper that it ought be 1*13 ;      so here the feature is found
showing itself in about half the degree in which, according to the new
quantitative calculation, it ought to be met with.       When we consider
that Begnault's reductions of his experimental results in the making out
of curves, formula, and tables for representing them in the aggregate
were, as we have sufficient ground to suppose, carried out under the idea,
now proved to be erroneous, of there being, for aqueous vapour, con
tinuity in variations of pressure with variations of temperature past the
freezing-point, just as past any other point of temperature, and when we
further consider that the quantities with which we are here concerned are
indeed very small, it is not surprising that there should have been a
tendency to smooth off this feature on the supposition that any depar
tures of the experimental observations from the course of a continuous
or smooth curve were only slight irregularities due to experimental
errors or imperfections.
   It may now, in conclusion, be remarked that if from experiments inde
pendent of those which have been made, or may be made, directly on the
pressure of aqueous vapour at different temperatures near the freezing-
point, both above and below it, very correct determinations of the values
of the quantities C, M, and M' can be made, such determinations will
lead to more correct evaluations of        md  —   for  aqueous  vapour    in
contact in the one case with liquid water, and in the other with ice, than
we at present possess.     Such determinations, we may presume further,
would,  if very trustworthily arrived at, conduce to the attainment of a
more correct estimate of the density of steam at the freezing-point (or at
the triple point) than we now possess.      In fact, in connexion with the
subject which has been here under consideration, there are various im
portant quantities so connected that improved determinations of one or
more of them may lead to more correct evaluations of others.

 II. " On   the Action   of Heat on Gravitating Masses." By William
            Ckookes, F.R.S. &c. Received August 12, 1873.
                                    (Abstract.)
    The experiments recorded in this paper have arisen from observations
 made when using the vacuum-balance, described by the author in his
paper " On the Atomic Weight of Thallium"*, for weighing substances
 which were of a higher temperature than the surrounding air and the
weights. There appeared to be a diminution of the force of gravitation ;
and experiments were instituted to render the action more sensible, and
to eliminate sources of error.
    In an historical resume of the state of our knowledge on the subject of
attraction or repulsion by heat, it is shown that in 1792 the Rev. A.
Bennet recorded the fact that a light substance delicately suspended in
air was attracted by warm bodies : this he ascribed to air-currents.
When light was focused, by means of a lens, on one end of a delicately
suspended arm, either in air or in an exhausted receiver, no motion
could be perceived distinguishable from the effects of heat.
    Laplace spoke of the repulsive force of heat. Libri attributed the
 movement of a drop of liquid along a wire heated at one end, to the re
pulsive force of heat ; but Baden Powell did not succeed in obtaining
 evidence of repulsion by heat from this experiment.
    Fresnel described an experiment by which concentrated solar light and
heat caused repulsion between one delicately suspended and one fixed
disk. The experiment was tried in air of different densities ; but con
 tradictory results were obtained under apparently similar circumstances
 at different times, and the experiments were not proceeded with.
    Saigey described experiments which appeared to prove that a marked
attraction existed between bodies of different temperatures.
    Forbes, in   a discussion    and   repetition of Trevelyan's       experiment,
came to the conclusion that there was a repulsive action exercised in the
 transmission of heat from one body into another which had a less power
of conducting it.
    Baden   Powell, repeating Fresnel's experiment, explained the results
otherwise than as due to repulsion by heat. By observing the descent of
the tints of Newton's Rings between glass plates when heat was applied,
 Baden Powell showed that the interval between the plates increased, and
attributed this to a repulsive action of heat.
    Faye introduced the hypothesis of a repulsive force          of heat to account
for certain astronomical phenomena.             He described     an experiment to
show that heat produced repulsion in the luminous arc            given by an induc
tion-coil in rarefied air.

and more delicate, which enabled him to detect and then to render very
sensible an action exerted by heat on gravitating bodies, which is not
due to air-currents or to any other known form of force.
   The following experiment with a balance made of a straw beam with
pith-ball masses at the ends enclosed in a glass tube and connected with
a Sprengel pump, may be quoted from the paper : —
   " The whole being fitted up as here shown, and the apparatus being
                             I
full of air to begin with, passed a spirit-flame across the lower part of
the tube at b, observing the movement by a low-power micrometer ; the
pith ball (a, b) descended slightly, and then immediately rose to con
siderably above its original position.     It seemed as if the true action of
the heat was one of attraction, instantly overcome by ascending currents
of air
   " 31. In order to apply the heat in a more regular manner, a thermo
meter was inserted in a glass tube, having at its extremity a glass bulb
about 1£ inch in diameter ; it was filled with water and then sealed up. . .
The water was kept heated to 70° C, the temperature of the laboratory
being about 15° C.
   " 32. The barometer being at 767 milUms. and the gauge at zero, the
hot bulb was placed beneath the pith ball at b. The ball rose rapidly ;
as soon as    equilibrium was restored,   I placed  the hot-water bulb above
the pith ball at a, when it rose again, more slowly, however, than when
the heat was applied beneath it.
   " 33. The pump was set to work ; and when the gauge was 147 millims.
below the barometer, the experiment was tried again ; the same result,
only more feeble, was obtained.     The exhaustion was continued, stopping
the pump from time to time, to observe the effect of heat, when it was
seen that the effect of the hot body regularly diminished as the rarefac
tion increased, until when the gauge was about 12 millims. below the
barometer the action of the hot body was scarcely noticeable.               At
10 millims. below it was still less ;^ whilst when there was only a difference
of 7 millims. between the barometer and the gauge, neither the hot-
water bulb, the hot rod, nor the spirit-flame caused the ball to move in
an appreciable degree. The inference was almost irresistible that the
rising of the pith was only due to currents of air, and that at this near
approach to a vacuum the residual air was too highly rarefied to have
power in its rising to overcome the inertia of the straw beam and the
pith balls. A more delicate instrument would doubtless show traces of
movement at a still nearer approach to a vacuum ; but it seemed evident
that when the last trace of air had been removed from the tube surround
ing the balance — when the balance was suspended in empty space only —
the pith-ball would remain motionless, wherever the hot body were
applied to it.
   " 34.  I  continued exhausting.      On next applying heat, the result
showed   that  I  was  far from having discovered the law governing these

 which had been observed at lower rarefactions.      With the gauge 3 millims.
 below the barometer, the ascension of the pith when a hot body was
 placed beneath     it was equal to what it had been in air of ordinary
 density ; whilst   with  the gauge and barometer level its upward move
 ments were not only sharper than they had been in air, but they
 took place under the influence, of far less heat ; the finger, for example,
instantly sending the ball up to its fullest extent."
    A  piece of ice produced exactly the opposite effect to a hot body.
    Numerous experiments are next given to prove that the action is not
due to electricity.
   The presence of air having so marked an influence on the action of
heat, an apparatus was fitted up in which the source of heat (a platinum
spiral rendered incandescent by electricity) was inside the vacuum-tube
instead of   outside it as before ; and the pith balls of the former apparatus
were replaced     by brass balls. By careful management and turning the
tube round, the author could place the equipoised brass pole either over,
under, or at the side of the source of heat.      With this apparatus it was
intended to ascertain more about the behaviour of the balance during
the progress of the exhaustion, both below and above the point of no
action, and also to ascertain the pressure corresponding with this critical
point.
   After describing many experiments with the ball in various positions
with respect to the incandescent spiral, and at different pressures, the
general result is expressed by the statement that the tendency in each
case was to bring the centre of gravity of the brass ball as near as possible
to the source of heat, when air of ordinary density, or even highly rare
fied air, surrounded the balance.      The author continues : —
   " 44.
          The pump was then worked until the gauge had risen to within
5  millims. of the barometric height. On arranging the ball above the spiral
(and making contact with the battery), the attraction was still strong,
drawing the ball downwards a distance of 2 millims. The pump continuing
to work, the gauge rose until it was within 1 millim. of the barometer. The
attraction of the hot spiral for the ball was still evident, drawing it
down when placed below it, and up when placed above it.              The move
ment, however, was much less decided than before ;        and   in spite of pre
vious experience (33,     34) the inference was very strong that the attrac
tion would gradually diminish until the vacuum was absolute, and that
then, and not till then, the neutral point would be reached.        Within one
millimetre of a vacuum there appeared to be no room for a change of
sign.
    "
      45. The gauge rose until there was only half a millimetre between
it and the barometer.      The metallic hammering heard when the rarefac
tion is close upon a vacuum commenced, and the falling mercury only
occasionally took down a bubble of air.      On turning ou the battery cur

rent, there was the faintest possible movement of the brass ball (towards
the spiral) in the direction of attraction.
   "46. The working of the pump was continued.                   On next making
contact with the battery, no movement could be detected.                The red-hot
spiral neither attracted nor repelled.        I had arrived at the critical point.
                              I
On looking at the gauge saw it was level with the barometer.
   " 47. The pump was now kept at full work for an hour. The gauge
did not rise perceptibly ; but the metallic hammering sound increased in
                 I
sharpness, and could see that a bubble or two of air had been carried down.
On igniting the spiral,   I  saw that the critical point had been passed.        The
sign had changed, apd the action was faint but unmistakable repulsion.
The pump was still kept going, and an observation was taken from time
to time during several hours.           The repulsion continued to increase.
The tubes of the pump were now washed out with oil of vitriol*, and the
working was continued for an hour.
   "48. The action of the incandescent              spiral was now found to be
energetically repellent, whether it was placed above or below the brass
ball.   The fingers exerted a repellent action, as did also a warm glass rod,
a spirit-flame, and a piece of hot copper."
   In order to decide once for all whether these actions really were due
to air-currents, a form of apparatus was fitted up which, whilst it would
settle the question indisputably, would at the same time be likely to
afford information of much interest.
   By chemical means the author obtained in an apparatus a vacuum so
nearly perfect that it would not carry a current from a BuhinkorfF s coil
when connected with platinum wires sealed into the tube.                    In such a
vacuum the repulsion by heat was still found to be decided and ener
getic.
   An experiment      is next described, in which the rays of the sun, and
then the different portions of the solar spectrum, are projected on to the
delicately   suspended pith-ball balance.          In vacuo the repulsion is 60
strong as to cause danger to the apparatus, and resembles that which
would be produced by the physical impact of a material body.
   Experiments are next described in which various substances were used
as the   gravitating masses. Amongst these are ivory, brass, pith, pla
tinum, gilt pith, silver, bismuth, selenium, copper, mica (horizontal and
vertical), charcoal, &c.
   The behaviour of a glass beam with glass ends in a chemical vacuum,
and at lower exhaustion, is next accurately examined when heat is applied
in different ways.
   On suspending the light index by means of a cocoon fibre in a long
glass tube furnished with a bulb at the end, and exhausting in various
ways, the author finds that the attraction to a hot body in air, and the
repulsion from a hot body in vacuo are rendered still more apparent.

    Speaking of Cavendish's celebrated experiment, the author says that
he has experimented for some months on an apparatus of this kind, and
gives the following outline of one of the results he has obtained : —
    " A heavy metallic mass, when brought near a delicately
                                                                           suspended
light ball, attracts or repels it under the following circumstances : —
    " I. When     the ball is in  air of ordinary density.
            a. If the mass is colder than the ball, it repels the ball.
            6. If the mass is hotter than the ball, it attracts the ball.
  " II.  When     the  ball is in a vacuum.
            a.  If the mass is colder    than the ball, it attracts the ball.
            b.  If the mass is hotter    than the ball, it repels the ball."
    The author continues: — " The density of the medium surrounding the
 ball, the material of which the ball is made, and a very slight difference
 between the temperatures of the mass and the ball, exert so strong an
influence over the attractive and repulsive force, and it has been so diffi
cult for me to eliminate all interfering actions of temperature, electricity,
 &c., that   I  have not yet been able to get distinct evidence of an inde
 pendent force (not being of the nature of heat) urging the ball and the
 mass together.
    " Experiment has, however, showed me that, whilst the action is in one
 direction in dense air, and in the opposite direction in a vacuum, there is
 an intermediate      pressure at which differences of temperature appear to
 exert little or no interfering action.        By experimenting at this critical
 pressure, it would seem that such an action as was obtained by Cavendish,
 Keicb, and Baily should be rendered evident."
    After discussing the explanations which may           be given  of these actions,
 and showing that they cannot be due to air-currents, the author refers to
 evidences of this repulsive action of heat, and attractive action of cold, in
 nature.     In  that portion of the sun's radiation which is called heat, we
 have the     radial   repulsive force, possessing successive propagation, re
 quired to explain the phenomena of comets and the shape and changes of
 the nebulae.      To compare small things with great — to argue from pieces
 of straw up to heavenly bodies — it is not improbable that the attraction,
 now shown to exist between a cold and a warm body, will equally prevail
 when, for the temperature of melting ice is substituted the cold of space,
 for a pith ball a celestial sphere, and for an artificial vacuum a
 stellar void. In the radiant molecular energy of cosmical masses may
 at hist be found that " agent acting constantly according to certain laws,"
 which Newton held to be the cause of gravity.

   In  a paper  " On the Mechanical      Conditions of the Respiratory Move
ments," read before the Royal Society in November 1872*, the author
endeavoured to show that there is a distinct difference in the chord
lengths of a sternal rib in the two positions of full inspiration and
forced expiration, and that a certain degree of bending of the ribs
usually takes place in forced breathing.           The measurements on which
these conclusions were based were made with a 3-plane stethometer,
the performance of which was not sufficiently accurate to satisfy the
author, who has accordingly repeated them by the aid of a new instru

gives fairly accurate results, which fully corroborate the conclusions pre-

1873.]     Mr. J. A. Broun    on Sun-spots and Terrestrial Magnetism.            43
    The following communications       were read     : —
I. " On      the Period    of Hemispherical Excess of Sun-spots, and
       the 26-day Period of Terrestrial Magnetism."                     By J. A.
        Bkoun, F.R.S. Received September 13, 1873.
    It  appears from the interesting communication to the Royal Society,
 June     19th, by Messrs. De La Rue, Stewart, and Loewy*, that the
 difference of the area of spots on the visible northern and southern
 quarter-spheres     of the sun seems, during periods of considerable solar
 disturbance, to obey a law such that the difference is a maximum in the
 same quarter-sphere during several successive rotations of the sun, the
 difference   being a maximum alternately iu the northern and southern
 hemispheres —the time from maximum to maximum, for the same
 hemisphere, being variable between 18 and 32 days, but having a mean
 value of about 25-2 days.
    It  occurs at once that   if the variations of the mean terrestrial mag
 netic force are connected in any way with the solar spots, or the causes
 which produce them, we might here find some explanation of the mag
 netic period of 26 days, the difference of spot-area in one hemisphere
 from that in the other being related to a difference of the solar magnetic
 action.
    In   order to determine whether     such a connexion       existed, I projected
 first the curves of excess of spot-area given in the paper of Messrs.
 De La Rue, Stewart, and Loewy, and below them the daily mean hori
 zontal force of the earth's magnetism during the same periods.                 The
 conclusion from these projections is, that there is no relation whatever
 between ifte two ela-ises of curves.   The maxima and minima of the one
 agree in no way with those of the other : the greatest excesses of sun-
 spot area in the one hemisphere over those in the other occur when the
 earth's magnetic force is the most constant ; the greatest variations of
 the earth's magnetic force from the mean occur in several instances
 when the sun-spot area is equal in the two visible quarter-spheres.
    It  should be remembered, in considering the curves of sun-spot excess,
 that the minima and maxima are in some cases only relative, — sometimes
 the one, sometimes the other being really cases in which there is neither
 maximum nor minimum —that is to say, eases in which the sun-spot area
 is equal, or nearly so, in the two visible quarter-spheres.
    It would be hasty to conclude from this comparison that the variations
of the mean magnetic force are really unconnected with the mode of
distribution of the sun-spots.        Other methods of grouping the spots
may perhaps       be employed with advantage relatively to this and other
questions ;    for example, were the position        of the centre of gravity of
the sun-spots determined for the visible quarter-spheres and hemisphere,

giving   each spot a weight    in proportion to its area, the variation of
these positions in latitude and longitude, and their weights, might give
a more satisfactory base for this comparison and for other deductions.
    It will be obvious also that this investigation refers only to the visible
hemisphere of the sun ; an approximation to the spot-distribution on
the other hemisphere, however, will be frequently possible.

    After noticing the investigations     of previous anatomists in the his
tology   of the chromatophores,   the  work  of Schneider and Rotteken on
these supposed organs of special sense is examined and criticised.
    Agreeing with Rotteken in his description, some further information
is given respecting the nature of the bacillary layer and the minute

anatomy of the elongated cells called                                     The
position and nature of the pigment-cells is pointed out, and also the pecu
liarities of the tissues they environ. It is shown that the large re
tractile cells, which, according to Rotteken, are situated between the
bacilli and the cones, are not invariably in that position, but that bacilli,
cones, and cells are often found separate.       They are parts of the ecto-
thelium, and when conjoined enable light to affect the nervous system more
readily than when they are separate. Further information is given
respecting the fusiform nerve-cells and small fibres noticed by Rotteken
in the tissue beneath the   cones ; and the discovery  of united ganglion-like
cells and a diffused plexiform arrangement of nerve is asserted.          The
probability of a   continuous   plexus  round  the Actinia  and beneath each
chroinatophore is suggested, and the physiological action of the struc
tures in relation to light is explained.
   The minute structure of the muscular fibres and their attached fibrous
tissue in the base of Actinia is noticed; and the nervous system in that
region is asserted to consist of a plexus beneath the endothelium, in
which are fusiform cells and fibpes like sympathetic nerve-fibrils.     More
over, between the muscular layers there is a continuation of this plexus,
whose ultimate fibrils pass obliquely over the muscular fibres, and either
dip between or are lost on them.
   The other parts of the Actinia are under the examination of the
author, but their details are not sufficiently advanced for publication.
The nervous system, so far as it is examined, consists of isolated fusi
form cells with small ends (Rotteken), and of fusiform and spherical
cells which communicate with each other and with a diffused plexus.
The plexus at the base is areolar ; and its ultimate fibres are swollen here
and there, the whole being of a pale grey colour.

        13, 1873.
    The author's attention has been recently drawn, by Mr. John Morgan,
of Bishopbriggs, Glasgow, to two cases of discrepancy in the author's
published value of ir, and to the misprint of a figure in the value of
tan" 1 ^ (one of the arcs employed in determining ir), as given in the
author's paper of April 1873. These two discrepancies in the value of
r, which will be described presently, did not appear in the paper pre
sented by the late "William Butherford in 1853, wherein the author's
extension to 530 decimals was correctly given.
    The source of the two cases of error was easily discovered, on re
ferring to the author's manuscript of 1852 ; for it was there found that
the 461st and 402nd decimals in the value of tan-1 ^ were, in the process
of careful revision previous to publication, altered from 88 to 96 ; and
this alteration required the addition of 128 in the corresponding place of
the value of            This addition was rightly made in the value sent to
Mr. Butherford, and given, as above stated, in his paper. It should
seem that the author unfortunately did not take a copy (for his own use)
of what he forwarded to Mr. Butherford.                       At all events, from some
strange cause or accident (perhaps from being overworked) the addition
of 128 was very soon afterwards made at the 513th, 514th, and 515th,
instead of at the 4G0th, 461st, and 462nd decimal places. Hence arose
the double error, which remained, strange to say, undetected for upwards
of twenty years ! This mistake, however, from its nature, in no wise
affects the accuracy     of tlie other figures.
    It  is sufficient merely to state that the 75th decimal, before alluded
 to, in the value of tan- 1       \  should be 8 and not 7 ; but it may be well to
 give  the entire value of it anew : —

    J. Clerk Maxwell, M.A., Professor of Experimental Physics
       in the University of Cambridge.                    Received October 31, 1873.
                              * theory of the internal friction of fluids, a
    According to Poisson's
viscous fluid behaves as an elastic solid would do if it were periodically
liquefied for an instant and solidified again, so that at each fresh start it
becomes for the moment like an elastic solid free from strain.        The state
of strain of certain transparent bodies may be investigated by means of
their action on polarized light. This action was observed by Brewster,
and was shown by Fresnel to be an instance of double refraction.
              I
    In 1866 made some attempts to ascertain whether the state of strain
in a viscous fluid in motion could be detected by its action on polarized
light.    I had a cylindrical box with a glass bottom.    "Within this bos a
solid cylinder could be made to rotate.       The fluid to be examined was
placed in the annular space between this cylinder and the sides of the
box. Polarized light was thrown up through the fluid parallel to the
axis, and the inner cylinder was then made to rotate.           was unable to    I
obtain any result with solution of gum or sirup of sugar, though            ob                  I
served an effect on polarized light when                   I
                                                   compressed some Canada
balsam which had become very thick and almost solid in a bottle.
    It is easy, however, to observe the effect in Canada balsam, which is so
fluid that it very rapidly assumes a level surface after being disturbed.
Put some Canada balsam in a wide-mouthed square bottle ; let light,
polarized in a vertical plane, be transmitted through the fluid ; observe
the light through a Nicol's prism, and turn the prism so as to cut off the
light ; insert a spatula in the Canada balsam, in a vertical plane passing
 through the eye.     Whenever the spatula is moved up or down in the
 fluid, the light reappears on both sides of the spatula ; this continues only
 so long as the spatula is in motion.     As soon as the motion stops, the
 light disappears,   and that so quickly that          I
                                                 have hitherto been unable to
 determine the rate of relaxation of that state of strain which the light
indicates.
     If the
          motion of the spatula in its own plane, instead of being in the
plane  of polarization, is inclined 45° to          it,
                                             no effect  observed, showing is
that the axes of strain are inclined 45° to the plane of shearing, as indi
cated by the theory.
 I     am not aware that this method of rendering visible the state of strain

  1873.]        Double Refraction in a Viscous Fluid in motion.                      47
  of  a viscous   fluid has been hitherto employed ; but it appears capable of
 furnishing important information as to the nature of viscosity in different
 substances.
     Among transparent solids there is considerable diversity in their action
 on polarized light. If a small portion is cut from a piece of unannealed
 glass at a place where the strain is uniform, the effect on polarized light
  vanishes as soon as the glass is relieved from the stress caused by the un
 equal contraction of the parts surrounding it.
     But if a plate of gelatine is allowed to dry under longitudinal tension,
 a small piece cut out of it exhibits the same effect on light as it did
  before, showing that a state of strain can exist without the action of
 stress.     A film of    gutta percha which has been stretched in one direc
 tion has    a  similar action on light. If a circular piece is cut out of such
 a stretched fdm and warmed, it contracts in the direction in which the
 stretching took place.
     The body of a sea-nettle has all the appearance of a transparent jelly ;
 and at one time       I thought that the spontaneous contractions of the living
 animal might be rendered visible by means of polarized light transmitted
                                 I
 through its body. But found that even a very considerable pressure
 applied to the sides of the sea-nettle produced no effect on polarized
               I
 light, and thus found, what         I might have learned by dissection, that the
 sea-nettle is not a true jelly, but consists of cells filled with fluid.
     On the other hand, the crystalline lens of the eye, as Brewster ob
 served, has a strong action on polarized light when strained either by
external pressure or by the unequal contraction of its parts as it becomes
 dry.
     I have enumerated these instances of the application of polarized light
 to the study of the structure of solid bodies as suggestions with respect
to the application of the same method to liquids so as to determine
 whether a given liquid differs from a solid in having a very small
" rigidity," or in having a small " time of relaxation"*, or in both ways.
Those which, like Canada balsam, act strongly on polarized light, have
probably a small
                       " rigidity," but a sensible " time of relaxation."       Those
which do not show this action are probably much more " rigid," and owe
their fluidity to the smallness of their " time of relaxation."
    The Society then adjourned         over the Christmas      Eecess to Thursday,
January     8, 1874.
    * The " time of relaxation " of a substance strained in a given manner is the time
required for the complete relaxation of the strain, supposing the rate of relaxation to
remain the same as at the beginning of this time.

I. "On      the Brom-Iodides."           By Dr. Maxwell Simpson, F.R.S.,
       Professor of Chemistry,           Queen's   College,   Cork.      Received
       November 4, 1873.
   Some years ago      I ascertained that chloride of iodine combines directly
with the defines and the non-saturated haloid ethers in the same manner
as  free chlorine    or bromine.      I have since ascertained that bromide of
iodine also enters into direct combination with these bodies.
   In the following experiments           I have invariably used a solution of
bromide of iodine in water, which was prepared by adding rather more
than a molecule of iodine in fine powder to a molecule of bromine pre
viously mixed with about six times its weight of water. The bromine
was repeatedly agitated during the addition of the iodine, and kept cold
by being surrounded by water.            An almost black liquid was thus ob
tained, which was separated from the excess of iodine.
   Brom-iodide of ethylene. — This body was formed by passing a stream

 of defiant     gas into the foregoing solution, which was kept cold during
 the absorption of the gas.          An oily liquid soon made its appearance,
 which was the body in question ; it was then subjected to distillation,
 having been previously washed with dilute potash, and afterwards with
 distilled water. Almost the entire quantity passed over without decom
 position between 162° and 167° Cent. This gave on analysis the follow
 ing numbers : —

                 C                                   10-21             10-35

     At the temperature of the air this is      a  solid body, consisting of a mass
 of long white needles, which melt at 28° Cent. At 29° it has a specific
 gravity=2-516. It has a sweet biting taste ; on exposure to light it
 becomes     slightly coloured, from the separation of free iodine.                  When
 subjected   to  the action   of  alcoholic potash,   it yields     iodide  of potassium
 and a gas burning with a green flame, which is doubtless bromide of
 vinyl. It is an isomer of the brom-iodide obtained by Pfaundler*, and
 afterwards by Eeboult, by exposing bromide of vinyl to the action of
hydriodic acid. Pfaundler's compound boils between 144° and 147° Cent.
    Brom-iodide of propylene. — This body was formed by passing propylene
gas derived from iodide of allyle into the brom-iodine solution.                    It was
washed with dilute potash, then with water, and distilled.                   The greater
part passed over between 1 60° and 1 68° Cent., suffering, however, at the
same time slight decomposition.           The distillate was then analyzed, having
been previously agitated with mercury to remove free iodine.                      The fol
lowing are the results : —
                                                                   Experiment.

    Notwithstanding the difference between the theoretical and experi
mental numbers,       I believe this is a definite compound, and not a mixture
of bromide and iodide of propylene.             The discrepancy probably arises
from the slight decomposition which the body suffered during distillation.
    Brom-iodide of propylene is, when freshly prepared, a colourless oily
liquid ; it has a sweet and biting taste. Treated with alcoholic potash,
it yields iodide of potassium and brom-propylene (Ca H5 Br).
    lodo-dibrom-vinyl. — When the brom-iodine solution and bromide of
vinyl   are brought into contact, direct combination takes place, and this
body   is  formed.     In order to complete their union, it is advisable to
heat them gently in a sealed tube.           A portion of the oily product thus
obtained was washed with potash and distilled            ;   almost the entire quan
tity passed over between 170° and 180° Cent.                 As, however, it suffered

          the Iodo-derivatives of the Orcins."  By John Stenhouse,
          LL.D., F.R.S., Sec. Received November 10, 1873.
     A preliminary notice on these compounds                             has already appeared             in the
'
    Chemical News,' vol. xxvi. p. 279                   ;    and the present paper contains a more
detailed account of my experiments.
                    I
   In 1864* published an account of a crystalline teriodorcin obtained
by precipitating an aqueous solution of orcin with a solution of iodine
monochloride, but       found I                I
                                 was unable to prepare any other iodine
derivative of orcin by this process.       It seems probable, however, that
the method devised some years ago by Prof. Hlasiwetzt, and commu
nicated by him at the meeting of the
                                              " Naturforscher und Aerzte in
Innsbruck," would yield the lower substitution compounds.             This was
found to be the case ; for on agitating an ethereal solution containing
equal molecular weights of orcin and iodine with dry precipitated mer
curic oxide, the colour rapidly disappears, and monoiodorcin is formed ;
this may be obtained by distilling off the ether and crystallizing the
residue from benzol, in order to separate an uncrystallizable oily com
pound which accompanies it. It                               is,
                                         however, still contaminated with                                         a
 small quantity of mercuric iodide, which obstinately adheres to the sub
stance, and can only be removed by recrystallization from       dilute aqueous          a
solution of potassium iodide     this difficulty arises from the circumstance
                                               ;
that mercuric iodide      more or less soluble in most of the liquids usually
                                  is
 employed  as solvents.    Icu this reason found advisable to substitute
                                                                   I          it

six parts of ether ; then two parts of iodine are added, and the mixture
agitated until the whole of the iodine is dissolved ; nine parts of very
finely powdered lead oxide (litharge) are now introduced in small portions
at a time with frequent     agitation.  A marked action takes place, ac
companied by development of heat, and the colour of the solution rapidly
disappears.  On. distilling off the ether and extracting the residue with
hot benzol, the iodorcin separates in the crystalline state on cooling.

melt at 86°-5, and decompose with evolution of violet vapours of iodine
when strongly heated.      Concentrated sulphuric acid has but little action

is decomposed and iodine        freely liberated.

    In preparing teriodorcin          by the action of iodine protochloride on orcin,
it was observed that a comparatively large amount of the dilute solution
of iodine chloride could be added to the aqueous solution of orcin before
a permanent precipitate of teriodorcin was produced.                 It seemed possible
that an intermediate          iodine derivative was first formed, far more soluble
than the teriodorcin,        and which subsequently became converted into the
latter by    the    further    action of the chloride of iodine.        In order to as
certain whether this was actually the case, a dilute solution of iodine
protochloride       was added to an aqueous solution of orcin containing one
part of orcin in fifty of water, as long as the precipitate redissolved in
the liquid on agitation.             The addition of iodine was then stopped, and
the filtered solution          agitated    with ether. The ethereal solution, on
evaporation, left an oily uncrystallizable liquid which was readily soluble
in water, and which evolved iodine when heated with concentrated sul
phuric acid     :  this liquid, on standing some days, deposited a few crystals
of unaltered       orcin.

     By Professor Cayley, F.R.S.                        Received November 14, 1873.

   The theory of Transformation in Elliptic Functions was established by
Jacobi in the 'Fundamenta Nova' (1820); and he has there developed,
transcendentally, with an approach to completeness, the general case, n
an odd number,\but algebraically only the cases «=3 and n=5; viz. in
the general case the formula? are expressed in terms of the elliptic func
tions of the nth part of the complete integrals, but in the cases n=3 and
«=5 they are expressed rationally in terms of u and v (the fourth roots
of the original and the transformed moduli respectively), these quantities
being connected by an equation of the order 4 or 6, the modular equation.
The extension of this algebraical theory to any value whatever of n is a
problem of great interest and difficulty. The general case should admit of
being treated in a purely algebraical manner ; but the difficulties are so
great that it was found necessary to discuss it by means of the formulae of
the transcendental theory, in particular by means of the expressions in-
                                                                nK'\

                                 (Abstract.)
   This communication contains an account of a new phenomenon (of rods
and wires of iron becoming twisted while under the influence of elec
tric currents), and a full description of the conditions under which it
occurs, the necessary apparatus, and the methods of using it.
   The phenomenon of torsion thus produced is not a microscopic one,
but may be made to exceed in some cases a twist of a quarter of a circle,
the end of a suitable index moving through a space of 80 centimetres
(=31 inches). It is always attended by emission of sound.
   The torsions are produced by the combined influence of helical and
axial electric currents, one current passing through a long copper-wire
coil surrounding the bar or wire, and the other, in an axial direction,
through the iron itself.   The cause of them is the combined influence of
magnetism    in the ordinary longitudinal direction induced in the bar by
the coil-current, and transverse magnetism induced in it by the axial
one.
   The torsions are remarkably symmetrica], and are as definitely related
in direction to electric currents as magnetism itself. The chief law of
them is — A current flowing from a north to a south pole products left-
handed torsion, and a reverse one right-handed torsion    e. in the direction
                                                        (i.
of an ordinary screw). Although each current alone will produce its own
magnetic effect, sound, and internal molecular movement, neither alone
will twist the bar, unless the bar has been previously magnetized by the
other. Successive coil-currents alone in opposite directions will not
produce torsion, neither will successive and opposite axial ones.
   The torsions are influenced by previous mechanical twist in the iron,
by mechanical tension, and by terrestrial magnetic induction. The di
rection of them depends both upon that of the axial and of the coil-currents,
but appears to be determined most     by the former. A few cases occur in
which the currents, instead of developing torsion, produce detorsion but
                                                                       ;
only two instances, out of many hundreds, have been met with in which
torsion was produced in direction opposite to that required by the law.

ones occur when the two currents are transmitted alternately, and the
large ones when they are passed simultaneously      ;the former generally
leave the bar in a twisted state, the latter do not.   Those produced by
axial currents succeeding coil ones are nearly always much larger than
those yielded by coil-currents succeeding axial ones, because the residual
magnetism left by the coil-current   isthe strongest.   The order of suc
cessionof the currents affects the torsions in all cases, altering their
magnitudes, and in some few instances even their directions.    In steel

  all the torsional   effects are modified by the mechanical and magnetic
 properties of that substance.
     Each current leaves a residuary magnetic effect in the bar, amounting
 in iron to about one tenth of its original influence.      The residuary mag
 netism of coil-currents    is  affected and  sometimes reversed by axial ones ;
 and that of axial currents is also removed by coil ones, and by a red heat.
 The condition left by an axial current is smaller in degree and less stable,
 in a vertical iron wire or one in the terrestrial magnetic meridian, than
 that left by a coil one, partly because of the influence of terrestrial mag
 netism ; but in a position at right angles to that the effect is different.
     The torsion produced by a coil-current may be used as a test, and
 partly as a measure, of the residuary effect of an axial one ; and that
 produced by an axial current may be employed to detect, and to some
extent measure, ordinary magnetism in the bar.             As an opposite coil-
current at once reverses the ordinary longitudinal magnetism of a bar of
iron, so also an opposite axial one at once reverses its transverse mag
netism.
    Many instances have been met with in which the transverse and longi
tudinal magnetic states produced by the two currents coexisted in the
same substance.      The torsional influence of the excited helix is distri
buted equally throughout its length ; so also is that of the current in the
bar.     All the torsions are closely related to the well-known electric
sounds, and to particular positions and internal movements of the particles
of the iron.
    Signs of electrotorsion were obtained with a bar of nickel, but not
with wires of platinum, silver, copper, lead, tin, cadmium, zinc, mag
nesium, aluminium, brass, or German-silver, nor with a thick rod of
zinc, or a cord of gutta percha.

    This notice   embraces     the scientific  results of an inquiry on Fog-
signals, undertaken at the instance of the Elder Brethren of the Trinity
House, and communicated with their friendly concurrence to the Royal
Society.
    The investigation   was begun on the 19th of May, 1873, and continued
till the 4th of July.    It was resumed on the 8th of October, and con

 tinued to the end of November.          It also includes observations made
 during the dense fog which enveloped London on December 9 and the
  succeeding days.
    Gongs and bells were excluded from this investigation, in consequence
 of their proved inferiority to other instruments of signalling. The experi
 ments were made with trumpets blown by powerfully compressed air,
 with steam-whistles,   guns, and a steam syren, associated with a trumpet
  16 feet long.
    DabolTs horn, or trumpet,     had been highly spoken of by writers on
 fog-signals. A third-order apparatus of the kind had been reported as
 sending its sound to a distance of from 7 to 9 miles against the wind,
 and to a distance of 12 to 14 miles with the wind. Holmes had improved
 upon Daboll ; and with two instruments of Holmes, not of the third but
 of the first order, our experiments were made.       On the 19th of May at
 3 miles distance they became useless as a fog-signal ; at a distance of 4
 miles, with paddles stopped and all on board quiet, they were wholly
 unheard.    At a distance of 2 miles from the Foreland the whistles tested
 on May 19 became useless. The 12 o'clock gun, fired with a 1 lb. charge
 at Drop Fort in Dover, was well heard on May 19, when the horns and
 whistles were inaudible.    On the 20th of May the permeability of the
 atmosphere had somewhat increased, but the steam-whistle failed to pierce
it to a depth of 3 miles.    At 4 miles the horns, though aided by quietness
 on board, were barely heard.                                 I
                                    By careful nursing, if may use the ex
 pression, the horn-sounds were carried to a distance of 6 miles.          The
 superiority of the 18-pounder gun, already employed by the Trinity House
 as a fog-signal,  over horns and whistles was on this day so decided as
 almost to warrant its recommendation        to the exclusion of all the other
 signals.
    Nothing occurred on the 2nd of June to exalt our hopes of the trumpets
and whistles.     The horns were scarcely heard at a distance of 3 miles ;
sometimes indeed they failed to be heard at 2 miles.          By keeping every
thing quiet on board, they were afterwards heard to a distance of 6
miles — a result, however, mainly due to the improved condition of the
atmosphere.      Considering the demands as to sound-range made by writers
on this subject, the demonstrated incompetence of horns and whistles of
great reputed power to meet these demands was not encouraging.             On
the 3rd of June the atmosphere had changed surprisingly. It was loaded
overhead with dark and threatening clouds ; the sounds, nevertheless,
were well heard beyond 9 miles.      On June 10th the acoustic transparency
of the air was also very fair, the  distance  penetrated being upwards of 8|
miles.    The subsidence of the sound near the boundary of the acoustic
shadow on the Dover side of the Foreland, and before entering the
shadow,    was to-day sudden and extraordinary,        affecting equally both
horns and guns.      "We were warned on June 3     that  the supremacy of the
gun on one occasion by no means implied its supremacy on all occasions,

60                              Prof.    J. Tyndall on the                       [Jan.  15,
the self-same guns which on May 20th had so far transcended the horns
being on this day their equals and nothing more.                   The 11th of June was
employed       in mastering    still further   the  facts  relating  to the subsidence of
 the sound east and west of the Foreland               ; the cause of this subsidence
being   in   part  due  to the  weakening      of the   sonorous waves by their diver
 gence into the sound shadow, and in part to interference.
    The atmosphere on the 25th of June was again very defective acousti
cally.     The sounds reached a maximum distance of 6£ miles ; but at 4
miles, on returning from the maximum distance, they were very faint.
The day had, as it were, darkened acoustically. On this day the guns lost
still further their preeminence, and at 5| miles were inferior to the horn.
No sounds whatever reached Dover Pier on the 11th ; and it was only
towards the close of the day that they succeeded in reaching it on the
25th.      Thus by slow degrees the caprices of the atmosphere made them
selves known to us, showing us subsequently that within the limits of
a single day, even within a single minute, the air, as a vehicle of sound,
underwent most serious variations.               The 26th of June was a far better
day   than    its predecessor,    the   acoustic   range being over 9^ miles.          The
direction of the wind was less favourable to the sound on this day than
on the preceding one, plainly proving that something else than the wind
must play an important part in shortening the sound-range.
    On the 1st of July we experimented upou a rotating horn, aud heard
its direct or axial blast, which proved to be the strongest, at a distance
of 10| miles.          The sounds were also heard at the Varne light-ship,
which     is 12| miles from the Foreland.                The atmosphere had become
decidedly clearer acoustically, but not so optically ; for on this day thick
haze obscured the white cliffs of the Foreland.                  In fact, on days of far
greater optical purity, the sound had failed to reach oue third of the
distance attained to-day.            In the light of such a fact, any attempt to
make optical transparency a measure of acoustic transparency, must be seen
to be delusive. On the 1st of July a 12-inch American whistle, of which
we had heard a highly favourable account, was tried in place of the 12-inch
English whistle ; but, like its predecessor, the performance of the new
instrument fell behind that of the horns. An interval of                 12 hours sufficed
to convert the acoustically clear atmosphere of July 1 into an opaque
one ; for on the 2nd of July even the horn-sounds, with paddles stopped
and all noiseless on board, could not penetrate further than 4 miles.
    Thus    each succeeding day provided us          with   a virtually new atmosphere,
clearly showing that conclusions founded upon one day's observations
might utterly break down in the presence of the phenomena of another
day.     This was most impressively demonstrated on the day now to be
referred      to.   The acoustic imperviousness of the 3rd of July was
found to be still greater than that of the 2nd, while the optical purity
of the day was sensibly perfect. The cliffs of the Foreland could be
 seen   to-day     at  ten   times     the   distance    at   which they     ceased  to  be

1874.]           Transmission   of Sound   by the Atmosphere.                GJ
risible on the 1st, while the sounds were cut off at one sixth of the dis
tance.      At 2 p.m. neither guns nor trumpets were able to pierce the
transparent air to a depth of 3, hardly to a depth of 2 miles. This extraor
 dinary opacity was proved conclusively to arise from the irregular admix
 ture with the air of the aqueous vapour raised by a powerful sun.          This
 vapour, though perfectly invisible, produced an acoustic     cloud impervious
to the sound, and from which the sound-waves were thrown back as the
 waves of light are from an ordinary cloud. The waves thus refused trans
 mission produced by their reflection echoes of extraordinary strength and
 duration. This     I may remark is the first time that audible echoes have
 been proved to be reflected from an optically transparent atmosphere. By
the lowering of the sun the production of the vapour was checked, and
the transmissive power of the atmosphere restored to such an extent that,
at a distance of 2 miles from the Foreland, at 7 p.m., the intensity of the
 sound was at least thirty-six times its intensity at 2 p.m.
    On October 8 the observations were resumed, a steam syren and a
 Canadian whistle of great power being added to the list of instruments.
 A boiler had its steam raised to a pressure of 70 lbs. to the square inch ; on
 opening a valve this steam would issue forcibly in a continuous stream,
and the sole function of the syren was to convert this stream into a
 series of separate strong puffs.     This was done by causing a disk with
 12 radial slits to rotate behind a fixed disk with the same number of slits.
 When the slits coincided a puff escaped ; when they did not coincide the
 outflow of .steam was interrupted. Each puff of steam at this high pres
sure generated a sonorous wave of great intensity ; the successive waves
linking themselves together to     a musical sound so intense as to be best
 described as a continuous explosion.
    During the earlier part of October 8 the optical transparency of the
 air was very great ; its acoustic transparency, on the other hand, was very
 defective.    Clouds blackened and broke into a rain- and hail-shower of
 tropical violence. The sounds, instead of being deadened were improved
 by this furious squall ; and, after it had lightened, thus lessening the
 local noises, the sounds were heard at a distance of 7£ miles distinctly louder
 than they had been heard through the preceding rainless atmosphere at a
 distance of 5 miles.     At 5 miles distance, therefore, the intensity of the
 sound had been at least doubled by the rain — a result entirely opposed to
 all previous assertions, but an obvious consequence of the removal by con
 densation and precipitation of that vapour the mixture of which with the
 air had been proved so prejudicial to the sound. On this day a depen
 dence was established between the pitch of a note and its penetrative'
power — the syren generating 480 waves being slightly inferior to the
horns, while generating 400 waves a second it was distinctly superior.
The maximum range on October 8 was 9 miles. On October 9 the trans-
missive power had diminished, the maximum range being 1\ miles. On

62                           Prof.  J. Tyndall  on the               [Jan. 15,
both these days the syren proved to be superior to the horns, and on some
occasions superior to the gun.
   On the 10th and 11th, a gale having caused our steamer to seek safety
in the Downs, we made land-observations.            The duration of the aerial
echoes   was for  the  syren  and  the gun 9  seconds, for the horns 6 seconds.
The duration varies from day to day. We sought to estimate the influence
of the violent wind, and found that the sound of the gun failed to reach
us in two cases at a distance of 550 yards to windward, the sound of
the syren at the same time rising to a piercing intensity. To leeward
the gun was heard at five times, and certainly might have been heard
at fifteen times the distance attained to windward. The momentary
character of the gun-sound renders it liable to be quenched by a single
puff of wind ; but sounds of low pitch generally, whether momentary
or not, suffer more from an opposing wind than high ones. We had on
the 13th another example of the powerlessness of heavy rain to deaden
sound.
   On the 14th the maximum range was 10 miles, but the atmosphere
did not maintain this power of transmission.          It was a day of extreme
optical clearness ; but its acoustic clearness diminished as the day ad
vanced.     In fact the sun was in action. We proved to-day that by
lowering the pitch of the Canadian whistle, its sound, which had pre
viously been inaudible, became suddenly audible.          The day at first was
favourable to the transmission of the longer sound-waves.              After a
lapse of three hours the case was reversed, the high-pitched syren being
then heard when both gun and horns were inaudible.               But even this
state of things did not continue, so rapid and surprising are the caprices
of the atmosphere.        At a distance of 5 miles, at 3.30 p.m., the change
in transmissive power reduced the intensity of the sound to at least
one half of what it possessed at 11.30 a.m., the wind throughout main
taining the same strength and direction.           Through all this complexity
 the knowledge obtained on July 3 sheds the light of a principle which
 reduces to order the apparent confusion.
    October 15 was spent at Dungeness in examining the performance of
 Daboll's horn.      It is a fine instrument, and its application was ably
 worked out by its inventor ; still it would require very favourable atmo
 spheric conditions to enable it to warn a steamer before she had come
 dangerously close to the shore.       The direction in which the aerial echoes
 return  was  finely illustrated to-day, that direction being always the one
 in which the axis of the horn is pointed.
    The 16th was a day of exceeding optical transparency, but of great
 acoustic opacity.       The maximum range was only 5 miles.           On this
 day the howitzer and all the whistles were clearly overmastered by the
 syren.    It was, moreover, heard at 3£ miles with the paddles going,
 while the gun was unheard at 2| miles.            With no visible object that

  1874.]         Transmission    of Sound   by the Atmosphere.              63
  could possibly yield an echo in sight, the pure aerial echoes, coming
  from the more distant southern air, were distinct and long-continued at
  a distance of 2 miles from the shore.        Near the base of the Foreland
  cliff we determined their duration and found it to be 11 seconds, while
  that of the best whistle echoes was 6 seconds.           On this day three
  whistles, sounded simultaneously, were pitted against the syren, and
  found clearly inferior to it.
      On the 17th four horns were compared with the syren and found
 inferior to it. This was our day of greatest acoustic transparency, the
  sound reaching a maximum of 15 miles for the syren, and of more than
  16 for the gun.     The echoes on this day were continued longer than on
 any other occasion.       They continued for 15 seconds, their duration
 indicating  the  atmospheric depth from which they came.
     On October 18, though the experiments were not directed to deter
 mine the transmissive power of the air, we were not without proof that
 it continued to be high. From 10 to 10.30 a.m., while waiting for the
 blasts of the syren at a distance of 3 miles from the Foreland, the con
 tinued reports of what we supposed to be the musketry of skirmishing
 parties on lanff were distinctly heard by us all. We afterwards learned
 that the sounds arose from the rifle-practice on Kingsdown beach,
 5| miles away. On July 3, which, optically considered, was a far more
 perfect day, the 18-pounder, howitzer, and mortar failed to make them
 selves heard at half this distance.       The 18th was mainly occupied in
 detennining    the  influence  of  pitch  and  pressure on the syren-sound.
 Taking the fluctuations of the atmosphere into account,      I am of opinion
 that the syren, performing from 2000 to 2400 revolutions a second, or,
 in other words, generating from 400 to 480 waves per second, best meets
the atmospheric conditions.        We varied the pressure from 40 to 80 lbs.
on the square inch ; and though the intensity did not appear to rise in
proportion to the pressure, the higher pressure yielded the hardest and
most penetrating sound.
     The 20th was a rainy day with strong wind. Up to a distance of
5 \ miles the syren continued to be heard through the sea- and paddle-
noises.    In rough weather, indeed, when local noises interfere, the syren-
sound far transcends all other sounds. On various occasions to-day it
proved its mastery over both gun and horns.             On the 21st the wind
was strong and the sea high.           The horn-sounds, with paddles going,
were lost at 4 miles, while the syren continued serviceable up to 6| miles.
The gun to-day was completely overmastered. Its puffs were seen at the
Foreland ; but its sound was unheard when the syren was distinctly heard.
Heavy rain failed to damp the power of the syren. The whistles were
also tried to-day, but were found far inferior to the syren. On the 22nd
                                       '
it blew a gale, and the ' Galatea quitted us. We made observations
on land on the influence of the wind and of local noises.         The shelter
of the Coastguard Station at Cornhill enabled us to hear gun-bounds

                             Prof. J. Tyndall   on the               [Jan. 15,
which were quite inaudible to an observer out of shelter ; in the shelter
also both horn and syren rose distinctly in power ; but they were also heard
outside when the gun was quite unheard.            As usual the sound to lee
ward was far more powerful than those at equal distances to windward.
The echoes from the cloudless air were to-day very fine. On the 23rd,
in the absence of the steamer, the observations on the influence of the
wind were continued.        The quenching of the gun-sounds, in particular, to
windward was well illustrated.        All the sounds, however, gun included,
were carried much further to leeward than to windward. The effect of a
violent thunderstorm and downpour of rain in exalting the sound was
noticed by observers both to windward and to leeward of the Foreland.
In the rear of the syren its range to-day was about a mile. At right
angles to the axis, and to windward, it was about the same.            To lee
 ward it reached a distance of 7^ miles.
    On the 24th, when observations were made afloat in the steam-tug
 ' Palmerston,'
                  the syren exhibited a clear mastery over gun and horns.
                               J
The maximum range was 7 miles. The wind had changed from W.S.W.
to S.E., then to E. As a consequence of this, the syren was heard loudly
in the streets of Dover.       On the 27th the wind was E.N.E. ; and the
syren-sound penetrated everywhere through Dover, rising over the moan
ing of the wind and all other noises. It was heard at a distance of
6 miles   from the Foreland on the road to Folkestone, and would probably
have been      heard all the way to Folkestone had not the experiments
ceased.     Afloat and in the axis, with a high wind and sea, the syren,
and it only, reached to a distance of 6 miles ; at 5 miles it was heard
through the paddle noises.       On the 28th further experiments were made
on the influence of pitch, the syren when generating 480 waves a
second being found more effective than when generating 300 waves a
second. The maximum range in the axis on this day was 7£ miles.
    The 29th of October was a day of extraordinary optical transparency
but by no means transparent acoustically.           The gun was the greatest
sufferer.     At first it was barely heard at 5 miles ; but afterwards it was
tried at 5£, 4£, and 2| miles, and was heard at none of these distances.
The syren at the same time was distinctly heard. The sun was shining
strongly ; and to its augmenting power the enfeeblement of the gun-
sound was doubtless due. At 3^ miles, subsequently, dead to windward,
the syren was faintly heard ; the gun was unheard at 2| miles.         On land
the syren and horn-sounds were heard to windward at 2 to 2\ miles, to
leeward at 7 miles ; while in the rear of the instruments they were heard
at a distance of 5 miles, or five times as far as they had been heard
on October 23.
    The 30th of October furnished another illustration of the fallacy of
the notion which considers optical and acoustic transparency to go hand
in hand. The day was very hazy, the white cliffs of the Foreland at the
greater    distances   being quite  hidden  ; still the gun- and syren-sounds

1874.]          Transmission     of Sound   by the Atmosphere.               65
reached on the bearing of the Varne light- vessel to a distance of 11 |
miles.     The syren was heard through the paddle-noises at 9| miles,
while at 8| miles it became efficient as a signal with the paddles going.
The horns were heard at 6^ miles. This was during calm. Subsequently,
with a wind from the N.N.W., no sounds were heard at 6| miles. On
land, the wind being across the direction of the sound, the syren was
heard only to a distance of 3 miles N.B. of the Foreland ; in the other
direction it was heard plainly on Folkestone Pier, 8 miles distant.
Both gun and horns failed to reach Folkestone.
   Wind, rain, a rough sea, and great acoustic opacity characterized
October 31.       Both gun and horns were unheard 3 miles away, the
syren at the same time being clearly heard.            It afterwards forced its
sound with great power through a violent rain-squall. Wishing the
same individual judgment to be brought to bear upon the sounds on both
sides of the Foreland, in the absence of our steamer, which had quitted
us for safety,  I committed the observations to Mr. Douglass.         He heard
them at 2 miles on the Dover side, and on the Sandwich side, with the
same intensity, at 6 miles.
   A gap (employed by the engineers in making arrangements for pointing
the syren in any required direction) here occurred in our observations.
They were resumed, however, on November 21, when comparative                 ex
periments were     made upon the gun and syren.       Both sources of sound,
when employed      as fog-signals, will not unfrequently have to cover an arc
of 180°  ;  and it was desirable to know with greater precision how the
sound is affected by the direction in which the gun or syren is pointed.
    The gun, therefore, was in the first instance pointed on us and fired,
then turned and fired along a line perpendicular to that joining us and it .
There was a sensible, though small, difference between the sounds which
reached us in the two cases.        A similar experiment was made with the
syTen  ; and  here  the falling off when the instrument was pointed perpen
dicular to the line joining us and it was very considerable.       This is what
is to be expected ; for the trumpet     associated with  the  syren is expressly
intended to gather up the sound and project it in a certain direction, while
no such object is in view in the construction of the gun. The experi
ments    here referred     to were amply    corroborated   by others made on
November 22 and 23.
                                              '
    On both of these days the ' Galatea's guns were fired to windward
and to leeward. The aerial echoes in the latter case were distinctly louder
and longer than in the former.       The experiment has been repeated many
times, and always with the same result.
    In front of the Cornhill Coastguard Station, and only 1| mile from
the Foreland, the syren, on the 21st, though pointed towards us, fell
 suddenly and considerably in power.       Before reaching Dover Pier it had
 ceased to be heard.      The wind was here against the sound ; but this,
 though it contributed to the effect, could not account for it, nor could the

66                                 Prof.      J.   Tyndall on the                     [Jan.   15,
proximity of the shadow account for it.                       To these two     causes must have
been added an acoustically                 flocculent though       optically transparent atmo
sphere.    The experiment demonstrates conclusively that there                        are atmo
spheric and local conditions                 which, when combined, prevent our               most
powerful instruments from making more than a distant approach to the
performance which writers on fog-signals have demanded of them.
   On November 24 the sound of the syren pointed to windward was com
pared at equal distances in front of and behind the instrument.      It was
louder to leeward in the rear, than at equal distances to windward in front.
Hence, in a wind, the desirability of pointing the instrument to wind
ward.   The whistles were tested this day in comparison with the syren
deprived of its trumpet.    The Canadian and the 8-inch whistles proved
the most effective         ;   but the naked syren was as well heard as either of
them.    As regards opacity, the 25th of November almost rivalled the
3rd of July. The gun failed to be heard at a distance of 2*8 miles, and
it yielded only a faint crack at 2| miles.
   Meanwhile this investigation has given us a knowledge of the atmo
sphere in its relation to sound, of which no notion had been previously
entertained.      While the        velocity    of sound has been the subject of refined
and repeated experiments,              I   am not aware that since the publication of a
celebrated paper by Dr. Derham, in the Philosophical Transactions for
1708, any systematic inquiry has been made into the causes which affect
the intensity of sound in the atmosphere.     Derham's results, though
obtained at a time when the means of investigation were very defective,
have apparently been accepted with unquestioning trust by all subsequent
writers — a fact which           is,
                                  I        think, in   some    part to be ascribed     to the   d
priori probability        of his conclusions.
   Thus Dr. Robinson, relying apparently upon Derham, says, " log                             is   &
powerful damper of sound," and he gives us physical reason why must                     it
be so.
          " It  is  mixture of air and globules of water, and at each
                     a                                                                          of

of fogs to deaden the report of guns has been often noticed."
     Assuming  moreover, as probable that the measure of

                                       a                      to obstruct the
sound. This    quite
                is   in accordance  with prevalent   notions    and granting    ;
that the sound   dissipated, as assumed,
                     is                                       by
                                             reflection from the particles
of fog, the conclusion follows that the greater the number of the reflecting
particles, the greater will be the waste of sound.     But the number                              of
particles, or, in other words, the density of the fog,     declared        its
                                                                           is             by
action upon light hence the optical opacity will be
                       ;                                   measure of the  a
acoustic opacity.

     This,  I say, expresses the opinion generally entertained, " clear still
 air" being regarded as the best vehicle for sound. We have not, as
 stated above, experimented in really dense fogs; but the experiments
 act ually made entirely destroy the notion that clear weather is
                                                                    necessarily
 better for the transmission of sound than thick weather.         Some of our
 days of densest acoustic opacity have been marvellously clear optically,
 while some of our days of thick haze have shown themselves highly
 favourable to the transmission of sound. Were the physical cause of the
 sound-waste     that above assigned, did that waste arise in any material
 degree from reflection    at the limiting surfaces of the particles of haze,
 this result would be inexplicable.
    Again, Derham, as quoted by Sir John Herschel, says that " falling
rain tends powerfully to obstruct sound." We have had repeated reversals
of this conclusion.     Some of our observations have been made on days
when rain and hail descended with a perfectly tropical fury ; and in no
 single case did the rain deaden the sound ; in every case, indeed, it had
precisely the opposite effect.
    But falling snow, according to Derham, offers a more serious obstacle
than any other meteorological agent to the transmission of sound. We
have not extended our observations at the South Foreland into snowy
weather ; but an observation of my own made on December 29th, in the
Alps, during a heavy snow-storm, distinctly negatives the statement of
Derham.
    Beverting to the case of fog,    I am unable in modern observations to
discover any thing conclusive as to its alleged power of deadening sound.
I  had the pleasure of listening to a very interesting lecture on fog-signals
delivered by Mr. Beazeley before the United-Service Institution ; and         I
haye carefully perused the printed report of that lecture, and of a paper
previously communicated by Mr. Beazeley to the Institution of Civil
Engineers. But in neither of these painstaking compilations can find    I
any adequate evidence of the alleged power of fogs to deaden sound.
    Indeed during the discussion which followed the reading of Mr. Beaze-
ley's paper, an important observation in an opposite sense was mentioned
by   Mr.   Douglass, to whose ability and accuracy as an observer    I am able
to bear the strongest testimony.       Mr. Douglass stated that he had found
in his experience but little difference in the travelling of sound in foggy
or in clear weather. He had distinctly heard in a fog, at the Smalls rock
in the Bristol Channel, guns fired at Milford Haven, 25 miles away. Mr.
            moreover, has heard the Lundy-Island gun
                                                        " at Hartland Point,"
Beazeley,
a distance    of  10 miles,  during dense fog.    Mr. Beazeley's conclusion,
indeed, accurately expresses the state of our knowledge when he wrote.
In winding up his paper, he admitted " that the subject appeared to be
very little known, and that the more it was looked into the more
apparent became the fact that the evidence as to the effect of fog upon
sound is extremely conflicting."       When, therefore, it is alleged, as it is

G8              Messrs. T.    L. Brunton and       J.  Fayrer on the     [Jan. 22,
so often alleged, that the power of fogs to deaden sound is well           known,
the disjunctive not is to be inserted before the predicate.
    The real enemy to the transmission of sound through the atmosphere
has,   I think, been clearly revealed by the foregoing inquiry. That enemy
has    been   proved to be not rain, nor hail, nor haze, nor fog, nor snow
:— not water in fact in either a liquid or a solid form, but water in
a vaporous form, mingled        with air   so as to  rindsr it acoustically turbid
and flocculent.      This acoustic turbidity often occurs on days of surprising
optical transparency.        Any system of measures, therefore, founded on
the assumption that the optic and acoustic transparency of the atmosphere
go hand in hand must prove delusive.
    There is but one solution of this difficulty : it is to make the source of
 sound so powerful as to be able to endure loss by partial reflection, and
 still retain  a sufficient residue  for transmission.     Of all the instruments
hitherto examined by us the syren comes nearest to the fulfilment of this
condition ; and its establishment upon our coasts will, in my. opinion,
prove an incalculable boon to the mariner.
    An account of the observations made during the recent fog will           be in
cluded in the paper shortly to be presented to the Society.                  These
observations add the force of demonstration               to others recorded in
the paper, that fogs possess no such power of stifling sound as that
hitherto    ascribed to them.       Indeed     the melting   away of fog on De
cember 13th was accompanied by an acoustic darkening of the atmo
 sphere, so great that, at a point midway between the eastern end of the
Serpentine, where a whistle was sounded, and the bridge, the sound pos
sessed less than one      fourth of the intensity which it possessed on the day
of densest fog.
            I
    Thus, think, has been removed the last of a congeries of errors which
for more than a century and a half have been associated with the trans
 mission of sound by the atmosphere.

        Naja     tripudians    and other       Indian   Venomous      Snakes." —

        geon-Major Bengal Army. Communicated by Prof. Huxley,
        Sec.R.S. Received November 8, 1873.
    The effects of the poison of Naja tripudians are probably the same as
those of Qphiopliayux elaps, Bum/arm, Hvdrophidae, and other poisonous

  1874.]             Poison  of Indian  Venomous Snakes.                     60
 colubrine   snakes, whilst that of Daboia Eusxellii is similar to that of Echis
 carinata, and also of the Trimeresuri,   which represent the viperine snakes
 in India.
     Just as the Naja may   be regarded   as among the most     virulent of the
 colubrine, the Daboia is probably as venomous as         any of the viperine
 snakes, it being very deadly ; whilst the Crotalidce are but feebly repre
 sented in India by the Trimeresuri.
     The venomous colubrine snakes in India are represented by the Naja
 tripudiatis, Ophiojihaf/us elaps, liumjarm fasciatus, B. cceruleus, Xenure-
 laps bungaroides, and the various species of Calhphis and Hydrophidae ;
 whilst among the viperine snakes the Viperidie, or vipers, are represented
in India by only two genera, each with a single species, Daboia Eussellii,
Echis carinata ; the Crotalidae, or pit vipers, by the various Trimeresuri,
 Peltopelor, Hahjs, Hypnale,    though these are much less active than their
 American congeners.
    The Daboia, however, may be considered as virulent as the most deadly
 form of the Viperidae of Africa, or probably as the Crotalus or Craspedace-
phalus of the pit-vipers of America and the West Indies.
     In a previous communication we have described the effect of the poison
 of Naja tripudians upon warm-blooded animals, and have illustrated it
 by experiments on the dog, rabbit, guineapig, and fowl.
     We purpose in the present paper to compare its action with that of the
poison of the Daboia liussellU, a viperine snake, to describe its effects
upon cold-blooded animals and invertebrata, and to examine in detail its
action upon the various organs of the body.
    In our former paper we stated that the general symptoms of poisouing
by cobra-venom are depression, faintness, hurried respiration and exhaus
tion, lethargy, unconsciousness, nausea, and vomiting.        In dogs, guinea-
pigs, and rabbits peculiar twitching movements occur, which seem to re
present vomiting in them ; occasionally, in fact, dogs and guineapigs
(Experiment XX.) do vomit, and dogs are profusely salivated.            As the
poisoning proceeds, paralysis appears, sometimes affecting the hind legs
first and seeming to creep up the body, and sometimes affecting the whole
animal nearly at the same time.        There is loss of coordinating power
of the muscles of locomotion.
    Haemorrhage, relaxation of the sphincters, and involuntary evacuations,
not unfrequently of a sanguineous or muco-sanguineous character, often
precede death, and are generally accompanied by convulsions.
    In fowls the appearance is one of extreme drowsiness ; the head falls
forward, rests on the beak ; and gradually the bird, no longer able to
support itself, crouches, then rolls over on its side. There are frequent
startings, as if of sudden awaking from the drowsy state.
    The following experiments upon pigeons and guineapigs show that the
general symptoms produced by the poison of the Daboia are nearly the
same as by that of the Naja.    The local symptoms are greater extravasation
                                                                  a 1

of blood and effusion into areolar tissue.     In Experiment     III. it was noted
that greater lethargy and less violent convulsions occurred in the pigeon
poisoned by cobra-venom than in that poisoned by Daboia but this might
                                                                  •
readily be due to individual difference in the bird ; and an opposite result
is noted in Experiment VII. upon a guineapig.            In one pigeon, killed by
2)o6oia-venom, the blood remained permanently fluid after death ; but in
the other, and also in the guineapigs, it coagulated firmly. This is an excep
tion to the rule which has been noticed in experiments made in India,
that the blood after Do6oio-poisoning remains fluid — in marked contradi
stinction to death from cobra-venom, in which the blood almost invariably
 coagulates. Coagulation, however, of the blood of a fowl after death from
 the bite of a Daboia has also been noticed by one of us (Dr. Fayrer) in
 India ; and therefore the coagulation in our experiments was not due to
 the lower temperature of the atmosphere.
                                   Experiment   I.
    August 27th, 1873. — Three milligrammes of dried Z)a6oia-poison, re
 ceived some weeks ago from Balasore, were injected into the thigh of an
 old and vigorous pigeon at 2.48.
     2.53. No apparent effect, except that the bird is lame on that leg.
    3.2. The bird is sluggish.        Inspirations hurried.         Lameness con
 tinues.
     3.18. Still sluggish, but it is not deeply affected.
     3.30. Disinclined to move. When placed on the table              it sunk on its
 breast.    No nodding of the head.
    3.45. Sudden and violent convulsions.
     3.46. Dead in 58 minutes from the time of injection.
     Electrodes inserted into the spinal cord soon after death caused move
 ments of the wings, but not of the legs. Blood taken from the bird, just
 before death, partially coagulated after death.        Blood taken from it after
 death, coagulated more firmly — but less firmly than some taken from
 another pigeon poisoned with cobra-venom.
                                  Experiment    II.
     A  young full-grown pigeon had 3 milligrammes          of dried Do6oia-poison
 injected into the peritoneum at 3.5 p.m.
     At  3.13 it was observed to   pass suddenly    into violent convulsions, flap
  ping its wings strongly.    It  continued in this state for a minute ; and at
  3.14 it died, 9 minutes after the injection.
     Electrodes inserted into the spinal cord, in the neck, caused violent
  muscular contractions all over the wings and legs. The cord was thus
  evidently not paralyzed ; but its irritability soon ceased.             The blood
 remained permanently fluid, and became bright red on exposure to air :
  under the microscope (400 diameters) the corpuscles seemed normal.
  Rigor mortis came on.

    A full-grown     youug pigeon had 3 milligrammes of dried cobra-poison
injected    into the  thigh at 2.49 p.m.

appearance and begins to droop.

and paralyzed.
    3.10. Dead in 21 minutes from the injection.
    Electrodes inserted into the cord soon after death caused general con
tractions of the extremities, showing that the cord was not paralyzed.
Its irritability soon disappeared. The symptoms in this bird are different
from those in the one poisoned by Z)a6oio-virus ; there is more lethargy,
nodding of the head, and apparent drowsiness before the convulsions,
which are not so sudden or so violent.
                                   Experiment  IV.

into the peritoneum at 3.5 p.k.
    3.15. The bird is sluggish, nodding its head.

    3.22. Convulsions.       Several grains of Indian corn are vomited.
    3.25.    Quite paralyzed.    Convulsions.
    3.26. Dead in 21 minutes from the injection.
    Electrodes in the cord soon after death caused movements in the limbs.
 The irritability rapidly disappeared, and at 3.33 was entirely gone.
    The blood coagulated firmly after death.
    When examined after death with a magnifying-power of 400 diameters,
 crenation of some of the red corpuscles was observed, but no other change
 was noticed.

     1.58. The animal is very unsteady and tottering on its legs.
     2.2. Both hind legs completely paralyzed, and, when the animal draws
 itself forward with its fore paws, the hind legs trail out behind it. There
 are twitehings of the fore part of the body.
     2.17. Hind legs and loins quite paralyzed.      The posterior part of the
 body lies flat on the ground, the abdomen being flattened out upon it.
 Paralysis seems gradually extending to the fore limbs. There is general
 twitching. It tries to crawl, but cannot drag itself forward, though it can
 still move the fore legs. Gnaws the bottom of the box in which it lies.
     2.20. Almost motionless.       Eye is still sensitive.    Fluid has issued
 from the mouth. The animal can still move its head.

 occur   ; they seem to be of the nature of respiratory movements.          Heart
 beats strongly.
     In a minute or two afterwards the animal was opened. The heart was
 irritable and contracted when touched. The ventricle did not contract
 unless touched.      The auricles were beating.     The lungs were (I think)
  slightly congested. Blood from the large trunks in the thorax was col
  lected in a vessel ; it was of a dark colour ; on exposure to air it became
  bright red and formed a firm coagulum.         Peristaltic movements of the
  intestine were observed.

 quite still.
   3.12. The animal did not seem to be much affected by the poison.
 Some more injected into left thigh.
   4. Both hind legs became paralyzed, and the animal lay with them
spread out behind it. The hind part of the body also sank down, so that
the abdomen became flattened on the floor, just as with the Zta6oia-poison.
   4.23. Convulsive twitches occur.             The animal lies on its side. It is
more convulsed than the one killed with Daboia-jtoiaon.
                            Action of Cobra-poison on Frogs.
   When cobra-poison is injected under the skin of frogs they occasionally
become very restless immediately after the injection.            This, however, is by
no means always the case ; and as similar agitation occurs, often to a much
greater extent, after the injection of other substances, it is to be attributed
rather to the insertion of the needle than to the action of the venom. A
gradually increasing torpor then comes over the animal, sometimes begin
ning some time after the injection, and then proceeding uninterruptedly, at
other times being interrupted by occasional movements. The limbs are
drawn close up to the body, and the head gradually sinks down between
the hands in most instances ; but sometimes, as in Experiment VIII., the
head is held at first much more erect than usual.               The power of motion
is lost before that         of sensation  ; for  the movements     caused by painful
stimuli become weaker and weaker, although they may still follow each
application of the irritant. The progressive weakness is well shown in
the movements of the hind legs. After the frog has sunk down and is
lving flat upon the table, pinching the toes causes it to kick vigorously ;
but by-and-by, instead of kicking, it merely draws away the foot from
the irritant with a slow wriggling motion.              If it is then lifted up from
the  table,   so  as to  remove   the resistance   occasioned   by friction, the wrig
gling entirely disappears, and the foot is promptly and easily drawn up
to the body when pinched.                This weakness seems to depend on the
nervous system rather than on the muscles ; for, even in this state of ap
parent paralysis,       the animal occasionally displays considerable muscular
power,   and    is able   to spring to a considerable height, as in the following
experiment.        A similar condition is sometimes observed in warm-blooded
animals, as in Experiment LX.             The motor paralysis increases, no motion
follows the application of any irritant, however powerful ; but even then
sensation exists, as is seen from Experiment LXXVI. The heart continues
to beat after all motion in the body has ceased ; but its pulsations become
gradually slower, and at last        cease altogether.
                                    Experiment    VIII.
   September      12th, 1873. — Three frogs      of nearly equal size were selected,
and   a dose    of dried cobra-poison dissolved in water was injected into the

dorsal lymph-sac of each.      The quantity injected into No. 1 was estimated
to be equal to three or four drops of the fresh poison, that into No. 2
about a drop, aud into No. 3 about half a drop.        These estimates, how
ever, are not to be absolutely depended on.
   The injection was made into all three about 3 p.m.
    3.17. Nos.  1 and 2 are sitting with the head much more erect than usual
and the belly depressed. No. 3 has the head depressed between the fore
paws.

    4. No. 1 lies quite quiet ; when moved its limbs give a slight wriggle.
Applied strong acetic acid to its legs ; after many seconds it gave a faint
wriggle.    No. 2 also lies quiet. When its legs are pulled back it can
still wriggle them up towards its body.       When held up it can kick well.
After being placed on the table it suddenly, and without any apparent
reason, sprung up to a considerable height.         No. 3 presents the same
appearance as No. 2, but seems more paralyzed.
    4.5. No. 1 does not react at all to any painful stimulus.     Nos. 2 and
3 wriggle their legs when pinched.         The observation was now discon
tinued.    Next morning all three were dead.
                               Action on Lizards.
    The action of cobra-poison upon lizards seems very similar to that
which it has upon frogs ; the animal becomes sluggish and difficult
to rouse ; and the bitten part is affected by paralysis, so that, if a limb
has been thus wounded, it is dragged by the animal.             The .paralysis
afterwards extends to the rest of the body, and death ensues.         Experi
ments on this subject have been recorded by one of us (Dr. Fayrer) in
the ' Thanatophidia of India.'
                      Effect of Serpent-venom  on Snakes.
    The bite of venomous serpents, such as the cobra, Daboia, and Bun-
yarwt, generally proves fatal to innocuous serpents, but not always.      The
occasional escape of the latter is probably due to the quantity of poison
absorbed having been small, either absolutely, or relatively to the size of
the bitten snake.    The effect of the size of the innocuous snake upon the
time required by the poison to produce a fatal effect is illustrated by
experiment /, in which a small rat-snake was killed by the bite of a Bun-
garus ccerulens (less poisonous than a cobra) in 7 hours 17 minutes, while
a large snake of the same species was not killed by the bite of a cobra
till after about 36 hours (experiment a); and another still larger one
was unaffected by the cobra-venom (experiment g). Venomous snakes
are not generally affected either by their own poison or that of another
sort of snake, no less than 1 5 drops of venom having been injected hypo-
dermically into a cobra ( Experiment r ) without effect ; but small ones

are occasionally killed by large individuals belonging                either to the same
or to a different species *.
    The symptoms caused by the poison were the same in both the inno
cuous and the venomous snakes killed by it, and consisted chiefly of slug
gishness and indisposition to move, which probably signifies in the snake,
as it does in the frog, a progressive paralysis.                 Only in experiment 6
were convulsive movements noticed.               The movements of the tail in ex
periment c, after motion had ceased in every other part of the body, are
remarkable.
     The poisonous action of the venom of the cobra, Daboia, and Bungarus
upon innocuous snakes is shown in the following experiments selected
from a number recorded in the ' Thanatophidia of India : —
                                                                           '
     Exp. a. — March 10th, 1868. — A rat-snake (Ptyas mucosa), about 6 feet
in length, was bitten by a large cobra at 12.54.                      Before closing the
 snake's jaws on the part the scales were scraped off.                   Blood was freely
 drawn by the snake's fangs from bites inflicted in two places.
     1 .8 p.m. Appears sluggish ; wound bleeding freely.

      1 .35. No change.
     There was no apparent change in the snake all that day or the next,
 except that it may have been a little more sluggish.                        It died in the
 night of the 11th, being         found  dead   on  the   morning of the 12th.

      They simply seemed to become sluggish and powerless ; there were no
  convulsions, no writhings or contortions.              After they had appeared quite
  dead for a moment or two, the tail of each moved slightly.
      Exp. d. — A green whip-snake (Passerita mi/cterizans), more than 3 feet
  long, was bitten by       a cobra about 10 inches        from the head, at 12.37       p.m.

hausted, gaped like the one bitten by the cobra, and at 2.2 it was dead
22 minutes after the bite.       The Daboia had been in confinement for some
time and was probably exhausted.

   The occasional escape of an innocuous snake after the bite of a poison
ous one is illustrated by Experiment g.              Several others were made
with a like result.
   Exp. g. —A full-grown rat-snake (Ptyas mucosa), about 8 feet long,
was bitten by a fresh cobra about two thirds grown and about half its
own size. About 13 minutes after the bite it seemed restless and un
easy, but remained perfectly active, and was perfectly well on the third
day after the bite.
   The power of one venomous snake to kill another appears from               the
following experiments.
   Exp.     h. — A Bungarus    fasciatus, nearly-full grown, was bitten by a
very large and powerful cobra 5 feet 8 inches in length.           It was bitten
twice, about 8 inches from the head,        at  12.22 p.m.   The cobra took firm
hold and implanted the fangs deeply.           It seemed to be unaffected ; and
22| hours after the bite it still seemed well ; but it died about the 29th
hour.
   Exp. t. — A Bungarus ccerukus, 28 inches long, was bitten by a very
large and powerful cobra. It died in 40 minutes, presenting the same
symptoms as those of an innocuous snake killed by a cobra-bite.

1874.]              Poison of Indian Venomous Snakes.                           77
   Exp. h. — July 10th, 1869.    A   young cobra, about 10 inches long, was
bitten at 3.45 p.m. by a fresh    full-grown cobra near the tail, so that the
viscera might not be injured. The fangs were seen to penetrate ; and
no doubt could exist that the poison was fairly inserted.          Being put on
the ground it crawled away vigorously, and seemed unaffected by the bite.
On the llith it seemed well ; but on the 17th it was found dead, and had
apparently been so for about 12 hours.
   As this snake was young it may have died partly from want of food,
and partly from the wound, as well as from the effects of the poison.
    Though small snakes of a venomous species may be killed by large
ones, either of the same or of another species, full-grown individuals are
rarely injured by the bite of another, either of their own or another
species.    This is illustrated by the following experiments,          which   are
taken from numerous others of the same sort.
   Exp. I. — A Buwjarus fasciatus was fairly     and deeply bitten by a fresh
cobra near the tail ; there was no doubt of      the penetration of the fangs
and inoculation of the poison.       No effect   was produced, and the Bun-
gams was alive and well five days after the      bite.
    Exp. m. — A Bungarus fasciatus was thoroughly bitten in a similar man
ner by a fresh Daboia.     The bite produced no effect, and five days after
wards the snake was in its normal condition.
    Exp. n. — A Daboia was bitten by     a fresh cobra near the   tail, the scales
having been previously scraped off. The snake bit fiercely and repeatedly.
Two days afterwards no effect could be noticed.
    Exp. o. — A large black cobra was bitten in two places 1 foot 6 inches
from the head, and also on the head, by a large and vicious Daboia.
Blood was slightly drawn ; and there could be no doubt that the fangs had
penetrated and the poison been inoculated.         Six days after the bite there
was no change    in the snake.
    Exp. p. — A full-grown cobra was bitten by another full-grown, fresh,
and vigorous cobra in two places about 6 inches from the head, and
also in the mouth.     They both bit each other freely in this situation, and
blood was freely drawn.      They were both well a week afterwards.
    Exp. q. — A cobra had 15 drops     of his own venom injected hypodermi-
cally about 8 inches from the head. A week afterwards       it seemed sluggish     ;
but this might be from other causes.
    Exp. r. — A cobra had    15 drops   of the venom from another cobra in
jected hypodermically in the same      situation as the last. A week after
wards he was perfectly well.
                                Effects on Fish.
   Cobra-poison seems to produce paralysis, indicated by the fish turning
on its side in the water — and also great excitement, the fish struggling
and plunging violently.

78              Messrs. T.    L. Brunton and       J. Fayrer on the        [Jan. 22,
                                  Experiment     IX.
   A   fish (Ophioccphalus marulius), about 10 inches in length, was bitten
by a fresh cobra at 11.20 a.m. in two places on the dorsal and ventral
surfaces.
   1 1 .22. It turned over on its sids in the water.
   11.23. Struggling and plunging violently in the water.
   11.25. Turned over on its side.
   11.26. On being roused it plunges violently.
   1 1 .40. Dead in 20 minutes from the bite.
   For the purpose of comparison the following experiment with curare
was made.      It will  be seen that there was no plunging.           The failure of
muscular action, except when a more than ordinarily powerful stimulus
from the nerve-centres called it into play, is very evident.
                                   Experiment     X.
   November    1873. — Injected    a   solution of curare under the skin of a
carp near the tail.     A  great part of the solution came out on withdrawing
the needle of the syringe.
   11.25. Injection made.
   11.26. The fish lies obliquely in the water, inclining to the opposite
side from the injection. It can move when irritated, and can remain
perfectly upright in the water       ;  but in a very short time its position be
comes oblique again.
   11.35. Injected some more curare.           A great part of this also returned.
   11.50. Lies obliquely, but can move tolerably vigorously when roused.
   11.55. Moves more feebly when roused.
   12.10. Seemed dead, but did not lie flat on its side, and still preserved
the oblique position.
   12.20.   It suddenly started up without any apparent cause, swam across
the vessel, a distance of several inches, and then relapsed into its former
state.
                                 Action on Snails.
   Cobra-venom      seems   to destroy their irritability.     It first causes them
to shrink within their shells, and finally lessens their movements when
stimulated.
               Effect  of Reagents   6,c. on the Action of the  Poison.
   The activity of the poison is not destroyed, and scarcely impaired, by
drying. We have made no comparative experiments with perfectly fresh
poison and the dried residue of a similar quantity ; but there are few, if
any, instances on record of death from the fresh poison in less than half
a minute, the time in which the dried poison killed a guineapig                   in
Experiment XXVIII.
   The local action of the poison, however, seems to be altered by drying ;
for extravasation of blood around the part where a snake has inserted its

 1874.]               Poison  of Indian   Venomous    Snakes.                  79
fangs,   or venom has been injected, is one of the most prominent effects
produced by the fresh poison, whereas it is very slight, or absent alto
gether, when the dried venom has been employed, except in occasional
instances, such as      Experiment   LVII.
   Dilution seems also to have no effect in lessening the activity of the
venom, except so far as it retards absorption ; for it is evident that a
drop of pure poison, injected subcutaneously, is likely to find its way into
the   circulation    more quickly than the same       quantity diluted    with  a
hundred times      its bulk of water.
   Coagulation     of the venom by alcohol does not destroy its activity, as
we have shown in our former communication.              The coagulum thrown
down by the alcohol is innocuous, or nearly so ; but the poisonous principle
remains in solution, and the alcoholic extract possesses similar properties
to the poison itself.      A specimen of poison was received from India in a
coagulated state ; but we are uncertain whether this occurred sponta
neously or was produced by the action of reagents.          It is probable, how
ever, that it was due to its having been mixed, in order to preserve it,
with alcohol, which had evaporated before we received it. It was active,
as Experiment XI. shows.          Coagulation by boiling does not destroy the
activity of the poison (Experiment XII.) ; but a portion which was boiled
for more than half an hour under pressure corresponding to a tempera
ture of 102° C, had no effect when injected under the thigh of a lark.
The notes of this experiment have unfortunately been lost.            Admixture
with liquor ammonias and liquor potassao does not alter the effects of
the poison.       This appears from Experiment XIII., and from several
made by Dr. Fayrer in India.

 India.    It  was of a yellowish    colour, and was hard and dry, like tough

 imperfectly    soluble), was injected into the thigh of the same guineapig

   "With cobra-venom,        as  with other poisons, there is      a general corre
spondence     between    the size of  the  animal  and   the intensity of the effects
of a given quantity of poison, a small animal being more readily affected

in the constitution of the animal, or, as the story used to run, on account
of its knowledge of some herb which it used to eat as an antidote ; but such
is not the case. If fairly bitten, it succumbs like any other creature, as
 proved by experiments in India (' Thanatophidia,' pp. 68, 69, and 134).
 Its great activity and vigour enable it to elude the snake ; and generally,
 when it is wounded, it is merely scratched, not pierced by the fangs.
 If   the poison is inoculated,      it dies.
      The same is true of the pig, which escapes probably by receiving the
 wound in the foot, where absorption is not rapid or vigorous.                   This
 animal, like     others,   yields  to  the   poison  when  the fangs are embedded

                                 Action on Germination.
      In order   to see whether cobra-poison had any effect on the germination
  of seeds, the following experiments were made. It will be seen from
  them that the venom does not prevent germination, but interferes with
  it, especially when strong.           In this it agrees with rattlesnake-poison.

                                      Experiment   XIV.
       A piece of  flannel was doubled, and, 12 cress-seeds being laid between
  the folds,    it  was placed in a small beaker with 10 cubic centims. of
  water. Another piece, treated in the same way, was laid in 9 cubic
  centims. of water and 1 of a 2-per-cent. solution of dried cobra-poison.
       Some time after the water had evaporated, so as to leave the flannel
  soaked with water but not covered, nine of those seeds which had been
   treated with water and poison had germinated and grown to about half
   an inch in length, while seven of those treated by water alone had ger
   minated and had grown somewhat larger than the others.
                                       Experiment    XV.
       The preceding experiment was repeated with lettuce-seeds.             Seven of
   those treated with water alone had germinated, but only one of those
   treated with water and poison.

out a radicle more than £ of an inch long. All the cress-seeds moistened
with poison had also sprouted, but the radicles were only about       of an                     -j1^

barely visible.

its poisonous action and      may be due in great measure to the solution
                                 ;     it
of the poison having matted the fibres of cotton-wool more closely than
the water, and thus rendered the conditions of air and moisture less
favourable to the seeds placed in it.
             Effect    of   the Poison when introduced through different channels.
   The action of the poison      most rapid when
                                            is          introduced directlyit   is
into the circulation, as              by
                             injection into the jugular vein and       such              ;      in
instances death may occur in less than        minute.  When injected into
                                                               a
the thoracic cavity, as in Experiment XXVIII., death occurred almost as
quickly but this may have been due to puncture of the lung and intro
              ;
duction of the poison directly into some of the pulmonary vessels.
   Injection into the peritoneal cavity comes next in order of rapidity,
but      a    good deal behind the last              ;   and   it   is   followed      by subcutaneous
injection.
   Whatever may be the effect of the venom of the viper or crotalus, the
cobra virus produces its poisonous effects tolerably rapidly when
swallowed, both in the frog and in warm-blooded animals, as         seen                        is
from Experiments XVII. and XIX.
    It   is   also absorbed from the conjunctiva,                and produces the character
istic symptoms of poisoning.                     In      Experiment XX. the animal, though
affected          by
           the poison, recovered   but in several experiments made
                                                 ;                    one                              by

    A small quantity of dried cobra-poison dissolved in water was given to
 a young rabbit at 2.53 p.m. It was readily swallowed.           In 7 minutes all
 the symptoms of poisoning were developed.            The rabbit died in convul
 sions in 11 minutes, just as when the poison is injected hypodermically.
 The thorax was opened a few minutes afterwards.            The heart had ceased
 to beat.     Rigor mortis came on very rapidly.

                              Local Action of the Poison.
    Cobra-poison acts as a local irritant, and produces chemosis of the
conjunctiva and swelling of the eyelids when applied to the eye, and,
occasionally, congestion of the peritoneal vessels when injected into the
abdominal cavity (Experiments XX. and XLIV.).
    It paralyzes the ends of the motor nerves, and also the muscles of the
part into which it has been injected (Experiment XXV.).              The muscles
are not only deprived of their irritability, but become prone to putrefy
(Experiment LVH.).            The fresh cobra-poison produces great extrava
sation of blood around the wound through which it has been introduced ;
but this is not so marked when dried poison is used.

    If  death do not rapidly follow, great swelling from infiltration of the
areolar tissue may occur, or, in some cases, gangrene of the skin and sub
jacent cellu'ar tissue and subsequent changes indicative of general blood-
poisoning.
    The local action     of viperine     is probably        more active    than   that of
colubrine virus.
                     Action of Cobra-poison upon            the  Blood.
     The blood of animals killed by cobra-poison generally presents a dark
 colour, as death is due to failure of the respiration and not of the circu
 lation ; but it readily assumes a florid colour when exposed to air. The
 same is the case with the blood of animals poisoned by Daboia-v&aam
 (Experiments II., V., and VI.).
     Coagulation usually occurs readily and firmly in the blood of animals
 killed by cobra-poison, while it is frequently absent from the blood of
those killed by that of the Daboia.             In experiments made in India, this
 occurred almost invariably ; and it is illustrated by Experiments II. and
 IV. In Experiments I., V., and VI., however, coagulation occurred in
the blood of a pigeon and guineapig poisoned by Z)a6ot'a-venom ; and a
similar occurrence has been sometimes observed by one of us (Dr. Fayrer)
in fowls bitten by this snake in India*.
     In numerous instances we have been unable to detect any alteration in
the blood-corpuscles after death from cobra-poison ; but in Experiments
 XXI.    and XXII.   we observed a most distinct crenation in the corpuscles
 of rats poisoned by it. This was probably due in some degree to evapora
tion, as in Experiment XXT. it was to a great extent prevented by sur
rounding the preparation with oil ; but it indicates a change in the blood,
as the corpuscles     did not present this appearance before the injection of
the poison — although they were prepared for observation in exactly the
 same way, and were as much exposed to evaporation in the one case as in
 the other.
                                  Experiment      XXI.
    A   drop of blood from       the tail of a white rat was examined micro
scopically.    The corpuscles did not form rouleaux ; but no trace of cre
nation could be observed in them.
     12.10 p.m. -018 gramme of dried cobra-poison, dissolved in 1 cubic
centim. of water, was injected into the flank.                  Almost immediately the
nose of the animal began to twitch up every few seconds.
     12.15. Head has sunk down. The breathing was laboured. The animal
made a sudden start forwards. The hind legs dragged behind. It did not
move readi'y when irritated. The breathing was laboured                 ; the expiration
convulsive.     General convulsive movements occurred.
    12.18. The animal seemed dead. The heart was still beating. A drop of
blood was taken from the tail ; and, the thorax being opened, another was

corpuscles in both were seen to be very much crenated.    They did not
form rouleaux.    Another drop was taken from the right ventricle, and
surrounded with oil to prevent evaporation. Hardly a trace of cremation
could be observed in this drop ; but several branching crystals of a reddish
colour were observed, and some of them appeared to grow while under
observation.     Numerous granular masses were also seen.

coagula of some sort.

made, and then ceased.  The      heart was beating steadily. Thorax opened
and heart exposed. A little      blood drawn from the ventricles by a fine
pipette was examined microscopically by Dr. Klein.          It presented
exactly the same characters as those of the former specimen. Blood from
another, healthy rat showed numerous rouleaux, and the corpuscles were
not crenated.

   Cobra-poison has the power of destroying the irritability of voluntary
muscular fibre when applied directly to        it,

diluted condition.  It does   not produce any quivering of  the fibres and       ;
in  this particular   itdiffers from the poison of the rattlesnake as
described by Dr. Weir Mitchell.
  The local action of cobra-poison on muscle            is   illustrated   by   Experi
ments XXIIL, XXIV., XXV., and XXVI.

  September 4th. —  A   frog was decapitated, and the skin removed from
both hind legs.     A longitudinal cut was then made in the muscle of
both thighs.   A  strong solution of dried cobra-poison in distilled water,
of such   strength as to resemble the fresh poison closely in appearance,
          a
was then applied to the cut in one thigh, while the other was moistened
                                                            h              2

with distilled water.         Immediately after the application an almost
imperceptible trembling in the muscles occurred equally in both thighs ;
but it ceased after a few seconds, and did not reappear.              On testing
the muscles soon afterwards, by an induced current applied directly to
them, those of the poisoned leg contracted feebly, but those of the non-
poisoned leg, forcibly.
    In this  experiment, the quivering occurred equally in both thighs, and
was therefore obviously due to the water in which the poison was dis
solved, and not to the poison itself.
    As Weir Mitchell found that the quivering produced by the poison of
the rattlesnake was not prevented by paralysis of the motor nerves by
 curare, the previous experiment was repeated on a curarized frog.
                                 Experiment   XXIV.
    September   4th. — The motor nerves having      been tested and  found to be
 completely paralyzed, a strong solution of cobra-poison was applied to a
 cut in the back of the right thigh. No quivering of the muscles could be
 observed after its application.        The poison was only applied to the
 middle    of the back of the right thigh.          After a few minutes, those
 muscles with which it had come into contact did not contract when irritated
 by the direct application of an induced current.         Distance of secondary
 from the primary coil 0.          The muscles of the sides and front of the
 poisoned thigh, as well as those of the other thigh, contracted well when
irritated in the same way, with the coil at 13 centimetres.
    The poison paralyzes the muscles of warm-blooded animals in much
the same way as those of frogs ; and it seems probable from the following
 experiment, that the paralysis of the wounded limb, which is very fre
quently noticed in cases of snake-bite, is partly due to the local action of
 the poison upon the muscles.
                                 Experiment   XXV.

muscles contract when the coil is at 3.

  The    toes move   distinctly when the sciatic is irritated ; coil at 37.

    The  ventricles of the heart of No. 2 are only moderately contracted,
and there is no pulsation either in them or the auricles.

pigs, and irritated it by an induced current, coil at 0. No contraction
took place in the hind legs of either animal.         Contractions occurred in
the muscles of the fore legs with much the same force in both.

   This experiment shows that the venom paralyzes the motor nerves
when applied to them locally, a strong current applied to the sciatic
causing no contraction in the left leg of No. 1, while a moderate one
caused movement in the right foot, at a time when the muscles of both
were nearly equally irritable.
  Its   deleterious     action on the muscles, when conveyed by the blood, is
also evident       in the rapid loss of irritability after death in both legs of
No. 1 as compared with No. 2. The pale muscles                       seemed to retain        their
irritability longer than those having a deep colour.

88              Messrs. T.     L. Brunton and       J.   Fayrer on the      [Jau. 22,
body, and the skin removed.            Each was then placed in a glass, and a
sufficient quantity of fresh ox-blood serum poured over it to cover it.
In one glass, the serum contained about 5 centigrams of cobra-poison
dissolved in about 20 cubic centims. of serum          ; but, with this exception, all
the conditions under which the two legs were placed were exactly alike.
   July 19th. — About 19 hours after the immersion of the legs in serum
their irritability was examined.
   The muscles of the leg in the pure serum did not contract at all when
the strongest irritation was applied to the sciatic nerve, but contracted
very vigorously when irritated directly.           The muscles of the leg in the
poisoned serum were whiter than those of the other one.                   They had a
faint yellowish tinge, and were somewhat stiff. They did not contract in
the least when the strongest irritation by a Du-Bois coil was applied
either to them or the sciatic nerve.
   When the poison is injected directly into the circulation, or is very
rapidly absorbed, so that the quantity circulating in the blood is large, it
destroys the irritability of the voluntary muscles rapidly, and, occasionally
at least, hastens in a most remarkable manner the occurrence of rigor
mortis.      This is well seen in the Experiment XXV., where rigor
mortis supervened in half an hour after the injection of the poison, while
the muscles of another animal killed at the same time by decapitation
retained their irritability for many hours.

   Another frog prepared in the same way gave at first : — left leg (poisoned),
distance of coil 42-2, contraction ; right (ligatured), distance 21-0, con
traction.
   After    some   time  : — left leg, distance  6*0, contraction    ; right, distance
25-0, contraction.
   Some time later      : — left leg, distance   0, almost no contraction ; right
leg,  distance   14-5, contraction.
   In this experiment, the poisoned muscle at first responded more readily
to the irritation than the one which had been deprived of blood by the
application of a ligature ; and this renders more apparent the effect of the
poison, in causing rapid diminution and final extinction of irritability in
the muscle to which it had access, since the other lost its excitability
\ery slowly.

 cent, solution of dried cobra-poison into the thoracic cavity of a guinea-
 pig.     It was uncertain whether the lung (right one) was pierced by the
 point of the needle or not. Within a few seconds the animal gave several
 convulsive struggles, and died in half a minute or so. The head was then
 cut off.       Immediately afterwards a second guineapig was killed by deca
 pitation.        On opening the thorax of No. 1 (the poisoned guineapig) the
  lungs were found congested.            The heart was tetanically contracted and
  quite still. The heart of No. 2 wus contracting vigorously.                 The vena

     All the muscles do not lose their irritability with the same rapidity,
 some of them becoming paralyzed before others.               The intercostal muscles,
 serrati, and abdominal muscles seem to lose their irritability first ; and
 such muscles of the limbs as have a dark colour become paralyzed sooner
 than those which are paler (Experiment XXV.).

dead in rather less than a minute from the injection.       The thorax was
then opened.   The lungs were somewhat congested.            The heart was
quite still in tetanic contraction.   A strong interrupted current applied
to it caused no contraction of any of the fibres.    The muscles lost their
irritability very quickly ; the intercostals of both sides, and the serratus
and subscapularis of the right side, seemed to lose their irritability before
the other muscles.

circulates in the blood, its action on the muscles is much less marked,

                frog (Rana temporaria) was poisoned with curare. After

     Another frog was curarized and similarly prepared, with this excep
tion — that the vessels of the right leg only were ligatured, the muscles,
as well as the nerve, being left free.          This frog was also examined in
the same way; and the irritability of the muscles in both legs was
found to be almost exactly the same three to four hours after poisoning.
 Both contracted with the coil at about 7-5.
                     Secondary Action of the Poison on Muscles.
     The muscles of the part into which the poison has been introduced are
 very apt to undergo rapid decomposition.             We have already shown that
 their irritability is either lessened, or completely destroyed, by the action of
 the venom ; and it seems very probable that the mere contact of any other
 foreign body, containing Bacteria or their germs (as the water in which
 the cobra-poison was dissolved in our experiments certainly did) would
 snffice to explain the decomposition of the muscle without assuming any
 special putrefactive action on the part of the poison ; for the muscle,
 which has been at least temporarily killed by the poison, is placed in the
 body in the most favourable conditions of temperature and moisture for
 the occurrence of decomposition whenever any germs are brought into con
 tact with it. However, Weir Mitchell found that the venom of the rattle
 snake had a curious influence upon muscle, which could hardly be explained
 without the supposition that the poison had a peculiar disorganizing
 action upon the muscular tissue. In every instance the venom softened
 the muscle in proportion to the length of time it remained in contact
 with it ; so that, even after a few hours, in warm-blooded animals,
  and after a rather longer time in the frog, the wounded muscle became
  almost diffluent, and assumed a dark colour and somewhat jelly-like ap
  pearance.    The structure remained entire until it was pressed upon or
  stretched, w-hen it lost all regularity, and offered, under the microscope,
  the appearance of a minute granular mass. In order to ascertain whether
  cobra-poison had a similar action, the following experiment was tried.
                                Experiment    XXXIV.
     September    1873. —The gastrocnemii of a frog were removed and laid in
  two watch-glasses.       One was then covered with several drops of a solution
  of dried cobra-poison, dissolved in a sufficient quantity of |-per-cent. salt
  solution to form a mixture about the consistence of fresh poison, while
  the other   was covered with a few drops of salt solution          alone. They

  were then protected from dust by two other watch-glasses inverted over
  them.     The temperature of the room was moderately warm. The
  poisoned muscle underwent no change.                 Both muscles gradually dried
  up ;  but  at  no  time   could  one  be  distinguished  from the other, except by
 the label on the watch-glass.
     The influence of cobra-poison in causing decomposition within the body
  is evident from the following experiment.
                                   Experiment     XXXV.
     January 17th. — About three drops of cobra-poison were injected under
 the skin of the flank of a guineapig at 12.48 p.m.               Immediately after
 wards the guineapig became restless and cried.              In two minutes its head
 began to twitch. An hour after the injection the animal was quiet, and
 little or no effect of the poison could be observed. Three hours after the
 injection it did not seem very well. Next morning it was found dead.
 On examining it 22 hours after the injection it had begun to undergo
 decomposition.        The abdomen was somewhat inflated, and sulphuretted
 hydrogen     issued   from    it when opened. The hair came off readily from
 all parts of the animal's skin.         The muscles were soft. There was little
 ecchymosis     at  the   spot  where  the   injection had been made.    The tissues
 near it were rather watery.              The heart was contracted ; the lungs
 somewhat congested.
                              Action on  the  Nervous System.
     The most prominent symptoms of an affection of the nervous system
after the bite of a cobra, or other venomous snake, in animals or man, are
depression, faintness, lethargy, and in some cases, somnolence. There is
loss of coordinating power, and paralysis, sometimes affecting the hind legs
first and creeping over the body, sometimes affecting the whole body at
once. Death occurs by failure of the respiration, and is preceded by con
vulsions.
    These symptoms clearly point to paralysis either of the nervous centres
or of the peripheral nerves.          It may be supposed that the mention of the
latter alternative       is  superfluous, and that paralysis of the peripheral
nerves cannot produce such symptoms, which must therefore, by exclu
sion, be due to an affection of the central ganglia.            More especially may
the occurrence of convulsions be thought to exclude the possibility of
death being due to paralysis of the peripheral terminations of motor
nerves   ;  for if their function is abolished here, how, it may be said, can
general convulsions, which have their origin in the nervous centres, occur ?
    The answer to this is, that although the ends of the motor nerves are
so far deadened that they no longer transmit to the muscles any ordinary
stimulus proceeding from the nerve-centres, their function is not so
thoroughly abolished that they cannot transmit those which are stronger
than usual.       This is shown by the fact that when an animal is slowly
poisoned by curare (as for example when that poison is introduced into

 1874.]              Poison  of Indian   Venomous    Snakes.                 93
the stomach after ligature of the renal vessels), convulsions occur just
as in death from cobra-poison.        Although the motor nerves have their
function so much impaired that they no longer transmit to the muscles
of respiration the ordinary stimuli from the medulla, which usually keep
up the movements of breathing, they can still transmit those stronger
impulses which proceed from it when greatly stimulated by the increasing
venosity of the blood, and which cause the respiratory as well as the other
muscles of the body to participate in the general convulsions.       The loss of
coordination which occurs in poisoning by cobra-venom, has also been
noticed by Voisin and Liouville in poisoning by curare.
   That the peripheral terminations of the motor nerves are actually
paralyzed by cobra-venom is shown by Experiment XXXVI., in which the
animal was able to move the leg which had been protected from the action
of the poison for some time after the rest of the body was perfectly
motionless, as well as by Exp. XXXVII. and those succeeding it. Its
occurrence in man is indicated by the symptoms of a case described by
Dr. Hilson (Ind. Med. Gaz., Oct, 1873, p. 254).
   But paralysis of motor nerves is not the only effect of cobra-poison on
the nervous system.       The spinal cord is also paralyzed, as is seen from
Exp.  XLI.,    where   motion  ceased in the frog's leg which remained free
from poison, although it answered with great readiness to a very weak sti
mulus applied to its nerve. In some instances paralysis of the spinal cord
appeared to cause death when little or no affection of the motor nerves
could be observed (Exp. XL VII. &c); but in others the peripheral para
lysis was strongly marked. In no case was it more obvious, and in few
was  it so  distinct as in Exp. XXXVI., made with the virus itself, which
had neither become coagulated nor dried.        In experiments made with the
coagulated poison, death seemed invariably to be caused by paralysis of
the spinal cord, the motor nerves being little affected (Exp. XI.) : while,
in those made with the dried venom, sometimes the action on the cord
predominated,      and sometimes that on the nerves.       In  this respect, as
well  as   in some of the symptoms it produces, cobra-poison agrees very
closely with conia.       This alkaloid, as Crum-Brown and Fraser have
shown, often contains a mixture of true conia and methylconia.            Conia
alone paralyzes the motor nerves without affecting the spinal cord ; but
when mixed with methylconia, sometimes the one is affected first, and
sometimes the other.        When the dose is small, the motor nerves are
usually paralyzed before the reflex function of the cord ; but when the
dose is large, the cord is paralyzed before the nerves.       Methylconia also
affects both ; but a small dose    of it paralyzes the cord before the nerves,
while a large one paralyzes them first. The paralysis of the hind legs,
often observed in snake-poisoning (Exp. VI. & VII.), is probably partly
due to the local action of the poison in the nerves and muscles of the bitten
member, and partly to its action on the cord.         This paralysis is noticed
in Genesis     xlix. 17, where  Jacob   says,
                                              " Dan  is an adder in the path,

94                 Messrs.     T. L. Brunton and             J.   Payrer on the      [Jan. 22,
biting the horse-heels,        so that the       rider falleth backward."         In this point
cobra-venom, when dried, appears to resemble methylconia rather than its
admixture with conia ; but it exercises numerous other actions upon the
blood, muscles, &c. which            neither of these substances has been shown
to do.      It   is doubtful whether the cerebrum is directly affected by cobra-
poison, as the intelligence      both in man and animals often remains almost
unimpaired to the last, and the stupor and drowsiness which are some
times noticed may be caused indirectly, by the action of the venom on the
motor and vaso-motor nerves and on the functions of the cord. The re
flex centres through which irritation of the fifth nerve acts, remain un
affected after the reflex function of the cord is nearly gone ; and even then
the power of voluntary motion still exists.
  The effect of the poison upon the respiratory and vaso-motor nerves
will be considered under the heads of respiration and circulation.
                          Action of Cobra-poison on Motor nerves.
  As the contraction of          a muscle, on          irritation of the motor nerve sup
plying
            it,
            is the index        by
                              which we               judge of the irritability of the nerve
itself, the paralyzing effect of cobra-poison upon muscle renders the exact
determination of its action upon motor nerves much more difficult than
in the case of such poison as curare, which leaves the muscular irrita
                           a
bility intact.    For the failure of a muscle to contract on irritation of its
motor nerve, can be due only to paralysis of the motor nerve in the case
of curare but in poisoning
             :                             by
                                     cobra-venom      may be due to enfeeble-

ment of the muscles, as well as paralysis of the nerve.        But     we find     if
instances in which the muscles still retain their irritability almost un
altered, and respond readily to direct stimulation after they have ceased
to contract on irritation of their motor nerve, we are justified in saying
that the nerve      paralyzed
                     is          and such
                                     ;        the case in Experiment XLI.
                                                       is
   In Experiment XXV. this action on the ends of motor nerves               all          is
the more evident from the paralysis being most complete in the part
where the poison was introduced. At this part,          was brought, init con            a
centrated state, into contact with the ends of the motor nerves, while the
other parts of the body received        after dilution with the blood and in
                                                it                                   ;
them the paralysis was much less marked.
   The paralysis of the hind legs, so often noticed in experiments, appears
to be due, at least in considerable measure, to the local action of the
poison on the ends of the motor nerves of the legs, as the injection or
bite   isoften made on the flank or thigh.
     The action of the poison on motor nerves illustrated by the following

                              Experiment  XXXVI.
    A ligature was placed round the right thigh of a young frog, excluding
the sciatic nerve.
    2.42. A drop of dark fluid cobra-poison (the first supply) was injected
into the dorsal lymph-sac.        Immediately after the injection the animal
became restless.
    3. It lies quietly with its eyes shut. It hardly moves when touched ;
but it struggles when laid upon its back.
    3.8. It can still draw up the ligatured leg. The other one can be
drawn up, but with a wriggling motion.           When laid on its back the
animal no longer resists.
    3.9.30. It lies quite flat.    There is trembling of the leg when either
foot is touched ; and when it is pinched either leg can still be drawn up.
On suddenly touching the poisoned leg, the frog gave a jerk with both.
Bespiratory movements have ceased.          The exact time when they did so
was not noticed.
    3.17. The frog has become much lighter in colour, with the exception
of the ligatured leg.
     3.45. The eyes no longer shut when touched ; they remain widely
open.      Dilute acetic acid of 1 per cent, produces no effect when applied
to the sound leg ; but when the leg is lifted up, so as to prevent friction
against the table, it is drawn in towards the body.
     4.9. On applying a strong interrupted current to the eye of the frog
the unpoisoned leg jerks feebly, the poisoned one not at all.
     4.13. On turning the frog on his back the non-poisoned leg moved.
     4.20. Opened abdomen. The heart was beating, but only slowly.       Irri
tated the lumbar nerves on the left side (those of poisoned leg) by an in
 terrupted current. No contraction occurred in the poisoned leg; but
 twitching took place in the non-poisoned one. Irritated lumbar nerves
 of right side. Tetanus occurred in the right (non-poisoned leg). No
 movement of the poisoned leg. Laid bare the muscles of both legs, and
 irritated them by a Faradic current directly applied. Those of the poisoned
 leg were paler than those of the other. The muscles of both legs con
 tracted when irritated directly.     Exposed the sciatic nerves of both sides
 and irritated them by an induced current. No contraction in the gastro
 cnemius of poisoned leg. Tetanus in the non-poisoned leg.
     4.35. The heart is no longer contracting.     Electrodes were placed in
 the medulla, and an interrupted current applied.       Contractions occurred
 in the non-poisoned leg. No contractions in the poisoned one.
     The movements which occurred in the non-poisoned leg when the
 lumbar nerves of the other side were irritated, may have been due to re
 flex action through the spinal cord. If this were the case, it would indi
 cate that the sensory fibres in the lumbar plexus were not paralyzed, and
 that the reflex power of the cord was not quite destroyed : but the nerves

9(5             Messrs. T.       L. Brunton and   J.   Fayrer on the    [Jan.   22,
were not very carefully isolated, and it is probable that the twitchings
were due to direct irritation of the lumbar nerves of the right side by
conducted currents, especially as irritation of the left sciatic nerve caused
no movement in the right foot.
   The continuance of movement in the ligatured leg, after it had ceased
in other parts of the body, indicates that the ends of the motor nerves have
been paralyzed ; and this is confirmed by the production of tetanus in the
ligatured and absence of movement in the poisoned leg when their motor
nerves are stimulated.    The slightness of the movements in the ligatured
leg when a strong interrupted current was applied to the eye, while the
motor nerves of the limb still retained their irritability, indicates that
paralysis of the reflex function of the cord had taken place. The motion
of the leg on turning the frog on his back afterwards,           shows that the
higher nervous centres, through which the opposition to the change of
posture was manifested, retained their power longer than the cord.
                                 Experiment   XXXVII.
    November       1872. — The sciatic nerve of the left leg of a frog was
               29<A,
exposed ;  and a double ligature being passed under it round the limb, the
whole of the tissues except the bone were then divided and removed be
tween the ligatures.  A fraction of a drop of cobra^poison, diluted with
 |-per-cent. salt solution, was injected into the lymph-sac.        After about
two hours the animal seemed paralyzed.         On irritating either fore leg by
electricity, or by acetic acid, slight movements occurred in the hind feet,
and were fully stronger in the poisoned than the ligatured limb.            Irrita
tion of the poisoned hind foot also occasioned twitches both in it and the
non-poisoned foot.      Twitches did not invariably occur.     No twitching of
the fore paws was noticed on irritation of the hind feet.       A ligature was
then passed round the poisoned hind leg, and the tissues divided, as in
the non-poisoned one, and the animal left a little longer.            Irritations
again applied had a similar result to the former, but the contractions in
the non-poisoned limb were sometimes stronger than in the other.              Irri
tation applied by a strong interrupted current to the spinal cord, by elec
trodes inserted in     it,
                        caused very faint twitches in both hind feet.      Irrita
tion of the lumbar nerves in the abdomen caused very faint twitches in the
feet. Irritation of the exposed sciatic nerve of the non-poisoned limb by an
interrupted current caused strong contractions.        Similar irritation of the
poisoned sciatic caused much weaker contractions.          Direct irritation of
the muscles by interrupting         constant current, caused contractions of
                                    a
nearly equal strength in both.
    The dose of poison in this experiment was small, and        it was given in
a  much diluted form.      The fact that an interrupted current applied to
the sciatic nerve of the poisoned limb had      much slighter effect than the
                                                a
same current applied to the sciatic nerve of the non-poisoned limb, while

able amount of paralysis of the ends of motor nerves, while the muscles
are but little affected.
                                   E.vperiment   XXXVIII.
   May l±ih. — The right leg of        frog was ligatured, with the exception
                                           a
of the sciatic nerve, and the animal poisoned by a rather small dose of
dried cobra-poison dissolved in water, and injected into the dorsal lymph-
sac at 11.45 a.m.
   12.15. The animal paralyzed.         Acetic acid applied to the left arm
caused movements in it ; but no movements ensued when the acid was
applied to the nose. When applied to both arms and one leg, it caused
movements in the arms and the left leg, but none in the right leg.
   12.33. Acetic acid applied to the left arm causes movement in           but in   it,
no other part of the body.
   12.51. Electrodes were placed in the spine and the cord irritated                       by   a
Faradic current.     At 15 centimetres distance of the secondary from the
primary coil there      faint twitch in right arm. At
                          is                                   distinct twitch in
                                                                    9,

exposed and irritated.      At 50, right leg contracts distinctly. At 36,
right leg becomes tetanized.      At 16, left leg contracts very faintly indeed.
At  8, left leg contracts slightly.
   The muscles were then irritated by single induced shocks — 9"8 centims.,
                                                                          :
right leg faint contraction     9-8, left (poisoned) leg contraction
                                    ;                                     equally  is
strong; 10-1, left (poisoned) leg contraction occurs.          10-1, right (liga
tured one) does not contract.
   In this experiment, the irritability of the poisoned muscle greater              is
than that of the other, the venom having done less injury to the mus
cular substance than the deprivation of blood                by
                                                        the ligature, and conse
quently the paralyzing          action of the poison on the ends of the motor
nerves becomes          very evident.

 no movement whatever.
     12.40. Acetic acid applied to a forearm         causes vigorous    movement    in
 it and also in left hind leg.
     1.  Acetic acid to right hind foot causes no movement.           Applied to left
 hind foot it causes vigorous movements in both forearms and left hind leg.
     1.12. A ligature was applied to the left thigh in a similar manner to
 that on the right, so as to cut off the circulation in the left leg also, and
 thus bring the two legs as much as possible under the same conditions.
 The general condition of the frog is much the same as before ; but the
 reflex action produced by irritation of the cornea is slighter.
     1.24. Acetic acid applied to right forearm.           Slight movement occurs
 in right hind leg alone. When applied to left forearm it caused slight
 movement in that arm alone.
     1.35. Acetic acid applied to both feet, both forearms, and to the nose
 caused no motion anywhere.          Both sciatic nerves were now laid bare along
 a considerable portion of their course.          It was found that, although the
 right sciatic had not been included          in  the ligature, it had been tightly
 constricted by the fascia at the place of ligature.         Sciatic nerves irritated
 by an induced current.

                                             possibly have been due to the left

                                            more than the right, both sciatica were
                                             exposed further, and irritated quite
                                            below the points of ligature and just
                                            above the knee.
        Bight.             37-5           Distinct contraction.
        Left.                7'0          No distinct contraction.       When the
                                            muscles were irritated by single in
                                            duced shocks, applied to them directly,
        Single shock.       7.5             they contracted almost equally.
    In this   experiment, the right sciatic nerve had been injured by the ope
ration of ligaturing ; and thus the effect of the poison on the other limb
as compared with the right one was less manifest.             Notwithstanding this
it moved, and the other limbs did not, when the right arm was irritated.
The difference between the irritability of the sciatic nerves when the
muscles of the legs themselves were almost equally irritable, shows, in a
marked manner, the influence of the poison on the motor nerves.

    10.57. Ligature applied.      A considerable quantity of blood was lost.
    10.58. A considerable quantity of dried cobra-poison dissolved in water
was injected into the dorsal lymph-sac. Immediately after being released
the frog jumped about, but became quiet in a minute or so.
    11.28. Made some voluntary movements.
    11.45. Acetic acid to fore feet causes weak reflex movements in both
fore feet ; stronger in hind feet, especially in right.
    11.55. Acetic acid to right forearm caused vigorous kicks of right
hind leg. Acetic acid affected right leg in 10 seconds. No motion in
any other part of body.     Acetic acid to left forearm caused kicks in both
hind legs, but much more vigorous in the right. Also movement of left
forearm by itself, but weak.
    12.5. Acetic acid to left fore leg caused wriggling motion, first in right
hind leg and then in left fore leg in 16 seconds. Applied to right forearm
it caused a weak kick in right hind leg and wriggling in left hind leg, but
no motion in any other part.
    12.27. Acetic acid applied to forearm.       No reflex action anywhere.
    12.30. No reflex action anywhere on application of acetic acid.
    12.30. Distance of coil 8.     Electrodes in the spinal cord.    Slight con
 tractions in right hind and left fore legs, and also in^ the abdominal
 muscles, though very weak.          It was now noticed that the cord with
 which the frog was attached to the board had been very tightly tied
 round the left forearm and left there. The circulation was stopped there,
 as the cord had not been removed.
    The paralyzing effect of the poison on the motor nerves was here shown
 by an involuntary experiment.        On irritating the cord the ligatured leg
 responded as we had expected, but we were astonished to see movements
in the left arm also. An examination of the limb at once showed the
 cause of the phenomenon.       The cord attaching it to the board had been
inadvertently drawn so tight as to obstruct the circulation, and thus pre
 vented the access of the poison to the nerves.

    On testing the irritability of several of the frogs used in these experi
ments on the ensuing day, the ligatured leg was found to contract on
irritation of the sciatic nerve, or of the muscles directly.           The muscles
of the poisoned leg did not contract, either when irritated directly or
through the nerves.

   May 20th, 1873. — In order to test the action of cobra-poison on the
ends of the motor nerves, without disturbing the experiment by ligaturing
one leg, two frogs were taken of as nearly as possible the same size.
Both were very small ; but No. 1 was somewhat larger and stronger than
No. 2. The sciatic nerve was exposed in one thigh of each frog and
placed on the hook electrodes used by Marey for his myograph.                     By
means of a Pohl's commutator, with the cross pieces taken out, an inter
rupted current could be sent at will through either nerve.             The distance
of the secondary from the primary coil at whieh the first faint contrac

    1*47. The spinal cord was exposed and irritated by a Faradic current.
 No contractions occurred in any of the muscles, except those to which the
 current was conducted, even when the strongest was employed.                  On
 exposing   the   sciatic  nerves   and   dividing  one  of them  and  applying a
 Faradic current, no effect could be perceived when the electrodes were
 applied to either the central or the distal end of the nerve.         The motor
 nerves were thus seen to be paralyzed.
    The heart continued to beat vigorously all the time.               On laying
 open the abdominal cavity, the intestines and peritoneum were found in
 a state of intense congestion.         Electrodes applied to the lumbar nerves
 caused no contraction anywhere.
    Thorax opened. The heart was beating vigorously.              The lungs were
 normal.    A Faradic current applied to the phrenic nerve caused no con
traction of the diaphragm ; but when applied to that muscle directly, it
caused vigorous contractions.
    The left vagus was divided and its peripheral end stimulated by a Faradic
current. The pulsations of the heart were at once arrested, but again com
menced; and no further irritation of the vagi had any effect on the heart.
    2.2 p.m. Stomach removed.           Its coats were intensely congested, as
though some irritant had been swallowed.             It contained much bile. The
blood   was  florid  and  formed   a firm   coagulum.
    This experiment clearly shows that cobra-poison produces paralysis of
the motor nerves in warm as well as in cold-blooded animals, the sciatica
being so completely paralyzed that they did not respond to the strongest
irritation, although respiration was efficiently kept up and the circula
tion continued unimpaired.          In almost all the other experiments, when
the   nerve  was   irritated   immediately after death, contractions were pro
duced ; but the same is the case when the animal is poisoned with curare,
and the contractions are due to the poison not having had sufficient time
to exert its full action.
   The complete cessation of vomiting after division of the vagi seems to
indicate that the poison produces emesis by acting on the peripheral
terminations of the vagi, and not on any nerve-centre.

                   Action  of Cobra-poison  on Secreting Nerves.
   A   notable symptom of cobra-poison in dogs is great salivation ; and
this might be supposed at first sight to indicate that the poison acted
as an irritant to the secreting nerves of the salivary gland.       Nausea and
vomiting being also present, however, it is by no means improbable that
the salivation is due to the poison stimulating the secreting nerves of the
salivary glands not directly, but by reflex action, through the gastric
branches of the vagus.       Unfortunately we are unable to say in which of
these ways salivation is induced, as we have not noted whether it
occurred after division of the vagus or not. So far as memory serves us,
we are inclined to think that it was much less in these cases ; but on this
point we cannot be at all positive.
   Whether cobra-poison has any stimulating action on secreting nerves
at first or not, it seems finally to paralyze them, or at least greatly to
diminish their power.
   This is evident from the following experiment.
                                Experiment   XLV.
   A   dog was etherized and the         chorda    tympani exposed after its
separation from the lingual nerve.        A   cannula was then placed in the
duct of the submaxillary gland.         On irritating the chorda by a weak
Faradic current, applied at intervals, saliva flowed freely.        Some dried
cobra-poison dissolved in water was then injected into a vein in the leg.
Shortly afterwards the saliva began to flow much less freely than before ;
and although the current was increased in strength, only a small quantity
could be obtained.
                            Action on Sensory Nerves.
   The sensory nerves seem to be little, if at all, affected by cobra-poison.
As appears from Experiment XXXVI. they retain their power after the
motor nerves are paralyzed; and Experiment XLVI. shows the compara
tive effect of the poison and of want of blood both on the sensory and
motor nerves. The former were so little affected by the poison, that they
caused a ready response when those which had been deprived of blood had
nearly ceased to act. The motor nerves of the poisoned limb, on the con
trary, were quickly paralyzed, while those of the ligatured one, although
doubtless weakened by the loss of their vascular supply, long retained
their irritability.    In Experiment LX. the optic nerve and the aural and
buccal branches of the fifth nerve retained their irritability after the
cord had become nearly paralyzed ; and, in several experiments, reflex
actions could be induced by irritation of the cornea after voluntary motion
and respiration had ceased.

   When acetic acid is applied to the hand, he straightens both the arms
and contracts the right, but not the left leg.
  Acetic acid applied to left hind leg causes him to straighten both arms
and draw up the right leg ; but there is only feeble movement in the
left leg.
   When acetic acid is applied to the right foot, the foot itself is drawn
up ; but there are no movements of any other part of the body.
   When acetic acid is applied to left hand, the left arm is powerfully
straightened, and there are strong contractions of right hind leg, but
none in the left, and little movement in any other part of the body.
   Acetic acid applied to left foot causes powerful extension of both legs.
   Acetic acid applied to the right foot has no effect. Electrodes were
inserted in the spine and the cord irritated by a Faradic current.
Distance of the secondary from the primary coil 18 centims.      There was
movement of left hand.
   At 16 centims, movement of left hand and right leg.
   At 12 centime, also faint movement of left leg.
   At 15 centims, the interrupted current was kept up for some time, and
the muscular twitchings were more powerful in the left gastrocnemius
than in tile right one.

right leg contracts.
   Coil at 42 centhns. the left leg only twitches.
                        Action on   the   Spinal Cord.
  The spinal cord   has the threefold     function of          of sensory
                                                         a conductor
impressions, a conductor of motor impressions, and a reflex centre ; and
in examining into the nature of the action of cobra poison upon         we       it,
must consider the manner in which each of these functions     affected. is
   Cobra-poison, as has already been intimated, has a powerful paralyzing
action upon the reflex function of the cord        ;   and this   is   exemplified     in
Experiment XL VII., &c.
   As conductor of sensory impressions, the cord
      a                                                 able to transmit two

kinds, viz. tactile and painful, and these have been stated to pass through
different parts of the cord, the former being conveyed by the posterior
and lateral white columns, and the latter by the grey matter.
   From Experiments XXXVI. and LX.             would appear that the power
                                              it
to convey  tactile  impressionsis  retained, both   in warm-blooded animals
and frogs, after the transmission of painful impressions has almost, or
entirely, ceased.    Thus, in Experiment XXXVI. the frog's leg moved
when the animal was laid upon its back, although an extremely painful
stimulus, the application of sparks from       acoil to the eye, had caused

  1874.J               Poison of Indian Venomous Snakes.                    105
 in it only the feeblest movement.          In Experiment LX. no response
 was elicited by striking, pinching, or pricking the paws of the animal
 but when the ear was tickled the cat shook its head, or moved its paw
 to ward off the irritant.
     From these     cases we think we are justified in concluding that the grey
 matter of the spinal cord, through which painful impressions are trans
 mitted, is paralyzed by cobra-poison ; but the white sensory columns are
 little, if at all, affected. The power of the cord to conduct motor impres
 sions from the encephalic ganglia appears to be little, if at all affected,
 until the apparent death of the animal ; for in Experiment LX. we find
 that, very shortly before respiration ceased, and when ordinary reflex
 action from the cord was nearly gone, purposive or voluntary movements
 were still made. The absence of movements in Experiment L., when the
 cord was irritated by a needle, as well as the rapid loss of its power to
 produce movement in the limbs when irritated by a Faradic current, is,
 we think, to be attributed to paralysis of its function as an originator,
 and not as a conductor, of motor impressions.
                                 Experiment XLVII.
     May   19th. — The    lumbar  nerves of a frog were exposed and a ligature
 tied round the body, excluding these nerves.

 into the dorsal lymph-sac.

 still marked in all the limbs, but more in the legs than in the arms.

but feebly and slowly.
     1.50. Acetic acid causes reflex movements when applied to either the
hind or fore feet.
     1.54. Applied to the nose, acetic acid causes movements in all the
extremities, and especially in the arms.
     1.56. Applied to the right hind foot it causes movements of the arms
and of the jaw, which otherwise gapes.
    2.2. Applied to the left hind foot it causes no reflex action.

auricles.
   Muscles of arms and legs exposed and irritated by single induced shocks.
6-5 centims., muscles of both arms contract ; muscles of both legs con
tract, but somewhat more strongly.
   In this experiment there is no evidence of paralysis either of the nerves
or muscles ; death appears due to paralysis of the spinal cord. This is
caused by the action of the poison ; for the circulation       still continued,
though feebly, after all reflex action had ceased.
                             Experiment  XL VIII.
   A  ligature was passed under the right sciatic nerve of a frog and tightly
tied round the limb, so as to constrict the whole of the thigh, with the
exception of the nerve, and completely arrest the circulation.
   At 1.8 half a drop, of cobra-poison (1st supply), diluted with        |  cub.
centim. of water, was injected into the dorsal lymph-sac.
   1.12. The animal is sluggish.

much less than before.
   1.30. Frog almost motionless.       Contractions of the fore llimbs      still
occur   ; but they no longer respond when pinched.
   1.57. There is a faint motion in the limbs.
   2.18. Frog is dead.    Much ecchymosed.
   On irritating the lumbar nerves in the abdominal cavity by an induced
current, the poisoned leg contracted rather more than the non-poisoned leg.
   On irritating the sciatic nerves in the thigh, below the level of the liga
ture, the contractions of the poisoned leg were much less vigorous than
those of the non-poisoned leg.
   Electrodes were then placed in the spinal cord, and the cord irritated
by an induced current.
   2.34. When irritation is applied in this way the fore limbs contract, but
not the hind limbs.
   When the cord is irritated lower down, the non-poisoned leg responds
to the irritation, but the poisoned leg does not.
   The muscles of the ligatured leg respond to the direct application of
electricity more freely than the other muscles.
   In this experiment the poison employed had not been coagulated or
dried, and the dose was somewhat small.          The failure of reflex action
while voluntary motions still continued in the nerves, shows that the cord

in this instance became paralyzed before the motor nerves.          It is indeed
difficult to say whether the motor nerves were paralyzed in this case or
not, as the muscles themselves were distinctly weakened.

    The poisoned leg seems to be losing its irritability more quickly than
the other.      Irritability of spinal cord gone.
   3.35.   The    left still contracts, with the coil at 35. The other, when
irritated by a current of the same strength, contracts more strongly.
    The loss of power occasioned by the cessation of the circulation in the
ligatured limb (which is used as a standard with which to compare the
other) was diminished in this experiment, by injecting the poison directly
into the circulation, so as to enable it to reach the motor nerve-ends at
once. As soon as it had taken effect, the poisoned leg was likewise
 deprived of its circulation, so as to bring the two limbs as nearly as
possible into the same conditions.          The cause of death, in this experi
 ment, was paralysis of the cord, all reflex action having been almost
immediately abolished by the large dose of the poison injected into
the circulation, though the heart continued to beat. The motor nerves
were not at first affected ; but after a little while paralysis appeared in
the poisoned limb.        This experiment is especially interesting in reference

 108            Messrs. T.  L. Brunton    and  J. Fayrer on the     [Jan. 22,
 to the cause of death when a considerable quantity of poison enters the
 arterial system at once. In warm-blooded animals, as is shown by Ex
 periment LXVTIL, the heart is arrested, in many instances, and death thus
 occasioned; but when this is not the case, the appearance of paralysis is
 probably due to affection of the nerve-centres.
                                Experiment   L.
    Sept. VSih. —A ligature was placed round the middle of a frog, excludmg
 the lumbar nerves.
    3 p.m. Some dried cobra-poison dissolved in water was injected into the
 dorsal lymph-sac.     Immediately after the injection the animal could move
 all its limbs quite well.
    3.3. Restless ; moves all its limbs.
    3.17. Can still move vigorously.
    3.21. Can kick vigorously with its legs, especially the right. When
it moves it seems to overreach itself and turns over, apparently from
the hind limbs remaining unaffected and the arms becoming partially
paralyzed.
    3.40. Still moves voluntarily.
    3.52. No reflex motion can be produced by touching        any of the ex
tremities with acetic acid.
    A  minute or two afterwards   & slight twitch was noticed in one arm, to
which acetic acid had been applied ; but whether this was greatly delayed
reflex action caused by the acid, or whether it was due to something else,
is uncertain.    A  needle was now run down the spinal cord.     It produced
no effect.
    The legs contracted readily when the lumbar nerves were irritated.
    The absence of motion in the legs when the cord was irritated by a
needle run down the spinal canal, shows that the power of the cord to
originate motor impulses had been destroyed, as it would usually have
caused violent contractions in the extremities.     These having been pro
tected from the action of the poison either on muscle or nerve, would
respond readily, as indeed they did, to voluntary motor impulses shortly
before the death of the animal.

   In  this experiment the loss of reflex motion was gradual.            It is shown
to be due to paralysis of the cord, and not to excitation of Setschenow's

  110             Messrs. T. L. Brunton and       J. Fayrer   on the    [Jan. 22,
 inhibitory centres, by the division of the medulla having no power to in
 crease the reflex action.
    The fact that irritation of the lumbar nerves hardly caused any contrac
 tion tn the legs, while irritation of the sciatics below the ligature caused
 them to contract readily, indicates either that the nerves had been injured
 by the ligature, or that the part of them lying between the spine and the
 ligature had been paralyzed by the poison. The latter is possible ; but as
 the frog moved its arms and not its legs before death, the former is more
 probable.
    Several years ago Setschenow showed that the optic lobes in the frog
 possess an inhibitory power over the reflex acts originating in the spinal
 cord.   Irritation of the optic lobes greatly lengthens the time required for
 the performance of any reflex act, and thus produces an effect apparently
 similar to that of diminished excitability, or paralysis, of the spinal cord.
 A diminution in reflex action may therefore be due to two very different
 causes : — (1) Lessened excitability of the cord, and (2) excitement           of
 SetschenoVs      inhibitory centres. These can, however, be readily dis
 tinguished from one another by dividing the cord just below the medulla.
 It is thus separated from the inhibitory centres ; and if the diminution in
 reflex action is due to excitement in them it will disappear, but will be
 permanent if it is caused by paralysis of the cord.           The following ex
 periment, performed by Tiirck's method, shows that in cobra-poisoning
 the diminution of reflex action is due to the latter of these causes.
                                 Experiment   LIU.
    May    19th, 1873. — The  right leg of a frog ligatured, excluding the sciatic
 nerve.
    3.5. A full dose of dried cobra-poison dissolved in water injected into
 the dorsal lymph-sac.

 acetic acid. Bight arm twitched.
    3.57. Beflex action in both arms.      None in the legs when the left leg   is
 dipped in the acid.

    The medulla was now divided in order to separate the cord from
Setchenow's inhibitory centres.
    4.35. No reflex action can be observed.
    As the operation of dividing the cord somewhat lessens the excitability,
in the following experiment the division was performed on the previous
day, so that its effects should have passed off before the poison was injected.

seventh and twelfth dorsal vertebra.      A Faradic current passed through
them caused contractions in the adjoining muscles of the back, but none
elsewhere.   The left sciatic was exposed and irritated. The limb con
tracted.   About an hour afterwards curious and somewhat rhythmical
movements took place in the right foot.                        The sciatic had not         been ex
posed in the right leg.

   In this experiment the paralysis began in the fore legs. There was di
stinct loss of coordination ; but the animal could run up to the last,
although it could not walk. This indicates that the higher coordinating
centre (probably the cerebellum) was paralyzed before the lower ones, just
as in the case of a man who is drunk.
                                      Experiment   LX.
   August 29th, 1873. — A cannula was placed             in the trachea of   a cat about
5.30 p.m.
  5.35. One decigram of dried cobra-poison, dissolved in two cubic centi
metres of water, was injected into the peritoneal cavity.
     5.39. The animal      lies on its side breathing very rapidly and wagging
its tail.     Rises, sits with head erect and mouth widely open.
  5.45. The respiratory movements are very rapid and shallow, with
occasional deep ones. The animal sits up. "Respirations 240 per minute.
Pulse 148 per minute.
  6.3. The animal was lying down and occasionally rising. Is now lying
down. The respiratory movements have an extraordinary vermicular
character.      Dr. Sanderson ascertained by palpation that this is due to
the diaphragm contracting before the thoracic walls expand.
   0.7. The respirations are feeble, with occasional deep ones.                 The cat
walks quite well. The bowels act.
   6.20. Bowels act again.  Tries to vomit several times.
  6.37. The cat lay on its side, and stretched itself once or twice in a

  6.41. Lies quietly.  When the cornea is touched or                      poked with a
pointed instrument, or when the finger is rubbed over                 it, the eyelids do
not close, nor                 give any sign of feeling.

    6.52. Animal lying on its side. When a bright light is brought before
its eyes it draws back its head. The cornea is quite insensible.            When
the paws are irritated by striking, pinching, or pricking there is no re
 sponse. When the inside of the ear, nose, or mouth is tickled, the cat
 shakes its head, and sometimes moves its paw to put the irritant away.
    7.5. On touching the eyes it sometimes draws back its head, but there
 is not the slightest motion of the eyelids.       It voluntarily moved its paws
 and head as if to rise, and then sank back as if asleep, and lay still on its
 side.
     7.6. Laid it on its belly.    It rose and walked a step or two towards a
 dark corner and then fell.       Immediately afterwards the muscles of the
 neck gave a sort of shudder.         After movement the respiration becomes
 much quicker, and then rapidly becomes         slow.   After lying a minute or
 so its respirations are 27 per minute.
     7.25. Moves its paws and tries to get up voluntarily, but cannot do so.
 Irritated paws and ear by sparks from a Du-Bois coil. No reaction.             On
irritating the   inside of the  thigh  in a similar  manner,   it stretched out  its
 fore legs, protruded its claws, and seemed to be trying to grasp me.
     7.33. The respiration ceased without convulsions.         The cannula in the
trachea was immediately connected with an apparatus for artificial respi
 ration, and this was kept up. While some adjustment was being made
 on the apparatus the animal was observed, and its heart was found to have
 ceased to pulsate about five or ten minutes after artificial respiration had
 been begun.
    On opening the thorax the lungs were found somewhat congested.
 The right side of the heart was moderately filled. The left ventricle was
 quite empty and firmly contracted.         The surface of the stomach and in
testines was much congested.          The interior of the stomach was not con
 gested.
    In this experiment, respiration continued for two hours after the in
jection of the poison.     The most remarkable points as regards respiration
are its great acceleration, with occasional deep breaths at first, its vermicular
character about the middle of the experiment, and its regularity towards
the end. Reflex action seemed entirely abolished, and sensation very
much impaired ; the mental faculties seemed sluggish ; but voluntary power
was retained, and the movements of the animal were not indefinite but
distinctly purposive.
    The motor nerves and muscles were evidently not paralyzed ; but the
grey matter of the cord seemed to have lost its power of inducing reflex
actions or of conveying painful impressions.         Tactile impressions, such as
laying the animal on its belly, still caused reaction.            The movements
thus induced, as well as those caused by irritating the ears, &c., may all
be reasonably ascribed to the action of the brain.
    Closure of the eyelids would seem to be a purely reflex act, in which
the brain is altogether unconcerned.

  October 29th, 1872. —To ascertain        if   a mixture   of strychnia and woorara
produced the same effect as cobra-poison, a guineapig weighing 1 lb. was
experimented upon.
   2.36.30. One cubic centimetre of a solution of woorara (1 in 1000)
was injected under the skin of the side.
  2.54. As the first dose seemed       to produce little effect, another cubic
centimetre     was injected in the same way as before.
   2.56.   A   drop or two of Liquor Strychnia (4 grs. to 1 fl. oz.) was in
jected into the side.
   2.57. Twitching motions of the body begin.       (They were not exactly
like those produced by cobra-poison.)
   2.58. The animal has fallen over on its side and is paralyzed, but the
twitching continues.
   3.2. The animal is dead.     No convulsions.    On opening the animal
the heart was found contracting vigorously.
   Electrodes were inserted in the spinal column and the cord irritated by
an induced current.    The limbs contracted when irritation was applied to
the cord.   The sciatic nerve was exposed and irritated by an induced cur
rent. The muscles of the limb contracted.
   3.9. Heart still contracts feebly. The lungs are congested.
               Action of Cobra-poison on   the Stomach      awl Intestines.
   One of the most noticeable symptoms of cobra-poisoning in dogs is
vomiting of a violent, repeated, and most distressing kind ; and it is also
present in cats and guineapigs, though to a less degree. Its occurrence
in guineapigs is somewhat extraordinary, as these animals very rarely
vomit, and, according to Schiff, only do so after their vagi have been di
vided ; whereas other animals which vomit under ordinary circumstances
are then unable to vomit at all. The nervous centre by which the move
ments of vomiting are originated is closely connected with the respiratory
centre, and it may be set in action by stimuli conveyed to it by the
branches of the vagus distributed to the stomach and other intestinal
organs, and also through the pharyngeal branches, either of the vagus or,
possibly, of the glosso-pharyngeal nerve. The brain can also excite it ; but
the vomiting it produces is not usually prolonged.        The vomiting which
occurs in cobra-poisoning      in all probability, due, in part, to irritation of
                              is,
the gastric or abdominal branches of the vagus — but not altogether for         ;
the attempts to vomit continued in Experiment LXIV. after that nerve
had been divided in the neck and the failure to bring any thing up
                                    ;                                               is
to be attributed to the cardiac aperture of the stomach failing to dilate
at the proper time — result which usually occurs after section of the
                         a

hardly be due to the division of the vagi in this instance, as that operation
is usually followed by' paleness of the membrane.      The intestinal move
ments are quickened by the poison, since there is purging, which can
not be due to increased intestinal secretion, as the stools consist
chiefly of mucus.         The movements            continue        for   a   considerable       time
after death.
                       Effect   of Cobra-poison upon Respiration.
    The action of cobra-poison upon respiration is perhaps the most im
portant of those which it exerts upon the organism ; for it is through this
action that death is generally caused. The respiratory movements, besides
being frequently altered in form, are generally quickened after the intro
duction of the poison ; then the number sinks to the normal or even below
it ; they become weaker and, finally, cease altogether.  The blood being
no longer aerated, becomes more and more venous, and, by irritating either
the respiratory centre itself or some nervous centre closely associated
with    it,
         occasions general convulsions. These disappear whenever arti
ficial respiration   begun and the blood again aerated
                         is                                   while they          ;
reappear when the respiration     discontinued and the blood regains its
                                         is
venous character.  This condition    to be observed in Experiment LXLL

The dependence of the convulsions on the venosity of the blood      well                   is
shown      Experiment YLU. of our former communication, where the con
          by
dition of the blood was indicated by the colour of the fowl's comb, and as
this became florid, or livid, the convulsions disappeared or returned. After
they have continued a short while the convulsions cease        for the venous ;
blood does not maintain the vitality of the nervous centres sufficiently to
keep them in action but   ;    artificial respiration be recommenced, the first

effect of aerating the blood    to renew the convulsions, by increasing the
                                    is
vitality of the  nervous centres, and rendering them again susceptible to
the action of a stimulus, though the convulsions disappear as soon as the
arterialization                          far.
                     has proceeded sufficiently
  Increased  rapidity of the respiratory movements may depend either
upon greater excitability of the respiratory centre in the medulla, or
upon stimulation of some of the afferent nerves which have the power to
accelerate . The chief of these are the pulmonary branches of the vagus,
               it
though there are probably others proceeding from the cerebrum, through
which the emotions influence the breathing, and others from the general
surface of the body.
   In order to ascertain the cause of the acceleration of respiration several
experiments were made. Experiment LX                   III.
                                               shows that      not due to theitis
action of the poison on the cerebrum       for    occurs after the cerebral

lobes have been removed.     The ultimate arrest of respiration     probably          is
due, in part, to paralysis of the medulla, and, in part, to paralysis of the
motor nerves distributed to the respiratory muscles. The complete insen
sibility of the phrenic nerve to the strongest                 stimuli, while the sciatics

and vagus still retained a considerable amount of irritability, in Experi
ments XL1V. & LXVI., is very remarkable.            The want of coordination
between the diaphragm and the thoracic muscles in Experiment LX. is
not improbably due to paralysis of the phrenic nerve, though it may be
attributed to some alteration in the respiratory centre. Brown-Sequard
states that the diaphragm contains ganglia which will keep up rhythmical
movements in it after the central nervous system has been destroyed ; and
if this statement is correct, it seems probable that paralysis of the phrenic,
by interrupting the connexion between the respiratory centres in the
medulla and those in the diaphragm, may allow the movements of the
thoracic respiratory muscles and of the diaphragm to occur one after the
other instead of simultaneously.
   It is difficult to say to what extent the stoppage of respiration depends
on paralysis of the medulla, or of the motor nerves, in each case. Pro
bably the effect of the one preponderates in some cases, and that of the
other in others.
                               Experiment   LXII.
   ATov.  29, 1872. — The vagi of a cat were exposed and some dilute cobra-
poison    injected subcutaneously.     Little effect being produced, the dose
was repeated, and then a solution      of alcoholic extract of the poison in
jected subcutaneously and into the peritoneum.          After the last injection
the animal became feebler.        No vomiting.     Before death slight convul
sions occurred.      After they ceased, a cannula was put in the trachea and
artificial respiration begun. Slight convulsions again appeared, but ceased
as respiration was continued.       They recommenced when the respiration
 was stopped, and disappeared when it was again begun.                 On once
more stopping respiration and allowing the convulsions to cease spon
taneously,     recommencement     of the respiration   caused   them   again to
appear.

ficial respiration commenced.
    3.40. Sciatic nerve exposed and irritated by a strong current, induced
twitchings in the limbs, but occasioned no reflex movement in any other
part of the body.
    3.45. The animal seems perfectly dead. The strongest current pro
duces no effect either when applied to the cord or to the sciatics.
    The colour of the muscles seems changed when compared with those of
the other rabbit (Experiment LXIV.) which had no poison.                  They are
of a less vivid colour, and altogether have an altered appearance.
    In this experiment the respirations became quickened from 37 to 96
 per minute after the injection of the poison, although the cerebral lobes
 had been previously removed.           The acceleration, therefore, could not be
 due to emotion,    or  to the  action  of the poison on the cerebrum. A com
 parison with Experiment LXIV., in which the cerebral lobes were removed
 without injecting any poison, shows that in the latter no acceleration
 whatever occurred, and the respirations became gradually slower till they
 ceased.
                                   Experiment LXIV.
     July  21, 1873. — A   rabbit was etherized, the calvaria removed, and the

 pinching feet or tail.

     From these experiments it was evident that the accelerated respiration
 was not of cerebral origin; and it was therefore probably due to sti
 mulation of the pulmonary branches of the pneumogastric by the poison.
  If this were so, the acceleration would not appear if the vagi were
  divided previously to the injection of the poison, as the stimulation of the

terminal branches of the nerves in the lungs would no longer be con
ducted to the medulla.         The following experiment shows that our hypo
thesis is correct, the injection of the poison rendering the respirations,
which had already been greatly diminished in rapidity by division of the
vagi, still slower.

    Sept. 15th.  —A   dog was chloroformed ; both vagi were divided, and a can
nula placed in the trachea. On recovering from the chloroform, the
animal became very restless and retched constantly, but was unable to
vomit.      A little while  afterwards   he became    more quiet, and his respira
tions were counted.

vomit. Respirations 7 per minute.

 injected into the flank of a white cat.

  tated by induced current.         Foot twitched when secondary        coil was at 57
  centimetres.
      About 6.30. Electrodes       screwed into cord about 2nd and 5th           dorsal
  vertebrae.
     The strongest current of the coil produced contraction of the muscles
  of the back, but no contraction of the limbs.           The sciatic nerve, when
  irritated directly, caused contraction of foot with the coil at 23.
     6.50. The phrenic nerve irritated ; no contraction of diaphragm ; vagus
  irritated ; heart stopped.
     In this experiment the continuance of reflex action on irritation of the
  ear, and of voluntary movements, after reflex action on irritation of the
  eye had disappeared, and almost up to the time of death, are remarkable ;
  as is also the paralysis of the phrenic before the sciatic and vagus nerves.
                       Action of Cobra-poison  on the Circulation.
     In   most cases of death from cobra-poison, the fatal issue is not to be
  attributed to any failure of the circulatory apparatus ; for the heart
  continues to pulsate vigorously, long after all motions have ceased in the
  voluntary muscles and the strongest irritation applied to the spinal cord
  and motor nerves fails to produce the slightest effect.             But this only
  occurs when the dose of poison is not excessive ; and when a large quantity
  of it is introduced, at once, into the circulation, the heart is not exempted
  from its action, but is, on the contrary, most seriously affected. This is seen
 in Experiments LXVIII. and XXVIII., where the poison having been
 either injected into the circulation, or absorbed with extreme rapidity, the
 action of the heart was at once arrested. But it is to be noted that it is
 not paralysis, but tetanic contraction of the heart which is produced,
 the poison, in fact, seeming to act as an excessive stimulus ; and this being
 the case, we feel less surprise on finding that, in ordinary cases of poison
 ing, the cardiac action may be maintained by the use of artificial respira
 tion for more than thirty hours, as Mr. Bichards has succeeded in doing
 in India.       The cardiac movements cease much sooner in frogs poisoned
 by   cobra-venom      than in those paralyzed by curare — the pulsations in the
latter often continuing for very many hours, or even for one or two days.
They are also arrested by the direct application of the poison to the heart,
as in Experiment LXXII.             Its action seems to be somewhat different in
degree,     if  not in  kind, when applied to the outside of the heart, as in
Experiment        LXX.,    and to the inside, as in Experiment     LXXII. ;      for in
the former case the pulsations continued for a considerable time, while in
the latter they were instantly arrested, the heart stopping in partial systole
and moderately contracted.
    The action of cobra-poison being exerted on the heart of the frog after
its excision, shows that it acts on the heart itself ; and its effect being
very much the same without the body as within it renders it probable

1874.]                 Poison       of Indian        Venomous   Snakes.                  •        123
that the central nervous system is little concerned in the arrest of circu
lation by the poison, at least in the frog.
   The stoppage of the excised heart may be due (1) to irritation of the
inhibitory centres contained within                  it,
                                            or (2) to paralysis of its motor
ganglia,  or  (3) to  excessive  stimulation  of them producing tetanus, or
(4) to the action of the poison on the muscular fibre of the organ. It not                   is
due to the first of these causes for atropia, which paralyzes the inhibitory
                                              ;
ganglia, does not restore the movements.        The second                  is
                                                               improbable, as
the heart  does  not stop in  diastole but in  systole, and resists distention
by fluid within it. The third seems the most probable cause, as one does
not see why the poison should arrest the cardiac pulsations at once when
applied to the interior of the organ, and not do so when placed on the
outside,   if
            it   acted on the muscular fibre, whereas            it    may readily be sup
posed that the poison may reach the ganglia more readily from the inner
side of the heart — though we do not venture to assert that this  the true         is
explanation  of the facts we have observed.
   The inhibitory branches of the vagus are not always paralyzed (Expe
riment LXVI. but sometimes the cobra-poison appears to affect them as
                  ;
well as the motor nerves and in this;     resembles curare, which in small

doses does not impair the inhibitory    action of the vagus, but in large
doses completely destroys it. In Experiment LVI. irritation of the vagus
quickened, instead of retarding, the cardiac pulsations — circumstance       a
which indicates that the inhibitory fibres of the vagus were paralyzed by
the poison, but not the accelerating ones.
   The capillary circulation   not unaffected by the poison.
                                         is                       In Experi
ment IV. of our former paper, the rhythmical contractions and dilatations,
altogether independent of the cardiac pulsations, which Schiff first observed
in the rabbit's ear, and which were noticed by Ludwig and Brunton in
the vessels of many parts of the body, were greatly increased by the
injection of the poison.
   In Experiments LXXIV. and LXXV. the blood-pressure remained
high after the heart had ceased to beat. This shows that the arterioles,
or capillaries, must have been much contracted, thus opposing    barrier             a
to the exit of blood from the arteries into the veins.

dried cobra-poison in solution (in the proportion of about two grains
in three fluid drachms) was introduced into the apparatus the heart
stopped almost immediately.           As will be seen from the accompanying
tracing, it became partially contracted and gave one or two feeble beats,
but did not dilate, and then remained still, the contraction, however, very
s^wly and gradually increasing.
   These tracings were obtained from a frog's heart by means of a small mercurial ma

diastole.
   3. Tracing given by the heart after it had been supplied with serum containing a
small quantity of cobra poison in solution. The heart makes a few ineffectual attempts,
but can neither contract nor relax, and remains still, in a condition midway between
complete systole and complete diastole. The line A is the zero to which B would sink
if the heart relaxed completely during diastole.

the cardiac pulsations became much quicker, but they were also strong.
They next became very small and rapid.               Lastly, the right ventricle be
came    much distended, and the heart stopped.              The lungs became con
tracted   ; and when force was used to distend them they did not expand
equally, but became emphysematous in spots, so that the exterior of the
lung assumed a nodulated appearance. When the right ventricle was
punctured it contracted firmly.         No further contraction took place when
it was irritated by the direct application of a Faradic current. The blood
coagulated.

                                                contracted when irritated.
   The injection of cobra-poison here caused a diminution of the blood-
pressure at first ; but a further injection again raised it.           In the latter
part of the experiment there is not the slightest trace of failure of the
heart's action, but, on the contrary, every evidence of powerful action.
When the respirations failed, the heart became slow from irritation of the
roots of the vagus by venous blood ; and the pulsations were gradually
weakened by the same condition.           The fact that the blood-pressure sank
slowly and did not fall below 30, even after the heart had almost entirely
ceased, shows that the arterioles were much contracted.
                               Experiment    LXXV.
   A  cannula was placed in the carotid artery of a rabbit and connected
with a kymographion.
   The blood-pressure was 75 millims. of mercury.              One cub. centim. of
a 2-per-cent. solution of cobra-poison was injected into the jugular vein.
Almost immediately the animal began to struggle, and the pressure rose
to 95. It remained at this for a minute and then fell.             The float unfor
tunately   stuck, and the   curve it should   have   described  in falling was con
sequently lost. On again getting the instrument to work, the pressure was
found to be 25 ; and this continued, although the heart had ceased to beat
and the thorax was opened. On cutting across the aorta, the pressure fell
to zero, showing that it had not been due to any clot in the vessel.
   In  this experiment the poison seems to have caused tetanic contraction
of the heart, and also of the arterioles.      The permanence of the pressure
at 25, notwithstanding the stoppage of the heart's action, can only be
ascribed to contraction of the arterioles preventing the escape of blood
from the arterial into the venous system.
                           Excretion of Snake-poison.
   We have    made  only one or two experiment       s, ourselves, on the excretion
of cobra-venom    ; but, from the data afforded by the experiments and ob
servations of others, we consider that it is excreted by the kidneys and
mammary glands, and probably also by the salivary glands and mucous

membrane of the stomach.           A  case reported by    Mr. Shircore, of Calcutta,
in which an infant, suckled by its mother after she had been been bitten
by a snake (species unknown), died in two hours after it had partaken of
the milk, shows that the poison is excreted by the mammary glands, and
with considerable rapidity ; for the child took the breast before any marked
symptoms had occurred in the mother*.              Its excretion by the kidneys ap
pears from an experiment of Mr. Richards, of Balasore, who found that
some urine from a dog poisoned by the bite of a sea-snake (Enhydrina
bengalensis) killed a pigeon in 22 hours after being hypodermically in-
jectedt.     Some saliva, which we obtained from the submaxillary gland of
a dog poisoned by cobra-venom, had no effect when injected under the
Bkin of the thigh of a lark j but Mr. Richards found that one drachm of
the greenish liquid which flowed from the mouth of a dog poisoned by
cobra-venom killed a pigeon in two hours.                As this fluid flowed con
stantly from the mouth, and the animal was paralyzed and motionless, it
seems probable that, notwithstanding its colour, it was saliva and not bile.
    As the poison-glands of the snake are modified parotid glands, we
should naturally expect the poison to be excreted by the salivary glands ;
and we think it possible that the immunity which poisonous snakes eDjoy
from the effects of their own poison or that of another species (an im
munity which is not shared by innocuous serpents, nor even by small in
 dividuals of a venomous species poisoned by a large dose of venom) may
 be due, at least in some measure, to their power of excreting the inocu
 lated venom through their own poison-glands.                We have, however, had
 no opportunities of trying whether venomous serpents, after extirpation
 of their poison-gland, succumb to the bite of others in the same way as
 innocuous    ones.
     On the Means    of preventing Death from      the bites of Venomous    Snakes.
    In  the case of all poisons, snake-venom included, there is a dose which
 is insufficient to kill ; and animals may recover from it even after the
 characteristic  symptoms of the poison have been distinctly manifested.
    It has been clearly shown by Hermann that the real dose of any poison,
 or, in other words, the quantity which is actually circulating in the fluids
 and operating on the tissues of the body, depends on two factors, viz.
 the rapidity with which it is absorbed, and the rapidity with which it
 is excreted.     If   absorption goes on more rapidly than excretion, the
 poison   accumulates    in the blood and exercises its lethal action ; while the
 quantity in actual circulation may be reduced to an infinitesimal amount
and deprived of all power for evil, if the excretion can keep pace with, or
go on more rapidly than, the absorption.             Thus it is that curare kills an
animal when introduced         into a wound   ; for the poison is absorbed from the
 wound more rapidly than it can         be excreted by the kidneys.      If placed  in
the stomach, curare has usually          no apparent     action whatever   ; for it is
      * Thanatophidia,  p. 43.       t Indian  Medical Gazette, May 1, 1873, p. 19.

130            Messrs. T.     L. Brunton and     J. Fayrer   on the     [Jan. 22,
excreted in the urme as quickly as it is absorbed by the gastric walls.       But
if absorption be quickened by increasing the quantity administered            and
giving it on an empty stomach, curare will have the same effect as when
it is placed in a wound or injected into the circulation.        A like result is
obtained by arresting its excretion, either by ligaturing the renal vessels
or extirpating the kidneys. Snake-venom is also poisonous when absorbed
by the mucous membrane of the stomach.
    On the other hand, when we wish to prevent the accumulation of a
poison in the blood and thus to arrest its action,we must either lessen its
absorption, quicken irs excretion, or combine the two means.
    In the case of curare the former of these is sufficient ; and all the bad
effects of the introduction of this poison into a wound may be prevented by
applying a ligature between the wound and the heart, and only loosening
the bandage occasionally,       for an instant or two at a time. The same
obtains in snake-poisoning.         In this way only a little of the poison is
absorbed each time the ligature is slackened, and this is excreted by the
kidneys before another quantity is absorbed. If the poison can be removed
from the wound itself by other means, instead of making the whole of it
pass through the circulation,     the danger it causes will, of course, be sooner
over.     Our power   to  quicken excretion is, in most cases, much less than
that to retard absorption ; and it is therefore on the latter that we mainly
rely in cases of poisoning in general, as well as snake-bites in particular.
   The various methods of mechanically arresting the introduction of the
virus, by excision, cautery, and chemical agency, have been fully discussed
                                     '
in the ' Thanatophidia of India ; and we purpose now to consider its excre
tion or removal from the organism.
    Before doing so, however, we must inquire whether its removal is likely
to be of any service or not ; for, as we have already pointed out in our
previous communication, the action of the poison may be of two kinds.
1st.   It may resemble curare in destroying the power of the nervous
system so long as    it is present in the blood, but leaving it in a condition
to resume its functions as soon as the poison has been removed.              2nd.
Its action may be identical with, or similar to, that of a ferment, decom
posing or altering the nervous and muscular tissues in situ (in somewhat
the same way as the pancreatic or gastric ferments would decompose them
if they had been placed in the intestinal canal), and thus rendering them
utterly incapable of ever again performing their functions.
    If the action of the poison is of the latter kind, no treatment can be
expected to be of any avail if the dose has been large ; but if it is of the
former, we may still entertain a reasonable hope of averting a fatal result,
even when the dose of venom has been large.
    We have shown in our previous communication, that, by means of
artificial respiration, life may be prolonged for many hours, and time
thus afforded for the excretion of some of the poison ; but the means at
our disposal have not enabled us to maintain respiration sufficiently long

 1874.]               Poison of Indian Venomous Snakes.                       131
to show      us   whether    the nervous    and muscular   systems regain    their
function after      the excretion     of the poison has proceeded far enough.
The experiments of Mr. Vincent Richards, and of a committee appointed
by the Government of India in Calcutta, at our suggestion, to investigate
the use of artificial respiration in death by snake-bite, being performed
under more favourable auspices, have afforded us the data which we were
unable to obtain from our own.           In one instance, a dog was bitten by a
sea snake (Enhydrina bengalensis),          and, two hours afterwards, died in
convulsions.       Artificial respiration was commenced ; but, four hours after
wards, the application of a galvanic current caused no muscular contrac
tions ; the eyes were dry and glazed, and the body was cold. Next morn
ing, about sixteen hours after the apparent death of the animal, reaction
commenced      ; the application of a galvanic current again caused movements
of the body and expulsion of urine, and the bowels acted spontaneously.
In   five hours more reaction seemed established and went on increasing ;
the animal appeared as if it would recover : the eyes lost their glazed ap
pearance, tears were secreted, and a greenish-looking fluid flowed from
the mouth ; reflex action became reestablished, the eyelids closing when
the cornea was touched or when water was poured into the eye.                  At
tempts to swallow were made when water was poured into the mouth ;
and the application of a pan of hot charcoal to the chest caused convul
sive movements all over the body ; and these also occurred spontaneously.
The animal also became more or less sensible, and the eyelids twitched
when the finger was merely brought near the eye.
    These phenomena show that the muscles, the motor nerves, the secreting
nerves, the spinal cord, and the cerebrum had all recovered their functions
 to   a certain degree,    after it had been completely abolished for sixteen
 hours.     This we think would not have been the case had the poison
 acted by decomposing the tissues in the manner of a ferment ; and we
 are therefore inclined to hope that, like curare, it acts only while present
 in the system, and that its injurious effects may     be arrested by its removal.
    Notwithstanding the fair promise of recovery which the use of artificial
 respiration gave in this instance, the heart became weaker, and the animal
 died 24 hours and 35 minutes after its first apparent decease.            Nor has
 the Committee been more successful in its further experiments, although
 life has been prolonged for even 30 hours. This result shows that, al
 though artificial respiration may still prove useful in sustaining life and
 affording time for the use of other measures, it alone is not likely to be of
 much service in preventing death from snake-bite, except in those cases
 where the quantity of poison is just enough to kill and no more.
     It is evident from the length of time during which life may be main
 tained without the animal ultimately recovering, that the excretion of the
 poison is very slow ; but we at one time thought to quicken it by the em
 ployment of diuretics and sialogogues, and to prevent reabsorption by
 draining off the urine and saliva constantly.        We also proposed to wash

  out the stomach from time to time, iu order to remove any poison which
  might be excreted through the gastric walls, keeping it partially filled
  with milk or other nutrient fluid during the intervals, in order to sustain
  the strength of the animal.
     We are by no means certain that some of these methods              ma_v not prove
  useful adjuncts : but as our hope of stimulating excretion, by the salivary
  glands at least, has been much lessened by our discovery that the poison
  paralyzes the nerves of secretion, we are inclined to think that, perhaps,
  the readiest method of removing the poison from the body may be to
  allow it to flow out along with the blood in which it is circulating, and
  supply the place of the poisoned blood thus withdrawn by means of trans
  fusion.
     The greater part of the poison present in the system is probably con
  tained in the blood, and only a small proportion in the tissues ; for one of
  us (Dr. Fayrer) has found that a few drops of the blood of a dog killed
  by the bite of a cobra or Daboia caused death in seventy-five minutes,
  when injected into the thigh of a fowl (' Thanatophidia,'                pp. 80, 83,
  119, 120). By removing as much blood as could be taken without endan
 gering the life of the animal, a great part of the poison would be with
  drawn from the system ; and, probably, any harm from the copious bleeding
 would be prevented by transfusing fresh blood immediately afterwards.
     "We have tried one or two experiments with transfusion ; but they have
 hitherto   been unsuccessful.
     We are therefore by no means confident that death may be prevented
 by the combined use of artificial respiration and transfusion ; but we
 think that they present         some  chance of success, and that, at all events,
 the suggestion is justifiable on scientific and rational grounds.
     The treatment of animals poisoned by cobra-virus by the hypodermic
 injection of liquor ammonise has been frequently tried in India by one of
 us (Dr. Fayrer) (vide Thanat. pp. 89 et ssq.), and also by Mr. Richards,
 of Balasore, and by ourselves again in London, on several occasions.
     The alkali has been administered internally, injected into the areolar
 tissue, and also into the veins, over and over again ; but no benefit has
 resulted.     The objection has been made that experiments of this nature,
made on animals, are not conclusive in reference to the probable action
of the agent experimented with on human beings ; but this objection can
hardly    be considered valid      in a physiological point of view.
    At   any  rate  the  trials that have been made, of this mode of averting the
lethal effects of the poison, in India by Dr. Hilson, Civil Surgeon of
Moradabad, do not afford any indication that the intravenous injection of
liquor    ammonise      was followed by any diminution of the effect of the
poisons, the man       in  both cases having died* (vide ' Indian Med. Gazette,'
Oct. 1873).
    The same may be said of other reputed antidotes, such as :— Tanjore

pill and other preparations of arsenic          ; the hypodermic injection of liquor
potassoe ; quinine, ipecacuanha, Aristolochia indica, and a variety of other
drugs, generally of a vegetable nature, and enjoying a large amount of
popular confidence       : all, when brought to the test of carefully conducted
experiment,     failed, as might have been expected, to give any favourable
result.
    It  seems almost unnecessary to allude to the so called snake-stones       ; they
are powerless for good or evil. They have also enjoyed much confidence ;
but when submitted to the test of impartial experiment and observation,
their virtues prove as unreal as those of the antidotes above mentioned.
    With reference to the mechanical methods of preventing the entry of
the poison into the circulation after a bite, we think that the speedy
application of an elastic cord (such as is used in bloodless operations)
round the limb, combined with the application of cups attached to an
exhausting-syringe       or pump*, might be of advantage, and that it might
be made of general application in India.

    (6) The pleura pulmonum is a very thin connective-tissue membrane,
provided, like other serous membranes, with a rich network of elastic
 fibres.  In   the lungs of the rat, rabbit, cat, and dog the pleura pulmonum
 seems to consist,    for the most part, of elastic networks.      In the matrix,
there is generally one layer of flattened connective-tissue corpuscles to be
found.
    Beneath the proper pleural membrane, there exists, in the guineapig, a
membrane which consists of non-striated muscular fibres, arranged in
bundles which form a meshwork.            In the normal condition the bundles
are relatively    thin, and the meshwork    which they form has elongated large
meshes.     In   the distended lung the meshes are of amuch greater diameter
than in the collapsed lung ; in the latter they form a more continuous mem
brane.     The muscular bundles have, in general, a radiating direction from
the apex towards the basis of the lung ; and it is further to be noted that
they are most abundant on the external surface, viz. that directed towards
the anterior wall of the chest, and the internal surface, viz. that directed
towards the mediastinum ; whereas on the posterior surface the bundles
are scanty, and become more and more so the nearer the vertebral column
is approached.       This distribution of the muscular tissue is therefore in
perfect agreement with the proportion in which the different parts of the
lung participate in the respiratory movement, the fibres being most richly
distributed over those parts of the pulmonary surface which are subject to
the greatest extent of excursions, and vice versd.       In rats and rabbits, as
well as in cats and dogs, bundles of unstriped muscular fibres occur spa
ringly ; at any rate there are none on the posterior surface of the lung of
these animals.       As soon   as the superficial parts of the  lung  become  the
seat of a chronic     inflammatory process («. g. tuberculosis, chronic pneu
monia),   the   muscular   bundles increase in breadth and number to such
a degree, that they form a continuous membrane, chiefly in those parts of
the surface which correspond to the diseased portions of the lung.
    1. Subpleural lymphatics. — The meshes of the muscular membrane of
the lung of guineapigs are lined by a single layer of flattened endothelial
cells, constituting, in fact, a communicating system of lymphatic sinuses.

 ] 8~4.]             the Lymphatic    System  of the Lvngs.                 135
 I call  this system of lymphatics the intermuscular or pleural lymphatics.
 In the distended lung of the guineapig, these pleural lymphatic sinuses
are seen to be covered by hardly any thing but the endothelium of the
 pleural cavity, between which and the cavities of those sinuses a free
communication exists by means of true stomata; so that the endothelium
 lining the sinuses is here directly continuous with that of the pleural sur
 face.    In every case of chronic pleuritis induced by injecting irritating
 substances (such as products of acute and chronic pyajmic processes, pro
 ducts of indurated lymphatic glands), an active germination of the endothe
 lium around those stomata takes place. This germination extends not
 only to the endothelium of the neighbouring parts of the pleural surface,
 but also to the endothelium of the intermuscular lymphatic sinuses. The
 relation between the cells of the. membrana propria of the pleura pulmo-
 nurn and the endothelium of the surface is similar to that already described
 by me in other serous membranes, the cells of the propria throwing out
 processes, which project between the endothelial elements of the free sur
 face, thus forming pseudostomata.         The pleural lymphatics stand in
 communication      with lymphatic  tubes, which  lie in grooves, the arrange
  ment of which corresponds with that of the most superficial groups of
  alveoli of the lung. These may be called the subpleural lymphatics ; they are
  provided with valves, and form a network of anastomosing lymphatic ves
  sels.   The larger trunks run along the ligamenta pulmonum towards the
  root of the lung. This system of lymphatic vessels is best developed in
  the lung of the dog, in which it has been described by Wy wodzoff ; it is
  also well developed in the lungs of rabbits and cats. It receives lympha
  tic branches, which take their origin between the alveoli of the superficial
  portions of the lung. The mode of origin of these interalveolar lymphatics
  is that already described in my published work.           The septa of the
 alveoli contain branched connective-tissue corpuscles ; the spaces in which
 these cells he, forming the lymphcanalicular system, open into the cavities
 of the interalveolar lymphatics, with the endothelium of which the cells
 of the lymphcanalicular system are in direct continuity.
     2. Perivascular lymphatics. — Besides the system of subpleural lympha
 tics, the lung contains two other systems ; of which one takes its origin
 in the alveolar septa from branched cells exactly like those previously
 referred to. The lymphatic capillaries of this system lead into vessels
 that accompany the branches of the pulmonary artery and vein ; they run
either in the adventitia of these vessels in twos or threes, anastomosing
with each other, or the blood-vessel is entirely, or only half, invaginated in
a lymphatic vessel.      The branched cells of the alveolar septa, from which
the capillaries of this system of lymphatics (which we will call the
perivascular lymphatics) originate, have an important relation to the epithe
lium of the alveoli ; for they send a process, or a greater or less portion
of their body, between the epithelial cells into the cavities of the alveoli.
These represent pseudostomata, as described by myself for the serous

136                         Dr. £. Klein on the Anatomy of                   [Jan. 29,
membranes.         As these branched cells have a corresponding lymphcanali-
cular system,      it  is easy to understand why Sikorski, in his experiments,
found that carmine entered freely from the cavities of the alveoli into the
interalveolar lymphatics.           But there is no other communication between
the cavities of the alveoli and the lymphatics than by means of these
pseudostomata.           It can be easily understood that the pseudostomatous
canals (viz. the canal in which lies the process of a cell projecting freely
into the cavity of an alveolus, and the lympheanalicular system, in which
the interalveolar branched cells lie) may become occasionally distended, e. g.
in inflammation, by exudation, or by migratory cells. In fact, it must be
assumed that cells, such as are produced by catarrhal inflammation of
the air-passages, migrate from the cavities of the alveoli into the in
teralveolar     lympheanalicular system through those pseudostomata ; and
the same assumption must be made for the well-known large granular
mucous corpuscles, in many lungs, containing carbon particles, inasmuch
as similar cells are found in the interalveolar tissue.
    3. Peribronchial       lymphatics. — The third system of lymphatics is com
posed of lymphatic vessels which are chiefly distributed in the adventitia
of the bronchi.           I  shall therefore call it the system of peribronchial
lymphatics.       The vessels of this system are usually distributed around the
bronchi, anastomosing with each other, and especially with the perivascular
lymphatics.        The vessels of the peribronchial system take up capillaries,
which originate in the mucous membrane of the bronchi and penetrate
through the tunica muscularis of the bronchi.                 These capillary branches
originate    in  the   usual  way  ; t. e. their wall is continuous  with the branched
cells of the mucosa, which cells in turn penetrate, as a nucleated reticulum,
between the epithelial cells of the bronchus, and project on its free surface.
 From this it may          be understood how particles can penetrate from the
 cavity of a bronchus into the peribronchial lymphatics, as in the experi
ments of Sikorski. The lymphatics are always most numerous on that
 side of a bronchus which is directed towards a branch of the pulmonary
artery.     In the course of each bronchus, especially those that possess only
 a thin muscular tunic and no trace of cartilage, there are generally several
 vasculated lymph-follicles to be met with, which are placed in continuity
 with the endothelial wall of a lymphatic vessel, in such a manner that
 they are surrounded by that lymphatic vessel, in the same way as the
 lymph-follir-les of Peyer's patches are by their lymph-sinuses.                 These
 follicles, already seen by Dr. Burdon Sanderson, extend up to the tunica
 muscularis ; in some instances they are to be traced through this latter into
 the mucosa. They always lie in the wall of a lymphatic vessel, between the
 bronchus and the accompanying branch of the pulmonary artery.                    They
 are of different sizes, and are generally spherical or elliptical ; sometimes
 they represent merely a cord-like thickening of the wall of the lymphatic
 vessel.    In the lung of the guiueapig these perilymphangial follicles are
 very   numerous      ; they are not so numerous in rabbits.      It can be proved that

J 874.]                   the   Lymphatic System of the Lungs.                 137
a constant growth and reproduction of these follicles is going on. The
lymphatic vessels of the two last-mentioned systems anastomose with
each other in the ligaments of the lung, and finally enter the bronchial
lymphatic glands.
                                 B. Pathological conditions.
   I have already mentioned the germination of the endothelium of
the surface, and the hypertrophy of the muscles, in chronic diseases of
the lung.
   In   many chronic inflammatory processes of the lung (chronic pyaemia,
artificial tuberculosis, chronic pneumonia) the pleura pulmonum becomes
the seat of nodules of various sizes and shapes. Generally they are more
or less round, and correspond in position to those superficial portions of
the lung which have become the seat of an inflammatory process. These
nodules of the pleura are due to a very rapid proliferation of the branched
connective-tissue  corpuscles, simultaneously with an increase of fibrous
connective tissue, this latter fact being very obvious when the nodules
have reached a certain age. As long as they are small, they show merely
an abundance of cellular elements ; in their later stages they become
richly supplied with capillary blood-vessels.
   Lungs of guineapigs that are far advanced in the process of artificial
tuberculosis    e. where the bronchial
                 (i.                      glands have already become the
seat of cheesy deposits) show superficial nodules, which are in direct con
tinuity with the subpleural lymphatics.     In horizontal sections through
such portions of the lung, one finds these lymphatics filled with lymph-
corpuscles, while at   later period they are occupied
                            a                                   by
                                                         an adenoid reti
culum, the meshes of which contain lymph-corpuscles,    and which     in     is
direct continuity with the endothelium of the lymphatic tubes. The no
dules themselves represent      network of cords, which very much resembles
                                   a
adenoid tissue.     The meshes of this network of trabecular are the alveoli,
which, at an early period, contain       few lymphoid corpuscles, while the
                                            a
epithelium     is,

                                                                     a
the alveoli are filled with small lymphoid corpuscles, while the epithelium
of the alveoli   isno longer to be distinguished as such.     The blood-capil
laries belonging to these alveoli have undergone some remarkable changes,
of which  I   shall speak at length afterwards      at present
                                                         ;         will only

These interalveolar trabecular of adenoid tissue, forming the framework
of the superficial nodules, are developed from the branched connective-
tissue corpuscles of the alveolar septa. The same process extends to the
subpleural lymphatics, originating from these interalveolar connective-
tissue corpuscles, in such   way that these lymphatics become con
                                    a
verted into cords of adenoid tissue connected with their endothelium.
Consequently         these lymphatics     become   converted into endolymphangial
cords.

     If one examines the lungs of a guineapig which is so far advanced in
 the process of artificial tuberculosis that the bronchial glands contain
 cheesy deposits, one can distinguish with the naked eye two kinds of
  morbid structure on the surface of the lungs : —
     (a) Translucent structures of a circular or irregular shape, sometimes
 projecting slightly above the surface, generally isolated, but in some
 instances confluent, so as to form patches.            The smallest are of the size
 of the head of   a small   pin ; some  of them are three, four, or several times
 as large.    In  some   lungs only the large structures       are to be found   ; the
 larger kind have generally a yellowish centre.
    (6) Opaque patches of considerable diameter projecting above the sur
 face of the lung, some of them relatively very large (about ^ to -j^ of an
 inch), quite white, and very firm. On sections through the lung one findd
 that the first kind of structures correspond with cords provided with lateral
 nodular swellings, which accompany the branches of the pulmonary artery
 and vein.      The second kind of structures correspond with nodules and
 patches which are irregularly distributed in the tissue of the lung. On
microscopical examination it is seen that the first kind of structures are
 perivascular cords of adenoid tissue, representing the follicular tissue
 which is found in the walls of the peribronchial lymphatics in the
normal condition.          Many of these perivascular cords or nodules are
 supplied with a system of capillary blood-vessels.            The second kind of
 nodules, or patches, are seen to consist, on microscopical examination, of
a framework      of trabecule   which   corresponds to the interalveolar      tissue   ;
 they represent trabeculae     of adenoid tissue which are in continuity with
the perivascular cords first mentioned.            The meshes of this network are
more or less filled out by cells lying     in  the  spaces that were previously the
cavities of the alveoli.      The question arises, How do these two kinds of
morbid structures develop, and what is their ultimate fate ?
    If one studies sections of lungs that possess very few of the first
kind of cords and nodules, one comes across a number of the lymphatic
vessels    that   accompany the branches of the pulmonary artery, con
taining more or less numerous lymph- corpuscles.              In addition to those
just    mentioned,   one   is able  to find  lymphatic    vessels, the endothelium
of which is in continuity with a thin short cord of adenoid tissue that
stretches along the outer wall of the lymphatic, or (as may be seen in some
places) projects into its cavity, thus connecting the two endothelial            walls
of the lymphatic ; in other words, we have here a peri- as well                 as an
endolymphangial growth of adenoid tissue, connected with the                    endo
thelium of the lymphatic.         From what      I  have shown in the case     of the
serous membranes, there can be little doubt that the above-mentioned
tuberculous cords of adenoid tissue accompanying the blood-vessels are in
reality only peri- or endolymphangial           outgrowths of the endothelium of
the lymphatics.       It is important    to state that, at the same time, the fol
licles of the bronchial adventitia increase in size, and also that a perilym

  1874.]              the Lymphatic System of the Lungs.                     139
  phangial new growth takes place on the peribronchial lymphatics.         From
  the study of the normal lung, it can be ascertained that not all the large
  branches of blood-vessels are accompanied by lymphatics, and not even
  one and the same branch for its whole length, but that in some places
  they are only surrounded by branched connective-tissue corpuscles, which
  may be said to belong to their adventitia.      In a given case, one will not
 be able to determine whether a certain tubercular cord has developed by
 the increase of these adventitial cells, or whether it has developed from
  the endothelium of a lymphatic, either as a peri- or endolymphangial cord      ;
 for the fully developed cords      have quite the same relation to the blood
 vessels as   if they had developed in their adventitia.
     I  have already mentioned that the growth of adenoid tissue in the
 branches of the subpleural lymphatics extends to the connective-tissue
 corpuscles between the alveoli.       Exactly in the same way we see the pe
 rivascular adenoid cords spreading between the alveoli ; that is to say, the
 perilymphangial growth of tracts of adenoid tissue extends from the lym
 phatics to the interalveolar branched cells, with which the endothelium
 of the former is in direct continuity.
    The first points at which the tubercular perivascular cords of adenoid
 tissue make their appearance are the ultimate branches of the pulmonary
 artery and vein, whence they spread along the lymphatics towards the
 larger branches, as well as towards the interalveolar branched cells.        In
 general the growth in the first direction (that is, towards the larger
branches) goes on much more abundantly and rapidly than in the other
direction.
                                  I
    It is an important fact that have constantlymet with the following con
dition of the tuberculous lungs of guineapigs : — The ultimate branches of
the pulmonary artery show a germination of their endothelium, which is
already recognizable in the earlier stages of the disease, at a time when
perivascular cords are only rarely to be found. If the process advances, the
germination of that endothelium reaches such a degree that the cavities of
the blood-vessels     are almost filled with its products, only a very narrow
central canal being left free.       In later stages, the tunica media of the
smaller and middle-sized vessels, that are provided with perivascular cords,
becomes very much thickened, and splits into laminie, between which lie
accumulated       lymphoid cells, either free or contained in a reticulum.    In
many places it can be shown that the adenoid tissue of the perivascular cords
gradually grows towards the cavities of the vessels, and finally assumes the
whole portion of the vessel into its substance.       The chief fact of import
ance, however, is that the capillary blood-vessels of those interalveolar
trabeculae, into which the perivascular cords have penetrated, have become
converted into solid nucleated bands and threads, which are in continuity
with the surrounding reticulum.           These threads, although they appear
solid, must be taken as still permeable by fluid substances ; for in lungs
the pulmonary artery of which had been previously injected with a cold

110                     Dr. E. Klein on the Anatomy of                 [Jan. 29,
solution of Berlin blue, the cavity of many of the capillaries in the neigh
bourhood of those interalveolar trabeculae stops short, but the injecting
material can be traced into the nucleated filaments which enter those tra
beculae.   From the study of a great number of specimens, taken from
lungs in different stages of the process of artificial tuberculosis,       I have
reason to believe that the first parts which undergo inflammatory changes
are the ultimate branches of the pulmonary artery and the capillaries next
to them, and that the morbid process extends from them to the corre
sponding lymphatics.
    I  have already mentioned that, where the alveolar septa become
thickened, the epithelium of the alveoli becomes gradually changed, so as
completely to fill the cavities of the alveoli.         By this means nodular
or patch-like  structures    are formed, which  may be called secondary patches.
It   may be said, in general, that the epithelial cells proliferate   :  they en
large; their nuclei divide ; and then the cells themselves divide.       In many
alveoli there appear, besides isolated epithelial cells, with or without car
bon particles in their substance, numerous small lymphoid corpuscles.
In some of the alveoli the enlarged epithelial cells become fused together
to one large mass of granular protoplasm, which contains a number of
nuclei in its periphery ; this represents, in the true sense of the term, a
 " giant cell." We may therefore say that, at an early period, these patches
consist of trabecular, which represent the thickened interalveolar septa and
their meshes (the alveoli), and that the latter are filled either with small
cells or with giant cells, or rather with multinuclear protoplasmic cylin
drical masses.       These secondary patches gradually increase in size, by
the extension    of  the adenoid metamorphosis of the alveolar septa and the
changes of the capillary blood-vessels, indicated above.
    A perivascular cord may become furnished with a number              of lateral
nodules of adenoid tissue from the assumption, by adenoid interalveolar
cords, of the contents of alveolar cavities into their own tissue. Where,
however, the alveolar cavities contain giant cells, other remarkable changes
take place.    These are as follows : — The cylinders of multinuclear proto
plasm grow and divide into a number of giant cells, which gradually be
come converted      into a tissue to a certain extent resembling adenoid tissue,
but differing from it in many respects.         Thus the giant cells give origin
to a more or less regular network of nucleated cells, which, consisting at
first of granular substance, soon assume the appearance of a more or less
distinct fibrillar substance ; in their meshes lie only a limited number
of lymphoid cells. This tissue spreads very rapidly, and finally undergoes,
from the centre outwards, a fibrous degeneration, which becomes the seat
 of cheesy deposits.
    Different lungs are somewhat different in this latter respect. In some
cases the transformation        of the giant cells into a network of nucleated
cells goes on very rapi dly ; and then the cheesy metamorphosis is also soon
established.    In other cases the growth of the network of nucleated cells

has a very long duration, and consequently the growth of the secondary
patches remains active for a long time.      The network of nucleated
cells   is,
        at no period of its development, such   delicate reticulum as in
                                                                  a

as this latter.          Moreover the adenoid tissue of the perivascular                     cords
or    their lateral      nodules never            a fibrous or clieesy
                                                 becomes   the   seat     of
metamorphosis.    The more the lung has advanced in the process of
artificial tuberculosis, the more do we find the tissue of the lung,
in the neighbourhood of the primary and secondary nodules, undergoing
inflammatory changes — consisting in thickening of the alveolar septa,
and in   granular condition of the walls of their capillary blood-vessels,
          a
the nuclei of which are in active proliferation, their number being out
of proportion large.
  In the peripheral parts of the lung the most numerous secondary no
dules are to be met with and consequently the most numerous cheesy
                                    ;
deposits are here to be found.    have often seen

parts, as the terminal branches of       minute bronchus pass towards the

stem.
   The secondary process extends from the terminal branches (alveoli and
infundibula) to the large bronchi.   In these the process becomes very
marked, and consists of the following changes —                  :
   (a) The epithelium proliferates very abundantly, whereby the cavity
may finally become almost completely plugged up by the progeny of the
epithelium.
   (6) A more important change consists in the proliferation of the tissue
that we have designated above as pseudostomata, namely the branched cells
of the tunica mucosa that extend between the epithelial cells to the surface                    ;
this tissue grows so as to form a very rich adenoid tissue.    At the same
time  there goes on an active growth  of adenoid tissue in the walls of the
peribronchial lymphatics    that   to say, there
                                   ;         is                      is

son) of the preexisting follicles, as well as new formation.a

active transformation of the pseudostomatous tissue of the bronchi into

                    I
pyaemia   ;   it   has been already stated that the reticulum                   of branched cells
which  stretches between the epithelial cells of the surface        better              is
developed  in rabbits than in guineapigs, in the normal condition.]
   (c) In the large bronchi, which have become involved in the secondary
process, another noteworthy change takes place, viz. the fusion of groups
of the proliferating epithelial cells, not only those of the free surface,
but also those of the mucous glands, so as to form multinuclear proto
plasmic cylinders and lumps (giant cells).
   The secondary process, viz. that which affects the alveoli and bronchi,
and     which      may    be    justly called the catarrhal                   pneumonic process,
always accompanies             artificial    tuberculosis    when       it    has extended to the

interalveolar tissue ; in the early stages of artificial tuberculosis, only the
perivascular lymphangial cords are to be met with.
    If  the infection has been established from the pleural cavity, the ger
mination of the endothelium of the surface round the stomata, and the
transformation of the subpleural lymphatics into cords of adenoid tissue,
is the first symptom, and is followed by the appearance of perivascular
adenoid cords.        If, however, the lung becomes tuberculous by infection
from the blood-vessels, the peritoneal cavity or the subcutaneous tissue,
the perivascular adenoid cords are the first structures that make their ap
pearance.      In lungs which have become the seat of chronic pyaemia, the
first changes are to be found in the alveolar septa and alveoli, viz. the
formation of patches and nodules similar to those that          I have designated
before     as  secondary ;    and   if  the  process lasts long enough, those
changes take place that        I have designated   before as primary tuberculous
changes.
    The opinion has been expressed (by Sanderson and Wilson Fox) that
the process of artificial tuberculosis in the lungs of guineapigs resembles,
in its anatomical features, the tuberculous process in man.                 I will
therefore examine the process that is clinically and anatomically known
as miliary tuberculosis in man.           For this purpose   I shall describe the
changes that     I found in three series of cases of miliary tuberculosis in
children, representing, as we shall see, three different stages of develop
ment.      In the first series the lungs exhibited all the anatomical appear
ances of acute miliary tuberculosis.         On microscopical examination it was
found that the nodules were due to groups of alveoli (with the correspond
ing infundibula) being filled with and distended by a fibrinous material
that contained granules and a few small cells ; generally these latter oc
cupied the centre of the alveoli.         The walls of the alveoli were hardly
distinguishable     ;  and  the  capillary vessels were not permeable, as shown
by the fact that, in well-injected preparations, the injection did not pene
trate into the capillaries of the alveolar septa. The alveoli next to these
nodules contained the same fibrinous material ; but they were not filled up
by    it completely    ; and their epithelium     could be distinctly recognized,
 having    become     wholly  or  partially detached,  the individual cells being
 somewhat enlarged, and some of them containing two nuclei.              Here the
 injection material penetrated the capillary blood-vessels more or less
 perfectly : the alveoli of the neighbouring            parts contained either a
 small amount of fibrinous material, besides isolated young cells, or a ho
 mogeneous gelatinous substance that had become stained with hsematoxy-
 lin.    The epithelium was very distinct, its cells granular.        In some of
 the alveoli the epithelial membrane was more or less detached from the
 alveolar septa ; the capillary blood-vessels were perfectly permeable.
    In the second series of cases of miliary tuberculosis, in which the lungs
 did not differ in macroscopical appearance from those of the first series, but
 in which the process had lasted longer, the microscopical appearances were

somewhat different.         The nodules were seen to differ in their structure
from those     in the  former series in the following respects. In some of them
it was easy to recoguize that they represented a number of alveoli very much
distended by a fibrinous substance similar to that described above, which
included granular material and a number of small cellular elements ; the
trabecular of these nodules (that is, the interalveolar tissue) were slightly
 thickened and contained young cells, their capillary blood-vessels being not
 completely permeable and not easily distinguishable.              Besides these there
 were    nodules   of which  only  the central  alveoli were   in the  state just men
tioned    ; whereas in those situated more peripherally the fibrinous material
 was no longer to be discovered, but they were filled in one or other of the
 following ways :— first, by spherical nucleated elements, many of which
 could    be still recognized as epithelial cells, by their size, granulation, and
 nucleus,'and some of which contained two nuclei. In these places, the inter
 alveolar trabeculse were thickened in a very marked manner, exhibiting
 all the appearances of an infiltrated tissue — that is to say, a more or less
  distinct reticulum of nucleated fibres, in the meshes of which lay small
 lymphoid corpuscles very readily stained by logwood or carmine.                    Or,
  secondly, they were filled by one large multinucleated mass or giant cell.
 In the latter case the giant cell, or rather the multinuclear protoplasmic
  cylinder, contained the nuclei either regularly distributed in its periphery,
  or all crowded together in the central part of the mass. As regards the
  nuclei, it may be said that they stain readily ; they are relatively small,
  sharply outlined, and contain one or two nucleoli.           The protoplasm of the
  giant cell is tinted slightly yellowish,    does  not stain  in hematoxylin, and is
  very regularly filled with small granules of equal size. As regards the deve
  lopment of these giant cells and their nuclei,        I must first contradict those
  authors who say that they originate generally by a free-cell formation in
  the veins, as well as those who make them originate in lymphatic vessels ;
  for   I have   followed   their development from the epithelial          cells of the
  alveoli with all possible certainty.       I have  been able to make out that the
  whole epithelial lining of an alveolus becomes fused together into one pro
                                                              and the nuclei of which
  toplasmic lump which fills out the alveolar cavity,
  rapidly divide, remaining,     however,   in  their original  places, viz. peripheral.
   We have here a protoplasmic cylinder the transverse section of which
   shows a peripheral ring of nuclei.             But a single epithelial cell may
   also become transformed into a multinuclear giant cell : one or the
   other epithelial cell increases rapidly in size (probably at the expense of
   its fellows) ; its protoplasm becomes enlarged as well as its nucleus ; then
   this nucleus gives rise by cleavage, or by budding, to a number of small
   nuclei, so that it is transformed into a number of nuclei lying in the
   middle of the cell. [I have little doubt that Klebs would be much inclined
   to regard the very regular granulation of the giant cells previously men
    tioned, as being due to the presence of micrococci ; such an assumption,
    however, conld not easily be proved.         A substance filled very regularly

144                  On the Lymphatic            System   of the Lungs.   [Jan. 29,
with granules is said to         be filled       with micrococci.
                                                           Against that view,
however, it can be maintained, first, that there are a number of normal
tissues that appear after hardening to be just as regularly filled with
granules     g. the liver-cells of any liver hardened in spirit), and, secondly,
           (e.
that the resistance of these granules to acids and alkalies after hardening
does  not prove them to be micrococci.]
   Where the alveoli contain giant cells, the alveolar septa are very much
thickened, and are seen to consist of       tissue that contains branched
                                                     a
and spindle-shaped cells, the substance of which has more or less the
appearance of      fibrous tissue, their processes as well as their body
                     a
being slightly fibrillar.  Between these there are very few lymphoid
corpuscles to be found.
   In third series of lungs, which also in macroscopical aspect did not
       a
differ from the former ones,   seen that almost all the nodules contain
                                   it   is
giant cells, corresponding to the alveolar spaces.   These, however, have
undergone changes which are correctly described by Schiippel and others              ;
viz. the giant cells give origin to network of branched nucleated cells, as
                                          a
well as to few spherical nucleated elements that lie in its meshes. This
           a
network grows at the expense of the giant cell, which undergoes prolife
ration at the same time. We have here what     generally called reticular
                                                          is              a
tubercle.   From  one  giant cell  number   of
                                             a giant cells may take their
origin.
   The nearer to the centre of nodnle the giant cell lies, the more exten
                                    a
sively and quickly does     transformation of its substance take place. It
                             a
becomes converted into         very dense feltwork of fibrillar tissue, the
                               a
nuclei of which gradually disappear, while the tissue itself dies away,
becoming firm and hard, and finally resembling a granular substance, in
which fibrils can be made out very indistinctly. While the network of the
nucleated cells continues to grow at the expense of the giant cells, the
process of necrosis spreads gradually to the peripheral parts.        In this
stage  of the  process the   thickened interalveolar   trabecular become also
assumed into, and identified with, the tissue that originated from the giant
cells.  In the neighbourhood of the nodules there are very numerous
places where the interalveolar trabecular are thickened and contain nume
rous young cells, the epithelium of the corresponding alveoli being, at the
same time, in   state of proliferation.
                 a                       In general the tubercular nodules
of both these latter series have the common character that the peripheral
zone of the tubercular nodule       regular adenoid tissue, being composed
                                    is    a
ofa  delicate reticulum  which includes small lymphoid eorpuscules     this   ;
adenoid    tissue    is   in continuity with the tissue of the interalveolar
trabecular above mentioned.          Inthese stages of the tuberculous process,
we find numerous branches           of large blood-vessels, in the immediate
neighbourhood     of the      nodules, provided with the same perivascular
cords of adenoid tissue as have been described in the tuberculous                 lung
of the guineapig.

     Finally, it may      be mentioned    that these nodules also grow in circum
ference, by the alveolar septa of the neighbouring                 alveoli gradually be
coming thickened, while, at the same time, the epithelium of the corre
sponding alveoli undergoes the changes before
                                                            described.     The capillary
vessels of these parts show the same changes as were mentioned in the case
 of the guineapig's lung — being transformed gradually into nucleated fibres,
 which      must be supposed to be,         for a certain    time, still permeable by
 coloured fluids.
      If  we summarize       the results    thus described,     it is evident that the
 changes in the process of miliary tuberculosis in man are only to a limited
 extent similar to those which occurr in the process of artificial tu
 berculosis in guineapigs.           In the lung of tuberculized guineapigs the
 first structural changes are       characterized,   briefly speaking, by the appear
 ance of perivascular lymphangial nodules, whereas the changes of the in-
 teralveolar tissue and the alveolar epithelium form only a secondary pro
 cess. In miliary tuberculosis of man, on the other hand, we see that the
 first changes take place in the alveoli and interalveolar septa, and these
 changes are followed by the appearance of perivascular cords.
       It is therefore probable that, in artificial tuberculosis of the lung of the
 guineapig, the parts first attacked are the small branches of the pulmo
 nary artery or pulmonary vein, whereas in the miliary tuberculosis of man
  the capillary blood-vessels of the alveoli seem to be the tissue from which
  the action of the morbid agent starts.

           1873.
                                          (Abstract.)
        The author first reviews briefly several methods by which attempts
   have been made to estimate the value of minor portions of geological
   time,    such as   : — calculations   intended   to   estimate     the age of deltas,
   founded on the annual rate of accumulation                of sediments ; the astro
   nomical method followed by Mr. Croll, in connexion with the recurrence
   of glacial epochs ; the relative thicknesses of different formations ; and
   the relation of strong unconformity between two sets of formations in
   connexion with marked disappearance of old genera and species, and the
   appearance of newer forms.            Having shown that none of these methods
    give any clear help       in  the  absolute  measurement of time in years or
    cycles of years, even when founded on well-established facts, he proceeds
    to attempt to estimate the comparative value of long portions of geo
    logical time,      all  of which    are   represented      by   important series of
    formations.

  U6                          Prof. A. C. Ramsay on the                   [Jan. 29,
     The author then alludes to the subject of two papers by himself, given
  to the Geological Society in 1871, on the Red Rocks of England, in
  which he attempted to show that the Old Red Sandstone, Permian, and
  New Red series were all deposited in great inland lakes, fresh or salt;
  and this, taken in connexion with the wide-spreading terrestrial cha
  racter of much of the Carboniferous series, showed that a great con
  tinental age prevailed over much of Europe and in some other regions,
 from the close of the Silurian epoch to the close of the Trias.           He then
 endeavours to show the value of the time occupied in the deposition of
 the above-named formations, when compared with the time occupied in
 the deposition of the Cambrian and Silurian strata, and of the marine
 and freshwater        strata which    were deposited between the close of the
 Triassic epoch and the present day.
     After alluding to the probable mixed estuarine and marine character
  of the purple and grey Cambrian rocks of St. David's, it is shown that the
 Cambrian and Silurian series may be massed into three great groups: —
 first, from the bottom of the purple Cambrian rocks to the top of the
 Tremadoc      slates ; these being succeeded uneonformably by the second
 group,   the  Llandeilo and Bala or Caradoc beds ; on which rest uncon
 formably the members of the third series, ranging from the base of the
 Upper Llandovery to the top of the Upper Ludlow beds, — each uncon
 formable    break     in stratigraphical succession being accompanied by a
 corresponding      break   in palseontological succession.
     These three great divisions are next shown to be comparable, in the
time occupied for their deposition, to the three divisions of Lower,
Middle,     and Upper Devonian rocks, which are considered to be the
marine     representatives of the Old Bed Sandstone ; and therefore it
follows that     the time occupied   in the deposition of the latter may have been
as long as that taken      in  the deposition of the Cambrian and Silurian series.
This position is strengthened by the great palseontological differences in
the fossils of the Upper Ludlow and those of the marine Carboniferous
series, which seem to indicate a long lapse of time during which, in
Old Red Sandstone areas, no direct sequence of marine deposits took
place.
    The next question considered is, what relation in point of time the
deposition of the Old Red Sandstone may have taken, when compared
with the time occupied in the deposition of certain members of the
Mesozoic      formations.        Through a series of arguments, lithological,
stratigraphical, and palseontological, the conclusion is arrived at, that the
whole of the Liassic and Oolitic series present the various phases of one
facies of marine life, and, in this respect, are comparable to the changes in
the fossil contents of the various subformations of the Cambrian and
Lingula-flag series, of which the Tremadoc Slates form an upper
member.        In like manner the Lias and Oolites may be compared
with the Lower Devonian strata; and therefore a lower portion of the

1874.]        Comparative Value of certain Geological Ages.                   147
Old Red Sandstone may have taken as long for its deposition as the whole
of the time occupied in the deposition of the Jurassic series.
    Following out this train of argument through the Neocomian and
Cretaceous strata, the result is arrived at that the whole of the time
occupied in the deposition of the Old Red Sandstone may have been equal
to the whole of the time occupied in the deposition of all the Jurassic,
 Wealden, and Cretaceous strata collectively.
    In t he same manner the next term of the Continental era, the Carboni
ferous epoch, is compared with the Eocene period, both being locally
of marine, estuarine, freshwater, and terrestrial origin, and both con
nected with special continental epochs.        Next comes the Permian series,
comparable in its lacustrine origin to the Miocene strata of so much of
Europe, though in the case of the Permian waters the lakes were salt.
After this the Triassic series of Europe alone remains of the old con
tinent, the marine and salt-lake strata of which are not likely to bare
taken a shorter time in their deposition than the older Pliocene strata.
    If the foregoing method be of value, we arrive at the general conclusion
that the great local continental era, which began with the Old Red Sandstone
 and closed with the New Red Marl, is comparable, inpoint of Geological Time,
 to that occupied in the deposition of the whole of the Mesozoic series later than
 the  New  Red Marl, and of all the Cainozoic formations, and, more probably, of
 all ilu time that has elapsed since the beginning of the deposition of the Lias
 down to the present day; and consequently the more modern continental era,
 which locally began with the Eocene period and lasts to the present day,
 has been of much shorter duration.
     The author then pointed out that during the older continental era
 there flourished two typical floras — one extending from the time of the
 Old Eed Sandstone to the close of the Permian strata ; while the second,
 which is largely of Jurassic type, characterized the Triassic formations.
 From the time of the Lias onward in time, we have also two distinct
 typical floras — the first of Juraspic, and the second of much more modern
 type, beginning with the Upper Cretaceous strata of Aix-la Chapelleand
 lasting to the present day.
     In like manner the faunas connected with the land resolve themselves
  into two types : — the first chiefly Labyrinthodontian, as shown in the
  Carboniferous and Permian strata ; and the second characteristic of the
  Trias, with Crocodilia, many land-lizards, Anomodontia, Deinosauria, and
  Marsupial Mammalia. This fauna, as regards genera, with the exception
  of Labyrinthodontia and the appearance of Pterosauria, is represented
  through the remaining members of the Mesozoic formations,* from
  Jurassic to Cretaceous inclusive.      After this comes the Pachydermatous
  Mammalian Eocene fauna, and after that the Miocene land-fauna,
  which, in its main characters, is of modern type. From Jurassic to Cre
  taceous times, inclusively, there was therefore, as far as weTmow, in
  this area a land-fauna chiefly Reptilian, Saurian, and Marsupial, and

   In conclusion, the recent character of the early marine faunas of the
Cambrian and Lingula-flag series was pointed out, such as Spongida,
Annelida, Echinodermata,           Crustacea, Polyzoa, Brachiopoda, Lamelli-
branchiata, Pteropoda, Nucleobranchiata, and Cephalopoda. This was long
ago insisted on by Professor Huxley ; and we find no evidence of its
having lived near the beginning of the zoological series ; for below the
Cambrian series we are at once involved in a sort of chaos of meta-
morphic strata.          Of the geological history, in the words of Darwin,
" we possess the last volume alone, relating only to two or three countries."
The connexion         of this question with that of the comparative value of
different geological eras is obvious, especially in relation to the palaeonto-
logical part of the question.

I. " On    the Anatomy and Habits         of the genus Phronima (Latr.) ."
       By John Denis Macdonald, M.D., F.R.S., Staff Surgeon
       R.N., Assistant Professor of Naval Hygiene, Netley Medical
       School.    Received January 15, 1874.
   Of all groups of Crustacea the Amphipoda would appear to exhibit
the widest range, in the modification of their parts or organs, without
obliterating the delicate lines of natural affinity running through them
as a whole.    This is well exemplified in the interesting paper of Dr. R.
                                                      '
Willemoes-Suhm, Naturalist to the ' Challenger Exploring-Expedition,
" On a new Genus of Amphipod Crustaceans " founded by him, and named
Thaumops (Phil. Trans, vol. clxiii. p. 629). This genus, although exhibiting
many characters in common with Phronima, presents some striking points of
difference traceable in the external jaw-feet, caudal appendages, the posi
tion of the generative pore, and certain particulars in its internal anatomy.
   Of the several characters given of Thaumops the presence of only four
caudal appendages is perhaps the most exceptional ; for in the generality
of the Ubopteba there are six besides the telson, which is obviously the
equivalent of the seventh abdominal segment of Macrura.           Thus the six
pairs of abdominal appendages, including the tail-fins of the prawn or
shrimp, for example, are represented in Phronima and its allies, with the
exception of Thaumops.      The manner in which the fourth and fifth pair
of swimmerets and the caudal fins of Macrura are modified in the
Ubopteba is well seen in the accompanying figures ; fig. 2 in Phronima
and fig. 3 in a neighbouring group of Hyperians, which also serve to
show why, at least in the former genus, only five segments have hitherto
been recognized in the abdomen.
    During the exploratory     voyage    of H.M.S.    •
                                                        Herald,' in the S.W.
Pacific, numerous species      which  I   have always been in the habit of
referring to the genus Phronima, were taken in the towing-net ; and           I
may remark that the assumed parasitic habit of these creatures was
never, at least, a prominent fact to me ; they were so often taken either
 perfectly free, or tenanting a nidamental case, such as that subsequently
to be described. Those who, like Dr. Suhm, are acquainted with deep-
 sea dredging are usually cautious how they refer the doubtful products
to their proper habitat ; whether it be the bottom that has been reached,
 or some zone of the watery space above.        Indeed it is quite possible for

     1874.]       Anatomy and Habits       of the Genus Phronima.              155
    the narrow area of the tallow-arming of the deep-sea lead to include for
   tuitously, and carry down Phronima or any other little crustacean natu
    rally living near the surface ; and contact with the bottom would finally
   press it into the tallow, so as to mislead the observer as to its true
   habitat.    Conversely,   in bringing up the dredge from a given depth, it
   may finally carry with it any more superficial objects casually lying in
   the track which it takes.
       Fig. 1 of the accompanying drawings from nature represents a species
   of Phronima captured in lat. 30° 16' S., long. 176° 27' W., of which          I
   find the following description in my notes taken at the time : —
      Head exceedingly elongated from above downwards, with considerable
   enlargement of the back part, which contains two masses of transparent,
   rounded ?, and tapering columns, whose bases occupy the fulness of the
   poll, exhibiting a regularly facetted appearance externally on two rounded
   protuberances.      The apices of these organs, on the other hand, con
   verge   and blend with  the rays of the compound eye, of which, indeed, they
   may be said to form part, probably assisting nocturnal vision by the pro
   duction of luminosity. The long axis of the head is therefore at right
   angles with that of the body, its form being full above and gradually
   tapering downwards.         The aperture of the mouth is situated at the
   smaller extremity, inferiorly guarded by its mandibular, maxillae, and one
   pair of foot-jaws, appertaining to the cephalic segments. The latter
i  organs are more distinctly recognizable than the others, on account of
   their more superficial position. They are short, apparently united at the
   base, and curved forwards, terminating in two ovate and acute appen
   dages lying side by side, serrated on the borders and beset with short hairs.
      The eyes are small where the facets are lateral, and the apices are
  invested with black pigment, but large where they swell out the back of
  the head, the points of the same cones meeting in a red spot, quite distinct
   from, and internal to the black one. This condition is also observable in
  the Hyperians, and is worthy of further study in a physiological        point of
  view.
      Two minute two-jointed antennae arise from the head, just above and in
  front of the eyes. The posterior or upper surface of the second joint of
  these antennae is clothed with short stiff hairs.
      There are seven pairs of thoracic limbs ; but the first two are separated
  from the others, to some little extent, by arising on a plane anterior and
  inferior to them, the first two tergal pieces being somewhat wider than
  those of the succeeding segments.           They are, moreover, distinguished
  from the other limbs by possessing a minute spine-like movable claw,
  bounded, on either side, by a short styliform process.           There is also a
  rudimentary     manus  developed upon     the posterior part of the second seg
  ment above this claw, that of the first pair being the stoutest, although
  the limbs themselves are the smaller of the two. Both pairs of members
  now described, while they very distinctly belong to the thorax, act the
                                                                     n2

part of foot-jaws as in the higher Crustacea.                 The five succeeding pairs
are more especially restricted to the thorax, the third or middle one being
stoutly chelate, normally directed backwards, with the pollex superior, and
enjoying a very considerable range of motion.
   The first pair is usually thrown forwards over the head, and the last
backwards over the abdomen, the first flexure corresponding with the
first swimmeret ; the second pair is the longest.
   The fourth, fifth, and sixth thoracic segments are each furnished with
a pair of elongated and laterally compressed respiratory vesicles, connected
 with the posterior and inferior part of the epimeral pieces behind the
articulation of the corresponding limbs. These vesicles increase in size
from before backwards ; and indeed a very rudimentary one may be seen
behind the third pair of limbs.             The last, or seventh, thoracic segment is
of unusual length, tapering posteriorly, to correspond with the narrowness
of the abdomen, in which also the segments are of greater length than
those of the thorax.           It has been already stated that in Phronima, as in
the Macrura, there are seven segments in the posterior division of the
body ; functionally, however, three of these may be said to belong to the
abdomen and four to the tail. The three abdominal segments bear each
a pair of swimmerets,           arising near their posterior border, and consisting
of a   stout or inflated foot-stalk and two narrow, acuminate, annulated
and setaceous terminal pieces.
   The three anterior of the four caudal segments bear a narrow fan, con
sisting of three pairs of slender appendages furnished with two short
styliform tips. The first and third of these caudal members are much
longer than the second.
   The oral organs (with the exception of the jaw-feet), the large chela,
and the foot-stalks of the swimmerets are tinted with a rich purple pig
ment.      All the other parts are hyaline and transparent.

by him    :—
   In   lat. 21° 0' S. and long. 17° 45' W. off the island of Ono, Fiji
Group, apparently the same species of Phronima as that above described
was taken in the towing-net, but with the addition of a numerous pro
geny of young in a large gelatinous but tough nidamental case.                  This
interesting nest was shaped like a barrel, but with both ends open, and
the external surface was somewhat tuberculated and uneven.                 The wall
of the tube presented numerous round and puckered openings, observmg
no very definite arrangement, but through which entering currents were
observed to pass.         These openings generally, though not invariably,
pierced the tuberculations.
   An external membrane, with an internal lining, were distinctly visible,
both seeming to be continuous at the rims of the tube. The space between
these layers was filled up with a pulpy substance, in which scattered
nucleiform      bodies were detected with a higher power of the microscope.
   I   have been particular in the description of the case, as some far
fetched guesses were made as to its real nature.            The cutting, piercing,
and tearing implements of Phronima would very soon alter and reduce a
 bell-shaped Medusa, a Salpian, or a Pyrosoma tube to the required pattern ;
for there is usually a great uniformity in the character and appearauce
of this case.
   " With regard to Phronima,"              Mr. Spence Bate*, " our knowledge
                                       says
is small   : its habit is that of an inhabitant of the gill-cavities of some one
or more species of Medusa ; but in the Collection of the British Museum,
entrusted to my care for examination, is a very curious case that was
sent home from Naples by 8. P. Pratt, Esq., as being the one in which the
animal was taken.         The structure is thick, fleshy, semitransparent, and
studded over the surface and round the orifices — one of which is smaller
than the other — with numerous white excrescences.                 Examination with
the microscope shows the substance to be pervaded by bundles of fibres ;
each fasciculus is twisted together near its centre ; these, some of them
being larger than others, star the structure thickly, and still more plenti
fully where the white excrescences appear."
   However problematical the nature of the case, that its use is for nidi-
fication there can be no further doubt.

be out of place.

II. " On    a  Self-recording Method of Measuring the Intensity of
      the Chemical Action of Total Daylight."           By H. E. Roscoe,
      F.R.S. Received November 27, 1873.
                                 (Abstract.)
   The object of the present communication is to describe an instrument
by which the varying intensity of the chemically active rays, as affecting
chloride of silver paper of constant sensitiveness, can be made self-record
ing. The method described by the author in the Bakerian Lecture for 1865,
although it has been the means of bringing into notice many important
facts concerning the distribution of the sun's chemical activity throughout
the atmosphere, as well as in different situations on the earth's surface, has
not as yet been introduced as a portion of the regular work of meteoro
logical observatories, owing to the fact that, in order to obtain a satisfac
tory curve of daily chemical intensity, at least hourly observations need to
be made, and this involves the expenditure of more time and labour than        •
it has been found possible to give. In the present communication a
method is described, which, whilst preserving untouched the principles
and accuracy of the former method, reduces the personal attention needed
for carrying out the measurements to a minimum, and thus renders its
adoption in observatories possible.
   According to this plan, a constant sensitive paper is exposed by a self-
acting arrangement for accurately known times, at given intervals
throughout the day. The insolation apparatus stocked with sensitive
paper is placed in position either early in the morning of the day during
which the measurements have to be made, or on the previous night, and
by means of an electric communication with a properly arranged clock,
the sensitive paper is exposed every hour during the day, so that, in the
evening, the observer has only to read off, in the ordinary manner, the
hourly intensities which have been recorded on the paper during the
day.
   This self-recording arrangement, though apparently simple, involves
points which have rendered its successful completion a somewhat difficult
matter, owing, in the first place, to the great variations which occur in
the chemical intensity of total daylight in different places, at different
times of the day, and in different periods of the year ; and secondly,
owing to the fact that, in order to be able to estimate the chemical
intensity, the coloration acquired by the paper must reach, but not much

     1874.]     Intensity  of the Chemical Action of Total Daylight.           159
     exceed, a given tint.   It becomes   necessary therefore that on each occasion
     when an observation      is needed, the sensitive paper should be exposed
     mechanically, not once, but for several known, but varying intervals of
     time, quickly succeeding each other ; so that whatever may be the
     intensity of the total daylight (supposed during these intervals to re
     main constant), some one at least of the several exposed papers will
     possess the requisite shade.       This is accomplished by a duplicate ar
     rangement of a clock and insolation-apparatus, by means of which disks of
     the constant sensitive paper are exposed each hour for successive known
     intervals of time, varying from two to thirty seconds.       After an interval
    of an hour, another set of disks are exposed for the same series of
     intervals, and these series of insolations are repeated once every hour
     during the day. The mechanical arrangements for effecting this with
     accuracy are fully described in the paper.       On unrolling, at the end of
     the day, the strip of sensitive paper which has served for the exposures,
     black disks showing where the paper" has been stationary for the hour
    are seen, and between each of these are found ten circles variously tinted,
     from that, probably, scarcely visible, which was exposed for two seconds, to
     that, perhaps too dark to read off, which was insolated for thirty seconds.
     Amongst these, some one at least, will be found of such a shade as to
     enable it to be read off by the monochromatic soda-flame, on a graduated
     fixed strip, as described in former communications.
  <     A new method of calibrating the fixed strips of standard tints neces
     sary for these measurements is next described, and the question as to the
    possibility of preparing constant sensitive paper in long strips instead of
    in large sheets is next experimentally discussed, the result of the exa
     mination being that it is possible to prepare silvered paper in long narrow
    strips such as are used in Morse's telegraph-apparatus, so that it shall
    throughout its length preserve the standard sensitiveness.
        The time during which the disks of constant sensitive paper are ex
    posed is next ascertained for each instrument by a chronograph.
        During wet weather the insolator is covered by a semicircular glass
    shade, and the value of the coefficients for refraction and absorption
r   due to this glass shade is determined.
        The latter portion of the communication contains the results of a series
    of comparisons of the curves of daily chemical intensity obtained (1) with
    the hand-insolator,    and (2) with the self-recording instrument. Com
    parisons of this nature were made during the months of May, June,
    and July, 1873, by simultaneous hourly determinations in the neighbour
    hood of Manchester according to both methods.           Of these observations,
    six full days are selected, and the tables and curves accompanying the
    communication show the close correspondence of both sets of observations.
    The integrals of total chemical intensity for these days are also given, and
    exhibit   as close an agreement     as, from the nature    of the experiments,
    can be expected.

      Memoir.        By   F. A. Abel, F.R.S., Treas. C.S.         Received
      December 1, 1873.
                                   (Abstract.)
   The researches detailed in this memoir are in continuation of those
described in the Memoir on Explosive Agents, published in 1869*, and
relate chiefly to the investigation of the conditions to be fulfilled for
accomplishing the detonation of explosive substances, and of the circum
stances and results which attend the transmission of detonation.
   The exceptional behaviour exhibited by certain explosive compounds
with respect to their power of inducing the detonation of other sub
stances by their explosion, which was demonstrated and discussed in
the preceding memoir, has been confirmed by further experiments.       The
susceptibility of some substances to detonation, through the agency of
certain compounds, and their remarkable inertness when subjected to the
detonation of others, which at any rate do not rank lower as regards the
mechanical force and heat developed by their explosion, led the author to
suggest that a similarity in character, or synchronism, of the vibrations
developed by the explosion of particular substances, might operate in
favouring the detonation of one such substance by the initial detonation
of a small quantity of another, while, in the absence of such synchronism,
a much more powerful initiative detonation, or the application of much      »
greater force, would be needed to effect the detonation of the material
operated upon.      This view, which has been favourably entertained by
many,   as affording a reasonable explanation of the apparently anomalous
results referred to, appears to have received support from the results of
experiments recently instituted by Champion and Pellett, with iodide of
nitrogen and some other explosive compounds, which indicated that the
explosion of certain sensitive substances could be accomplished only by
vibrations of a particular pitch, and by which they also demonstrated that
particular explosions affected certain sensitive flames which were un
affected by others, unless the volume of the explosion was proportionately
much increased.
    Some few experiments were made by Champion and Pellet on the
transmission of detonation to iodide of nitrogen through considerable
 spaces, by means of tubes, and some experiments of a purely practical
character have also been instituted by Captain Trauzl, on the transmission
of detonation    to cartridges    of dynamite, separated by spaces, in iron
tubes, by the explosion of a charge of the material placed in one extremity
 of the tube. It appeared to the author that a systematic investigation of
the transmission of detonation through the agency of tubes, with the
 employment of explosive agents less highly susceptible and more uniform

      and constant in composition than the iodide of nitrogen, might usefully
      contribute to our knowledge of the behaviour and relation to each other
      of explosive substances.
         Experiments were first carried on with tubes of cast and wrought iron
      of different diameters and lengths. The explosive agents used were gun-
      cotton, in different mechanical conditions, dynamite, mercuric fulminate,
      and preparations containing the latter as an ingredient.         Interesting
      results were obtained, among others, in the course of these experiments,
      demonstrating a want of reciprocity in behaviour between gun-cotton and
     mercuric fulminate, as regards the transmission of detonation from one
     to the other, similar to that previously observed in the case of nitro
     glycerine, chloride of nitrogen and gun-cotton, and showing also how
     greatly the results, as regards transmission of detonation, may be altered
     when certain limits in respect to the quantity of material employed as
     the initiative detonator, are exceeded.    Thus 7 grammes of strongly con
     fined mercuric fulminate, inserted into one extremity of an iron tube only
      ¦152 metre (6 inches) long and -025 metre (1 inch) in diameter, was the
     minimum      amount   required to determine the detonation of gun-cotton
     placed in the other extremity of the tube, being at least fifty times the
     amount requisite to ensure detonation of compressed gun-cotton when
     exploded in close contact with the latter ; but the detonation of 7 grammes
     of compressed gun-cotton in one extremity of a channel 2-128 metres
. *• (7 feet) long and -031 metre (1-25 inch) in diameter, consisting of two
     iron tubes placed end to end, accomplished the detonation of fulminate
     inserted in the other extremity. When 14 grammes of confined fulminate
     were employed, detonation of gun-cotton was accomplished through a
     channel 2-129 metres (7 feet) long and -031 metre (1-25 inch) in diameter,
     while 7 grammes only just sufficed to develop detonation through a tube
     of smaller diameter and only -152 metre (6 inches) long, and 10 grammes,
     through a similar tube only "228 metre (9 inches) long.        The foregoing
     are quoted as illustrations of the instructive results obtained in these
     experiments.
         A few'experiments werejnade on a comparatively large scale with the
*    above-named explosives, with the view of ascertaining the influence of
     the  material composing the tube, upon the effect produced ; and some strik
     ing results were also obtained by interposing very slight obstacles (e. g.
     loose tufts of cotton wool) in the path of the gas-wave, and thus checking
     the transmission     of detonation, which was certain when the path was
     unobstructed.      But these points were more closelyj investigated by a
     series of accurate experiments upon a small scale with silver fulminate,
     the tubes used being alike in diameter and thickness, but varying in
     length, and consisting of different materials, viz. glass, pewter, brass,
     paper, and vulcanized india-rubber.       The principal results obtained by
     the larger operations with other explosives were confirmed by these small
     experiments, and several additional     interesting observations were made.

 162                           Mr. F. A. Abel       on the                   [Feb. 5,
A   great difference appeared, at first, to be established in the power pos
sessed by tubes of different materials of favouring the transmission of
detonation,        the glass tubes being far in advance of the others in this
respect. It was eventually established, very clearly, by a series of experi
ments that this difference was 'not due, to any decisive extent, to the
physical peculiarities (in regard to sonorosity, elasticity, &c.) of the
materials composing the tubes, but chiefly to differences in the degree
of roughness of their inner surfaces, and in the consequent variation of
the resistance opposed by those surfaces to the gas-wave.                  Thus the
power      of    a  glass tube  to favour   the   transmission   of  detonation  was
reduced, by about two thirds, by coating the inner surface with a film of
French chalk, while the facility of transmission, through a brass tube, was
nearly      doubled by polishing its interior, and was increased threefold,
with a paper tube, by coating the interior with glazed paper.
    The following are some of the points established by these experiments
on the transmission of detonation by tubes : —
    1.  The distance to which detonation may be transmitted through the
agency of a tube to a distinct mass of explosive substance is regulated by
the following conditions :
    (rt) by the nature and the quantity of the substance employed as the
initiative detonator, and by the nature of the substance to be detonated,
but not by the quantity of the latter, nor by the mechanical condition in
which     it is exposed by the action of the detonation ;
                                                           " detonator," and of the
   (b) by the relation which the diameter of the
charge to be detonated, bear to that of the tube employed ;
    (c) by the strength of the material composing the tube, and the conse
quent resistance which it offers to the lateral transmission of the force
developed at the instant of detonation ;
    {d) by the amount of force expended in overcoming the friction between
the gas and the sides of the tubes, or other impediments introduced into
the latter     ;
    (e) by the degree of completeness of the channel, and by the positions
assigned to the detonator and the charge to be detonated.
    2. The nature (apart from strength or power to resist opening up, or
disintegration) of the material composing the tube through which detona
tion is transmitted, generally appears to exert no important influence
upon the result obtained.          At any rate the differences with respect to
smoothness of the interior of the tubes far outweigh those which may
prove traceable to differences in the nature of the materials composing
them.
    In   the tube experiments      with gun-cotton     many instances occurred in
which the mass operated upon was exploded, but with comparatively
little if any destructive effect, portions of the gun-cotton being at- the
same time dispersed         and occasionally   inflamed.     Similarly, the mercuric

 1874.]                  History of Explosive Agents.                        163
fulminate was frequently exploded, through the agency of a transmitted
detonation, in a manner quite distinct from the violent detonation at other
times developed.        Even the silver fulminate, which under all ordinary
circumstances      detonates  violently even when only one particle of a mass
is submitted to a sufficient disturbing influence, has on one or two occa
 sions been exploded by the transmitted effect of a detonation of mercuric
 fulminate, without the usual destructive effect.
    This remarkable difference in the behaviour of one and the same explo
 sive substance, under nearly similar circumstances, has been made the
 subject of experimental investigation, in the course of which some in
teresting illustrations have been obtained of the manner in which varia
tions in the resistance to mechanical motion influence the results obtained,
 by submitting some part of a mass of explosive material to sharp blows,
 by firing from a rifle (at different ranges) against masses of compressed
 gun-cotton    of different weight and thickness, and either freely suspended
 in air or supported in various ways. An important exemplification of the
 difference between explosion and detonation was obtained in the course of
 subsequent experiments, instituted for the purpose of determining the
 velocity with which detonation is transmitted through tubes.
     The influence of dilution, by solids and liquids, on the susceptibility of
 explosive compounds to detonation has been made the subject of syste
 matic experiments, and some of the results obtained have already acquired
 considerable importance.       The dilution of a liquid and of a solid explosive
 compound by inert solid substances produces very different results.        Thus
 the liquid (nitroglycerine) may be very largely diluted (as in the case of
 dynamite and similar preparations) by inert solids, without any modifica
 tion of its sensitiveness to detonation, because this dilution does not
 interrupt the continuity of the explosive substance. The initiative deto
 nator, when surrounded by such a mixture, is therefore in contact at all
 points with some portion of the nitroglycerine, and the latter is in con
 tinuous connexion throughout ; hence detonation is as readily established
and transmitted through the mixture as though the liquid were undiluted.
 But when     a solid explosive agent is similarly diluted, there must obviously
be complete separation of its particles at a number of points proportionate
 to the extent of dilution and the state of division ; the establishment of
detonation, or its transmission, is therefore impeded either by a diminution
of the extent of contact between the initiative detonator and the substance
to be exploded, or by the barrier which the interposed non-explosive
particles oppose to the transmission of the detonation, or by both causes.
    Intimate mixtures of a finely divided sensitive explosive compound
with an inert solid, if compressed into compact masses, become much
more susceptible of detonation than if they be in the loose pulverulent
condition ; thus compressed mixtures of finely divided gun-cotton, with
large proportions of inert solids, were found but little inferior in sensi
tiveness to the undiluted explosive agents.          If the diluent consists of a

soluble salt (e.g. potassium chloride) the well-incorporated mixture being
compressed with the aid of the solvent («. g. water), and then dried, the
material is obtained in a condition  of great rigidity, the particles being
cemented together by the crystallized salt ; it is therefore in a form more
favourable to the action of detonation than undiluted gun-cotton sub
mitted to considerably greater compression.
  "When the solid substance with which gun-cotton is diluted consists
of an oxidizing agent (a nitrate or chlorate), the predisposition to chemical
reaction between the two substances so far increases the susceptibility to
detonation that, operating in conjunction with the effect of the soluble
salt in imparting rigidity to the mixture, it renders the latter quite as
sensitive to the detonating action of the minimum fulminate-charge as
undiluted gun-cotton is, when highly compressed. This fact has given
additional importance to results which the author obtained some time
since in availing himself of the facility with which finely divided gun-
cotton, as obtained by the pulping process, may be intimately mixed with
the proportion of an oxidizing agent (such as potassium nitrate) required
to completely oxidize the carbon. If about three fourths of the theoretical
requirements of the salts be employed, the resulting products will perform
fully the amount of work obtained from a corresponding weight of undi
luted gun-cotton; and as nearly one third of this substance has been
replaced in them by material of very much less cost, a considerable advan
tage is gained in point of economy.     Moreover the greater rigidity of the    •
                        "          "
compressed masses of      nitrated   gun-cotton, already explained, renders
them less susceptible to injury by transport and rough usage than ordinary
compressed gun-cotton.
  These compressed mixtures being found quite as sensitive to detonation
by fulminate as the pure explosivo compound, it became interesting to
compare their behaviour with that of the latter, when exposed to the
detonation of nitroglycerine. The results demonstrated that they are
much more readily susceptible of detonation by it than compressed gun-
cotton  ; thus, in only one instance was the latter detonated by the explo
sion of 62-4 grammes (two ounces) of nitroglycerine in close contact with
it,but that quantity invariably detonated

preparation was exploded, but without the destructive effect produced in
the other experiments   ;similar explosions of the substance were deve
loped by means of 15"6 grammes (0-5 ounce) of nitroglycerine.      In the
case of pure gun-cotton, the results obtained were always either simple
disintegration of the mass, or else detonation, sufficient nitroglycerine

   facilitated by the greater resistance it opposes to disintegration when
   incorporated with a salt, as described ; but that the higher susceptibility

   parations is probably chiefly due to some predisposing influence exerted
   by the oxidizing agent.
      If  gun-cotton is diluted by impregnation with a liquid, or with a body
   solid, at ordinary temperatures, which is introduced as a liquid into the
   mass, its sensitiveness     to detonation    is reduced to a far greater extent
   than by a corresponding weight of a solid, incorporated as such, with the
   gun-cotton.      The cause of this is evidently the converse of that which
   operates in preventing the reduction of sensitiveness of nitroglycerine by
   its considerable dilution with an inert solid ; the liquid diluent which
   envelopes each particle of the solid explosive material isolates it from its
   neighbours, and thus opposes resistance to the transmission of detona
   tion, while with nitroglycerine the liquid explosive agent envelopes the
   solid diluent, and thus remains continuous throughout the mass.
      The absorption of three per cent, of water by gun-cotton (in addition
¦V to the two per cent, which it normally contains) rendered its detonation
   doubtful by the " detonator

                                     ordinarily used. Dry disks which had been
   impregnated with oil or tallow, could not be exploded by means of one
   gramme of mercuric fulminate, applied in a metal case in the usual way.
   By considerably increasing the initiative charge of fulminate, damp gun-
   cotton could, however, be detonated; and it occurred to Mr. Abel's
   assistant, Mr. E. O. Brown, to apply the detonation of dry gun-cotton
   itself to the development of the explosive force of the compressed material,
   when in a moist state.
      A   series of precise experiments showed that when compressed gun-
   cotton contained as much as 17 per cent, of water, it could be detonated,
   though not with absolute certainty, by 6-5 grammes (100 grains) of com
   pact air-dry gun-cotton exploded by means of the usual
                                                                   " detonator," in
   close contact with it. When the proportion was increased to 20 per
   cent, detonation was not accomplished with certainty by employing less
   than 31*2 grammes (1 ounce) of the air-dry material ; and when the maxi
   mum amount of water (30 to 35 per cent.) was absorbed, detonation conld
   not   be absolutely relied upon with the employment of less than 1 24-8
   grammes (4 ounces) of air-dry gun-cotton applied in close contact.
      Moist and wet compressed gun-cotton are decidedly more readily sus
   ceptible of detonation by means of air-dry gun-cotton, freely exposed and
                             " detonator " of mercuric fulminate, than by means
   exploded by the usual
   of the confined fulminate applied alone     ;  thus, when the material contained

17 per cent, of water, its detonation by fulminate direct was not certain
with the employment of less than about 13 grammes (200 grains),
whereas the result was absolutely        certain with employment of about 10
grammes of air-dry gun-cotton.
   The transmission of detonation from dry to wet gun-cotton, through
the agency of a tube, appears to take place with the same facility as
though the mass to be detonated were dry ; and the same is the case with
regard to the propagation of detonation from one mass of moist gun-
cotton to others freely exposed to air, but touching each other, provided
the one first detonated contained not less water than the others to which
detonation is to be transmitted ; but this is not the case, if even small
spaces intervene between the separate masses, and in this respect the
moist gun-cotton behaves very differently from the air-dry material.

                                      preparations of gun-cotton are as
readily detonated, in the moist state,      as   ordinary compressed gun-cotton.
With respect to the mechanical effects obtained by the detonation of
these materials in the moist or wet state, numerous small and large com
parative experiments have demonstrated that there is no falling off in the
work done by them when used wet.
  Decided evidence has, moreover, been obtained of greater sharpness of
action, when gun-cotton and its preparations are detonated in the wet
state  and this accords with the observations made in the earlier of these
        ;
researches, that the less susceptible a mass of given explosive material is             *
of compression, when submitted to the action of             a sufficient   initiative
detonation, the more readily will detonation be transmitted, and the more
suddenly will the transformation from solid to gas and vapour take place.
When air is replaced by water in the compressed masses, t he transmission
of detonation is obviously        favoured by the increased     resistance of the
particles   to motion, at the instant of their exposure to the detonative
force.
   The freezing of wet compressed gun-cotton renders it as readily sus
ceptible of detonation as the mixtures of gun-cotton with soluble (crys
tallized) salts, to which the wet material obviously becomes quite similar
in structure by the solidification of the water.
   Mercuric fulminate and mixtures of it with potassium chlorate, when
mixed with water to such an extent as to convert them into pasty masses
and freely exposed, are readily detonated by small quantities (0*2 grm. or
3 grains) of the confined fulminate, even when not in contact.      Finely
divided gun-cotton, made up into a pulp with water, was found not to
be susceptible of detonation, even under very much more favourable con
ditions than the above, the mixture being placed in thin metal cylinders,
open at one end,  and a large disk of dry gun-cotton detonated in the
centre.  But if wet compressed gun-cotton is packed into receptacles of
wrought iron, so that the initiative charge of dry gun-cotton is closely
surrounded    by   it,   and the small spaces    intervening between the several

   masses are filled up    with water, the charge being then submerged, it is
   exploded    with certainty and with results equal to those furnished under
   similar conditions by the dry material.     Provided the escape of force, by
   transmission through the water, be retarded at the instant of the first
   detonation, either by the resistance which the material of the case offers,
   or by the pressure of a considerable column of water, the detonation of
   wet gun-cotton immersed in water, and separated by thin layers of the
   fluid from the contiguous masses, is accomplished with certainty. Eesulta
   fully equal to those furnished by charges enclosed in strong wrought-iron
   cases, have been obtained by the employment of sheet^tin cases or of bags,
   or even of simple fishing-nets, these only serving to hold the masses
   composing the charge tightly together.      If, however, the latter condition
   is not attended to, or the depth of the immersion of the charge is insuf
   ficient, its detonation will not take place, even if a comparatively large
   initiative detonator be employed.
       The suddenness and completeness with which detonation was trans
   mitted through small water-spaces in the experiments with wrought-iron
   cases, led the author to attempt the application of water as a vehicle for
   the efficient employment of only small denotating charges for bursting
   or breaking up cast-iron shells into numerous and comparatively uniform
   fragments (and thus to employ a hollow projectile of the most simple
   construction to fulfil the functions of the comparatively complicated
.< "shrapnel"- or " segment "-shell).         The results afforded remarkable
   illustrations of the transmission of force by water, and may prove of
   considerable practical importance.      The destructive effects produced by
   small detonating charges, when exploded in shells which were filled
   up with water and entirely closed, were proportionate, not simply to the
   amount of explosive agent used, but also to the suddenness of the con
   cussion imparted to the water by the explosion.           Thus 7 grammes
   (0-25 ounce) of compressed gun-cotton, detonated in a shell filled with
   water, broke it up into nearly eight times the number of fragments
   obtained by exploding a shell of the same kind full of gunpowder (viz.
   containing 367-9 grammes = 13 ounces).          When picric powder, which
*  is also a very violent explosive agent, though much less sudden in its
   action, was detonated in one of these shells, in the same way as the small
   charge of gun-cotton, 28-3 grammes (=1 ounce), or an amount four
   times greater than that employed of the latter substance, burst the shell
   into about the same number of fragments as were produced by the 13
   ounces of gunpowder (instead of about 8 times the number, produced by
   means of 0-25 ounce of gun-cotton).           Other observations of interest
   were made in the course of these shell-experiments ; they led, moreover,
   to some cognate experiments which furnished interesting results.
       In developing detonation, in a perfectly closed and sufficiently strong
   vessel, completely filled with water besides the detonating charge, the
   resistance offered by the liquid at the instant of detonation may be re

garded as similar to that which would be presented by a perfectly solid
mass. Similarly, if the strong vessel be completely filled with a mixture of
water and a solid (e. g. a fine powder or a fibre reduced to a fine state of
division), such a mixture should also, at the instant of detonation,
behave    as a very compact         solid with regard to the resistance which it
opposes to the detonating          charge which it surrounds.          If  this be so, a
mixture of finely divided guii-gotton with water, if enclosed in a shell,
should be in a condition readily susceptible of detonation, because at the
instant of explosion of the initiative charge, the particles of gun-cotton
must offer great resistance to mechanical motion.                Experiment has fully
established   the  correctness     of  this conclusion,   having demonstrated that,
while it is indispensable to employ gun-cotton in a highly compressed
form, to ensure its detonation under all other conditions, it may, if en
closed in strong vessels, such as shells, be employed with equal efficiency
in   a finely  divided    state, provided the spaces between the particles be
completely filled with water, the small detonating charge being immersed
in the aqueous mixture.
    The results obtained in the several experiments             bearing on the trans
mission of detonation       led  the  author  to attempt    to  determine its velocity,
or the rate at which it proceeds along a continuous mass, or from one
mass of an explosive body to another, under various conditions.                        For
this purpose he availed himself of the electric chronoscope devised by
Captain A. Noble, F.E.S., which had furnished satisfactory results in
determinations of the rate of motion of projectiles in the bore of a gun,
made by the Government Committee on explosive substances.                         The ex
periments were carried out with compressed gun-cotton in the dry and
wet state, with " nitrated
                                 "
                                   gun-cotton, with nitroglycerine and dynamite,
and with small charges of gun-cotton inserted into tubes, with considerable
inten-ening spaces*.          The disks of gun-cotton, dry, wet, and nitrated,
were arranged       either    in continuous rows or trains, the disks either
touching each other, or a definite and uniform space or interval
intervening between each.            At the commencement of the row a fine in
sulated wire, forming part of the primary circuit (by the sudden severance
of which the electric record of the rate of transmission was obtained on
the chronoscope), was tightly stretched across the first disk.                      Other
wires were similarly fixed at uniform distances (of one, two, four, or six
feet) from each other.          In detemining the velocity of transmission of
detonation through          tubes, wrought iron gas-pipes of 0-032 metre
(l-25 inch) diameter were used, with small perforations at the desired
intervals, through which the insulated wires were passed ; the disks of
gun-cotton, to which detonation was to be transmitted, were inserted
into the tubes so as to be in close contact with these tightly stretched

  compressed charges of this material, 3 inches (-0759 metre) long and 1
  inch ("0253 metre) in diameter, being placed end to end or with definite
  spaces intervening between them.        The nitroglycerine was placed in V-
  shaped troughs of thin sheet metal, through which the insulated wires were
  passed transversely   at the requisite intervals, so as to be immersed  in the
  liquid.
     A number of experiments with dry gun-cotton compressed, demon
  strated that the rate at which detonation is transmitted from mass to
  mass, when these are in actual contact with each other, is between 17,500
  and 20,000 feet (5320 metres and 6080 metres) per second, and that the
  rate of transmission is affected by the compactness of the material, but not
  bya difference in the form and arrangement of the individual masses, nor by
  very considerable variations     in their weight.   By the experiments with
  spaced   gun-cotton disks, it  was  demonstrated  that  the separation of the
  masses may retard the rate at which detonation is transmitted, the extent
  of such retardation   being, of course, determined by the relation between
  the size of the individual masses and the extent of space intervening be
  tween them.      With compressed gun-cotton, containing fifteen per cent,
  of water, detonation    was transmitted    at a slightly higher velocity than
  with the dry substance of the same compactness ; but when gun-cotton
  saturated with water was employed, the increase in the rate of trans-
* mission was very marked, being equal to about 20,000 feet per second,
  with disks which, when dry, detonated at a rate of about 17,500 feet per
  second. With " nitrated gun-cotton the rate of transmission was, as
                               "
  might have been anticipated, decidedly slower than with the pure dry
  material ; it ranged between 15,500 and 16,000 feet (4712 metres and
  4864 metres) per second.
     The results obtained with dynamite and nitroglycerine presented some
  very interesting points of difference from those furnished by compressed
  gun-cotton, which are aseribable to the liquid nature of the explosive
  material.    The dynamite used was in the form of compressed rolls or
  cylinders, similar in firmness or solidity to stiff but not very plastic clay.

  (12-8 metres) in length, were detonated by means of a
  of the kind used with gun-cotton,         which   was  inserted  into a small
  cylinder of gun-cotton, or into a small cartridge of dynamite, and placed
  upon one extremity of the train.            The rate at which detonation
  was transmitted     ranged between 19,500 and 21,600 feet (5928 and
  6566 metres) per second ; it was therefore decidedly higher than with
  compressed gun-cotton.         The separation of the individual cartridges
  or cylinders by spaces of 0-5 inch (-013 metre) produced, however, a
  very much greater retarding effect than was the case with a sepa
  ration to the same extent of masses of compressed gun-cotton ; the

(5179-9 metres) per second. When nitroglycerine
pure and, therefore, liquid state, detonation being established at one ex
tremity of the trains by means of a cartridge of dynamite, the mean rate
at which it was transmitted was only about 5500 feet (1672 metres)
per second, the same result being obtained in two experiments, in
                                                                              one of
which the quantity of nitroglycerine, in a given length of the train, was
 double that employed in the other*.           It may be possible that, by very
 greatly increasing the quantity of nitroglycerine used, the rate of trans
 mission of detonation would be increased ; but there is no doubt that the
 mobility and elasticity of the liquid, and the consequent facility with
 which it yields to mechanical force when unconfined, act antagonistically
 to the transmission of detonation in a mass of freely exposed nitrogly
 cerine.     The author hopes that he may have the means and opportunity
 of extending these interesting experiments, by ascertaining the effect of
 confinement, both of nitroglycerine and gun-cotton, on the transmission
 of detonation along continuous masses of the explosive agent.
     The numerical details given in the memoir afford proof of the trust
 worthiness of the results obtained in the velocity determinations, and of
 the uniform rate at which detonation is transmitted along rows of con
  siderable length, composed of distinct masses of the explosive material,
  even when these are separated from each other by spaces.               With trains
  12-16 metres to 15-20 metres (40 to 50 feet) in length, the rate at which
  detonation travelled along the last few feet was equal to that observed in
  the first portion of the train. This was not the case with the transmission
  of detonation through      tubes to widely separated masses of gun-cotton.      The
  time intervening between the detonation of the initiative charge at one
  extremity of the tube and that of the first distinct charge (separated by a
   space of 3 feet 3 inches, or 1 metre) was somewhat variable, and ranged
  between 10,000 and 13,000 feet (3000 to 3900 metres) per second ; the
  subsequent transmission, from charge to charge, along the tubes proceeded
  at a tolerably uniform but considerably reduced rate, the average being
   1800 metres (6000 feet) per second. In one experiment, with reduced
   charges, the detonation was transmitted, as usual, to the first three separate
   masses ; but the fourth and succeeding charges, though they exploded, did
   not detonate ; the tube containing them was uninjured at those parts, but
   the wires were severed at the seat of each charge, and the records ob-

   sponded to that used in certain of the gun-cotton experiments, in which the rate of
   transmission of detonation ranged between 18,000 and 21,000 feet.

   tained indicated that the explosion was transmitted from charge to charge
   at the rate of between 450 and 640 metres (1500 and 1800 feet) per
   second.   These experiments with tubes showed that, when the relations
   between the amount of explosive material, the diameter of the tube, and
   the space intervening between the charges are such as to ensure the
  transmission   of detonation, its rate is about one third of that at which it
  travels along a continuous mass, or continuous row of distinct masses, of
  the same material.
      The concluding    part of this memoir deals with a subject only inci
  dentally referred to in the former memoir on explosive agents, and which
  has since that time acquired        considerable    importance — namely, the
  manner in which the accumulation of heat in a mass of explosive ma
  terial, and other conditions, may operate in bringing about or promoting
 violent explosion or detonation.

 I. " Note     on the Synthesis of Formic Aldehyde."               By Sir B. C.
           Bkodie, Bart., F.R.S. Received February 5, 1874,
     In  a former note    I  communicated     to the Society the result of an
experiment     in which   a mixture   of equal (or nearly equal) volumes of
hydrogen and carbonic oxide had been submitted,           in the induction-tube,
to the electric action. My expectation in making the experiment had
been that the synthesis of formic aldehyde would be thus effected accord
ing to the equation CO+H„= COHa. The only permanent gas, however,
other than the gases originally present in the induction-tube,              which
appeared in the result of the experiment was marsh-gas.             When a mix
ture of hydrogen and carbonic acid gas was similarly operated upon, the
 same    hydrocarbon,  together  with carbonic oxide, was formed.          I  have
now, however,     succeeded, by a  modification  in the  conditions  of the  latter
experiment, in attaining the object which           I  originally had in view.
Evidence of this is afforded by the following analysis : — The gas analyzed
 was the result of submitting to the electric action about equal volumes of
 hydrogen and carbonic acid. After removal from the gas of carbonic acid
 and carbonic oxide, and also of a trace of oxygen, 191-2 volumes of gas
remained, in which were found, at the conclusion of the analysis, 2-6
volumes of nitrogen. Deducting this amount of nitrogen, 188-6 volumes
of gas remain, containing the residual hvdrogen in the gas, together with
                                                                    o 2

any gases besides carbonic oxide formed in the experiment.         This  gas
was analyzed by the addition of oxygen and subsequent detonation          by
the electric spark, the absorption of the carbonic acid by potash, and   the
removal of the oxygen over by pyrogallate of potash.      The results of the
analysis entirely concur with the assumption that the 188-G volumes of
gas were constituted of hydrogen, marsh-gas, and formic aldehyde in the
proportions given below : —
                 Hydrogen                               183-2

    Another experiment was attended with similar results, only that the
 proportion of marsh-gas was somewhat greater.
    The result of this experiment may be considered to be given in the
 equation C02+2H2=COH2+H20.             I have reason to believe that formic
 aldehyde is also formed in the reaction of hydrogen and carbonic oxide,
 and that the marsh-gas found (in both experiments) results from the
 decomposition of this substance, possibly according to the equation
 2COH2==C02+CH4.          I do not now dwell upon this subject, as it is
 my intention very speedily to lay before the Society, together with other
 matters, the details of the various experiments which      I have made in
 reference to it.
 II. "On      the Influence of Brandy on the Bodily Temperature,
        the Pulse, and the Respirations of Healthy Men." By E. A.
        Parkes, M.D., F.R.S., Professor of Hygiene, Army Medical
        School.    Received November 29, 1873.
     In the Proceedings of the Royal Society (Nos 120, 123, and 130) the
 details of experiments are given which show that in two healthy men
 pure ethyl alcohol, brandy, and claret, given at intervals during the day,
 produced no effect on the temperature of the body as measured in the
 axilla and rectum.
     This result is in accordance with the experiments of several other
  observers, while there are some experimenters who have noticed a de
  crease in temperature in healthy men after the use of alcohol.     In some
  cases of disease in men and in some healthy animals alcohol has caused,
  it would seem, a decided lessening of temperature.

1874.]         Influence      of Brandy      on the    Bodily Temperature        eye.     173
   These differences of statement               led me to conceive that the time when
the alcohol was given might have some effect.
   In the experiments formerly reported to the Royal Society, alcohol
was usually given either with or at no long interval from food.                            As
food raises the temperature of the body, it occurred to me that it might
mask an opposite action of the alcohol ; and                   I therefore determined to
repeat the experiments, and to give the alcohol about four hours after a
moderate breakfast, when the heating-effect of the food had gone off,
and when digestion              was completed,       and also to give      it in  a state of
complete inanition.
                    I. Experiments after tlie completion of Digestion.
   The subject of the observations is a strong healthy soldier, T. B., aged
25, height 5 feet 8| inches, weight (naked) 67-46 kilogrammes, or 148 lbs.
He    has at times        drunk   some   quantity of spirits, but not for the last two
or three years, and usually takes about two or three pints of beer daily.
   The course of the experiments was as follows : — His breakfast was
taken at 6.30, was finished every day by 7 a.m. ; he took for breakfast
8 ounces of bread, | ounce of butter, and 17 fluid ounces of tea with sugar
and with 3 ounces of milk. Immediately after breakfast he went to bed
again, and did not get out of the recumbent position for any purpose
until 2 o'clock. He then dined on 12 ounces of beefsteak, 4 ounces of
bread, and 8 ounces of water.
   After dinner he took exercise and smoked, had tea (same food as at
breakfast) at 0, and a glass of water at 9 p.m., when he went to bed.
He took daily precisely the same diet and quantity of water.
   Thermometers (tested for accuracy and exactly corresponding) were
placed in the axilla and rectum at G o'clock, and, except at breakfast, they
were removed only for the purpose of being read at first every 30 and
then every 15 minutes, and were at once replaced, until 2 o'clock, after
which time the temperatures were only taken every two hours.
   After several days' preliminary examination (during which                        time    he
took no alcohol) the experiments were commenced and carried on for six
days without alcohol ; then during five days undiluted brandy containing
50 per cent, of absolute alcohol was given once daily, viz. at 11 a.m., four
hours after breakfast.
   On the first day one fluid ounce of brandy ( = £ ounce of alcohol) was
given, on the second day two ounces, on the third day four ounces, on
the fourth day six ounces (=3 ounces of alcohol), and on the fifth day
also six ounces.           I had intended to give him eight ounces on the fifth
day, but the brandy made him so ill, he begged me not to increase the
quantity*.
   * The     effect  of the six ounces of brandy taken in this way at one time and without
water was entirely to destroy appetite,       so that he could not force   himself to take his
food  ; it also  caused a great feeling  of depression, sickness, and headache, and increased
the flow of urinary water very largely for three        hours.   The nitrogenous elimination

   2nd. The mean temperature of the periods.
   3rd. The range of the thermometer from 1 1 to 2 o'clock                ;   i. e. the differ
 ence between the 11 o'clock and the 2 o'clock temperatures.

178                            Dr. E. A. Parkes             on the                     [Feb. 12,
     1. Mean Temperature           of the  fourteen hours wlien the man was under
                                           observation.
   144 observations in tho water days give a mean daily temperature in
the axilla of 97o-9, and 137 observations in the brandy days give a mean
daily temperature of 97o-71. In the rectum the observations were 144
and 138 respectively, giving a mean daily rectum temperature of 98°-89
in the non-brandy and 98°'78 in the brandy days.
   This difference is so slight as to fall within the range of unavoidable
error ; but it might be that the effect of the brandy was only perceptible
for a short time. It is necessary then to take the temperature of the
periods.

   The differences, especially in the case of the rectum mean tempera
tures, are slight even in the hours between 11 and 2.                             In every case,
 however, the mean      of   the    thermometer         is   lower,   though    to  a very slight
extent, in the alcoholic series.              This, however, is not conclusive, as will
be evident from a consideration of the mean rectum temperatures on the
 several days.

   Ou four of the brandy days the mean temperatures were quite equal
to four of the non-brandy days ; on one day (6 ounces of brandy) the
mean was, however, only 98o-34, or 0o,22 below tho lowest temperature of
a water day.       But this was accidental, and was owing to the thermometer
getting imbedded in a mass of fmces, which separated it from the intestinal
wall. For fear of spoiling the experiment, the man would not move
though he greatly wished to do so.                 That this was the real cause of tho
diminution in this mean, is shown by tho last day's experiment, when
with the same quantity of brandy the temperature was higher than on
four of the water days, and was 0°-l above the mean of the six water
days.    It seems therefore very difficult to conclude from the mean
rectum temperature of the period that there was an actual fall.
   In the period from 2 to 10 the mean brandy temperature was 0°-27
lower than in the water period.                   But as the observations were much
fewer at this time and were taken at much longer intervals, and as food and
exercise complicated the results, little importance can be attached to them.
   Although the mean temperatures do not, then, give a satisfactory answer
to the inquiry, it may be that an effect may be found in the initial and ter
minal temperatures of the 11 to 2 period.                  This is shown in the following

180                                Dr. E. A. Parkcs on the                               [Feb. 12,
    The greatest fall in these three hours of the axilla temperature on a
water day was 0°-6 Fahr. : the greatest fall on a brandy day was l0-2, and
on another day the fall was 1°, or "6 and -4 more than on any water day ;
yet on the third day of brandy, when four fluid ounces ( = 2 fluid ounces
of absolute alcohol) were taken, the difference was only 0°-2 Fahr.
    In considering the rectum temperatures it is necessary to omit the
fourth day of brandy, when impacted focal matter in the bowel evidently
lowered the reading of the thermometer.         There was no fall with one
fl uid ounce of brandy ( = | fl uid ounce or 1 cub. centim . of alcohol), a fall
                                              4
of 0o-5 with two fluid ounces ( =28-4 cub. centims. of alcohol), of only 0o,l
with four fluid ounces, and of 0o-6 with           six fluid ounces. There was there
fore no regularity with the increasing             quantity of brandy.   The greatest
fall (0°-6) was not more than occurred              on one of the water days.
   When these numbers, omitting the                fourth brandy day of the rectum
series, are submitted to calculation according to the rule given by Mr.
Galloway in his Treatise on Probability, the following results are given : —

     If
     the observations are not too few to be trusted, this calculation
shows that there was a slight fall in temperature in the three hours
following brandy.
   But it will be seen at          once both how small the      fall      is,   and how difficult
it   even yet to feel quite sure of the result.
     is                                               Taking the rectum
temperature for example,  the probable errors of result as calculated out
are 0°-ll in the water and 0o-07 in the brandy days the results in each
                                                                      ;

                                         a
and of — 0°-23 in the brandy series, or there might have only been                               a
difference of — 0o-07.
   Still, looking at all these results, and especially to the fact that the
calculation      in all cases
                is                  little against the brandy series,
                                         a                                 may            it
be concluded that in this man the brandy did produce                very slight   a
fall but that, this
     ;            if      correct, the fall could not have been more than 0c-35

    It  may probably be interesting to note the usual course of the bodily
temperature in the water period.              It was very uniform : at 6 a.m. (twelve
hours after food) the mean rectal temperature was lowest, viz. 98° ; and
it was highest at 10 at night, when it reached 100o-14, or a difference in
the twenty-four hours of 2°-14 Fahr.
                                                           I
    From the effect produced by the breakfast, infer that this course was
chiefly owing to food, and not to any peculiar effect produced by the time
of day.
    Thus the mean rectum temperature being 98° at 6 and 6.30 o'clock
a.m.,    it rose at 7 (just after a warm breakfast) to 98D,3, and continued to
rise till 9 o'clock, when it reached 99°. It continued at this point until
 10 or 10.30, when it began to fall, and at 11 was 98°-66, at 1 98°-65, and
at 2 o'clock 980-62.         Then dinner and exercise were taken, and the ther
mometer went rapidly up, being 99°-08 at 3 o'clock, 99°-42 at 4, 99°-83
at 6, 100°-10 at 8, and 100°-14 at 10. It seems fair to attribute this rise
especially to the effect of food.
    The mean axilla temperature followed exactly the same course, being
lowest (97°-36) at 6 a.m., rising after breakfast, falling again three and
three and a half hours after breakfast, and rising immediately after
 dinner and tea to its highest point, 98°-4 ; the mean diurnal difference in
 the axilla temperature was one half that of the rectal, or l°-04*.
                                          The Pulse.
    The pulse was taken on an average twenty-three times daily, from six
in the morning until ten at night, the man being always in a recumbent
position, and, in fact, being in bed until two o'clock every day. The course
of the pulse before the brandy was taken was very constant ; the number
 of beats per minute was raised by breakfast for two hours, then fell gra
 dually until dinner, and then rose greatly after dinner in consequence of
the food and exercise.

   *   It may be noticed, in reference to the rectum temperature, that it is not quit*
 correct to say, as is sometimes done, that there is no change within short periods. In
half an hour the rectum temperature has varied as much as 0o,4 Fahr., though took  I
 every precaution to place the thermometer properly and to read it with great care.
 Usually it is much less than this. The variations within short periods in the axilla
were, however, decidedly greater than in the rectum, but were seldom more than from
O'-6 to 0° 8 as a maximum.

    It will be observed that, when all the days are taken, the brandy did
 not raise the mean pulse of the whole day. It increased, however, the
 rapidity of the pulse during the three hours after it was taken, as will be
 seen from the following Table : —

   As the means of the entire day are practically the same when all the
days are taken, it is clear that the acceleration of the pulse in the three
hours succeeding the taking of the brandy must have been compensated
by a corresponding lessening of frequency afterwards ; and this is shown
by the following Table : —

   In the brandy period the mean pulse was 1-9 per minute slower in the
after part of the day, and three beats per minute slower in the morning.
The action of the single small dose of brandy in the day was to alter the
mode of working of the heart, and not to alter the amount of work done
in 24 hours, as far as this was judged of by the frequency of the pulse.
As far as frequency was concerned the compensation was perfect, and
the temporary quickening was balanced by an equal amount of subsequent
retardation.   Previous experiments indicated that when large and repeated
doses were taken, the acceleration was not thus compensated, and that
the heart beat more frequently than was natural      throughout the whole
day.     It wascertainly very interesting to see how this healthy heart
maintained its balance, and, in spite of the alteration in action forced
upon  it,accomplished in the day the same amount of work under different
conditions of diet.     Whether other healthy, and especially whether
diseased, hearts would do the same      an interesting question, as
                                                             is       also                                         is
the point whether the temporary acceleration was, in this man, useful, or
hurtful, or indifferent, to the heart.

    The respirations in this man were always extremely quick, even when
lie had been lying in bed for eighteen hours.              The variation follows closely
the changes in the pulse.           They increased after breakfast at 7 o'clock, and
then at 9.30 commenced to fall, and continued less numerous by two or
three per minute until dinner.              This meal, and the exercise which was
always taken in the afternoon, raised the number.                     The brandy seemed
to lessen the number of respirations in the period from 11 to 2 o'clock ;
the mean of this period in the anti-brandy days was 19-86 per minute,
and in the brandy period was 17*88.                This result, if it be real, showed a
difference between the pulse and respirations, the former being raised six
beats per minute on a mean of all the days, and the latter being lowered
two respirations per minute in the three hours following the brandy.
 The effect on the number of respirations was most marked in the two
days when six ounces of brandy was taken.
    Considering, however, the rather unusual frequency of the respirations in
the man and the smallness of the change,               I  hesitate to conclude that the
respirations were lessened in number, but decidedly they were not
increased.

    The following experiments were made to determine the effect of alcohol
after sixteen hours fasting : —
    A healthy man (J. S.), 5 ft. 4 in. in height, weighing '06-774 kilo
grammes, was kept in bed every day until 1 o'clock, at which time he re
ceived his first meal in the day. The last meal was taken at 6 o'clock p.m.
He was consequently fasting for nineteen hours. The axilla and rectum
temperatures were taken every half hour from 0 to 10 a.m., and every
fifteen minutes from 10 to 1 p.m., the thermometers remaining in situ,
except for the purpose of being read. The daily food was the same,
except on two days, when the brandy destroyed his appetite and he could
not quite eat his ration,

    The experiments were carried on for six days : on the first, third, and
fifth days he took no alcohol ; on the second, fourth, and sixth days he
took 6 fluid ounces of brandy, containing 36 per cent, of alcohol, at 10
o'clock; he therefore took 2-16 fluid ounces, or 61 cub. centims., of

   The mean of the three water days was 98-57, and of the three days
with brandy 98-24.
   There appears, then, to be a slight fall on the brandy days. On refer
ence to the larger Table giving the means of the periods, it will be also
noticed that in the periods from 10 to 1 in the three hours immediately
succeeding the brandy, the rectum temperature was not only lower in
two of the brandy periods, but sank twenty-six times to 98°-2 or below it,
and on one day sank to 97°-4 for more than an hour ; while in the corre
sponding periods without brandy, which include an equal number of ob
servations, it only sank three times as low as 98°-2, and never fell below
this.   In other words, out of nine hours when brandy was taken, the
temperature was at 98°-2, or below         it,
                                      during 5^ hours, while in other            9
hours without brandy, at the same time of the day, the temperature was
at 98°-2 only for of an hour, and was never lower.
                   J                                 This seems conclu
sive for whatever conditions, independent of food and movement, may
   ;
cause slight alterations in temperature (and the Tables show such con
ditions do act),    itseems impossible they should have acted twenty-six
times out of thirty-six when alcohol was taken, and only three times out
of thirty-six when alcohol was not taken.
   On tracing the rectum temperatures on the several days from            a.m.
                                                                            6
to1  p.m.,  the fall  after alcohol    well
                                      is    marked  on  the fourth day, and      is
quite perceptible on the sixth day, while on the second day     it    only ob
                                                                     is
vious for an hour, and          not
                                is   great.  The explanation of this want of
uniformity may perhaps be that the processes in the body causing varia
tions of temperature may sometimes act in the same direction with
alcohol and sometimes in the opposite, or, in other words, may sometimes
increase the fall and sometimes counteract it.
   With regard to the amount of fall, the lowest rectum temperature on
the fourth day, when the effect of alcohol was most marked, was 97°'4,
while in the hours on the same day before alcohol the lowest was 97°-8.
If the effect of alcohol        measured by this difference,
                               ia                             it   amounts to
0°-4 F.  ;   if
              it   ismeasured by the difference in the means of the two
periods, it  amounts to 0°-39 Fahr.     It seems fair to assume that 2-16 fluid
ounces, or 61 cub. centims., of absolute alcohol produced          a mean de
pression equal to        of

                             General Conclusions.
   I believe  the following conclusions       may be drawn from the observa
tions formerly recorded (Proceedings          of the Royal Society, Nos. 120,
123, and 136) and from those now laid before the Royal Society.
   1. When brandy in dietetic doses (=2-16 fluid ounces, or 61 cub.
cenrims., of absolute alcohol) was given to a healthy man fasting and at
rest, a decided, though slight lowering, of bodily temperature (as judged
of by the heat of the rectum) was caused. The amount of lowering was
under   \ a degree of Fahrenheit ; and sometimes even this amount was not
perceptible, being probably counteracted by the opposing influence of the
heat-producing changes in the body, which cause slight variations of
temperature independent of food and movement.                  The greatest effect
was produced from about one        to  two   hours   after the  alcohol was taken,
and the effect was evidently passing off in three hours.
   2.  When brandy in dietetic doses was given to a healthy man at rest
and in whom the process of digestion was completed, and whose tempe
rature raised by the food was again commencing to fall, a lessening of
temperature was also proved, but its amount was not so great ;
                                                                              it could
not have been more than 0°-35 Fahr., and may           have  been  only 0°-07    Fahr.
   3. When alcohol was given with food, with either usual or increased
exercise, no effect on temperature was perceptible, even though the
alcohol was given in large quantities, viz. from 4 to 8 fluid ounces of
absolute alcohol (114 to 227 cub. centims.) in twenty-four hours.                 It is
to be presumed that the amount          of  heat  generated    from   the  food    and
movement concealed the effect of the alcohol, which would require a more
delicate method or longer observations for detection.
   4. In no case did alcohol raise the temperature.
   5. The effect of alcohol on the pulse was uniform in the four men experi

190      Mr. J. Cottrell  on the  Division of a Sound-Wave         [Feb. 12,
mented upon.      The contractions of the heart were more frequent after
alcohol during complete rest, from five to ten beats per minute for some
time ; and when exercise was taken the increase was greater. The mean
pulse of the twenty-four hours was, however, not increased unless the
amount of alcohol was large and repeated.         In other words, the heart's
beats were less frequent than natural when the effect of the alcohol had
passed off. The pulse became both fuller and softer to the touch ; and this
relaxation of the radial artery was shown also by the sphygmograph. That
the smaller vessels were relaxed, was shown both by the redness of the
surface and by the evident ease with which the blood traversed the capil
laries, as shown by the sphygmographic tracings.
    6. The respirations were not increased in number by alcohol        ;  they
were rather lessened, and were deeper in some of the experiments         ; but
the effect was not very marked.

 IV. " On     the Division of a Sound-Wave by a Layer of Flame
       or heated Gas into a reflected and a transmitted Wave." By
       John Cottrell, Assistant in the Physical Laboratory of the
       Royal Institution.       Communicated       by Professor    Tyndall,
       F.R.S.    Received February 2, 1874.
    The incompetency of a sound-pulse to pass through non-homogeneous
 air having been experimentally demonstrated by Dr. Tyndall, and proved
 to be due to its successive partial reflections at the limiting surfaces of
 layers of air or vapour of different density, further experiments were
 conducted in order to render visible the action of the reflected sound
 wave.
    The most successful of the various methods contrived for this purpose
 consists of the following arrangement.      A vibrating bell contained in a
 padded box was directed so as to send a sound-wave through a tin
 tube, B A (38 inches long, 1| inch diameter), in the direction      BF,     its
 action being rendered manifest by its causing a sensitive flame placed at
 F' to become violently agitated.
    The invisible heated layer immediately above the luminous portion of
 an ignited coal-gas flame issuing from an ordinary bat's-wing burner

1874.]               by a      Layer of Flame or Heated Gas.                         191
was allowed to stream upwards across the end of the tin tube B A at A.
A portion of the sound-wave issuing from the tube was reflected at the
limiting surfaces of the heated layer ; and a part being transmitted
through    it,
            was now only competent to slightly agitate the sensitive
flame at   F.
   The heated layer was then placed at such an angle that the reflected
portion of the sound-wave was sent through          second tin tube, A
                                                        a               (of      F
the same dimensions as        A), its action being rendered visible
                                   B                                     its        by
causing    asecond sensitive flame  placed  at the end  of the tube  at   to        F
become violently affected.     This action continued so long as the heated
layer intervened    but upon its withdrawal the sensitive flame placed at
                     ;
F', receiving the whole of the direct pulse, became again violently agi
tated, and at the same moment the sensitive flame at                  F, ceasing to      be
affected, resumed its former tranquillity.
   Exactly the same action takes pla.ce when the luminous                  portion of     a
gas-flame     made the reflecting layer
               is                            but in the experiments above
                                               ;
described, the invisible layer above the flame only was used.   By proper
adjustment   of the  pressure  of the gas, the flame at F' can be rendered

I. " On    the Absorption of Carbonic Acid by Saline Solutions."
        By J.Y. Buchanan, Chemist on board H.M.S. ' Challenger.'
        Communicated  by Prof. Williamson, For. Sec. R.S. Re
        ceived December 11, 1873.
                                   (Abstract.)
  Until lately it was believed that the atmospheric            gases   dissolved    in
sea-water could be extracted from           it,
                                     as from fresh water,              by   boiling in
vacuo.  The merit of the discovery that such     not the case
                                                      is        due to      is
Dr. Jacobsen, of Kiel, who found that, in order to drive out the whole
of the carbonic acid, the water must be evaporated almost to dryness,
and that no amount of boding tn vacuo will suffice to eliminate it. Being
particularly interested in the matter, immediately commenced
                                            I                       series   a
of experiments    to determine,   if   possible, the salt or salts to which        sea-
water owes this property.
   Preliminary observations satisfied me, in the first place, that sea-water
has this property, and, secondly, that solutions of the sulphates of mag
nesia and of lime possess the same property.        In order to gain more
precise information, two series of experiments were made, the one ana
lytical, the other synthetical. The former consisted in saturating saline
solutions with carbonic acid, and then distilling them, the carbonic acid
passing in the various fractions being determined      the latter, in deter
                                                           ;
mining the absorption coefficients of two solutions, the one of sulphate of
magnesia, the other of sulphate of lime.
   First, the analytical series. — Before proceeding to saline solutions,
distilled water was saturated with carbonic acid and distilled. The first
eighth of the distillate contained abundance, the second     trace, and the
                                                                  a
remainder no carbonic acid.       It may therefore be assumed, in the ex
periments   which  follow, that the carbonic acid held simply in solution by
the water passes almost entirely in the first eighth of the distillate, and
that whatever passes afterwards has been retained, in some way or
other, by the salt in solution.
   Experiments were made on solutions of sulphate of magnesia, of sul
phate of magnesia and chloride of sodium, and of sulphate of lime, to
which were added some on sea-water itself.         In every experiment the
quantity of solution operated on was 300 cub. centims., which was
boiled in  a flask connected by    adoubly bored cork with    Liebig's con
                                                                  a
denser, which was fitted at its other end, air-tight, into        tubulated
                                                                       a

receiver.     To the tubulure was attached a bulbed U-tube, and, by
means of an aspirator, air could be constantly sucked through.                      The
carbonic acid coming off was retained by baryta-water of known strength
distributed between the receiver and the U-tube ; what remained unneu-
tralized was determined         by oxalic acid, the point of neutralization being
indicated     by  rosolic  acid.     The oxalic acid was rather stronger than
tenth normal; it contained 6-478 grammes CaH204+2H, O in the
litre. One litre baryta-water required 3235 cub. centims. oxalic acid for
neutralization.
    The method of conducting the operation was as follows : — Carbonic acid
was passed through the solution until it could be assumed to be satu
rated.     The object being to determine the carbonic acid retained by the
salt,  it was necessary to get rid,       as much as possible,   of the simply dis
solved gas. This was effected by drawing six or seven litres of air
through the solution cold, then heating it to boiling, and allowing it to
boil for a couple of minutes in a current of air. The receiver, with the
baryta solution, was then attached, and the distillation continued in a
current of air, until the contents of the flask were nearly dry. The.
amount of carbonic acid was given by the remaining alkalinity of the
baryta-water.
    Experiments       on    sulphate-of-magnesia     solution,     containing      12-3
grammes crystallized                          —
                            salt per litre. As all were conducted in precisely
the same way, it will be sufficient to give the results in a tabular form.
The first three experiments were made with one and the same solution ;
for the last two     a fresh   solution, prepared, to all appearance, in exactly
the same way as the previous one, was used. The difference in the results
shows the precarious nature of the combination.

    Two experiments were made with a solution prepared as follows : —
The quantity of sulphuric acid necessary for the formation of 12-3
grammes crystallized sulphate of magnesia was diluted to a litre, and pul
verized carbonate of magnesia suspended in it. Although the mixture
was allowed to stand over night, shut off from the influence of the
atmosphere, the solution was still very acid.          It is well known that car
bonate of magnesia is difficultly soluble in cold dilute acids.               To have
heated the solution would have frustrated the object of the experiment,
which was, by bringing nascent sulphate of magnesia together with

 194                  Mr.     J.  Y. Buchanan          on the Absorption         of         [Feb. 19,
 nascent carbonic acid at ordinary temperatures, to give them the best
 opportunity of combining.                 Two experiments were made with a simi
 larly prepared solution of sulphate of lime. In this case sulphuric acid
 was added to the water in quantity sufficient to form, with bme, more
 salt than would dissolve in the Uquid.                       Here neutralization took place
 without difficulty ; and, as might have been expected, the amount of
carbonic acid found was considerably greater than in the case of the
 magnesia salt.
    Two experiments              were made with an ordinary sulphate-of-magnesia
 solution, containing 2-05 grammes crystallized salt per litre.
    Two further experiments were made with a solution containing 2*05
 grammes sulphate of magnesia and 20 grammes chloride of sodium per
litre. All were conducted in the way described above, and the results
are given in the following Table.                    The experiments with the carbonates
of magnesia and of lime were made at a considerably later date than the
others ; the value of 10 cub. centims. baryta-water had in consequence
become equivalent to 32-0 cub. centims. instead of 32-34 cub. centims.

immediately        to  the    same   treatment      as  the saline solutions ; in the last two
carbonic acid was first passed through it for some time.                            As the results
are identical, it is evident that, in its natural state, the water in question

1874.]                  Carbonic Acid by Saline Solutions.                            195
    From the large amount of organic matter poured into the Forth in the
neighbourhood of Portobello, there must be an abundant production of
carbonic acid in the water itself ; and we have seen above the effect of
bringing it together in the nascent state with sulphate of lime. Sea-
water contains on an average about 8 parts sulphate of lime in 10,000.
A saturated solution of the same salt in distilled water contains, at
15° C, 24 parts in 10,000.            Under the most favourable circumstances,
then, sea- water might be expected to bind about one third of the quantity
retained by an equal volume of saturated gypsum solution.                        We have
seen that a litre of this solution is capable of retaining 0-338 grm. CO,,
while the same volume of sea-water contained at the most only 0-07
grm., or very little more than one fifth of that held by the sulphate of lime.
     In ocean-water        I have never yet found more than 0-064 grm. CO,
 per litre, including both simply dissolved and half bound. We have, then,
 in the sulphate of lime alone an agent capable of retaining much more
 carbonic acid than is usually found to exist in sea-water ; and there is
 besides the sulphate of magnesia ; so that whatever may be the function
 of the other salts, we do not, in order to find a vera causa for the phe
 nomenon under consideration, require to go beyond the sulphates ; and
 the practical lesson to be learned is that, if we get quit of the sulphates,
 the carbonic acid will be more easily disengaged by heat.
     This is entirely borne out by experiment.                In determining the car
 bonic acid in sea-water,       I always add to it a sufficient quantity of a satu
 rated solution of chloride of barium ; and             I   find that, after about the
 first fifth of the distillate has passed, there is rarely a perceptible tur
 bidity in fresh baryta-water.
      The synthetical experiment consisted in determining directly the
  coefficients of absorption of a 1-23 per cent, solution of crystallized
  sulphate of magnesia and of a 0-205 per cent, solution of Ca S04
  + 2H20. In Table I. the results of experiments on the magnesia so
  lution are given, where the observations were made without loss of time.
  In Table II. the results of experiments on the same solution are
  given, only here the duration of the reaction was taken into account.
  The first reading was made at the highest pressure after the gas and
  solution had been together for nine days ; the pressure was then succes
  sively reduced, and the other readings made at intervals of twenty-two,
  forty-one, and twenty-five hours from each other, the last of all being
   made only after the lapse of some days.             Table    III.  gives the results of
   experiments on the gypsum solution, the readings in this case being

II. " On        an Instrument for the Composition                           of two Harmonic
         Curves." By A. E. Donkin, M.A., F.R.A.S., Fellow of Exeter
         College, Oxford. Communicated by W. Spottiswoode, Treas.
         R.S.        Received November        6,    1873.
  The interest in such compound curves lies in the fact that as    simple                        a
harmonic curve may be considered to be the curve of pressure on the
tympanic membrane when the ear       in the neighbourhood of
                                             is                 vibrating                    a
body producing    simple tone, so a curve compounded of two such simple
                        a
harmonic curves will be the curve of pressure for the consonance of the
two tones which they severally represent, and thus the effect on the ear
of different consonances can be distinctly represented to the eye.
   If the motion of       point be compounded of rectilinear harmonic

to the direction of those vibrations, the point will describe      simple                        a
harmonic curve.
  Thus   pencil-point performing such vibrations upon
           a                                              sheet of paper           a
moving uniformly at right angles to their direction would  draw such a
curve.
  The     samekind of curve would also be drawn                       by
                                                        keeping the pencil
fixed and       by
              giving to the paper, in addition to its continuous transverse

vibrations in a given time of the pencil and paper, and which will be the
curve of pressure for the interval corresponding to this ratio.
   The manner in which these three motions are combined in the machine
is as follows : — Two vertical spindles, A and
                                                  B, revolving in a horizontal
  plate carry at their lower ends each a crank, C and D, and at their upper
  ends each a wheel cut with a certain number of teeth ; these two wheels
  can be connected by means of an intermediate one, as is seen in the figure :
  and since either wheel of the pair can be replaced by another with a different

number of teeth, the relative angular velocities of the spindles can be regu
lated at pleasure. The paper upon which the curve is to be drawn is carried
upon a rectangular frame, E F 0- H, capable of sliding horizontally up and
down in a direction parallel to that of the plane passing through the spin
dles. This frame has a pair of rollers, E F and G H, at each end connected
by tape-bands, between which the paper passes as the rollers turn. In order
to give a motion of revolution to the rollers, a wheel, L, is fixed upon the
axis of one of them whose teeth gear into those of a pinion, P Q, along
side which the frame slides, and which is itself driven by one of the
vertical spindles. A connecting-rod, D M, is carried to the frame from the
crank of this spindle, so that upon turning the latter a vibratory motion
is given to the former ; and since the transverse motion of the paper also
depends upon the same spindle, a fixed pencil-point resting on it would
draw a simple harmonic curve whose amplitude would depend on the
radius of the crank, and wave-length on the transverse speed of the paper,
which can be regulated at pleasure by means contrived for the purpose*.
   A vibratory motion similar and parallel to that of the frame is given
to a small tubular glass pen, E, so arranged as to move with its point
lightly resting upon the paper. This motion is communicated by a con
necting-rod, C N, from the other crank, which is carried underneath the
sliding-frame and jointed to the lower end of a small vertical lever, S, to
whose upper end the arm carrying the pen is attached.
   The weight W serves to regulate the pressure of the pen on the paper,
as it can be screwed in or out.             T is merely a pillar upon which the
change-wheels can be placed for convenience.
   If the pair of wheels on the spindles are now connected by the inter
mediate one, it is plain that, upon turning either of the spindles by a
winch provided for the purpose, the two motions of the paper will be
combined with that of the pen, and the curve drawn will be that com
posed of the two simple harmonic ones, which would be the result of
separately combining the harmonic vibrations due to each crank with the
transverse motion of the paper. Thus if m and n are the numbers of teeth on.
the pair of wheels respectively, the equation to the resultant curve will be
                                  ?/= sin mar+sin nx.
This equation implies that not only are the radii of the cranks the same,
but also that they start parallel to each other and at right angles to the
vertical plane passing through their axes : both these conditions can, how
ever, be altered ; and therefore the general form of equation to the curves
which the machine can draw            will  be
                         y=a sin (mx+a) + b sin (nx + (3),
   *  It should be observed here that the vibratory motion thus given to the frame is not
truly harmonic.    In order to make it so, a more complicated contrivance than the simple
crank and connecting-rod would have to be adopted ; but this would probably introduce,
through unavoidable play, an error greater than the present one, the length of the con
necting-rods and the small size of the cranks rendering the latter nearly inappreciable. The
motion will, however, for the sakeof convenience, be considered truly harmonic
                                                                                 throughout

where a and    b are the radii of the cranks, and a and       f}  are dependent
on their relative inclinations to the above-mentioned          vertical plane at
starting.
   As an example, suppose that a=6, while the ratio of m to n is as 2 to 1 ;
then the above equation will represent the curve of pressure for the octave.
Similarly, if m is to n as 16 to 15, the resultant curve represents the effect
on the ear of a diatonic semitone, while the ratio 81 to 80 would give
that of the comma. In both these curves, and more especially in the
latter, the beats which would ensue on actually sounding the two tones
together are shown with remarkable distinctness.
   As the machine is provided with a set of change-wheels, many different
curves can be produced, while the form of each can be more or less
changed by altering the relative positions of the cranks before bringing
the idle wheel into gear. It is also possible to obtain very large values
of m and n in the above equation by using two idle wheels on the same
axis which shall come into gear, the upper one with the wheel on the one
spindle, the lower one with that on the other.
   Thus, suppose A and B are the numbers of teeth on the spindle-wheels
respectively, C and D those on the idle wheels, and let A gear with C
                        tn    BC
and D with    B ; then — =        .   Now, by properly choosing the four
wheels, large values of m and n may be obtained.       If, for  instance, A=81,

corresponding curve will represent the effect of an octave slightly out of
tune. The period of such curves as these being very long, it is necessary
to have a good supply of paper ; and this is arranged by carrying a reel-
full on the horizontal  frame, from which     it is slowly unwound between
the rollers. The rate at which this takes place has a good deal of influ
ence on the form of the resultant curve ; the slower it is the more com
pressed will the latter appear.     Instead of using paper, the curves, pro
vided the periods are short enough, may be drawn on slips of blackened
glass, which can be carried along between the tapes connecting the rollers ;
they can be at once placed in a lantern and thrown on a screen.
   The width of contour of any curve depends on the radii of the cranks ;
 these may have any value between 0 and half an inch, and therefore the
limit of possible width at any part will be two inches ; so also, by altering
the radii, a series of curves may be produced corresponding to the con
sonances of tones not of the same intensities.      Since the maximum width
of any curve will be double the sum of the radii of the cranks, the paper
is cut to a width of two and a half inches, within which all curves which
can possibly be drawn will be comprised.
   The instrument is constructed by Messrs. Tisley and Spiller, of
Brompton Boad, to whom some improvement upon the original model
is due.

         Received December 2, 1873*.
    The following Table, iu reality the joint production of the Rev. George
Salmon,        F.R.S., and myself, was commenced, and indeed nearly com
pleted, before either calculator was distinctly aware that Burckhardt,
Jacobi, or Desmarest had written or published any thing on the same
subject.        This fact is perhaps to be regretted ; but it has led to the in
dependent recalculation, by two different methods, both of Burckhardt' s
( Jacobi's Table is professedly a reprint of Burckhardt's) and of Desmarest's
Table, and has resulted in the detection of several errors, which have, as
far   as  I know,       never before been pointed out.           These errors, in the first
place regarded            as   discrepancies,   have   been  carefully examined ; in fact
every case has been reworked by me, with the view of either proving or
disproving the accuracy of such numbers as differ from those in our
Table.        The result is, that such discrepancies are found to be errors both
in Burckhardt and Desmarest.                   The two lists of errors are given below.
    I  now proceed to give the theorems used, and some account of the
means employed by me in forming the Table.
    Let P be any prime number, except 2 and 5. Then, from Fermat's
                             iop-1
theorem, we have — p— =1 ; or, adopting the usual notation, 10?-1=1.
    Again, since the number of figures in the period of the reciprocal of
all primes is not P—              1 (or, in other words, since 10 is not a primitive
root of all primes),
                p-i

I. "The Winds of Northern India, in                    relation to the Temperature
       and Vapour-constituent of the Atmosphere." By Henry P.
       Blanford, F.G.S., Meteorological Reporter to the Government
       of Bengal.        Communicated by Major-General                Strachey, R.E.
       Received May 25, 1873.
                                       (Abstract.)
   The object of this paper is to describe the normal wind-currents of
.Northern India, and their annual variation, and to trace out their origin
and causes,      so far as these can be discovered in the local physical
changes     of the   atmosphere.      After referring to the data on which his
conclusions     are based, the author goes on to describe the winds of the
principal geographical regions of North India in detail.
                            Part I.   Description     of Winds.
    1.  The  Punjab. — Asa      rule currents from the vest ward predominate on
an average throughout the year ; and this is also found to be the case in
other parts of North India.            In the most northern part of the Punjab,
westerly winds prevail in the cold and hot dry months, easterly in the
rainy months.         In   the central    districts    northerly winds preponderate
over     southerly,   having in the cold months a westerly tendency, but
drawing     round    to  the north-east as the hot weather comes on, while as
the rainy season sets in the winds tend to east and south-east, returning
to west after the rain ceases in September.                In the southern part of the
                  \
Punjab (and. this is also the case in Sindh) easterly winds never prevail,

1874.]                    Winds of Northern India.                       211
and southerly, south-westerly, and north-westerly winds predominate —
the two former in the rainy months, the last in the cold and hot dry
season.    In   the coldest months the wind veers towards the north, and
occasionally passes a little to the east of north.
    2. The Gangetic Plain. — The great chain of the Himalaya, which skirts
the northern edge of this region, the elevation of which is between 150
feet above sea-level on the east and 900 feet on the west, determines in a
great measure the direction of its prevailing winds ; and those from the
north-west and south-east much exceed those from other quarters.           In
the western part of the plain the north-westerly winds somewhat exceed
the easterly.     In the eastern part the converse holds good. The change
from the westerly to the easterly direction accompanies the change from
the hot and dry season to the rains, and from easterly to westerly that
from the rains to the cold season. In the districts more remote from the
mountains     the tendency to a westerly direction increases, and occasional
 south-west winds blow, apparently caused by incursions from the Arabian
 Sea.   During the hot months, and during the day, the westerly winds
 blow with great force, falling at night ; calms are a characteristic of the
 nights, and prevail most in the colder months.    As the hot season advances
 the easterly winds become more frequent, and attain their maximum in
 July, when the rain becomes general. The winds veer from the west
 through the north to east and south-east, the opposite change being more
 abrupt, and at one place of observation apparently retrograde.
    3. Plateau of liajpootana. —This region is somewhat elevated above the
 Gangetic plain, varying from 800 or 900 feet to 1800 feet above the sea-
 level.  Winds from the west and south-west greatly exceed those from
 other quarters in the southern districts, commencing as early as February
 and continuing till November, when they are replaced by northerly and
 north-easterly winds.     The north-east winds are comparatively weak and
 unsteady, and interrupted by calms.        A similarity to the winds of the
 Southern Punjab may      be observed.   The  northern part of the plateau of
 Eajpootana partakes more of the character of the Gangetic plain in its
 winds, the winds     of the hot season being chiefly westerly and north
 westerly ; but the rainy season is accompanied by south-westerly winds,
 and not by easterly winds as in the Gangetic plain ; and easterly winds
 are always rare.
    4. Central India. — This region is on an average somewhat less elevated
 than that last referred to ; it is traversed by the high land known as the
 Satpoora range, and is otherwise considerably broken up into valley and
 mountain,   so   that the winds are more influenced by merely local con
 ditions than in the less hilly regions before noticed.    Westerly winds on
 the whole prevail.      In  the  hot  months   westerly and north-westerly
 winds predominate. Local inroads of south-westerly winds occur during
 the rainy months on the north of the Satpoora range, and less strongly
 on the south of the range ; as the rainy season ceases the winds veer

212                    Mr. H. F. Blanford      on (he              [Feb. 26,
through west to north and north-east, which direction is dominant after
November till January, when the northerly tendency fails and southerly
winds blow, which again pass into the westerly winds of the hot months.
This region participates in the characteristics both of the plains of
Northern India and of the Peninsula, which last is under the influence
of the true south-west and north-east monsoons.             During the cold
months and the rainy season respectively, when the two great monsoons
are at their height, the winds of the Central India plateau are from the
north-east and south-west, while those of the Gangetic plain are from
the north-west and south-east, the former blowing to or from the Arabian
or Western Sea, the latter to or from the Bay of Bengal, or Eastern Sea.
Only in the hot season do the winds approximate, blowing from the dry
region to the north-west towards the thermal focus of Central India and
Western Bengal.
   5.  Western  Bengal. — This region includes the continuation of the
plateau of Central India to the margin of the delta of the Ganges, and
descends to the Bay of Bengal.        The northern part, beipg a compara
tively open tableland, participates greatly as to its winds in the characters
of the neighbouring Gangetic plain.       The west and north-west winds of
the cold months are followed by south-west and south winds, which draw
round to south-east during the rainy season, again reverting to north
west through west.      Occasional incursions of the south-west monsoon
are felt, which are perceptible in the Gangetic valley.     On the coast the
winds are very different.    The west and north-west winds of the interior
are quite subordinate.     North and north-east winds begin in October,
when   the south-west   monsoon   ceases, becoming more northerly with the
increasing cold and the strengthening of the land-winds of the interior.
Later they again veer towards the east ; and the sea-winds blow from
south-east in January, and ultimately from the south-west.        After Sep
tember the winds fall back rapidly through south-east and east to north
east.   At places removed from the coast the wind is more westerly than
on the coast.
   6.  Gangetic Delta. — From its position this region is swept by the
currents of air passing between the Gangetic plain and the equatorial
ocean. The general course of the winds is as follows : — The winter
monsoon becomes well established in November, blowing nearly from the
north on the east of the Delta, and from north-west on the west ; near
the sea the direction is a little east of north. As the season advances
the wind draws round towards the west, where it is about February, and
eventually backs by south-west to south and south-east, in which direc
tion it blows during the rainy season and till September. In October
the winds are chiefly easterly, but unsteady and apt to be stormy, alter
nating with calms in the earlier part of the month, and passing into
north and north-west in the latter part.
   7. Assam. — The local configuration     of this valley no doubt affects its

1874.]                      Winds of Northern India.                       213
winds, forming, as it does, an open passage for the monsoons to pass to
and from the region north of the Himalaya. The winter monsoon begins
in October, when north and north-east winds blow with great steadiness
till January, after which westerly winds are felt, chiefly blowing from
the south-west,     till in June they predominate and continue till Septem
ber, when they in turn give way to the easterly winds. On the whole
the characteristic of Assam is the prevalence of easterly winds, which is
here as conspicuous        as that of the westerly   winds over the Gangetic
plain and Punjab.
    8. Ardkan     Coast. — The   observations in this region are limited to
places on the coast. The northerly winds begin in October, with occa
sional north-west wind, continue till March, or a month later than in the
Gangetic     delta, after which they work round to the southward, and at
length to south-east by south, which is the normal mean direction of the
wind along this coast during the south-west monsoon.               This mean
direction   is varied at all times of the year by the land and sea breezes.
The changes of the monsoons occur sensibly later on the southern parts
of the coast than on the northern        ; also the southerly winds attain less
easting, and the northerly winds less westing, in the south than in the
north.    In August a sudden drawing of the wind towards the west is
observable on this coast (and is also discernible in Bengal and the North
west Provinces of India), followed by a return to the eastward, due
apparently to the influence of the true south-west monsoon of the
Arabian    Sea, then at its height.
    Summary.   — From      the foregoing it will be seen that the winds of
Northern India are very different from those of the adjacent seas. In
stead of two monsoons from the north-east and south-west alternately
prevailing    during about equal periods of the year, we find rather three
distinct  seasons    in which special winds prevail, the directions of which
mainly depend on the directions and relative positions of the mountain-
ranges and plains.
    During the cold-weather months, November to January, light westerly
and northerly winds blow from the plaius of Upper India down the
valleys of the Ganges and Indus, and across the tableland of Central
India, and join into the north-east monsoon of the Peninsula.              The
easterly winds of the valley of Assam add to this current.
    In April and May, as the hot weather comes on, the winds of Northern
India become more westerly and powerful, and take the form of the hot
winds, which are not continuous but diurnal, blowing till sun-down and
then followed by calms, and prevailing to the eastern limits of the
Gangetic delta.       At the same time southerly winds are commencing on
the coast, and are felt from Sindh across to Bengal, but only at intervals,
and feebly except near the sea.
    In June the south-west monsoon, being established in the equatorial
ocean, sets in round both coasts of the peninsula, penetrates up the
                      »

214                       Mr. H. F. Blanford         on the               [Feb. 26,
valleys of the Indus, the Nerbudda, and Taptee, carrying a west or
south-west current over Central India, and from the Bay of Bengal
pouring up the funnel-shaped opening occupied by the Gangetic delta,
whence turning westward it passes up the Gangetic valley towards the
Punjab, which seems to be the limit of the south-easterly winds, in
Afghanistan the dominant winds being westerly even during the summer
months.     This is the period of the rainy season of Northern India.
   In October, as the south-west monsoon ceases, the southerly current is
recurved    towards    the heated region along the Coromandel coast (on
which the rainfall is till this season of the year comparatively small), and,
blowing as a south-east wind, causes the autumn rains on that coast,
which   some    writers have erroneously attributed         to the north-east mon
soon.    With the gradual cessation of the southerly winds the westerly
winds  of Northern India again begin, and the cycle of the year is thus
completed.
         Paet    II.  Relation of Winds     to other  Elements   of Climate.
   1. Temperature. — The seasons of        Northern India present three distinct
phases : — the cold  season , from the end of the rains   in September to Februa ry
or March    ;  the hot season, characterized by a dry atmosphere and great
diurnal range of temperature         ; and the rainy season, in which the tem
perature is moderately high and equable, and the air very humid.                At
the close of the rains (the end of September) the temperature of Northern
India from the Punjab to the sea is nearly uniform at about 81° or 82°.
But evaporation and radiation to          a cloudless sky soon reduce the tem
perature   of the interior below that of the maritime regions; and in
January the Punjab is about 11° colder than Bengal, the plains of the
North-west Provinces being about midway in temperature between the
two.   In March the advance of temperature in Central India has brought
out two thermal foci — one on the west in Bajpootana, and the other on
the east in the hilly tracts of Western Bengal.               In April the Central-
Indian thermal focus is well developed. The mean temperature of
Nagpore is 7° above that of Bombay, 13° above the northern Punjab,
and 6° above the coast of the Gangetic delta.              The hottest region has a
mean temperature between 85° and 90°, the Upper-Punjab and Upper-
Assam being from 75° to 77°.             In May the thermal focus has gone
further to the north-west, and lies in the northern part of the Bajpootana
plateau.     In June it has reached the Punjab, the temperature of which
continues to increase, rising to 95° and more ; while that of the south of
India begins to fall, consequent on the rains, which commence about the
middle of the month.           In July  the Punjab ranges above 90°, while the
                                                               J
greater part of Central India is below 85°. After uly the temperature
again falls, so that by the end of September it is nearly equalized all over
Northern India.
   To sum up briefly.         In the cold weather      there are two foci of mini

1874.]                    Winds  of Northern India.                        215
mum temperature,      the one in the Punjab and the other in Assam, and,
with   some  exceptions, the isothermals nearly conform to the parallels of
latitude.   In the hot months a focus of heat is formed in Central India,
round which the isotherms are bent, the temperature on the coasts and
in the northern plains being considerably lower than that of the interior.
Finally, during the rainy season the seat of highest temperature is in the
Punjab, the coolest regions then being those of the maximum rainfall,
and consisting of two tracts extending from the coasts of Bombay and
Bengal, along the course of the monsoon currents.
    The author then refers to the distribution of temperature in a vertical
direction, as ascertained from observations made at the mountain-stations.
He points out apparent anomalies in the differences of temperature due
to difference of altitude in the mountains of North-western India and
 those bordering on Bengal, and suggests, as a probable explanation, the
variation   of hygrometrical    condition of the air in the two regions,
remarking that the continual upward diffusion and condensation of water
vapour must tend to equalize the upper and lower temperatures, and that
this tendency will be the greater as the approach to saturation is closer.
The subject, however, is admitted to be one that requires further exami
 nation, and particularly with respect to the operation of nocturnal radia
 tion and diurnal absorption of heat — the remark being also made that the
 available observations give the local temperature near the surface of the
 mountains, and do not properly represent the condition of the free
 atmosphere at corresponding     elevations.
    2.  Vapour-tension, Humidity, and         Rainfall. — In the regions under
 discussion, the lowest vapour-tension          occurs   almost  everywhere in
 January, when the temperature is lowest.         The lowest mean tension for
 any month is about 0-2 inch, observed in the      Southern Punjab, the corre
 sponding minimum in Bengal being about             0-5 inch.   The increase of
 tension begins early in the districts near the    sea, and continues  regularly
 and rapidly till the setting in of the rains ;     but in the drier regions of
 the interior, where the west winds prevail         throughout the spring and
 hot-weather months, the rise of tension is slow, probably not more than
 is due to the actual rise of temperature acting on the local vapour supply.
 The increase at the commencement of the rains, in June or July, when
 the southerly winds begin to be felt, is very marked and sudden ; and
 equally so is the fall after September, when the southerly is replaced by
 the northerly current.
     As regards variation of tension due to elevation, the conclusions of
 former observers are confirmed, that the ratio of decrement follows
  generally the increase of elevation, but with a marked addition to the
 relative tensions at the higher stations in the hottest and wettest months.
     Passing to the humidity of the air, it is shown that the period of greatest
  dryness falls later in the year the greater the distance from the sea,
  measuring along the course of rain-carrying wind-current.         On the coast

216                             Mr. H. F. Blanford   on the             [Feb. 26,
of Bengal the driest month is January, the period being later as we go
inland up the Gangetic valley, till it is found in May or June in the
Punjab and North-west Provinces.
   In the western part of the G-angetic valley and the Punjab there is a
secondary minimum of dryness, which follows a converse rule to that of
the principal minimum ; that is, it falls earlier the greater the distance
from the sea in the sense before explained.   In the Punjab this minimum
is as early as September or October, shortly after the cessation of the
rains, gradually advancing till November at Benares, east of which it is
not appreciable.    Intermediate between the two minimum periods is a
secondary   or winter  maximum, evidently related to the winter rains of
the Upper Provinces, and, like the corresponding winter maximum and
rains of Europe, traceable to the descent of the equatorial (here the auti-
monsoon) current, and the low winter temperature.
   The relative humidity of the air remains pretty constant at all eleva
tions on the Himalaya, as already pointed out by Dr. Hooker and other
writers, but not including Tibet, the conditions of which are very
different.       There   are, however,   considerable
                                               exceptions to the general
rule ; and the local law of variation depends much on local conditions.
   The rainfall is next discussed. The author points out that there are
three principal seasons of rain calling for notice. The summer and early
autumn rains (that        is,
                       those of the south-west monsoon, or of tlie rainy
season commonly so called) are the most important.        In Bengal they
begin on an average about the middle of June, with  fall of from to 15
                                                              a             9
inches in that month.     In the Upper Provinces they are later, and in
Eajpootana  there    little
                         is rain till July. Everywhere they have their
maximum in     July. In the Upper Provinces and Eajpootana very little
rain falls in October, and the rains may be said to end in the last week
of September. In Bengal and Central India the fall       still considerable
                                                                  is
in October and the rains
             ;              there  end about the middle of this last-named
month.
   The spring rains prevail in the region over which the sea winds blow
from the Bay of Bengal early in the year. In Assam and Eastern
Bengal showers are frequent in March, and in April the fall            is
                                                                        copious,
amounting,   in those  districts to windward   of the  eastern mountains,  to 12
or 14 inches in the latter month.        In Western Bengal the fall         less,
                                                                            is
and takes place   with  occasional  thunder-storms,    locally known   as north
westers, which extend as far inland as Nagpoor and Benares.
   The winter rains are received most regularly and copiously in the Punjab
and Upper Provinces, Assam, and Cachar.              In Bengal and the lower
part of the Gangetic valley they    are less regular and Ughter. They begin
at  the end of  December,     continuing  till March in the North-west Pro
vinces, and till April in the Punjab.      The fall in these districts amounts
to about    or
             4    inches during the whole season. The author considers

greatest humidity, these rains must be due to some other cause, which he
thinks to be the humidity of the anti-monsoon current.
    On the mountains the heaviest rainfall is on the lower and outer
slopes.    The greatest recorded falls are those at Cherra-Poonji over
Eastern Bengal, averaging more than 500 inches in the year. On the
Himalaya the records show falls of from 280 inches on the east to 70 or 80
inches in the North-west Provinces, and 40 to 50 inches in the Punjab.
Local circumstances of position greatly affect the quantity.
    Generally the quantity of rainfall diminishes with increase of distance
from the coast ; but it increases on approaching a hill-range on the wind
ward side when the rise is steep, while to leeward a decrease takes place,
followed eventually by another gradual increase.
   3. Atmospheric Pressure. — The available data for discussing this part of
the subject are imperfect ; and particularly the means of reducing the
pressures to the sea-level are not forthcoming in many cases.         The fol
lowing remarks are made subject to this explanation.
    The mean pressure, reduced to sea-level, in the month of October is
nearly uniform over Bengal, on both sides of the bay, in the Central
Provinces, and the Gangetic valley, with a slight tendency to a higher
pressure in the North-west Provinces and Cuttack on the one side, and
on the Arakan coast on the other, which finds its expression in the
slightly converging winds of that season.
    In the following months the pressure rises over the whole area, but most
in the North-west Provinces and Western Bengal          ; and in December an
axis   of maximum pressure lies on a line drawn from Cuttack to the
North-west Provinces in a north-west and south-east direction.            The
distribution of pressure remains much the same till the end of February.
In March a rapid fall takes place in Northern India ; but the line of
higher pressure still remains, extending now from North-western India
 across to the coast of Arakan round the delta of the Ganges.            This,
 doubtless, is the immediate cause of the back to back winds described in
Parti.
     In April, with a continued  rapid fall, a trough of low pressure becomes
 apparent, which extends from the head of the delta of the Ganges into
 Central India. In May this area of low pressure is somewhat displaced
 towards the north, occupying a line from Western Bengal to Nagpoor,
 along the 24th parallel of latitude.   In June the conditions are generally
 similar, but with much reduced pressure in the Punjab, in the north-west
 of which province the absolute minimum is probably to be found.          The
 mean difference of pressure in June between Port Blair in the Bay of
 Bengal and the upper part of the North-west Provinces is not less than
 ¦j^ of an inch, and between Port Blair and Calcutta -j^ of an inch, Cal
 cutta being about as far from Port Blair as from the head of the Gangetic
 valley, 800 miles ; the baric gradient over the Bay of Bengal, therefore, is
 about double what it is over the axis of the Ganges valley, and amounts

to  -j^ of an inch for 400 miles over the land, and        of an inch over the
sea, which     suffices to maintain the steady current of the south-west
monsoon.
    In July the minimum      of pressure is reached without important relative
change. In August a         rise begins, greater over Northern India, which
continues during September and October, when the uniformity of
pressure is once more approximately restored.
    It is apparent that the distribution of pressure follows, within certain
limits, that of temperature, in an inverse ratio of intensity. Thus the
region of high pressure in the cold months, which lies across Northern
India from Boorkee to Cuttack, coincides approximately with the area over
which the isothermals, then approximately parallel to the circles of latitude,
are bent downwards, or the temperature of which is lowest relatively to
the areas to the east and west of it. Again, during the hot half of the
year, as the isothermal lines advance, first turning their branches south
wards and leaving an area of higher temperature in Central India between
them, which eventually is inverted towards the west over the Punjab, so
a pomewhat corresponding change occurs in the lines of equal pressure,
which     at this season may be said to be distributed on lines generally
 following the meridians, but with a loop more or less deeply concave
 towards the west.
    The author then discusses at some length the manner in which these
changes of pressure arise, and to what extent they are dependent on the
changes in the proportion of aqueous vapour in the air, and concludes
that the vapour indirectly greatly influences the pressure by carrying
heat from the lower to the upper strata, and by arresting solar and ter
restrial radiation, thus equalizing the temperature of the air-column, but
that its power of changing the density, by reason of the displacement of
the heavier air-particles, is relatively small, and in some cases unimportant.
In general terms the changes of temperature are the principal causes of
the variations of pressure.
    4. Certain Effects of Winds.— Inquiry is made whether any dynamic
heating or cooling of the air can be traced by reason of winds descending
to a lower or rising to a higher level, with the conclusion that no such
effects are discernible, and that certain explanations given of the winds
of India (by other writers), based on such a conception, are erroneous.
    Evidence is adduced which is held to establish that anti-monsoon cur
 rents blow in the upper strata of the atmosphere, at the various seasons
 of the year, and at varying elevations, causing corresponding modifica
 tions in the general temperature, the operation of all winds being to dis
tribute the temperature peculiar to them. To the descent of the anti-
 monsoon current from the south, the author is disposed to attribute the
rains of the cold weather.
     Attention is also directed to the greater velocity of the wind-currents
 near the sea, the westerly winds increasing in force as they approach

 Bengal, and the south-easterly winds diminishing in force as they reach
the North-west Provinces, indicating that descending and ascending cur
rents must be formed in the upper strata, though of the return south
ward of any descending current from the north there is no direct
 evidence.

        H. N. Hennessey, F.R.A.S.             Communicated       by Professor
        G. G. Stokes, Sec. R.S.         Received December 15, 1873.
    The following experiments were made with the (new) spectroscope
 (three prisms) of the Royal Society to ascertain for this instrument the
 amount of displacement in the solar spectrum from change of tempera
 ture. The spectroscope was set up on a pillar within a small tent at a
 time of the year when the thermal range is considerable : the collimator
 was placed horizontal, and directed through a window in the tent to a
 heliostat, which was made to reflect the sun's image when required.       On
 closing the window darkness prevailed in the tent, so that the bright
 sodium lines were easily obtained from a spirit-lamp. Before commencing,
 the slit was adjusted and the spectroscope clamped ; and no movement of
 any kind was permitted in the instrument during the experiments.         The
 displacement was measured by means of a micrometer in the eye-end of
 the telescope, reading being taken (out of curiosity) successively to both
 dark and bright lines, t.    e. to  K   1002-8=Dr 'and K 1006-8=Dr A
 verified thermometer was suspended directly over and almost touching
 the prisms.    The meteorological observatory referred to was some fifty
yards    north of the tent.
    Rejecting observation 5 (in the following Table) because the thermo
meter was evidently in advance of the prisms, we deduce

    " Mt dear Sir, — As       I cannot account for what is described and drawn
in enclosed,    I hasten to place the same before you, intending to look for
 the white linss in question so soon as             I  move down to a lower altitude.
Amongst others, no doubt Kirchhoff closely examined the region in ques
tion, without notice of the lines ; and this only adds to my perplexity, un
less what     I see here is due (1) to altitude, or (2) is instrumental.               In
the latter case     I cannot account for the absence of the white lines at
Dehra, where      I  examined the spectrum generally several times ;             I  must,
 however,    add  that  without  close    examination       and   some experience, the
lines might easily be passed over.            But if instrumental, to what are they
due ?      I very much regret that the old spectroscope is not available at
 present [it had been temporarily sent elsewhere for a special object] to
                                                         "

    [In   the drawing sent by Mr. Hennessey, the intervals between the
dark lines are coloured green, except in the place of the two white
lines.     To transfer this distinction to a woodcut, an additional horizontal
band has been added below, in which only those parts of the drawing
 which are left white appear as white, while in the upper part the white
of the woodcut represents the white or green,               as the case may be,    of the
original. — G. G. S.]

222               On White Lines in the Solar Spectrum.             [Feb. 26,
    Note for diagram. — In course of studying the solar spectrum for atmo
spheric lines, with an excellent 3-prism (new) spectroscope belonging to
the Royal Society,    I gradually extended my search, begun at the red end,
until on arrival at the region about 6 my attention was attracted by the
fact that  K   1657-1 by no means appeared as the strong line depicted in
Kirchholf's map, Plate     II.   On examining this region carefully,     I was
surprised to mfi the colourless lines shown in the diagram ; these lines,
                                           I
from want of a more appropriate name, shall call white lines (or spaces) ;
they cannot absolutely be described as bright lines, yet they closely re
semble threads of white floss silk held in the light. The spectroscope in
use, with the most convenient highest-power eyepiece, presents images
of about two thirds to seven ninths of those drawn in the diagram ; the
former are exaggerated by reckoning to agree with Kirchhoff s millimetre
scale ; it will therefore be readily understood that the white lines do not
present striking objects in the spectroscope, especially about the time of
sunset, when    I happened first to notice them ; they are best seen about
noon, when their resemblance to threads of white floss silk is vgry close ;
but once seen, the lines in question can always be readily detected.         So
far as my instrumental means permit,         the wider line  extends  between
K 1657-1 and K 1658-3 ; more accurately speaking, it falls short of the
latter and rather underlies the former ; the narrower white line is under
neath K 1650-3, sensibly more of the former appearing beyond the edge
towards violet of the latter, which presents the quaint look of a black
line on a white surface enclosed in a green band.         These are the only
 white lines in the spectrum from extreme red to F ; they are not bright
                                I
 (or reversed lines), so far as have had opportunity to judge. Were they
bright lines, the question would arise, why these alone should be reversed
 at 6700 feet above sea. Like the black lines the white lines grow dim
and disappear with the slit opened wide.       As seen here, K 1657-1 is sen
 sibly  weaker  than  K  1667'4,  whereas Kirchhoff assigns 5 b to the former
 and only 3 a to the latter.

taken with the Great Melbourne Equatorial, was exhibited              ;  also a
lithograph of the Nebula in Argo, made from eye-observations         with the
 same instrument.

      OBITUARY NOTICES OF FELLOWS DECEASED.
   Archibald Smith,     only son of James Smith, of Jordanhill, Renfrew
shire, was born on the 10th of August, 1813, at Greenhead, Glasgow, in
the house where his mother's father lived.      His father, who also was a
Fellow of the Royal Society, had literary and scientific tastes with a
strongly practical turn, fostered no doubt by his education in the Uni
versity of Glasgow and his family connexion with some of the chief
founders of the great commercial community which has grown up by its
       "
side.    In published works on various subjects he left enduring monu
ments of a long life of actively employed leisure.         His discovery of
different species of Arctic shells, in the course of several years' dredging
from his yacht, and his inference of a previously existing colder climate
in the part of the world now occupied by the British Islands, con
stituted a remarkable and important advancement of Geological Science.
In his ' Voyage and Shipwreck of St. Paul,' a masterly application of
the principles of practical seamanship renders St. Luke's narrative more
thoroughly intelligible to us now than it can have been to contem
porary readers not aided by nautical knowledge.        Later he published a
'
  Dissertation on the Origin    and   Connexion of the Gospels ;' and he
was engaged in the collection of further materials for the elucidation of
the same subject up to the time of his death, at the age of eighty-five.
Archibald Smith's mother was also of a family distinguished for intel
lectual activity. Her paternal grandfather was Dr. Andrew Wilson,
Professor of Astronomy in the University of Glasgow, whose specula
tions on the constitution of the sun are now generally accepted, especially
since the discovery of spectrum-analysis and its application to solar
physics. Her uncle, Dr. Patrick Wilson, who succeeded to his father's
Chair in the University, was author of papers in the ' Philosophical
              '
Transactions on Meteorology and on Aberration.
   Archibald Smith's earliest years were chiefly passed in the old castle of
Roseneath.     In 1818 and 1819 he was taken by his father and mother to
travel on the continent of Europe. Much of his early education was
given him by his father, who read Virgil with him when he was about
nine years old. He also had lessons from the Roseneath parish school
master, Mr. Dodds, who was very proud of his young pupil. In Edin-

burgh during the winters 1820-22 he went to a day-school ; and after
that, living at home at Jordanhill, he attended the Grammar School of
Glasgow for three years.       As a boy he was extremely active, and fond of
every thing that demanded skill, strength, and daring.         At Roseneath he
was constantly    in  boats ;  and his  favourite  reading was any thing about
the sea, commencing no doubt with details of adventurers and bucca
neers, but going on to narratives of voyages of discovery, and to the best
text-books of seamanship and navigation as he grew older.             He had of
course the ordinary ardent desire to become a sailor, incidental to boys
of this island;    but with him the passion remained through life, and
largely influenced the scientific work by which he has conferred never-to-
be-forgotten benefits on the marine service of the world, and made con
tributions to nautical     science which      have earned credit   for England
among maritime nations.        He was early initiated into practical seaman
ship under his father's instruction, in yacht-sailing.          He became an
expert   and  bold  pilot, exploring   and   marking passages   and  anchorages
for himself among the intricate channels and rocks of the West High
lands, when charts did not supply the requisite information. His most
loved recreation from the labours of Lincoln's Inn was always a cruise
in the West Highlands. In the last summer of his life, after a naturally
strong constitution had broken down under the stress nf mathematical
work on ships' magnetism by night, following days of hard work in his
legal profession, he regained something of health and strength in sailing
about with his boys in his yacht, between the beautiful coasts of the Frith
of Clyde, but not enough, alas, to carry him through unfavourable influ
ences in the winter that followed.
   In 1826 he went to a school at Bedland, near Bristol, for two years ;
and in 1828 he entered the University of Glasgow, where he not only
began to show his remarkable capacity for mathematical science in the
classes of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy, but also distinguished
himself highly in Classics and Logic.          Among his fellow students were
Norman Macleod and Archibald Campbell Tait, with both of whom
he retained a friendship throughout life. After completing his fourth
session in Glasgow, he joined in the summer of 1832 a reading party,
under Hopkins, at Barmouth in North Wales, and in the October fol
lowing commenced residence in Trinity College, Cambridge.
   While still an undergraduate he wrote and communicated to the
Cambridge Philosophical       Society a paper on Fresnel's wave-surface.
The mathematical tact and power for which he afterwards became cele
brated were shown to a remarkable degree in this his first published
work. Presnel, the discoverer of the theory, had determined analytically
the principal sections of the wave-surface, and then guessed its algebraic
equation.    This he had verified, by calculating from it the perpendicular
from the centre to the tangent plane        ;  but the demonstration   thus ob

                                        iii
tuned was   so long that he suppressed it in his published paper. Ampere
by sheer  labour   had worked out a direct analytical demonstration, and
                    '
published it in the Annales de Chimieetde Physique'*, where it occupies
thirty-two pages, and presents so repulsive an aspect that few mathemati
cians would be pleased to face the task of going through it. With these
antecedents, Archibald Smith's investigation, bringing out the desired re
sult directly from Fresnel's postulates by a few short lines of beautifully
symmetrical algebraic geometry, constitutes no small contribution to the
elementary mathematics of the undulatory theory of light. It was one
of the first applications in England, and it remains to this day a model
example, of the symmetrical method of treating analytical geometry,
which soon after (chiefly through the influence of the ' Cambridge Mathe
matical Journal') grew up in Cambridge, and prevailed over the un-
symmetrical and frequently cumbrous methods previously in use.
   In 1836 he took his degree as Senior Wrangler and first Smith's Prize
man, and in the same year he was elected to a Fellowship in Trinity
College.
   Shortly after taking his degree, he proposed to his friend Duncan
Farquharson Gregory, of the celebrated Edinburgh mathematical family,
then an undergraduate of Trinity College, the establishment of an
English periodical for the publication of short papers on mathematical
subjects.   Gregory answered in a letter of date December 4th, 1836,
cordially entering into the scheme, and undertaking the office of editor.
Being, however, on the eve of the Senate-House examination for his
                  "                                              '
degree, he adds, But all this must be done after the degree ; for business
before pleasure,' as Richard said when he went to kill the king before
he murdered the babes." The result was, the 'Cambridge Mathematical
Journal,' of which the first number appeared in November 1837. It
was carried on in numbers, appearing three times a year under the
editorship of Gregory, until his death, and has been continued under
various editors, and with several changes of name, till the present time,
                                                                     '

and Green had been the prophets and precursors.
   It much to be regretted that neither Cambridge, nor the university

   work of his life. Two years after taking his degree he commenced reading
  law in London ; but his inclination was still for science. Relinquishing
  reluctantly    a Trinity Lectureship offered to him by Whewell in 1838, and
  offered again and almost accepted in 1840, resisting a strong temptation
  to accompany Sir James Ross to the Antarctic regions on the scientific
  exploring expedition of the ' Erebus' and 'Terror' in 1840-41, and re
  gretfully giving up the idea of a Scottish professorship, which, during his
  early years of residence in Lincoln's Inn, had many attractions for him,
  he finally made the bar his profession.           But during all the long years of
  hard work through which he gradually attained to an important and
  extensive practice, and to a high reputation as a Chancery barrister, he
  never lost his interest in science, nor ceased to be actively
                                                                               engaged in
  scientific pursuits ; and he always showed a lively and generous
                                                                                     sym
  pathy with others, to whom circumstances (considered in this respect
  enviable by him) had allotted a scientific profession.
     About the year 1841 his attention was drawn to the problem of
  ships' magnetism by his friend Major Sabine, who was at that time
  occupied with the reduction of his own early magnetic observations
  made at sea on board the ships 'Isabella' and 'Alexander'                        on the
 Arctic Expedition of 1818, and of corresponding magnetic observa
 tions which had been then recently made on board the ' Erebus '
 and 'Terror' in Capt. Ross's Antarctic Expedition of 1840—41.                        The
 systematic character of the deviations, unprecedented in amount, ex
                         '           '
 perienced by the          Isabella and ' Alexander ' in the course of their
 Arctic voyage, had attracted the attention of Poisson, who published, in
 1824, in the ' Memoirs of the French Institute,' three papers
                                                                            containing a
 mathematical theory of magnetic induction, with application to
                                                                                    ships'
 magnetism.        The subsequent magnetic survey of the Antarctic regions,
 of which by far the greater part had to be executed by daily observations
 of terrestrial magnetism on ship-board, brought into permanent view the
importance of Poisson's general theory ; but at the same time demon
strated the necessity for replacing his practical formulae by others, not
limited by certain restrictions as to symmetry of the ship, which he had
assumed for the sake of simplicity. This was the chief problem first put
before Smith by Sabine ; and his solution of it was the first great
                                                                                  service
which he rendered to the practical correction of the disturbance of the
compass caused by the magnetism of ships.                   Twenty years later the
work thus commenced was referred to in the following terms

 " the formulae for correcting the deviation, which he had furnished to
 " me, reduced to simple tabular forms, were published by the
                                                                    Admiralty
 " in successive editions for the use of the Royal Navy.
    " As, in the course of time, the use of steam machinery, the weight of
 " the armament of ships of war, and generally the use of iron in vessels,
 " increased more and more ; the great and increasing inconvenience
 " arising from compass irregularities were more and more strongly felt,
 "and pressed themselves on the attention of the Admiralty and of
 " naval officers.
    " An entire revision of the Admiralty instructions became
                                                                   necessary ;
" Mr. Smith's assistance was again freely given ; and the result was the
" publication of the ' Admiralty Manual ' for ascertaining and applying
" the deviations of the compass caused by the iron in a ship.
    " The mathematical part of this work, which is due to Mr. Smith,
" seems to exhaust the subject, and to reduce the processes by simple
" formulae and tabular and graphic methods, to the greatest simplicity of
" which they are susceptible. Mr. Smith also joined with his fellow-
" labourer, Captain Evans, F.R.S., the present Superintendent of the
" Compass Department of the Navy, in laying before the Society several
"valuable papers containing the results of the mathematical theory
" applied to observations made on board the iron-built and iron-plated
" ships of the Royal Navy."
    This is not an occasion for explaining in detail the elaborate investiga
tions sketched in the preceding statement by Sir Edward Sabine ; but
the writer of the present notice, having enjoyed the friendship of Archi
bald Smith since the year 1841, and having had many opportunities,
both in personal intercourse and by letters, of following the progress
through thirty years of his work on ships' magnetism, may be permitted
a brief reference to some of the points which have struck him as most
remarkable     : —

                                        vi
   1.  Harmonic reduction of observations.
   2. Practical expression of the    full mathematical theory.
   3. Heeling error.
   4. Dygograms.
   5.  Eule for positions of needles on compass card, with dynamical and
magnetic reasons.
   1. Harmonic reduction of observations. — The disturbance of the compass
produced by the magnetism of a ship is found by observation to be the
same, to a very close degree of approximation, when the ship's head is
again and again brought to the same bearing, no great interval of time
having intervened, and no extraordinary disturbance by heavy sea or
otherwise having been experienced in the interval. Overlooking these
restrictions  for the present, we may therefore say, in Fourier's language,
that the disturbance of the compass is a periodic function of the angle
between the vertical plane of any line fixed relatively to the ship, and
                                                " even keel " or with any con
any fixed vertical plane, when the ship, on
stant inclination, is turned into different azimuths — the period of this
function being four right angles. Hence also the disturbance of the
compass is a periodic function of the angle between the vertical plane of
the chosen line moving with the ship, and the vertical plane through
the magnetic axis of the compass.        The line moving with the ship being
taken as a longitudinal line drawn horizontally from the stem towards
the bow, and the fixed vertical      plane being taken as the magnetic meri
dian, the angle first mentioned is called for brevity " the ship's magnetic
course," and the other
                          " the ship's compass course."
    One of Smith's earliest contributions to the compass problem was the
application of Fourier's grand and fertile theory of the expansion of a
periodic function in series of sines and cosines of the argument and its
multiples, now commonly called the harmonic analysis of a periodic
function. To facilitate the practical working out of this analysis, he gave
tables of the products of the multiplication of the sines of the " rhumbs
                                                                              "
by numbers, and by arcs in degrees and minutes ; also tabular forms and
simple practical rules for performing the requisite arithmetical opera
tions.    These tables, tabular forms, and rules, just as Smith gave them
about thirty years ago, are in use in the Compass Department of the
 Admiralty up to the present time. From every ship in Her Majesty's
 Navy, in whatever part of the world, a table of observed deviations of the
compass, at least once a year is sent to the Admiralty, and is there sub
jected to the harmonic analysis.         The observations having been accu
rately   and faithfully made,  a full history of the magnetic condition of the
 ship is thus obtained, and want of accuracy, or want of faithfulness, if
there has been any, is surely detected.      The rigorous carrying out of this
 system, with all the method and business-like regularity characteristic
of the scientific departments      of our Admiralty,    has  undoubtedly  done

   more than any thing else to promote the usefulness of the compass, and
  to render its use safe throughout the British Navy. Smith's tables and
  forms for harmonic analysis have proved exceedingly valuable in many
  other departments of practical physics besides ships' magnetism.          The
  writer of this article found them most useful fifteen years ago in re
  ducing for the Royal Society of Edinburgh Forbes's observations of the
  underground temperature of Calton Hill, the Experimental Gardens,
  and Craigleith Quarry, in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh ; and the
  forms, with a suitable modification of the tables, have proved equally
  useful in the harmonic analysis of tidal observations for various parts of
  the world, carried out by the Tidal Committee of the British Association,
 with the assistance of sums of money granted in successive years from
  1868 to 1872.
     2. Practical expression of the full mathematical theory. — Poisson him
 self, in making practical application of his theory, had simplified it by
 assuming particular conditions as to symmetry of the iron in the ship,
 and even with these restrictions had left it in a form which seemed to
 require further simplification before it could be rendered available for
 general use.     Airy, in taking up the problem with this object, at the
 request of the Admiralty in the year 1839, founded his calculations on a
 supposition that,
                      " by the action of terrestrial magnetism every particle
 " of iron is converted into a magnet whose direction is parallel to that of
 " the dipping needle, and whose intensity is proportional to the intensity
 " of terrestrial magnetism." This supposition, which is
                                                                 approximately
 true only for the ideal case of the iron of the ship being all in the shape
 of globes placed at such considerable distances from one another as
not to exercise mutual influence to any sensible degree, leads to a law
of dependence between the ship's force on the compass needle, and the
angular coordinates of the ship, which differs from that of the complete
theory, as shown afterwards by Smith, only in the want of his constant
term A of the harmonic development, — a difference which, in ordinary
cases, does not vitiate sensibly the practical    application.  In introducing
the supposition, Airy correctly anticipated that it would in general lead
to results sufficiently accurate and complete for practical purposes.      But
he said " it would have been desirable to make the calculations on
" Poisson's theory, which undoubtedly possesses greater claims on our
" attention        a theory representing accurately the facts of some
              (as                                                         very
"   peculiar cases) than any other.    The difficulties, however, in the appli-
"   cation of this theory to complicated cases are great, perhaps insuper-
" able."    These difficulties were wholly overcome by the happy mathe
matical tact of Archibald Smith, who reduced the full expression of
Poisson's theory, including the effect of permanent magnetism, the great
practical importance of which had been discovered by Airy, to a few
simple and easily applied formulae. [See Appendix to this notice.] These

                                          Mil
formulae are now in regular use in the Compass Department of the
Admiralty, for the practical deduction of rigorous results from the har
monic analysis already referred to. In fact the full expression of the
unrestricted    theory,    as given by   Archibald Smith in Part      III. of the
'
   Admiralty Manual,' is even simpler and more ready for ordinary use
than the partial and restricted expressions which Poisson and Airy had
given for practical application of the theory.
    3. Heeling error. — Poisson's general formulas express three rectangular
components of the resultant force at the point where the compass is
placed, due to the magnetism induced in the ship by the terrestrial
magnetic force.       To . these Airy added the components of force due to
permanent magnetism of the ship's iron, which, though not ignored by
Poisson, had been omitted by him, because, considering the probability
of scattered directions of the magnetic axes of permanent magnetism in
the isolated masses of iron existing in wooden ships and their arma
ments, he justly judged        that permanent magnetism could not seriously
disturb   a properly placed compass in a wooden ship ; and iron ships were
scarcely contemplated in those days. This general theory of Poisson and
Airy expresses the resultant force in terms of three angular coordinates,
specifying the position of the ship. In the practical application these
coordinates are most conveniently taken as: —(1) the ship's "magnetic
course," defined above ; (2) the inclination of the longitudinal axis of
the ship to the horizon ; (3) the inclination to the horizon of a plane
drawn through this line perpendicular to the deck.               The second co
ordinate    has  no  name    and is of no  importance in the compass problem ;
for under steam, or even under sail, the average inclination of the longi
tudinal axis (chosen as horizontal for the ship in still water) is never so
 great as to produce any sensible effect on the compass disturbance, and
the magnetic effects of pitching in the heaviest sea are not probably ever
 so great as  to produce any seriously inconvenient degrees of oscillation in
the compass card. The third coordinate is called the "heel ;" and its mag
                                              " the heeling error." The
 netic effect on the compass is called                                     heeling
 error was investigated by Airy in his earliest work on the compass disturb
 ance ; but at that time, when iron sailing ships were comparatively rare,
 he confined his ordinary practical correction of compass error to the case
 of a ship in different azimuths on even keel. Since that time the heeling
 error has come to be of very serious practical importance, on account of
 the great number of iron sailing ships, and of screw steamers admitting
 of being pressed by sail to very considerable degrees of
                                                               " heel." Archibald
  Smith took up the question with characteristic mathematical tact and
 practical ability, and gave the method for correcting the heeling error
                                                                                —
 which is now,     I  believe, universally adopted in the Navy, and too fre
  quently omitted (without the substitution of any other method) in the
 mercantile marine.

                                           ix
    4. Dygograms. — This is the name given by Smith to diagrams exhibiting
the magnitude and direction of the resultant of the terrestrial magnetic
force and the force of the ship's magnetism at the point occupied by the
compass.      The solution of the problem of finding for a ship in all
azimuths on even keel the dygogram of the whole resultant force is
given by him in the chapter headed
                                                " Ellipse and Circle," of the ' Ad
miralty Manual,' Appendix 2 (3rd edition, 1869, page 169-171). But it is
only for horizontal components of force that he has put dygograms into
a practical form ; and for this case, which includes the whole compass
problem of ordinary navigation, his dygograms are admirable both for
their beauty and for their utility.               " Dygogram Number I." is the
curve locus of the extremity of a line drawn from a fixed point, O, in
the direction, and to a length numerically equal to the magnitude, of the
horizontal component of the resultant force experienced by the needle
when the ship is turned through all azimuths.                   This curve (however
great the deviations of the compass) he proves to be the Limacon of
Pascal — that is to say, the curve (belonging to the family of epitrochoids)
described by the end of an arm rotating in a plane round a point, which
itself is carried with half angular velocity round the circumference of a
 fixed circle in the same plane.        The length of the first-mentioned arm is
equal to the maximum amount of what is called (after Airy) the
quadrantal deviation ; the radius of the circle last mentioned is the
maximum amount of what              Airy called the polar magnet deviation, and
 Smith the semicircular deviation.       (When, as the writer of this article trusts
before long will be universally the case*, the quadrantal deviation is
perfectly corrected by Airy's method of soft iron correctors, the dygogram
Number I. will be reduced to a circle.) Besides the form of the curve
in any particular     case, which depends on the ratio of the first-mentioned
radius to the second, to complete the diagram and use it we must know
the position of the fixed point through which the resultant radius-vector
is to be drawn, and must show in the diagram the magnetic bearing of
the ship's head, for which any particular point of the curve gives the
resultant force.       Smith gave all these elements by simple and easily
executed constructions,       in the first and second editions of the ' Admiralty
 Manual.' In the third edition he substituted, for his first method of
 construction of the dygogram curve, a modification of it due to Lieut.
Colongue of the Russian Imperial Navy and of the Imperial Compass
 Observatory, Cronstadt, and added several elegant constructions, also
due to Lieut. Colongue, for the geometrical solution of various compass
 problems, by aid of the dygogram Number I.
    * The barrier against this being done hitherto has been the perniciously frreat length
of the compass needles used at sea, the shortest being about Bix inches.   For a standard
compass the needles ought not to be more than half an inch long.

   The annexed diagram is the dygogram Number I. for the ' Warrior,'
drawn accurately (by aid of a circular board rolling upon a fixed circular
board of equal diameter, in the manner described by Smith in the ' Ad
miralty Manual,' Appendix II., under the heading ** Mechanical Con
struction of Dygogram No. I."), according to the following data deduced
from observations made at Spithead in October 1861. The notation 3, 33,

                                               dygogram."      It lies in the
                                                dotted line. NQS, EQW
     are two lines through Q at right angles to
                                                   one another ; and O, P
     are two points, in positions fixed by the
                                                ship's magnetic elements.

    and OE represents the horizontal component of

   Dygogram Number           II.
                           may be deduced from dygogram Number I. by
attaching a piece of paper to the half -speed revolving arm, and letting
the tracing-point of the limacpn leave its trace also on this paper, which
will             while at the same time the fixed point from which the
       be a circle,
resultant radius-vector is drawn will trace another circle on the moving
paper.   The fresh diagram thus obtained consists of two circles.   Mark
one of these circles (the second in the order of the preceding descrip
tion) with the points of the compass*, like a compass card; or (better)
mark simply degrees all round from North taken as zero ; and mark
with degrees counted in reverse direction the other circle, which, for
brevity, will be called the auxiliary circle.  Mark the ship's compass
course on the circumference of the ideal compass card.         From this
point to the corresponding point on the auxiliary circle draw a straight
line. The direction of this line shows by the parallel to     through the      it,
centre of the ideal compass card, the compass course corresponding to
any chosen magnetic course. The length of the line, drawn in the
manner  described, represents the horizontal resultant force of the earth
and ship, at the point occupied by the compass needle, in terms of the
radius of the ideal compass card, as unity. The writer of the present
article believes that this construction will yet prove of very great practical
utility, although hitherto      has not come into general uset.

    5. Rule  for positions of needles on compass card, with dynamical and
magnetic reasons. — In 1837 a Committee, consisting of Captain Beaufort,
 Hydrographer to the Admiralty, Captain Sir J. C. Ross, E.N., Captain
Johnson, E.N., Major Sabine, E.A., and Mr. S. H. Christie, was appointed
 to remedy defects of the compasses at that time in use in Her Majesty's
 fleet, and to organize a system of compass management ashore and afloat.
 The labours of that Committee hare conferred signal benefit, not only on
 the British Navy, but on the navies and mercantile marine services of    all
nations — in the ' Admiralty Standard Compass,' and in the   establishment
in 1843 of the British Admiralty Compass Department. The qualities of
 the magnetic needles and their arrangement on the card occupied much

                                                           xiii
attention of the Committee.   Smith's attention was called to the subject
by his friend Sabine ; and he gave a rule for placing the needles, which
was adopted by the Committee, and has ever since been followed in the
construction of the Admiralty compass.    The rule   that when there are         is,
two needles used they should be placed with their ends on the compass
card at 60° on each side of the ends of  diameter   and that when (as
                                                                  a              ;
in the Admiralty Standard Compass) there are four needles, they should
be placed with their ends at 15° and 45° from the ends of the diameter.
The object of this rule was to give equal moments of inertia round all
horizontal axes, and so to remedy the " wabbling" motion of the compass
card when balanced on its pivot, which has been found inconvenient.
Captain Evans, in     letter recently received from him by the writer of
                                    a
this notice, says that the " wabbling
                                         "
                                           motion has been satisfactorily
corrected     this    by
                   arrangement    of needles   "     transformed into  ;    it   is                     a
    swimming           motion."
'                 '
   About twenty years later    was discovered that the same arrangement
                                                 it
gives, by happy coincidence,
                  a               very important magnetic merit to the
                                                      a
Admiralty compass, which had not been contemplated         Smith when he               by
first gave his rule. To explain this,   must be premised that practical
                                                             it
compass-adjusters had experienced difficulties in correcting the compass
deviation of certain ships by Airy's method (which consists in using soft
iron to correct the quadrantal                            deviation,       and permanent        magnets to
correct the semicircular), and had reported that in such cases they had
found      advantageous to substitute compasses with two needles for a
             it
single-needle compass. The attention of Captain Evans was drawn to
this subject      the observations made in the
                           by                           Great Eastern on her '                      '
experimental voyage    from  the  Thames    to  Portland,  and afterwards when
she was lying at Holyhead and Southampton, from which he found that
although the deviations had been carefully corrected by Mr. Gray, of
Liverpool, with magnets and soft iron, and were in fact nearly correct
on the cardinal and quadrantal points, there were errors of between
5° and 6° on some of the intermediate points.          These observations indi
cated the existence of considerable     aerror,  which was neither semicircular
nor quadrantal, and thus apparently some source of error which had not
been taken into account                     by
                              Airy in his plan for correction.        To explain
the  cause of these and  similar results  in other  ships, previously considered
to be anomalous, Captain Evans instituted series of experiments with   a
compasses, and magnets and soft iron placed in different positions with
 respect to them.    He soon found that the greatness of the supposed
 anomaly in the     Great  Eastern depended on the unusually great length
                                '                     '

tions and experiments, reduced by aid of Napier's graphic method, and
subjected to a thorough harmonic analysis, are described in a joint paper
by Smith and Evans, published in the Transactions of the Boyal Society
for 1861. They show, in the expression for the deviation, sextantal and
                                                             '

paratively small when the Admiralty standard compass was tested in cir
cumstances otherwise similar.              Whether single needles or double needles
were used, it was found that the smaller the needle the smaller were the
sextantal and octantal terms.              Single needles gave greater terms of this
class than double needles of the same magnitude, arranged as in the
Admiralty compass.

an inch long and unloaded by a compass card, would be an improvement on the pre
sent ordinary usa^e of first-class ocean steamers.
    The direction of part of the reactionary improvement required is clearly pointed out in
the following note on the comparative merits of large and small compasses, extracted from
 Captain Evans's Elementary Manual for the Deviation of the Compass in Iron Ships:' —
                    '
 " Of late years much diversity in practice has prevailed as to the sin of compasses for
 " use on board ship. The Admiralty Standard card of
                                                              7i inches diameter, for example,
 " is fitted with needles the maximum lengths of which are
                                                                     7^ inches, while in large
 " passenger steam-vessels the needles are frequently 12 to 15 inches, and even longer.
 " The chief object in the employment of large compasses is to enable the helmsmen
 " to steer to degrees ; and a more accurate course is thus presumed to be preserved."
     " With reference to this increased size, it must be observed that competent authorities
 " limit the length of efficient compass needles to 5 or 6 inches ; beyond this limit an
 " increase of length is alone accompanied by an increase of directive power in the
 " same proportion ; and if the thickness of the needle be preserved, the weight, and
 "
    consequently the friction, increase in the same ratio. No advantage of directive
 " power is therefore gained by increase in length ; but with the increased weight of the
 " card and appendages the increase of friction probably far exceeds the increase of direo-
 " tive force : sluggishness is the result, which is further exaggerated by the extreme slow-
 " ness of oscillation of long needles compared with short needles."
     "
       Large cards, however convenient in practice, are therefore not without danger ; for
 " the course steered may deceive the seamen by seeming right to the fraction of a
 "
    degree, but which avails little if the card is wrong half a point, and the ship in con-
 " sequence hazarded.       In the opinion of the writer the present Admiralty standard
  " card is as large as should be used for the purposes of navigation, and that, as regards
  " safety in the long, steady, and fast ship, the choice is really between the Admiralty
  " card and a smaller one. In short the case
                                                    may be thus stated : the smaller a card
  " the more correctly it points ; the
                                        larger a card the more accurately it can be read."
     When the needles of a standard compass are reduced to something like half an inch
  in length, and not till then, will the theoretical perfection and beauty, and the great
  practical merit, of Airy's correction of the compass by soft iron and permanent magnets
  (which theoretically assumes the length of the needle to be infinitely small in propor
  tion to its distance from the nearest iron or steel) be universally recognized and have
  full justice done to it in practice.
      * That is to say, terms consisting of coefficients
                                                           multiplying the sines or cosines of
  six times and of eight times the ship's magnetic azimuth.

                                          XT
discovered in the Admiralty standard compass, " suggested the idea, that
" the arrangement of the needles in that
                                         compass might produce, in the
" case of deviations caused by a
                                  magnet or mass of soft iron in close
" proximity to       it,
                    compensation of the sextantal and octantal deviations;
                       a
" and this,   on the subject being mathematically investigated [on the
"
    approximate hypothesis that the intensity of magnetization     uniform
                                                                         is
"   through the length of each needle, and equal in the different needles],
"   proved to be the case, this particular arrangement of needles reducing
"   to zero the coefficients of the terms involving the square of the ratio
" of the length of the needle to the distance of the disturbing iron so           ;
" that this remarkable result was obtained, that the arrangement of
" needles which produces the equality in the moments of inertia is,               by   a
" happy coincidence, the same as that which prevents the sextantal devia-
" tion in the case of correcting magnets, and the octantal deviation in
" the case of soft iron correctors. The consequence                is,
                                                            that with the
" Admiralty compass cards, or with cards with two needles each 30°
" from the central line, correcting magnets and soft iron correctors
" may be placed much nearer the compass than can safely be done with                   a
" single-needle compass card, and that the large deviations found in iron
" ships may be thus far more accurately corrected."
    It   will            that the preceding statement, even as an index
                be understood
of subjects, gives but very incomplete idea of Smith's thirty years' work
                           a
on magnetism.     Further information    to be found in his papers in the
                                               is
Transactions and Proceedings of the Royal Society, some of them contri
buted in conjunction with Sabine or with Evans, others in his own name
alone.     In
           1850 he published separately* an account of his theoretical and
practical investigations on the correction of the deviations of      ship's   a
compass,   which  was  afterwards given as  supplement
                                                    a   to the Admiralty
" Practical Rules" in 1855. The large deviations found in iron-plated
ships of war " having rendered necessary the use of the exact instead of
" the approximate formulae," this article was rewritten by Smith for the
Compass Department     of the Admiralty.   It now forms Part             III.
                                                                    of the

  It     satisfactory

 practical skill, has been appreciated as a gift to the commonwealth of
nations by other countries than our own.         It is adopted by the United
States Navy Department, and it has been translated into Russian, Ger
man, Portuguese, and French.        Smith's mathematical work, and particu
larly his beautiful and ingenious geometrical constructions, have attracted
great interest, and have called forth fresh investigation in the same
direction,   among the    well-instructed and able mathematicans of the
American,     Bussian, French, and German Navy Departments.
    The laborious and persevering devotion to the compass problem,
which has been shown by British mathematicians and practical men, by
Sabine, Scoresby, Airy, Archibald Smith, by Captains Johnson and Evans
of the Compass Department of the Admiralty, and by Townson and
Bundell, who acted as secretaries to the Liverpool Compass Committee,
has been an honour to the British nation in the eyes of the world.
Referring particularly to the Liverpool Compass Committee, Lieut.
Collet, of the French Navy, the French translator of the ' Admiralty
Manual,' in a history of the subject which he prefixes to his translation,
           "
says : — Aide par des libcralites       particulieres,  soutenu surtout par
" cette sorte de tenacite passionnee, tout particuliere a la nation anglaise,
" qui, en inspirant les longues et patientes recherches conduit surement
" au succes et sans laquelle tous les moyens d'action sont impuissants a
" surmonter les obstacles, ce Comite fit paraitre successivement trois rap-
" ports qui fixerent d'une maniere definitive la plupart des questions con-
"troversees,   et qui indiquerent nettement, pour celles qui restaient        a
" resoudre, la marche qu'il fallait suivre et les veritables inconnues du
" probleme."       And in an official publication by the American Navy
Department, containing an English translation of Poisson's memoir,
followed by the whole series of papers, theoretical and practical, on ships'
magnetism, which have appeared in this country, we find the following
passage, which must be gratifying to all who feel British scientific work
and appreciation of it by other nations, to be a proper subject for national
           " * * With the complex conditions thus introduced, and the
pride : —
" more exacting requirements of experience in their practical treatment,
" came the necessity for constantly aiming at that complete analysis
                                                                             of
" the magnetic phenomena
                            of the ship which has been so prominent and
" characteristic a feature of the English researches."
    The constancy to the compass problem in which Smith persevered with
a rare    extreme of disinterestedness, from the time when Sabine first
asked him to work out practical methods from Poisson's mathematical
theory, until his health broke down two years before his death, was cha
racteristic of the man. It was pervaded by that
                                                       " tenacite             "
                                                                  passionnee
which the generous French appreciation, quoted above, describes as a
peculiarity of the English nation ; but there was in it also a noble single-
mindedness and a purity of unselfishness to be found in few men of any
nation, but simply natural in Archibald Smith.

     Honourable marks of appreciation reached him from various quarters,
 and gave him the more pleasure from being altogether unsought and un
 expected.     The Admiralty, in 1862, gave him a watch. In 1864 he
 received the honorary degree of LL.D. from the University of Glasgow.
 The Eoyal Society awarded to him the Royal Medal in the year 1865.
 The Emperor of Russia gave him, in 1866, a gold Compass emblazoned
 with the Imperial Arms and set with thirty-two diamonds, marking the
 thirty-two points.    Six months before his death Her Majesty's Govern
 ment requested his acceptance of a gift of .£2000, as a mark of their ap
                 " the long and valuable services which he had
 preciation of                                                     gratuitously
 " rendered to the Naval Service in connexion with the magnetism of iron
 " ships, and the deviations of their Compasses." The official letter in
 timating this, dated Admiralty, July 1st, 1872, contains the following
 statement, communicated to Smith by command of the Lords of the
 Admiralty :—" To the zeal and ability with which for many years you
 " have applied yourself to this difficult and most important subject, My
 " Lords attribute in a great degree the accurate information they possess
 " in regard to the influence of magnetism, which has so far conduced to
 " the safe navigation of iron ships, not only of the Royal and Mercantile
 " Navies of this country, but of all nations."
    The writer of this notice has obtained Have to quote also the following
from a letter from the First Lord of the Admiralty, Mr. Goschen, of date
February 23rd, 1872, announcing to Mr. Smith that the Government
had determined to propose to Parliament that the sum of .£2000 should
be awarded to him
                      " as a mark of recognition of the great and successful
 " labours" which he had " bestowed on several branches of scientific en-
 " quiry of deep importance to Her Majesty's Navy."
      I
    " am aware that you have treated your arduous work in this direction
" as a labour of love ; and therefore I do not consider that the grant which
" Parliament will be requested to sanction is in any way to be looked
" upon as a remuneration of your services                     I trust you will
" regard it as a mark of recognition on the part of the country, of your
" great   devotion to enquiries of eminent utility to the public, conducted
" in the leisure hours which remained to you in      a laborious profession."
    The following letter, which was addressed to the Editor of the ' Glasgow
Herald,' and published in that paper last January, will be read with
interest by others as well as those for whom it was originally written : —
" As an intimate friend of the late Archibald Smith of Jordanhill,            I
" desire to call your attention to a passage in your article of the
" 30th December upon him, which might perhaps convey a wrong im-
" pression to the minds of your readers.
    " You say that ' mathematics    ...  in its application to practical navi-
" ' gation was the amusement of his lighter hours.' The truth is, that
" the profession of a Chancery barrister, which the claims of a large

"  gation of the most minute and severe nature, undertaken after mid-
"  night, and carried on far into the morning hours by a man whose brain
"  had been working all day, and must work again the next day, can
"                    '
   hardly be called the amusement of lighter hours.'          The same remark
"  applies to vacations, during which his magnetic papers were constantly
"  with him — on railway journeys, on board the yacht, the last subject of
"  his thoughts at night, the first in the morning, at one time depriving
" him, to an alarming extent, of the power of sleep ; for, unlike the
" labours of law, these abstruse subjects cannot be dismissed at will.
    " The fact is that, in addition to the love of science for her own sake,
" he was penetrated by the conviction of the usefulness of his work.
" His splendid abilities, supported by a constitution of unusual vigour,
" were freely and heartily devoted to the service of his country, and the
" good of his fellow-creatures.      ' Think how
                                                   many lives it will save,' was
" his answer to an anxious friend who begged him to relinquish labours
" so exhausting, and to give himself ordinary rest. But the inevitable
" result followed ; and though in earlier days it had seemed as if nothing
" could hurt his constitution, and his friends might anticipate for him
" the length of days for which many of his family had been remarkable,
" yet the continued mental strain did its work too surely, and in 1870
" he was compelled to give up his profession with shattered health, to
" spend two short years with those he loved, and then sink into a prema-
" ture grave. You observe that ' from the very commencement of his
" career Her Majesty's Government
                                         (to their credit be it said) appreciated
" the supreme importance of his researches.' In justice to the Govern-
" ment, it ought also to be mentioned, that they asked

" what acknowledgment should be made to him for work undertaken at
" their request, and when Smith named a watch, it was presented to him
                                                                                by

" ' not as representative of the money value of his researches, but as a
" ' mark of their appreciation of their worth,' and still more, the graceful
" letter in which Mr. Goschen intimated to him that it was awarded,
" gave him pleasure, and his friends must always be glad that it did not
 " come too late.
    " The truth is, Sir — and it is for this reason that I address
                                                                       you — that

    One more extract in conclusion.        The following from the ' Solicitors'
Journal and Eeporter' of January 11th, 1873, contains a brief statement
 regarding the estimation in which Smith was held in relation to his legal
 profession, and concludes with words in which the writer of this article
 wishes to join, and therefore gives without quotation marks : —

                                               xix
      " When Mr. James Parker was made Vice-Chancellor he
                                                                                 appointed
 " Mr.    Smith     his Secretary ; and he was also Secretary to the Decimal
 "   Coinage Commission, which made its final report in 1859.                      In that
 "  report   there    is a  resume   of the subject by    Mr.   Smith ; and one may see
 "  there not only the special knowledge which he had collected on the
 "  matter in hand, but an example of his thorough and exhaustive style,
 "  close, compressed, and rich with fruits which it had cost him long
 "  labours and careful thought to mature.                 Ungrudgingly and without
 "  parade    he  used   to   offer the  products   of his  toil : ' This,' he said to the
 " writer, pointing to one half           page   of figures in his book, ' cost me six
 "  '
      weeks of hard work.' It was thus he ever worked : no pains seemed
 "  to be too much ; and consequently a marvellous neatness and elegance
 "  adorned all that he did.          In his profession, although he did not attain
 "  the same      exceptional eminence as in science, there was much that
 "  deserves notice.          His mental characteristics were of course more or
 " less apparent here. As a draughtsman few could compare with him
 " for conciseness and perspicuity.              His opinions were much esteemed ;
 " and his arguments, though far from brilliant in manner, had in them
 " so much sound law and careful and subtle analysis that they were
 " always of interest and value, and commanded the respect and attention
 " of the judges.          The important change which substituted figures for
 " words as to dates and sums occurring in bills in Chancery was made,
 " it is believed, at his suggestion. The well-known case of Jenner v.
 " Morris (on appeal 3 D. F. & J. 45, 9 W. E. 391), is an instance of one
 " of his successful arguments ; and the case of Deure v. Soutten (9 L. B.
 " Eq. 151, 18 W. E. 203), in which the former case was reconsidered
 " and confirmed, illustrates the research and industry which he was wont
"  to use in all matters which came before him. A judgeship in Queens-
"  land was offered to him about the year 1864 ; but he declined it."
    In private life those who knew Archibald Smith best loved him most ;
for behind a reserve which is perhaps incident to engrossing thought,
especially when it is concerned with scientific subjects, he kept ever a
warm and true heart ; and the affectionate regrets of his friends testify
to the guileless simplicity and sweetness of his disposition, which nothing
could spoil or affect.          About the close of 1870 he was compelled by ill
ness to give up work ; but two years later he had wonderfully rallied,
and, building too much on a partial recovery of strength, had recurred
imprudently to some of his old scientific pursuits.                  A few weeks before
his death he revised the instructions for compass observations to be made
                    '
on board the           Challenger,' then about to sail on the great voyage of
scientific investigation now in progress.                The attack of illness which
closed   his   life   was    unexpected    and   of  but  a few hours' duration.       In
1853 he married a daughter of Vice-Chancellor Sir James Parker, then
deceased ; and he leaves six sons and two daughters.                     He died on the
26th of December,          1872.

    Take lengths numerically equal to X, T, Z and X', T', Z' for the co
ordinates of two points.         The axes of coordinates being fixed relatively
to the ship, conceive the ship to be turned into all positions round a
fixed point taken as the origin of coordinates ; or for simplicity imagine
the ship to be fixed and the direction of the earth's resultant force to take
all positions, its magnitude remaining constant : the point (X, T, Z) will
always lie on a spherical surface, [(9) below) ; and the point (X, T', Z')
will always lie on an ellipsoid fixed relatively to the ship. For we have
                                Xa + Ya+Z2=F,                                     (9)
where      I denotes the earth's       resultant     force.    Now by (2) solved for
X, Y,     Z, we express these quantities as linear functions         of
                               X'_P, Y'-Q, Z'-B.
 Substituting these expressions for X, Y, Z, in (9) we obtain a homoge
 neous quadratic function of X'— P, Y' — Q, Z'— E, equated to Is, which
 is the equation of an ellipsoid having P, Q, E, for the coordinates of its
 centre.
     It is noteworthy     that the point (X, Y', Z') is the position into which
 the point (XYZ) of an elastic solid is brought by a translation (P, Q, E),
 compounded with a homogeneous strain and rotation represented by the
 matrix

     Instead of drawing at once the dygogram surface for the resultant of
  the force of earth and ship (X', Y', Z'), draw according to precisely the
  same rule, the dygogram surfaces for (X, Y, Z), the earth's force, and
  (X' — X, Y'— Y, Z' — Z), the force of the ship. The first of these will be
  a sphere   of radius   I.    The second will      be an ellipsoid  having its centre
  at the point (P, Q, E).        Let ON and OM be corresponding radius vectors
  of these two surfaces.         On OM, ON describe a parallelogram MONK.
   OK   is the resultant force of earth and ship at the point occupied by the
   ship's compass. Vary the construction by taking a " triangle of forces
                                                                                      "

   responding to OM of the spherical-surface dygogram of the earth's force.
   Join Nm ; through O draw OK equal and parallel to Nm. OK (the
   same line as before) is the radius vector of the resultant dygogram sur

   Take any plane section (large or small circle) of the spherical surface.
The corresponding line on the ellipsoid is also a plane section, but gene
rally in a different plane from the other. For example, let the ship
revolve round a vertical axis OZ ; in other words, relatively to the ship
let   ON revolve round OZ in    a cone whose semi- vertical angle is 0, the
dip.     The locus of,   N
                         is a horizontal  circle whose radius is H, the hori
zontal component     of  the earth's magnetic force.       The corresponding
locus of m is an ellipse, not generally in the plane perpendicular to OZ —
that is to say, not generally horizontal.     This ellipse and that circle are
Smith's "Ellipse and Circle" (Admiralty Manual, 3rd edition, 1869,
App. 2, page 168). The projection of the ellipse on the plane of the
circle is the dygogram of what is wanted for the practical problem, namely
the horizontal component of the ship's force.

altered circle and another circle (generally smaller) are found, with a
perfectly simple law of corresponding points, to give, in accordance with
the general rule stated above, the magnitude and direction of the resul
tant of horizontal force on the ship's compass. But in point of fact the
comparison with Dygogram No. I., by which (pages 168, 169) Smith in
troduced Dygogram No. II., taken along with his previous mechanical
construction of Dygogram No. I. (pages 166, 167), proves that Dygogram
No.     II.,
         simplified to two circles, is not confined to cases in which 21 and
<£ vanish, and so gives to this beautiful construction   a greatly enhanced
theoretical interest.          It
                         is to be also remarked that, although the necessity
for supposing 21 and (£ zero has been hitherto of little practical moment,
as their values are very small for ordinary positions of the compass in all
or nearly all ships at present in existence, the greatly increased quantity

"   The Localization       of Function      in the    Brain."          By David

                                  (Abstract.)
    The chief contents of this paper are the results of an experimental
investigation tending to prove that there is a localization of function in
special regions of the cerebral hemispheres.
    In  a former   paper published    by the author in the
                                                                 '
                                                                    West Riding
Lunatic Asylum Medical Reports,' vol. iii. 1873, the results were given
of experiments on rabbits, cats, and dogs, made specially for the purpose
of testing the theory of Hughlings Jackson, that localized and unilateral
                                          "                         "
epilepsies are caused by irritation or discharging lesions             of the grey
matter of the hemispheres in the region of the corpus striatum. Besides
confirming Hughlings Jackson's views, the author's researches indicated
an exact localization in the hemispheres of centres, or regions, for the
carrying out of simple and complex muscular movements of a definite
character, and described by him as of a purposive, or expressional, nature.
    Facts were also recorded tending to show that other regions of the
brain were connected with sensory perception, but no localization was
definitely arrived at.
    Among the experiments now related are some in further confirmation
and extension of those already made on cats, dogs, and rabbits, as well
as a new series of experiments on other vertebrates.               In particular,
numerous experiments on monkeys are described, for the purpose of
which the author received a grant of money from the Council of the
Royal Society.      In addition, the results of experiments on jackals,
guineapigs,- rats, pigeons, frogs, toads, and fishes are narrated.
    The method of investigation consists in the application of the stimulus
of an induced current of electricity directly to the surface of the brain
in animals rendered only partially insensible during the process of explo
ration, complete anaesthesia annihilating all reaction.     It is supplemented
 by the method of localized destructive lesions of the hemispheres.
    Special attention is called to the precision with which a given result
 follows stimulation of a definite area — so much so, that when once the
 brain  has been accurately mapped out, the experimenter       can predict with
 certainty  the  result of  stimulation  of  a given region or centre.         The
 theory that the phenomena are due not to excitation of cortical centres,
 but to conduction    of the electric currents    to basal ganglia and motor
                                                                     t  2

2.30                        Dr. D. Ferrier on t/ie                    [Mar.  5,
tracts, is considered to be disposed of by the fact of the precision and pre
dictable characters of the results, and by the marked differences in the
phenomena which are observed when regions in close local relation to
each other are excited.     Other facts are pointed out bearing in the same
direction   ;  among others, the harmony and homology subsisting       between
the results of experiment in all the different animals.
    The experiments on monkeys are first described.
    Reference is continually made in the description to figures of the brain,
on which are delineated the position and extend of the regions, stimula
tion of which is followed by constant and definite results.        A complete
statement of these results in the present abstract is impossible.
    Generally, it may be stated that the centres for the movements of the
limbs are situated in the convolutions bounding the fissure of Rolando,
viz. the ascending parietal convolution with its postero-parietal termina
tion as far back as the parieto-occipital fissure, the ascending frontal, and
posterior termination of the superior frontal convolution.          Centres for
individual movements of the limbs, hands, and feet are differentiated in
these convolutions.
    Further, in the ascending frontal convolution, on a level with the pos
terior termination of the middle frontal, are centres for certain facial
muscles,    e. g. the zygomatics  <fec. At  the posterior   termination   of the
inferior frontal convolution and corresponding part of the ascending
frontal are the centres for various movements of the mouth and tongue.
This is the homologue of " Broca's convolution."         At the inferior angle
 of the intraparietal sulcus is the centre for the platysma.
    In the superior frontal convolution, in advance of the centre for cer
 tain forward movements of the arm, as well as in the corresponding part of
the middle frontal convolution, are areas, stimulation of which causes lateral
 (crossed) movements of the head and eyes and dilatation of the pupils.
    The antero-frontal region, with the inferior frontal and orbital convo
lutions, give no definite results on irritation.    Extirpation of these parts
 causes   a condition  resembling dementia.
    No results could be ascertained as regards the function of the central
 lobe or island of Reil.
    Irritation of the angular gyrus (pli courbe) causes certain movements
 of the eyeballs and pupils. Destruction of this convolution gives data
for regarding it as the cerebral expansion of the optic nerve, and, as sucb,
the seat of visual perception.
    The phenomena resulting from irritation of the superior temporo-
sphenoidal convolution (pricking of the ear, &c.) are indications of exci
tation of ideas of sound. It is regarded as the cerebral termination of
the auditory nerve.       The sense of smell is localized in the uncinate con
volution. The situation of the regions connected with sensations of
taste and touch is not accurately defined, but some facts are given indi
cating their probable locality.

      The occipital lobes do not react on stimulation.    Destruction of these
  lobes caused no loss of sensation or voluntary motion, but an apparent
  abolition of the instincts of self-preservation.
      The corpora striata are shown to be motor in function, and the optic
  thalami sensory.
      Stimulation of the corpora quadrigemina causes dilatation of the
  pupils, opisthotonic contractions, and the utterance of peculiar cries
  when the testes alone are irritated. The nature and signification of these
  phenomena are regarded as still obscure, and requiring further investi
  gation.
     Some experiments have been made on the cerebellum of monkeys.
  They confirm the author's previous views as to the relation of this organ
  to coordination of the optic axes, and the maintenance of bodily equili
  brium.    The experiments are not detailed, as they will form the subject
 of   a future paper.
     New experiments on dogs essentially confirm those already published,
  while many new facts have been elicited.       Those on jackals agree in the
 main with the experiments on dogs, both as to the character of the results
 and the localization of the centres.      New experiments on cats generally
 confirm, as well as further define, the results described by the author in
 his former paper.      The facts of experiment on rabbits, guineapigs, and
 rats are essentially alike, and also confirm former statements.
     In all those animals the sensory regions are defined and their position
 compared with those in the brain of the monkey.
     The only result obtained by stimulation of the cerebral hemispheres
 in pigeons was contraction of the pupil. The region associated with this
 action, situated in the postero-parietal aspect, is compared with a similar
 region in the mammalian brain, and regarded as the seat of visual per
 ception.
     Movements    of the limbs in frogs, and of the tail and fins in fishes (as
 in swimming), can be excited from the cerebral hemispheres in these
animals. Exact localization of motor and sensory centres is not possible.
     The optic lobes in birds, frogs, and fishes seem related to movements
 of flight and progression, in addition to their relation with the eyes.
Similar phenomena result from irritation of the cerebellum; but the
signification_of these is reserved for future inquiry.
    From the data of physiological experiment a foundation is obtained
for constructing an anatomical homology of the convolutions.
    Among other points in homology the fissure of Rolando is shown to
be the homologue of the crucial sulcus in the brain of the Carnivora.
    The whole brain is regarded as divided into sensory and motor regions,
corresponding to the anatomical relation of these regions to the optic tha
lami and corpora striata and the sensory and motor tracts.
    The motor regions are regarded as essential for the execution of
voluntary movements, and       as the seat of a corresponding  motor memory

  motor ideas), the sensory regions being looked upon as the organic seat
of ideas derived from sensory impressions.       An explanation is attempted
of the phenomena of aphasia, and the relation of the memory of words
to the ideas they represent.
   The theory that a certain      action, excited by stimulation of a certain
centre, is the  result  of  a  mental conception is considered and disputed.
From the complexity of mental phenomena, and the participation in them
of both motor and sensory substrata, any system of localization of mental
faculties which does not take both factors into account must be radi
cally false.   A  scientific phrenology is regarded as possible.
   The paper concludes with a short consideration of the relation of the
basal ganglia to the hemispheres.         The view is adopted that they con
stitute  a subvoluntary    or automatic sensori-motor mechanism.

  General Considerations relative     to the Observations  contained  in Sections EL,
        ill., IV. {containing   the developmental    histories of Pisidium, Aplysia,
        Tergipes, Polycera, and Neritina).
     In  these observations the author points out briefly their bearing on two
 matters of theoretical importance, viz. (1) the origin and significance of
 what has been called the GWruZo-phase of development, and (2) the ho
 mologies or homogenies (as the author prefers to say) of the shells, liga
 ments, and internal pens of the Mollusca.            More facts have to be sought
 out and brought to bear on these questions ; but the author, while occu
 pied in that further search, indicates the anticipations which must guide
 and stimulate it. Before doing so he mentions that there are a variety
 of other matters of interest in the facts recorded in the paper which can
 not yet be brought into any theoretical structure, but which are not on
 that account kept back, as they will probably be of some service in their
 isolated condition.
    Kowalevsky was the first to describe, in a precise manner, the forma
 tion of the foundations of the alimentary tract in a developing embryo,
 by invagination of the wall of a simple primitive blastosphere, or hollow
 ball of embryonic cleavage-corpuscles.          He detected this mode of deve
 lopment in Amphioxus, and subsequently in Ascidia. By later researches
 he was able to indicate the same mode of development in certain Vermes
 (Sagitta, Euaxes, Lumbricus) ; and he mentioned incidentally that he had
 observed a similar development in the Heteropodous mollusk Atalanta.
 At that time the author was studying the development of Pisidium and
 Limax, and obtained evidence of the invagination of the primitive blasto
 sphere in those two widely separated mollusks.             Subsequently at Naples
 he found the same process occurring in Nudibranchs. The probable
identity of this process of invagination with that so well known in the
Batrachians, especially through Strieker's admirable work on the subject,
became clear, to those occupied with embryological studies, from the facts
established by Kowalevsky ; and the
                                             " anus of Eusconi " could now be re
                   " orifice of invagination " present in members of the three
cognized in the
large groups of Vermes, Mollusca, and Vertebrata.
    The embryonic form produced by this invagination-process is a simple
sac composed of an ectoderm and endoderm, with an orifice connecting
the exterior with the cavity lined by the endoderm.                It, in short, pre
sents the typical structure      of the  simplest   Ccelenterata,   and corresponds
exactly with the so-called Planula of the polyps and corals.               Hence we
are tempted to see in this primitive invagination-form the representative
of the Coelenterate phase of development of the whole animal kingdom.

231                       Mr. E. R. Lankester        on the            [Mar. 12,
In   a paper published in May 1*873*, containing the substance of lectures
delivered in the preceding October, the author discussed this notion at
some length, and other points connected with the attempt to work out
the correspondences of the embryonal cell-layers of the various groups of
the animal kingdom.           At the end of the year 1872, Professor Hackel's
splendid    Monograph     of  the Calcareous Sponges appeared, in which the
same questions are methodically discussed.           The name Gastrula is given
by   Professor   Hackel    to   the  embryonic form   which the author proposed
to designate by the old name Planula ; and the multicellular blastosphere,
from which the Gastrula is developed, which the author had proposed to
speak of as a Polyplast, he well christens the Morula.          Professor Hackel
was able to show in his monograph that the Calcareous Sponges exhibit a
beautifully definite Gastrula-lstrva,, which swims freely by means of cilia.
Lieberkiihn, Miklucho-Maclay, and Oscar Schmidt had previously shown
that certain sponges exhibit such an embryonic form; but Professor
Hackel described it in many cases, and showed fully its mode of deve
lopment and structure.
    This brings us to an important point in what Hackel calls the "Ga»-
trsea theory "t. The Gastrula form of the Calcareous Sponges is not formed
by invagination, but without any opening in the blastosphere making its
appearance ; the cells constituting its walls divide into an endoderm and
an ectoderm ; then, and not until then, an orifice is formed from the
central cavity to the exterior by a breaking through at one pole.          Careful
accounts of the development of Coelenterata, with a view to determine the
mode of development          of the Planula or Gastrula form in regard to the
question of invagination, are not to hand in a large number of cases.
But, on the one hand, we have Kowalevsky's account of the development
of Pelagia and Actinia, in which the formation of a Gastrula by invagina
tion is described, as in the cases already cited among Vermes, Mollusca,
and Vertebrata ; on the other hand, we have Allman's observations on
the Hydroids, Schultze's            on Cordylophora, Kleinenberg's on Hydra,
Hackel's on the Siphonophora, and Hermann Foil's on the Greryonidae,
in which the ectoderm and endoderm of the embryo (which is at first a
Planula without mouth, then a Gastrula with a mouth) are stated to
                                                  "
arise from the splitting or " delamination          of a single original series of
cells forming the wall of the blastosphere.         Hermann Foil's observations
are of especial value, since he shows most carefully how, from the earliest
period, even when the egg is unicellular, its central part has the character
of the endodermal cells, its peripheral part that of the ectodermal cells.
    The question now arises, can the Gastrulce which arise by invagina
tion be regarded as equivalent to those which arise by internal segrega
tion of an endoderm from an ectoderm ? and if so, which is the typical

1874.]             Developmental History    of the Mollusca.             235
or ancestral mode of development, and what relation has the orifice of
invagination in the one case to the mouth which, later, breaks its way
through in the other ?
    It is not within the scope of the present memoir to discuss these ques
tions at length ; but the author is of opinion that we must regard the
 Gastnda-sws with its endoderm and ectoderm as strictly equivalent (ho
mogenous, to use another expression) in the two sets of cases.        One of
the two methods is the typical or ancestral method of development, and
the departure from it in the other cases is due to some disturbing condi
tion. He believes that we shall be able to make out that disturbing
element in the condition of the egg itself as laid, in the presence in that
egg of a greater or less amount of the adventitious nutritive material
which Edouard van Beneden calls " deutoplasm."         This and certain re
lations of bulk in the early developed organs of the various embryos con
sidered, determine the development either by invagination or by delami-
nation. The relation of bulk to the process of invagination may be illus
trated from a fact established in the preceding communications.            In
Loligo the large otocysts develop, each, by a well-marked invagination of
the epiblast, forming a deep pit which becomes the cavity of the cyst. In
Aplysia the smaller otocysts develop, each, by a simple vacuolation of
the epiblast without invagination.     In Loligo the chief nerve-ganglia de
velop by invagination of the epiblast, in Aplysia by simple thickening.
 Again, in Vertebrata the nerve-cord develops by a long invagination of
the epiblast ; in Tubifex and Lumbricus the corresponding nerve-cord de
 velops by a thickening of the epiblast without any groove and canal of
invagination.
    The bulkier structures in these cases are seen to develop by invagi
nation, the smaller by direct segregation.     Invagination therefore acts as
an economy of material, a hollow mass being produced instead of a solid
 mass of the same extent.
    That the presence of a quantity of deutoplasmic matter, or of a par
 tially assimilated mass of such matter, in the original egg is not accom
 panied by well-marked invagination of the blastosphere, while the absence
 of much deutoplasm is the invariable characteristic of eggs which de
 velop a Gastrula by invagination, is shown by a comparison of Aplysia
and Loligo with Pisidium and Limax, and of the Bird with the Batra-
 chian.   In   some  cases, such as Selenka   has  characterized by the term
 " epiboly," it seems that the enclosure of the large yelk-mass by the over
 growth of cleavage-cells may be held as equivalent to the invagination
 of the large yelk-cells by "emboly;" and the intermediate character
 which the development of Euaxes and Lumbricus present in this respect,
 as described by Kowalevsky, tends very strongly to establish a transition.
    But the mode of development of the Gastrula of Geryonidae, described
 with so much minuteness by Foil, which is obviously the same as that of
 the Gastrulce of Spongiadae  and most Hydroids, is clearly no masked case

230                        Mr. E. R. Lankester          on the               [Mar. 12,
                                                                  "
of invagination.       There is no question of " epiboly            here, but a direct
and simple splitting       of  one cell into two  ;  so that  what   was a sac formed
by a layer of cells one deep, becomes a sac formed by a layer of cells
two deep, or of two layers each one deep.
   It is yet a question for much further inquiry as to how this mode
of forming a double-walled Gastrula can be derived from, or harmonized
with, the formation of Gastrula by the embolic or epibolic forms of inva
gination.
   It would certainly       seem at present    that the orifice of invagination of
the invaginate Gastrula must not be regarded as the equivalent of the
later erupting mouth of the segregate Gastrula*, which is the true per
manent mouth of the Sponge or Ccelenterate.                  In no case is the orifice
of invagination     of  the   invaginate   Gastrula   known     to persist under any
form ; it appears solely to effect the invagination, and when that is
effected vanishes.
   Enough     has been     said to show the importance of observations relating
to the Gastrula-ph&se of development.            In the paper well-marked inva
ginate Gastrula are described from : —
   1.   Pisidium (Lamellibranch).
   2. Tergipes (JNudibranch).
   3. Polycera (Nudibranch).
   4. Limax (Pulmonate).
   5. Limnceus     (Pulmonate).
   In addition     to these cases of the development of invaginate Gastrula
among Mollusca, the examination of the very beautiful figures in the
papers of Loven on molluscan development leaves no doubt that he
has   observed invaginate Gastrula in the following cases,                 but has not
understood their structure : —
   6.   Cardium (Lamellibranch).
   7. Crendla (Lamellibranch).
   Similarly, Karl Vogt's observations on           Actceo-n  indicate the same state
of things as the author has pointed out in Polycera ; and hence we mav
add :—
   8. Actaon    (Nudibranch),
and, finally, from Kowalevsky's statement, though not accompanied                     by
figure or description,
   9. Atalanta    (Heteropod).
   The second matter of theoretical interest (namely, the early features
in the development of the shell) has not been previously discussed, since
the structures described in the paper as shell-patch, shell-groove, and
shell-plug were unknown.
   If,  as seems    justifiable,   the Cephalopoda are to be regarded as more

that it may be so regarded.

  nearly representing the molluscan type than do the other          classes, or, in
  other words, more closely resemble the ancestral forms than they do, we
  might look, in the course of the development of the less typical Mollusca,
  for some    indication of   a representative  of the internal pen of the higher
  Cephalopoda.       We might expect to find some indication of the connexion
  between    this and   the calcareous shell of other forms ; in fact the original
 shell of all Mollusca should be an internal one, or bear indications of a
  possible developmeut into that condition.
     In Pisidium, in Aplysia, and in Neritina the author has submitted evi
  dence of the existence of a specially differentiated patch of epidermic
 cells at the aboral "pole, which develops a deep furrow, groove, or pit in
 its centre almost amounting to a sac-like cavity opening to the exterior.
 The first (chitinous) rudiment of the shell appears as a disk on the sur
 face of this gland ; but also, in some cases, the cavity or groove is filled by
 a chitinous plug.
     Let the walls of the sac close and the activity of its lining cells con
 tinue, and we have the necessary conditions for the growth of such
 a " pen as that of the Deeapodous Cephalopoda.
           "
     At present the details of the development of the " pen " in the Cepha
 lopoda are not fully known ; but the author has evidence that it is formed
 in an enclosed sac-like diverticulum of the epidermis, but he has not yet
 ascertained the earliest condition of this sac.      The history of its develop
 ment becomes surrounded with additional interest in relation to the shell-
 gland of the other Mollusca.
    The position of the groove of the shell-gland in Pisidium suggests a
 possible connexion of its chitinous plug with the ligament, which it will
 be worth inquiring into in other developmental histories of Lamellibranchs.
    The internal shells of other Mollusca besides the cuttlefish are cer
tainly not in some cases (e. g. Aplysia) primitively internal, but become
enclosed by overspreading folds of the mantle.          But in the case of Limax
and its allies,   it is possible, though the matter requires renewed investiga
tion, that the shell is      a primitively internal one representing the shell-
plug.
    There is yet one more possible connexion of this shell-gland and plug :
this is the chitinous secretion by which Terebratula and its allies fix
themselves to rocks &c. The position of the peduncle exactly corre
sponds to that of the shell-gland; and an examination of Professor
Morse's recently published account of the development of Terebratulina
leaves little doubt that at the pole of attachment, which very early deve
lops its function and fixes the embryo, an m-pushing occurs, and a kind
of shallow gland is formed which gives rise to the horny cement. The
author's own observations on the development            of Terebratula vitrea do
not extend to so early a period as this.
    It is perhaps scarcely necessary, in conclusion, to point out the close
resemblance of shell-gland and plug to the byssal gland and its secretion.

II. " On    a New Deep-sea Thermometer."              By Henry Negretti
       and Joseph Warren Zambra.              Communicated by Dr. Car
       penter, F.R.S. Received March 5, 1874.
   The Fellows of the Royal Society are perfectly aware of the assistance
afforded by Her Majesty's Government (at the request of the Royal
Society) for the purpose of deep-sea investigations, and have been made
acquainted with their results by the Reports of those investigations
                                                           '

published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society            and by the in
teresting work of Professor "Wyville Thomson.         Among other subjects,
that of the temperature of the sea at various depths, and on the bottom
itself, is of the greatest importance.     The Fellows are also aware that
for this purpose a peculiar thermometer was and is used, having its
bulb protected by an outer bulb or casuig, in order that its indications
may not be vitiated by the pressure of the water at various depths, that
pressure being about 1 ton per square inch to every 800 fathoms.          This
thermometer, as regards the protection of the bulb and its non-liability
to  be affected by pressure, is all that can be desired ; but unfortunately
the only thermometer available for the purpose of registering tempera
 ture and bringing those indications to the surface is that w-hich is
 commonly known as the Six's thermometer — an instrument acting by
means of alcohol and mercury, and having movable indices with delicate
 springs of human hair tied to them.             This form of instrument
registers both maximum and minimum temperatures, and as an ordinary
out-door thermometer it is very useful ; but it is unsatisfactory          for
scientific purposes, and for the object which it is now used (viz. the
 determination   of deep-sea temperatures) it    leaves  much to be desired.
Thus the alcohol and mercury are liable to get mixed in travelling, or
even by merely holding the instrument in a horizontal position; the
indices also are liable either to slip if too free, or to stick if too tight.
A sudden jerk or concussion will also cause the instrument to give
erroneous readings by lowering the indices, if the blow be downwards,
or by raising them, if the blow be upwards.         Besides these drawbacks,
the Six's thermometer causes the observer additional anxiety on the score
of inaccuracy ; for, although we get a minimum temperature, we are
by no means sure of the point where this minimum lies. Thus Professor
"Wyville Thomson says (' Depths of the Sea,' p. 139):—" The determina
tion of temperature has hitherto rested chiefly upon the registration of
minimum     thermometers.    It is obvious that the temperature    registered

1874.]                 on a New Deep-sea     Thermometer.                   239
by minimum      thermometers sunk to the bottom of the sea, even       if their
registration were unaffected by the pressure, would only give the lowest
temperature reached somewhere between top and bottom, not necessarily
at the bottom itself.     The temperatures at various depths might indeed
(provided they nowhere increased on going deeper) be determined by a
series of minimum thermometers placed at different distances along the
line, though this would involve considerable difficulties.           Still, the
liability of the index to slip, and the probability that the indication of
the thermometers would be affected by the great pressure to which they
were exposed, rendered it very desirable to control their indications by
an independent method."        Again, at page 299, we find : — " I ought to
mention that in taking the bottom temperature with the Six's thermo
meter the instrument simply indicates the lowest temperature to which
it   has  been  subjected ; so that if the bottom water were warmer than
any other stratum through which the thermometer had passed, the
observations would be erroneous."        Undoubtedly this would be the case
in extreme latitudes, or in any spot where the temperature of the air is
colder    than that   of the ocean. Certainly the instrument might be
warmed previous to lowering ; but if the coldest water should be on the
surface, no reading, to be depended upon, could be obtained.
     It was on reading these passages in the book above referred to that      it
became a     matter of serious consideration with us whether a thermometer
 could be    constructed which could not possibly be put out of order in
travelling or by incautious handling, and which should be above suspicion
 and perfectly trustworthy in its indications.      This was no very easy task.
 But the instrument     now  submitted  to the  Fellows  of the Royal Society
 seems to us to fulfil the above onerous conditions, being constructed on
 a plan different from that of any other self-registering thermometers,
 and containing as it does nothing but mercury, neither alcohol, air, nor
 indices.    Its construction is most novel, and may be said to overthrow
 our previous ideas of handling delicate instruments, inasmuch as its
 indications are only given by upsetting the instrument.          Having said
 this much, it will not be very difficult to guess the action of the thermo
 meter ; for it is by upsetting or throwing out the mercury from the in
 dicating column into a reservoir at a particular moment and in a par
 ticular spot that we obtain a correct reading of the temperature at that
 moment and in that spot.       First of all it must be observed that this in
 strument has a protected bulb, in order to resist pressure.         This pro
 tected bulb is on the principle devised by us some sixteen years since,
 when we supplied a considerable number of thermometers thus protected
 to the Meteorological Department of the Board of Trade ; and they are
  described by the late Admiral FitzEoy in the first Number of the
  •
    Meteorological Papers,' page 55, published July 5th, 1857.       Eef erring

  delicate bulbs being compressed by the great pressure of the ocean, he

  sayS  : — "With  a view to obviate this   failing, Messrs. Negretti and Zambra
  undertook to make a case for the weak bulbs, which should transmit
  temperature, but resist pressure.        Accordingly a tube of thick glass is
  sealed outside the delicate bulb, between which and the casing is a space
  all round, which is nearly filled with mercury.          The small space not so
  filled is a vacuum, into which the mercury can be expanded, or forced by
  heat or mechanical compression, without doing injury to
  or even compressing the inner or much more delicate
  bulb."
      The thermometers now in use in the 'Challenger' Expe
  dition are on this principle, the only difference being that
  the protecting chamber has been partly filled with alcohol
  instead of with mercury ; but that has nothing to do with
  the principle of the invention.
      "We have therefore   a protected   bulb thermometer, like
  a siphon   with parallel legs, all in one piece, and having a
  continuous communication, as in the annexed figure. The                 'j

  scale of this thermometer is pivoted on a centre, and
  being attached in a perpendicular position to a simple
 apparatus (which will be presently described), is lowered
 to any depth that may be desired. In its descent the
                 acts as an ordinary   instrument,    the mercury
 thermometer^
 rising or falling according to the temperature of the stratum
 through which it passes ; but so soon as the descent
 ceases, and a reverse motion is given to the line, so as to
 pull the thermometer to the surface, the instrument turns
 once on its centre, first bulb uppermost, and afterwards
 bulb downwards.        This causes the mercury, which was
 in the left-hand column, first to pass into the dilated si
 phon bend at the top, and thence into the right-hand tube,
 where it remains, indicating on a graduated scale the ex
act temperature at the time it was turned over. The wood
cut shows the position of the mercury after the instrument
has been thus turned on its centre.        A   is the bulb ; B the
outer coating or protecting cylinder         ; C is the space of
rarefied air, which is reduced if the outer casing be com
pressed ; D is a small glass plug on the principle of our
Patent Maximum Therritometer, which cuts off. in the
moment of turning, the mercury in the column from
that of the bulb in the tube, thereby ensuring that none
but the mercury in the tube can be transferred into
the indicating column ; E is an enlargement made in the
bend so as to enable the mercury to pass quickly from
one tube to another in revolving ; and F is the
                                                        indicating

the thermometer is put in motion, and immediately the tube has acquired
a slightly oblique position, the mercury breaks off at the point D, runs
 into the curved and enlarged portion E, and eventually falls into the
tube    F, when this tube resumes its original perpendicular position.
     The contrivance for turning the thermometer over may be described as
a short length of wood or metal having attached to it a small rudder or
fan ; this fan is placed on a pivot in connexion with a second, and on
this second pivot is fixed the thermometer.        The fan or rudder points up
wards in its descent through the water, and necessarily reverses its posi
tion in ascending.     This simple motion or half turn of the rudder gives
a whole turn to the thermometer, and has been found very effective.
    Various other methods may be used for turning the thermometer,
such, as a simple pulley with a weight which might be released on touching
the bottom, or a small vertical propeller which would revolve in passing
through the water.

I. " Preliminary Notice of         Experiments       concerning  the Chemical
        Constitution of Saline Solutions." By Walter Noel Hartley,
        F.C.S., Demonstrator of Chemistry, King's College, London.
        Communicated by Professor Stokes, Sec. R.S.                   Received
        February 3, 1874.
    The author   has been engaged     in investigating the above subject during
 the last eighteen months, and his experiments being still in progress, he
 thinks it desirable to place the following observations on record.
     In the examination of the absorption-spectra, as seen in wedge-shaped
 cells, of the principal salts of cerium, cobalt, copper, chromium, didymium,
 nickel, palladium, and uranium, to the number of nearly sixty different
 solutions, it was noticed that the properties of the substances in regard
  to changes of colour could be ascertained by noticing the absorption-
  curves and bands, so that, provided water be without chemical action,
  it could be foreseen what change would occur on dilution of a saturated
  solution.
                    The effect of Heat on Absorption-spectra.
     When saturated solutions of coloured salts are heated to 100°       C,  1st,

 there are few cases in which no change is noticed.       2ndly, generally the
 amount of light transmitted is diminished        to a small extent by some of
 the more refrangible, the less refrangible, or both kinds of rays being
 obstructed.    3rdly, there is frequently a complete difference in the
 nature    of the transmitted light.      Anhydrous salts not decomposed,
 hydrated compounds not dehydrated at 100° C, and salts which do not
 change colour on dehydration, give little or no alteration in their spectra
 when heated.
    Solutions of hydrated salts, and most notably those of haloid com
 pounds, do change ; and the alteration is, if not identical with, similar to
that produced by dehydration and the action of dehydrating liquids, such
as alcohol, acids, and glycerine, on the salts in crystals or solution.
    A particular instance of the action of heat on an aqueous solution is
that of cobalt chloride, which gives a different series of dark bands in
the red part of the spectrum at different temperatures, ranging between
23° C. and 73° C. Band after band of shadow intercepts the red rays as
the temperature rises, till finally nothing but the blue are transmitted.
 Drawings of six different spectra of this remarkable nature have been
made.     The changes are most marked between 33° and 53°, when the
temperature may be told almost to a degree by noting the appearance of
the spectrum.      Though to the unaided eye cobalt bromide appears to
undergo    the same  change, yet, as seen with the spectroscope, it is not of
so curious a character, the bands being not so numerous.
   With cobalt iodide  a band of red light is transmitted at low temperatures ;
the band of light moves towards the opposite end of the spectrum, with rise
of temperature, until it is transferred to such a position that it consists of
green rays only.     In this instance the change to the eye is more striking
when seen without the spectroscope, because the mixtures of red, yellow,
and green rays, which are formed during the transition, give rise to very
beautiful shades of brown and olive-green.         Thus a saturated solution at
16° C. was of a brown colour, at — 10° C. it became of a fiery red and
crystals separated, at +10° reddish brown, at 20° the same, at 35°
Vandyke brown, at 45° a cold brown tint with a tinge of yellowish green,
at 55° a decidedly yellowish green in thin layers and yellow-brown in
thick, at 65° greenish brown, thin layers green, and at 75° olive-green.
An examination of this cobalt salt has shown that there are two distinct
crystalline hydrates — the one, formed at high temperatures, has the
formula Co Cla,2H20, and is of a dark green colour ; the other, which
contains a much larger proportion of crystalline water, Co CI,, 611,0,
is produced at a low temperature, and its colour is generally brown,
in cold weather inclining to red.
   The action of heat on solutions of didymium is characterized by a
broadening of the black lines seen in the spectrum, more especially of
the important band in the yellow ; and in the case of potassio-didymium
nitrate, this is accompanied by the formation of a new line.        In the case

                          Ther mo-chemical   Experiments.
   Regnauld (Institut,     1864  ; Jahresbericht, 1864, p. 99) has shown that
on diluting a saturated solution of a salt, as a rule there is an absorption
of heat ; but in one or two cases he noticed that heat was evolved. The
 change in colour that takes place on the dilution of saturated solutions of
cobalt iodide, cupric chloride, bromide, and acetate is very remarkable.
There is every likelihood that this phenomenon is due in each case to the
formation of    a liquid hydrate. It is impossible of belief that accompanying
such a circumstance there should be no measurable development of heat;
and the author's experiments have proved that in the above cases, at any
rate, the heat disengaged is very considerable — amounting, for instance,
on the part of cupric chloride, at least to about 2565 units when 1 gram
molecule of the crystalline salt is dissolved in its minimum of water at
16° C. and brought into contact with sufficient to make the addition of
40 Aq.      These numbers     only roughly approximate to the truth.         On
diluting   a solution of cobalt iodide till the red colour appears, the thermal
effect must be much greater, as not only does it register several degrees
on an ordinary thermometer, but it may be perceived by the hand.
   The conclusions indicated by these results are obvious, but it is beyond
the scope of this paper to refer to them.          The writer hopes before long
to complete his experiments     with  the view of having them communicated
to the Royal Society.

   If   the subcutaneous connective tissue of the new-born rat* is exa
mined under the microscope in an indifferent fluid, it is found to consist
chiefly of an almost homogeneous hyaline ground-substance, which is
traversed by a few wavy fibres, and has a considerable number of exceed
ingly delicate, more or less flattened cells scattered throughout the tissue.
The cells here spoken of are of course the connective-tissue corpuscles.
They are not much branched as a rule (at any rate their branches do not
extend far from the body of the corpuscle), and they are mainly distin
guished by the extraordinary amount of vacuolation which they exhibit
                                                                             —
by which is meant the formation within the protoplasm of minute clear
spherules, less refractive than that substance, and probably, therefore,
spaces in it containing a watery fluid. The nuclei, of which there is
generally not more than one in each cell, are frequently obscured by the
vacuoles, but, when visible, are seen to be round or oval in shape and

beautifully clear and homogeneous ; they commonly contain either one
or two nucleoli.   It is from these cells that the blood-vessels of the tissue
are formed, and within them, red, and perhaps also, white blood-cor
puscles become developed.
   Of the vacuolated cells above described some possess a distinct reddish
tinge, either pretty evenly diffused over the whole corpuscle, or in one or
more patches, not distinctly circumscribed, but fading off into the sur
rounding protoplasm.     Others contain either one, two, or a greater num
ber of reddish globules, consisting apparently of haemoglobin. These vary
in size, from'minute specks to spherules as large as, or even larger than,
the red corpuscles of the adult : in cells which are apparently least deve
loped it is common to find them of various sizes in the same cell ; whereas
cells which are further advanced in development are not uncommonly
crowded with hemoglobin-globules,      tolerably equal in point of size, and
differing  from the adult  corpuscle only  in shape. It is important to re
mark that there    is,at no time, an indication of any structure within the
globules resembling     nucleus
                         a       :the nucleus of the cell also appears, up to
this point at least, to undergo no change. In fact the formation of the
 haemoglobin-globules reminds one rather of        adeposit within the cell-
substance such as occurs in developing fat-cells, the difference being that
in the latter case the deposited globules eventually run together into one
drop, whereas in the former they remain distinct as they increase in size
and eventually take on the flattened form.
   Before, however, this change occurs in the haemoglobin-globules, the
cells containing them become lengthened, and are soon found each to
contain a  cavity, within which the globules now He.   This cavity   pro          is
bably formed by coalescence of the vacuoles of the cell, or, what amountB
                 a

of the rest into it. The cell now comes to resemble       segment of

nucleus is  imbedded) enclosing blood-corpuscles in fluid— blood, in fact.

   Two or more such cells may become united at their ends, communi        a
cation being established between their cavities indeed, by aid of branches

sent out from the sides     number of cells may unite to form

Ev entually, however, these last become united with the newly developed
capillaries, and the blood contained in the latter thus gets into the
general circulation.
   With regard to the mode of junction of the capiUary-forming cells with
one another, and with processes from preexisting capillaries, has seemedit
to me to occur most commonly, not by growing together of their ex

quently hollowed by an extension into them of the cavity of the cell or
capillary, the partition between the two being finally absorbed.
    The best preparations for demonstrating the facts above described are
obtained from the subcutaneous tissue of the upper part of the fore limb,
and from that under the skin of the back — regions in which, in the adult
rat, this tissue becomes almost entirely converted into fat. Even in the
new-born animal some portions have already undergone this change ; and
it is principally in the neighbourhood of such patches that the hrema-
poietic cells are met with. It is only when the young rats are not more
than a few days old that the formation of blood-vessels is preceded by a
development of blood-corpuscles within the same cells as form the vessels :
in such other animals   as I have hitherto  examined this phenomenon seems
to occur only whilst still in  the foetal state. The immature condition in
•which the young of the rat are brought forth is sufficient to account for
this difference.
    The observations here recorded as to the intracellular development of
blood-corpuscles are in many respects in accordance with what has already
 been described by others as occurring in the area vascuhsa and other parts
of the embryo chick.     It has not, however, appeared desirable to enter
 into the literature of the subject in this brief notice.
 III. " On     the Attractions   of Magnets and Electric Conductors."
        By George Goke, F.R.S. Received January 27, 1874.
     Being desirous of ascertaining whether, in the case of two parallel
 wires conveying electric currents, the attractions and repulsions were
 between the currents themselves or the substances conveying them, and
 believing this question had not been previously settled,     I made the fol
 lowing experiment :—
     I passed a powerful voltaio current through the thick copper
                                                                   wire of a
 large electromagnet, and then divided it equally between two
                                                                     vertical
                                                                       six or
 pieces of thin platinum wire of equal diameter and length (about
  seven centimetres), so as to make them equally white-hot, the two wires
  being attached to two horizontal cross wires of copper.
     On approaching the two vertical wires symmetrically towards the
  vertical face of one pole of the horizontally placed magnet, and at equal
  distances from it, so that the two downward currents in them might be
  equally acted upon by the downward and upward portions respectively
  of the currents which circulated round the magnet-pole, the one was
  strongly bent towards and the other from the pole, as was, of course,
  expected ; but not the least sign of alteration of relative temperature
                                                                            of
  the two wires could be perceived, thereby proving that not even a small
   proportion of the current was repulsed from the repelled wire or drawn
  into the attracted one, as would have occurred had the attraction and
  repulsion taken place, even to    a moderate degree, between the currents

themselves    ;   and   I therefore       conclude that     theattractions and repulsions
of   electric conductors    are not exerted          between the currents themselves, but
between the substances conveying them.
  Some important coasequences appear to flow from this conclusion,
especially when it is considered in connexion with Ampere's theory of
magnetism, and with the molecular changes produced in bodies generally
by electric currents and by magnetism.
   As every molecular disturbance produces an electric alteration in bodies,
so, conversely, the discoveries of numerous investigators have shown that
every electric current passing near or through a substance produces a
molecular change, which is rendered manifest in all metals, liquid con
ductors, and even in the voltaic arc by the development of sounds, espe
cially if the substances are under the influence of two currents at right
angles to each other.   In iron it is conspicuously shown also by electro-
torsion, a phenomenon         I
                           have found and recently made known in a paper
read before the Royal Society.
   Numerous facts also support the conclusiou that the molecular changes
referred to last as long as the current. De la Rive has shown that a rod
                                      '
of iron, either transmitting or encircled by an electric current, emits, as
long as the current lasts, a different sound when struck ; and we know it
also exhibits magnetism.     The peculiar optical properties of glass and
other bodies with regard to polarized light discovered by Faraday also
continue as long as the current.     A rod of iron also remains twisted as
long  as it transmits and  is encircled  by electric currents ; and in steel
and iron the molecular change (like magnetism) partly remains after the
currents cease, and enables the bar to remain twisted.
   That the peculiar molecular structure produced in bodies generally by
the action of electric currents also possesses a definite direction with re
gard to that of the current, is shown by the rigidly definite direction of
action of magnetized glass and many other transparent bodies upon polar
ized light, also by the difference of conductivity for heat and for elec
tricity in a plate of iron parallel or transverse to electric currents, by
the stratified character of electric discharges in rarefied gases " and
the action of electric currents upon                  it,
                                              and especially by the pheno
mena of electro-torsion.    In the latest example an upward current pro
duces reverse direction of twist to
        a                               downward one, and a right-handed
                                                 a
current develops an opposite torsion to       left-handed one

latter are each internally different from the former.       As each of these
four torsions    an outward manifestation of the collective result of inter
                  is
nal molecular disturbance and possesses different properties, these four
cases prove the existence of four distinct molecular movements and four
corresponding directions of structure; and the phenomena altogether
are of the most rigidly definite character.                        .    .   •

stead of attraction must be due to difference of direction of structure pro
duced by difference of direction of the currents.
   Although the Amperean theory has rendered immense service to mag
netic science, and agrees admirably with all the phenomena of electro
magnetic attraction, repulsion, and motion, it is in some respects defec
tive ; it assumes that magnetism is due to innumerable little electric
currents continually circulating in one uniform direction round the mo
lecules of the iron ; but there is no known instance of electric currents
being maintained without the consumption of power, and in magnets
there is no source of power ; electric currents also generate heat, but a
magnet is not a heated body.
   If, however, we substitute the view that the phenomena of attraction
and repulsion of magnets are due, not to continuously circulating electric
currents, but (as in electric wires) to definite directions of molecular
structure, such as is shown by the phenomena of electro-torsion to really
exist in them, the theory becomes more perfect. It would also agree with
the fact that iron and steel have the power of retaining both magnetism
and the electro-torsional   state after the currents or other causes producing
them have ceased.
.  According so this view, a magnet, like a spring, is not a source of
power, but only an arrangement for storing it up, the power being re
                                                                              "
tained by some internal disposition of its particles acting like a " ratchet
and termed " coercive power."        The fact that a magnet becomes warm
when its variations of magnetism are great aud rapidly repeated, does
not contradict this view, because we know it has then, like any other
conductor of electricity, electric currents induced in it, and these develop
heat by conduction-resistance.
    According also to this view, any method which will produce the requi
site direction of structure in a body will impart to it the capacity of being
acted upon by a magnet ; and any substance, ferruginous or not, which
possesses   that structure has that capacity ; and, in accordance with this,
we find that a crystal of cyanite (a silicate of alumina) possesses the pro
perty, whilst freely suspended, of pointing north and south by the direc
tive influence of terrestrial magnetism, and one of stannite (oxide of tin)
points east and west under the same conditions.

       Professor of Natural History in Owens College, Manchester.
       Received March 18, 1874.
                                   (Abstract.)
    The author called attention to the various methods of classifying the
fern-stems and petioles of the Coal-measures adopted by Cotta, Corda,
 Brongniart, and others, and to the difficulties which attend those methods.
 Some of those difficulties had been already felt and partially removed by
 M. Brongniart.        All the generic distinctions hitherto adopted were
 based upon variations in the form, number, and arrangement of the vas
 cular bundles.    These elements vary so much, not only in different species
 of the same genus, but in different parts of the same petiole, as to make
 them most untrustworthy guides to generic distinctions. The consequence
 has been an enormous       multiplication of genera ; but, notwithstanding
 their number, the author found that if he adopted the methods of his pre
 decessors he would have to establish additional ones for the reception of
 his new forms.     Under these circumstances he decides that it will be
 better to include the entire series of these petioles, provisionally, under the
 common generic term of Rachiopterit,       This plan dispenses with a number
 of meaningless genera, and is rendered additionally desirable by the cir
 cumstance that all the petioles to which these numerous generic names
 have been applied belong to fronds which have already received other
 names, such as Peeopteris, Sphenopteris, &c., only the structure of fronds
 found in the shales, and their respective petioles of which we have ascer
  tained the structure, have not yet been correlated.
     As a preparation for the present investigation, the author made an ex
  tensive series of researches amongst recent British and foreign fern-stems
 and petioles, with the object of ascertaining not only the modifications in
  their arrangements in different parts of the same plant, but especially of
  studying the modes in which secondary and tertiary vascular bundles
  were derived from the primary ones. This inquiry led him over the
  ground previously traversed by M. Trecul, and, so far as British ferns
  were concerned, by Mr. Church.
     The most common general forms         exhibited  by transverse   sections of

these bundles in recent petioles may be represented by the letters H, T,
U, and X. As a general rule, the secondary bundles are given off from
that part of the primary one which happens to be nearest to the secondary
rachis to be supplied.      Thus in some cases the upper arms of the X will
merely   be  prolonged    and their ends detached ; in other cases a loop pro
jects from the side of one or both arms of the U, and becomes detached
as a  ring.
   The first petiole, described under the name of Bachiopteris aspera, is
one in which transverse sections of the central vascular bundle exhibit
modifications of the H form at its base, separating into two contiguous
bundles higher up, and ultimately reverting to the V form — the gutter-
shaped bundle {en gouttiere) of M. Trecul.        This is the plant to which, on
a previous occasion, the author proposed to assign the generic name of
Edraxylon (Proc. Boy. Soc. vol. xx. p. 438).           The vessels are chiefly
reticulate, with some of the barred and spiral types.            The bark con
sists of a delicate inner parenchyma, the cubical cells of which are arranged
vertically. This is. enclosed in a coarser middle parenchyma, and the
whole is surrounded by an outer layer, composed of intermingled paren
chyma and prosenchyma, the latter being disposed in vertical fibrous
bands, having wedge-shaped transverse sections, and being modifications
of the sclerenchyma of authors.       The outer surface of the bark is covered
with innumerable little, obtuse, projecting cellular appendages, which are
obviously abortive hairs.      These appendages are relatively larger in the
smaller rachis than in the larger petioles.      In very young petioles trans
verse bands of      small  consolidated  cells traverse the bark at numerous
points, reminding us of the similar conditions seen in the Heterangium
 Grievii, described in a previous memoir.         In the larger petioles these
cellular bands have disappeared, and left in their places large intercellular
lacuna}.    Numerous fragments of the terminal rachis of the above plant
have been obtained with the leaflets attached. For a long time the author
believed that he could identify these with the detached leaflets of a Pe-
copteris, which are very abuudant in the Oldham nodules; but later
researches have led to the conclusion that the plant has been a Spheno-
pteris, closely allied to, if not identical with, the S. Hoeninghausi of
Brongniart. The author proposes the provisional name of Bachiopteris
aspera for the above plant.
   The next petiole described is one to which Mr. Binney proposed
(' Proceedings of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester,'
Jan. 9, 1872) to give the name of Stauropteris Oldhamia. This is one of
the plants of which the vascular bundle, when seen in transverse section,
exhibits the appearance of the letter X. The vessels composing this
bundle are barred ones ; they are sometimes grouped in four slightly
coherent clusters, with some delicate, vertically elongated cells in or near
their central point of conjunction.      The same kind of cellular tissue sur
rounds the bundle, forming a thin layer, which passes rapidly into a very

 thick layer, of coarse prosenchyma, and which has evidently been hard and
 woody, as in many of the recent Adiantiums.                Towards the upper part
  of the petiole the vascular bundle becomes distinctly consolidated into a
 single cluster of crucial form ; it then passes into a somewhat trifid form,
 and ultimately into a small cylindrical one. This petiole has branched
 much more freely than any of the others described.                 Two of the extre
  mities of the crucial arms of the vascular bundle become first enlarged
 and then detached as two secondary bundles, which generally have an
 irregularly triangular transverse section, with long arms to the triangle.
 These triangular bundles are altogether different from the central axis of
AsterophyUites described in a preceding memoir. The ultimate subdivisions
 of these secondary branches look more like the terminations of cylindrical
 rootlets than of petioles — which fact, combined with the circumstance that
 no traces of leaflets have been found associated with any of these ultimate
 twigs, renders the petiolar nature of this plant open to question, though
 the arguments in favour of its being a branching fern-petiole preponderate
 over those which militate against that conclusion.            The author designates
this plant Bachiopteris Oldhamia.
     The next plant described is an exquisitely beautiful petiole from Burnt
 island, to two detached portions of which the author has already assigned
 the names of Arpexylon duplex and A. simplex*, but which two forms he
 now proves to belong to the same plant. In the matured petiole the
 vascular bundle is always a double one.               There is a central bundle,
 exhibiting a transverse section shaped like an hour-glass, one side of
 which is truncated and the other rounded, with a free, narrow, crescentic
band at the more truncate of its enlarged extremities.                 At each of these
extremities of the central bundle there is a longitudinal groove, which is
shallow on the truncated side nearest to the crescentic bundle, but so sur
rounded by small vessels at the opposite convex side as often to become
 converted into a longitudinal canal. The hour-glass bundle always reap
 pears in various specimens under the same aspect ; but the crescentic one
divides into two lateral halves, and the ends of each of these two subdivided
parts curl under their more central portions.            We thus obtain two of the
crescentic   structures previously designated Arpexylon simplex.                 These
crescents are traced outwards through the barkto lateral secondary rachides.
The vessels thus detached from the truncated side of the central hour
glass bundle now reappear at its opposite and more convex side, whence,
in turn, they again become detached ; so that the truncate surface with
its crescentic appendage, and the more oblate one with its almost closed
canal, have alternately reversed their positions in the petiole as each
secondary rachis was given ofE.         Alternating distichous tertiary rachides
spring from these secondary ones.

Eenault, underthe names of Zygopteris Lacattii and Z.bibractiensis, are next

examined*. In these plants the section of the central bundle exhibits a
form of the letter H. The vessels of the large central transverse bar are all
reticulated ones : the greater part of those of the terminal vertical bars
are of the same character ; but the outermost vessels of those latter
structures are barred or quasi-scalariform.          As in the case of R. duplex,
already described, these outermost layers of barred vessels, accompanied
by a few reticulated ones, become detached alternately from opposite sides
of the H-shaped central bundle. Passing quickly through a thin delicate
cellular inner bark, they enter the coarser parenchyma of a middle one,
as two irregular clusters of vessels with one common investment pro
longed from the innermost bark.         On reaching the outer bark they become
two distinct cylindrical bundles, each with its own delicate cortical
investing layer ; and thus invested, they emerge from the primary petiole
to supply the secondary rachis.
    The Oldham specimens of Machiopteris bibractiensis agree with those
described by M. Benault in having all their vessels of the barred type.
The outer bark projects at numerous points in large conical abortive
hairs, which almost assume a spinous aspect.
    The author further figures and describes the section of a vascular axis,
 with a central cellular medulla surrounded by five contiguous crescentic
 masses of vascular tissue, whose concavities are directed outwards.             This
 plant appears  identical   with the Anarcliopteris     Decaisnii  of Benault.
 II. " On    the Motions of some of the Nebulae towards                      or from
       the Earth."      By William Httggins, D.C.L., LL.D., F.B.S.
       Beceived January 26, 1874.
    The observations on the motions of some of the stars towards and
 from the earth which     I had the honour to present to the Boyal Society
 in 1872 appeared to show, from the position in the heavens of the
 approaching and receding stars, as well as from the relative velocities of
 their approach and recession, that the sun's motion in space could not be
                                                       " There can be little doubt
 regarded as the sole cause of these motions.
 but that in the observed stellar movements we have to do with two other
 independent motions — namely, a movement common to certain groups
of stars, and also a motion peculiar to each star"t.
    It presented itself to me as a matter of some importance to en
 deavour to extend this inquiry to the nebulas, as it seemed possible
that some light might be thrown on the cosmical relations of the gaseous
 nebulas to the stars and to our stellar system by observations of their
 motions of recession and of approach.

myself of the nights sufficiently fine (unusually few even for our un
favourable climate) to make observations on this point.
    The inquiry was found to be one of great difficulty, from the faintness
 of the objects and the very minute alteration in position in the spectrum
which had to be observed.
    At first the inquiry appeared hopeless, from the circumstance that the
brightest line in the nebular spectrum is not sufficiently coincident in
character and position with the brightest line in the spectrum of nitrogen
to permit this line to be used as a fiducial line of comparison.             The line
in the spectrum of the nebula) is narrow and defined, while the line of
nitrogen is double, and each component is nebulous and broader than
the line of the nebula).         The nebular line is apparently coincident
with the middle of the less refrangible line of the double line of ni
 trogen*.
    The third and fourth lines of the nebular spectrum are undoubtedly
those of hydrogen ; but their great faintness makes it impossible to use
them as lines of comparison under the necessary conditions of great dis
persive power, except in the case of the brightest nebula).
    The second line, as   I  showed in the paper to which         I  have referred, is
sensibly coincident with an iron line, wave-length 495- 7 ; but this line is
inconveniently faint, except in the brightest nebula).
    In the course of some other experiments my attention was directed to
a line in the spectrum of lead which falls upon the less refrangible of the
components of the double line of nitrogen.           This line appeared to meet
the requirements of the case, as it is narrow, of a width corresponding to
fhe slit, defined at both edges, and in the position in the spectrum of the
brightest of the lines of the nebulae.
                           I
   In December 1872 compared this line directly with the first line in
the spectrum of the Great Nebula in Orion.            I  was delighted to find this
line sufficiently coincident in position to serve as a fiducial line of com
parison.
   I  am not prepared to say that the coincidence is perfect ; on the con
trary,  I believe that if greater prism-power could be brought to bear
upon   the  nebula), the line in the lead spectrum would be found to be in
a small degree more refrangible       than the line in the nebula).
   The spectroscope employed in these observations contains two com
pound prisms, each giving a dispersion of 9° 6' from A to H.                 A mag-
nifying-power    of  16 diameters   was  used.
   In the simultaneous observation of the two lines it was found that if
the lead line was made rather less bright than the nebular line, the small
excess of apparent breadth of this latter line, from its greater brightness,
appeared to overlap the lead line to a very small amount on its less
refrangible side, so that the more refrangible sides of the two lines
appeared to be in a straight line across the spectrum.            This line could be

therefore    conveniently   employed as a fiducial line in the observations   I
had   in  view.
    In   my own map of the spectrum of lead this line is not given.         In
Thalen's map (1868) the line is represented by a short line to show that,
under the conditions of spark under which Thalen observed, this line was
emitted by those portions only of the vapour of lead which are close to
the electrodes.
    I find that by alterations of the character of the spark this line becomes
long, and reaches from electrode to electrode. As some of those conditions
(such as the absence of the Leyden jars, or the close approximation of
the electrodes when the Leyden jars are in circuit) are those in which the
lines of nitrogen of the air in which the spark is taken are faint or
absent, the circumstance of the line becoming bright and long or faint
and short, inversely as the line of nitrogen, suggested to me the possi
bility that the line might be due not to the vapour of lead, but to some
combination of nitrogen under the presence of lead vapour.            As, how
ever, this line is bright under similar conditions when the spark is taken
in a current of hydrogen, this supposition cannot be correct.
    A  condition of the spark may be obtained in which the strongest lines
of the ordinary lead spectrum are scarcely visible, and the line under
consideration becomes the strongest in the spectrum, with the exception
 of the bright line in the extreme violet.
    I need   scarcely remark that the circumstance of making use of this
line for the purpose of a standard line of comparison is not to be taken
as affording     any evidence in favour of the existence       of  lead in the
nebulae.
    Each nebula was observed on several nights, so that the whole observ
ing time of the past year was devoted to this inquiry. In no instance
was any change of relative position of the nebular line and the lead line
 detected.
    It  follows that none of the nebulae observed shows a motion of trans
 lation so great as 25 miles per second, including the earth's motion at
the time. This motion must be considered in the results to be drawn
 from the observations ; for if the earth's motion be, say, 10 miles
 per second from the nebula, then the nebula would not be receding
 with a velocity greater than 15 miles per second ; but the nebula might be
 approaching with velocity as great as 35 miles per second, because 10
 miles of this velocity would be destroyed by the earth's motion in the
 contrary direction.
     The observations seem to show that the gaseous nebulae as a class
 have not proper motions so great as the bright stars.              It may be
 remarked that two other kinds of motion may exist in the nebulae, and,
if  sufficiently

    Since the existence of real nebulae has been established by the use of
the spectroscope, Mr. Proctorf and Professor D'ArrestJ have called
attention to the relation of position which the gaseous nebula; hold to the

of the declination-needle followed an annual law were those of Cassini,
made, more than eighty years ago, in the hall of the Paris Observatory
and in the caves below it (90 feet under ground). It cannot be said,
however, that Cassini's result has been confirmed by subsequent observa

month to month.

world in modern times have given results        so different that we must con
clude either that the magnetic needle obeys different annual laws at each
place, or that the differences are due to instrumental errors.        The con
sequence has been that, after long, laborious, and expensive researches, it is
still a question whether the magnetic needle obeys an annual law or not.
   The results obtained at some observatories have made it very probable
that,  if an annual    law exist, the range of the oscillation must be very
small.    It is therefore  essential, in questioning any series of observa
tions for this law, to be assured that the errors (instrumental or others)
are neither considerable nor systematic.
   I  have concluded, from several series of observations made with sus
pension-threads bearing unmagnetic or slightly magnetic weights, that
the systematic errors due to varying temperature or humidity are very
small when the suspension-threads are carefully constructed with fibres
from which the original torsion has been removed. Dr. Lloyd has con
cluded that threads with fibres differently twisted may produce com
paratively large annual variations in different directions, according to the
direction of the twist. There is little doubt, however, that the greatest
errors   are due to the unequal stretching       and rupture of the different
fibres which form the suspension-thread.
    When the instrumental errors may        be so considerable   compared with
the variations to be observed,     it cannot   be supposed   extraordinary that
instruments in different places give different results; and it appears
essential so to eliminate the sources of error that two instruments in the
same place may tell the same story before we attempt to announce the
existence of any law.
    If at sea two or more chronometers are necessary in case one may be
affected by error, it seems not less necessary in scientific researches
requiring continuous observations for years, where errors are so difficult
of detection and elimination, that two or more instruments should be
observed.      These considerations induced me to establish at Trevan-
drum two declination-magnetometers           of different construction, placed
under considerably different atmospheric conditions; and it is to the
results of sixteen years' comparative observation from these two instru
              I
ments that desire to draw the attention of physicists.
    Both instruments had suspension-threads made with the utmost care.
One, Dr. Lloyd's instrument, made by Mr. Grubb, of Dublin, with a
magnet weighing nearly a pound, was placed in the large room of the
Trevandrum Magnetic Observatory, which was always more or less open
to the external air ; and, although covered by a cotton-wadded hood and
a series of boxes, it was much more liable to any errors due to atmo
spheric actions than the other.       Its chief source of error was, however,
connected with small movements of the telescope wire, although that was
made to coincide, at varying intervals of time, with the transit-mark five
miles distant.

 25G                     Mr.    J.   A. Broun    on the   Annual              [Mar. 26,
    The Beeond instrument, made according to my own designs by Mr. P.
 Adie, of London, had a magnet weighing only about one sixth of the other ;
it was suspended under a glass bell from which the air was exhausted,
and which was covered with two hoods — one with gilt surfaces, the
other with cotton wadding. This instrument was placed in a closed room
without windows or external openings, and with a terraced ceiling below
the observatory roof.          Observed from without (within the large room of
the observatory), the diurnal variations of temperature in the instrument
were not more than three tenths (0-3) of a degree Fahrenheit, while the
annual variation was tinder 5° Fahr.*
    The compared mean positions of the two magnets for each day, derived
from hourly observations of both instruments during eleven years, and
from eight daily observations during the remaining five years, will be
found with all other details in the volume referred to in the note to the
preceding paragraph.           It will be sufficient for the purposes now in view
to give here the chief conclusions from these means.
    The monthly mean declinations having been freed from the secular
movement, and the means for three groups of years having been taken,
these means are represented very nearly by the following equations of

    In  the years 1854 to 1859 the movements of Grubb's telescope were
 very   small,  the daily mean dectinations from both instruments differing
rarely more than O'-l throughout the whole six years. It will be seen
that the equations for these years agree very nearly.                   In spite of the
greater movements of the telescope in following years (affecting chiefly
the coefficient of sin 0), the epochs of- maxima and minima derived from
the two instruments differ but little, and all the principal deviations
from the mean law for any year are confirmed by both instruments.
    "When the means for the whole sixteen years are taken, and the equi-

one pound, showed     that the effect of a change of 1° Fahr. on the position of Grubb's
 magnet amounted to about 0' 003 ( =0"-18)— a result deduced from the changes of tem
 perature from hour to hour, as well as from those from day to day.       I must refer to
the first volume of the ' Trevandrum Observations,' now in the press, for the details of
these experiments.

valent equations of sines are carried to four terms, the following results
are obtained     : —

                       + 0'-012 sin (30+293°) + O'-O22 sin (40 + 197°).
   Prom these equations we deduce the following epochs of maxima and
minima: —
                       Minima.                              Maxima.

    Grubb.      January 13 and May 23.            March 18 and September 29.
   The confirmation of the results from Adie's instrument by those from
Grubb's,    in spite of the errors of the latter, is so marked in each year
and group of years, that we can affirm that at Trevandrum, in the south
magnetic hemisphere, the magnetic needle obeys an annual law producing
a double oscillation, having a minimum towards the end of May, the prin
cipal maximum near the end of September, another minimum in January,
and a secondary maximum in the middle of March. Or, taking the results
from Adie's instrument as most free from all error, the principal mini
mum occurs about a month before the            June solstice, and the secondary
minimum about a month after the December solstice            ;  while the principal
maximum occurs about a week after the September equinox, and the
secondary maximum about a week before the March equinox.
   In the result obtained by me from four years' observations (1843 to
1846) at Makerstoun, in Scotland, the greatest easterly position was
attained     in the end of April or beginning of May, and the greatest
¦westerly (or least easterly) position in September.       If that result, derived
from a single instrument, can be accepted*,            it would appear that the
movements of the north end of the needle, in the annual variations, are
in opposite directions at Trevandrum and Makerstoun at the same period
 of the year. This result agrees with that which           I   have found for the
decennial inequality, or that in the south magnetic hemisphere ; the law
for the south end of the magnet is the same as that for the north end of
the magnet in the north magnetic hemisphere : but it is opposed to the
result obtained by me for the twenty-six day period, in which the easterly
and northerly magnetic forces have their maxima at the same time in both
hemispheres.
   It   follows that the results which are connected with the sun's rota
tion on its axis are the same        in both hemispheres, while those related to
   *  I  have always considered this result a near approximation to the truth, hut it
was not confirmed by the very limited series of observations made in the three subse
quent years, years of great disturbance.

the earth's revolution round the sun appear opposite             in the two hemi
spheres.
   It might    be supposed, as was done    for the diurnal variation of magnetic
declination, that the directions of motion being opposite in the two hemi
spheres, the amount of motion should diminish, and perhaps altogether
disappear, at the magnetic equator.          This does not seem to be the case
for the annual law more than for the diurnal law, the range of the
mean oscillation from four years' observations at Makerstoun being about
T'O, which is little different from that found for Trevandrum (0'-33), the
difference of the directive forces being considered.

                        Rotteken, and others on the subject.
    MM. Milne-Edwards          and    Jules Haime* wrote            as follows in 1857
 concerning     the nervous    attributes   of the group         of Coylenterata called
 Zoautharia : — " They (les Coralliaires) enjoy a highly developed sensibi
 lity ; not only do they contract forcibly upon the slightest touch, but they
are, moreover, not insensible to the influence of light. Nevertheless, neither
 a nervous system nor organs of special sense have been discovered in them.
 It  is true that Spix described and figured ganglions and nervous cords
 in  the pedal disk of Actinioo ; but the observations of this naturalist, so far
 as the polypes are concerned, are not entitled to the least confidence.
     " Some naturalists   have supposed that the
                                                         '

                                                                                '

 Actiniae are eyes, and M. Husehke believes that certain capsules in the
 trunk of VeretiUa, which contain calcareous bodies, are the organs of
 hearing.     But these hypotheses do not rest upon any proved facts."

  261                          Prof. P. M. Duncan on the
      In'1864 Huxley noticed that, with regard to the              Ccelenterata,
                                                                                  "  a ner
 vous system has at present been clearly                made out only in the        Cteno-
 phora "*.
     Homard t, an admirable observer, contributed to the histology of the
 Actinozoa in 1851. He corrected Erdl's mistake concerning the sup
 posed striation of the muscular fibrillae of the tentacles, and also Quatre-
 f age   and Leuckart's notion concerning the rupture of the tentacular ends
 previously to the passage of water from them.                   Giving very good illus
 trations, he proved himself to be a very reliable investigator.
     Amongst other parts of the Actinozoa, he paid especial attention to the
 minute anatomy of the " bourses calicinales." These bead-like appendages,
 situated just without the tentacles in some genera, but not in all, are
 also called chromatophores and           " bourses                 "
                                                     marginales ; and their beautiful
 turquoise colour had rendered             thein attractive to previous anatomists,
 who had, as has already been noticed, guessed concerning their function.
     Homard determined that they were folded elements of the skin in
 which the capsules (nematocysts) were enormously developed.                            He
 stated that the thread of these gigantic nematocysts was seen with diffi
 culty.     He noticed the transparency of some large cells in the bourses,
 and stated that, in his opinion, there was " some physiological relation be
 tween these little organs and the light."
     Jules Haime (probably in 1855) examined the minute anatomy of
 Actinia mesembryanthemum,              and his colleague, Milne-lSdwards, quotes
                   '
 him iu the Hist. Nat. des Coralliaires,' vol. i. p. 240.                  The lamented
 young     naturalist    found   out  that  the chromatophores      bore,  so far as their
number        is concerned, a decided numerical           relation with the number of
the tentacles.         He decided that they contained but few muscular fibres,
and had navicular-shaped nematocysts,
                                                    " diversement contournes," with
indistinct threads within them.               However, he recognized large trans
parent cells and pigmentary granules in them.                  The nematocysts of the
chromatophores are larger than those of the tentacles.                      He was evi
dently not satisfied with the data upon which these coloured masses were
decided to be of importance as organs of special sense.                 In all probability
Haime was aware of Homard's work.
    Kolliker and the German histologists added about this time, and later,
to the exact knowledge respecting the histology of the muscles, skin,
endothelium, and tentacular apparatus, but no advance was made to
wards      the discovery       of   a  nervous    system     in the Actinia for       many
years.

Actinia was expressed by Alex. AgassizJ, who wrote: — "Notwithstanding
its extraordinary sensitiveness, the organs of the senses in the Actinia
are very inferior, consisting only of a few pigment-cells accumulated at
the base of the tentacles."
    But in this year a great advance was made towards discovery by
Profs. A. Schneider and Eotteken*. The first-named naturalist paid
especial attention to the development of the lamella) and septa in Corals
and Actiniae, and his colleague laboured in the histology of Actinia
especially.
    "Working at a very great disadvantage, with specimens which had been
preserved in alcohol, Eotteken produced a series of researches which
added greatly to the knowledge already granted to science by Homard and
Haiine. So far as they bear on the nervous system, the result of his re

tophores) are undoubtedly organs of sense, and, indeed, compound eyes.
They are pyriform diverticula of the body-wall, standing between the
tentacles and the outer margin of the peristome ; they are constructed
after the fashion of a retina, and the following layers of structure may be
distinguished     in them : — 1, externally      a cuticular   layer broken up into
" bacilli " by numerous pore-canals ;           2, a   layer of strongly refractile
spherules, which may be regarded as lenses ; 3, cones* — hollow, strongly
refractile, transversely striated cylinders or prisms rounded at the ends ;
these have hitherto been confounded with urticating capsules (nemato-
eysts) : at the exterior end of each cone there is generally one lens, and
sometimes two or three may stand in the interspaces ; 4, a granular
fibrous layer occupying the interspaces between the cones ; 5, a layer
which is. deeply stained by carmine, and contains numerous extremely fine
fibres and spindle-shaped cells, probably nerve-fibres and cells ; 6, the
muscular layer     ; 7, the endothelium,     which bounds the perigastric cavity.
    Actinia mesembryanthemum was the species examined, and the diagram
(PI. II. fig. 15) will explain the relative position of the layers.
    Eotteken could not determine the position of the pigment of the
chromatophores       from the alcoholized specimens. An examination of the
minute anatomy of the tentacles of Actinia cereus, Ellis and Solander,
determined that the refractile spherules and large cones were to be found
on the tips of these organs.

          II. A Description    of the Morphology of tlu     Chromatophorts.
   During the summer of 1871 the author of this communication                      was
examining into the minute anatomy of Actinia mesembryanthemum,                     and
had    the   advantage of possessing living specimens.             Having satisfied
himself    of   the   general correctness     of  Rotteken's admirable work, he
relinquished the inquiry until 1873, when he resumed it.
    Every one who       has endeavoured to anatomize one       of the Actinias must
acknowledge        the  excessive   difficulties  which   accompany the attempt.
The irritability of the muscular tissues, their persistent contraction during
manipulation, the confusion caused by the abundance of different cellular
histological elements, and the general sliminess of the whole, render the
minute examination very troublesome and usually very unsatisfactory.
Reagents are useful for rough examinations ; but when the most delicate
of the tissues are to be examined they must be floated under sea-water,
and this must be the medium in which they must be examined under the
microscope.        Carmine-solution,     osmic acid, and spirits of wine in weak
solutions are useful after the natural appearances have been determined,
but they exaggerate some histological elements and destroy others.
    Great care must be taken in making the thin sections, and no tearing
must be allowed ; for it is of paramount importance, in endeavouring to
trace the nervous system, that the relative position of parts should be
retained.
    It  is useless to rely on any observations           made with     object-glasses
lower than     -ji^-inch focus (immersive).
    In examining the chromatophores, Actinia) with very bright-coloured
ones, and other specimens with these organs dull in tint, should be
selected. Fresh subjects should be obtained, and it is not necessary to
kill them first of all.       The blades of very delicate scissors          should    be
allowed to touch the desired chromatophore close to its base, and then as
the    Actinia commences to contract, they should be brought together
gently and without wrenching the tissues.             By this method the chroma
tophore will remain on the blades.             Two or three chromatophores may
be removed, with their intermediate tissues, without injury to the animal ;
but, of course, the excision must not be too deep, or the endothelium will
be cut into.
    A   dropping-tube should be used to wash the chromatophore off the
blades on to a glass slide, where a drop of sea-water awaits it.
    Sections are by no means easy to make, but they are best performed
under a power of 10 diameters with fine scalpels. The forceps must not be
employed, as        it crushes the tissues.      If  possible, very slight   pressure

should be exercised on the thin glass, which is to be placed very carefully
and wet over the object.      After the examination, carmine should be
added, or osinic-acid solution, 1 per cent, in strength ; but no results
can be relied on which            are derived   from   the examination      under   the
influence    of reagents         alone, as they modify the       natural appearance
greatly.
   So far as the chromatophores are concerned, my investigations took the
following course : — 1. Rotteken's researches on the alcoholized Actinia
were followed     in recent specimens.  2. The tissues of the chromato
phores, of their margins, and of the spaces between them were examined
in   a large specimen   of
                       living pale-green variety of Actinia mesembryan-
                             a
themum from the Mediteranean.    3. The tissues of the chromatophores
of the Actinia mesembryanihemum were again examined with a view to
explain the differences between M. Rotteken's and my own results.
   The rounded, free, coloured, external layer of a chromatophore was
carefully disengaged from the granular tissue beneath                 it,
                                                                 so that the
bacilli of Rbtteken, the refractile corpuscles, and his so-called cones
were separated from the rest.      This turquoise-coloured film was floated
and carefully placed on      glass slide, the bacillary layer being inferior
                                 a
and on the glass, whilst the proximal ends of the cones were free in the
water.    No thin glass was placed over the film, and an object-glass of
|-inch focus was used. The appearance presented under this low power
(by transmitted light) was very remarkable, for        great number of bril
                                                          a
liant points of light were seen surrounded and separated by dark opaque
tissue.   When    a
                    ^-inch object-glass was used, the appearance was less
striking, for the points of light were more diffused.        No trace of an
object could be seen through the refractile tissues.
   The transparent and refractile tissues were the so-called bacilli, the
                                 " cones" already noticed       and the tissue, which
globular bodies and the                                     ;
was impermeable by light, consisted of the colouring-matter in small dull
granules, cells small and round in outline and granular, and also the cell-
walls of the cones.
     Sections through   chromatophore were made at right angles to the
                        a
point of the greatest convexity of the surface, and thin slices were floated
off carefully from the line of section on to glass slides.   The slices in
cluded (a) the coloured outside of the chromatophore,    (6) the tissue
beneath     it,
            and (c) some muscular  fibres which limit the  endothelium.
Sea-water was used as the medium, and thin glass cover was applied after
                                                a
the specimens had been examined with      low power.

scribes this as  cuticular layer broken up into bacilli by numerous pore-
                  a
canals.   Examined, however, in the fresh subject, this external layer con
sisted of   a vast multitude of small rod-shaped bodies, sharply rounded but
conical     at both ends, very transparent,    and resembling the smallest

   208                      Prof. P. M. Duncan on the
   nematocysts of the tentacles without the internal thread (PI. II. fig. 2).
   These are placed side by side, and the external rounded end of each is
   separated by a small space from the terminations of its neighbours.
   These ends are free and are in contact with the water in which the
   Actinia lives.      The rods are cylinders, and are separated from each
  other by a very delicate film of protoplasm, in which are numerous
  dark opaque granules and a few flat simple colourless rounded cells
  (PI. II. fig. 3).       The inner ends are shaped like the external, and
  are embedded in the next layer of tissue.                Each of these bodies is
  a simple cell filled with a transparent fluid.                When a thin film
  of the surface of      a chromatophore      is removed and examined          under a
  •j-'g-inch, the bacilli may be observed to crowd together over a layer of
  large refractile cells.    The thin glass cover is generally sufficient to crush
  down the bacilli, so that their sides may be seen as they rest in all kinds
  of positions on the deeper cellular layer (PI. II. fig. 17).
      The bacilli are not found universally over the chromatophores, nor do
  they invariably cover the layer of large refractile globular cells.
      It will be noticed, on examining excised portions which include two or
  three chromatophores and their intermediate tissue, that not only are
  they marked on their surface by foldings of their superficial tissue, but
 that between them there are others which are microscopic.                  These last
  rarely have bacilli.     Moreover,   in  some  parts  of the margins of the chro
  matophores, other pigments are visible than the turquoise, and the red
 often predominates ; the bacilli are not usually present there.
      Beneath the superficial layer of bacilli and their separating protoplasm,
 which      is faintly granular, there is some granular tissue with a few
 small spherical cells containing granules, and the inner ends of the bacilli
 are embedded therein (PI.       II. fig. 3).
     This granular tissue is very thin, but it covers and dips down between
 the large refractile     cells, which form the next layer        (PI. II. figs. 4, 13,
 15, 16, 17).
     These cells are more or less       spherical  ; the cell-wall is very thin, and
 the contents are transparent,         colourless,   and refractile.    Some have a
pale grey tint, and one or more extremely faint nuclei are attached to the
 inner surface of the cell-wall. The ovoid shape is occasionally seen.
     These large cells, which transmit light so readily, are universally found
 on the chromatophores; and when there are bacilli upon them, the spherical
shape is common.
     At   the margins of the chromatophores, and where the red pigment
commences, these refractile cells assume much larger dimensions and more
irregular shapes. These refractile cells are, as has already been noticed,
embedded in a tissue of granular and slightly cellular protoplasm, and
this occasionally is differentiated into some peculiar structures.
     Where there are no bacilli this granular tissue is increased in thickness

and becomes superficial ; moreover the granules then contribute to the
colour of the chromatophore, and probably they always do so to a certain
degree.
   The retractile cells are not invariably confined to the layer above the
so-called cones of Eotteken, although they are often thus limited in their
position, especially if there are bacilli covering them. In parts of the
same chromatophore, where this apparently normal arrangement is seen,
and especially on the microscopic chromatophores between the larger
kinds, the large refractile spherules are found between and in the midst
of groups of the cones (PI. II. fig. 16).
   In the chromatophores there is considerable variety in the size of the
refractile cells ; they appear to be developed from the small cells with
a circular outline, which contain a few dark granules, and which are
found in considerable abundance amidst the enveloping granular tissue
(PI.   II.
        fig. 8).
  The most striking of all the histological elements of the chromato
phores are the cones of Eotteken, or the nematocysts with imperfectly
visible threads of Homard.  They are divisible into three series :—
  a. Elongated simple cells, cylindrical in shape, with rounded and
somewhat pointed extremities, consisting of a tough cell-wall which is
capable of being bent without being broken or ruptured, and of colour
less transparent contents which are rather viscid (PI.    fig. 5). II.
                                                                   They
are four or five times the length of the bacilli, and three times their
width.    The cell- wail is faintly tinted with the peculiar colour of the
chromatophore.     These elongated cells are not conical, nor can they be
really termed  cones  with any propriety ; when observed through their
greatest length, or when the light traverses their long axis, the cell-wall
appears dark and the centre very refractile.  They exist in vast multitudes
over most parts of the chromatophore, and also in the intermediate tissue
and its microscopic chromatophores.

Eotteken they appear in the

with simple walls.

   y. Cells of the same shape and size as            d                     a
loped thread within them, which usually has no barb (PI.      fig. 7).   II.
   These cells are common where there are no bacilli, but they occur here
and there in all parts of the chromatophore circle.
  In some rare instances the " Eotteken bodies" (for thus           I      would name
these remarkable cells) are closely approximated, side by side, without the
intervention of any structure    but, usually, there
                                   ;                    very thin layer of
                                                          is   a
granular protoplasm, containing small cells, between them.
   As the bodies are cylindrical and more or less closely applied                by   their

270                        Prof. P. M. Duncan on the
sides, there is more space between them       in some places than     in others ; and
it is in these spots, where the bodies cannot come in direct contact, that
their intermediate structures are elongated and filiform (PI. II. figs. 9-
14). The filiform arrangement of the granulo-cellular protoplasm is often
branched, and a set of elongated masses may unite above or below the
bodies. The cells of this intermediate tissue are small and usually spheri
cal ; in one kind there is a large refractile nucleus, but in the commonest
varieties the cells simply contain granules.          It is necessary to study this
tissue, because of its close agreement to what          I presume to be the nerve-
structure,    in some,  but  not in the  essential,  points. This tissue is clearly
continuous with that which has already been noticed as separating and
bounding the larger refractile cells outside the Eotteken bodies, and it is
continued amongst the small closely set granular cells which underlie
these interesting histological elements (PI. II. fig. 13).
    The intermediate tissue binds together the bacilli ; for it is continued
upwards and between them, the large refractile cells (which             I propose to
term " Haimean bodies "), and the " Eotteken bodies," and it becomes lost
in the cells upon which the proximal ends of these last rest.
    It contains the granular structures which give, in the mass, the colour
to the chromatophore, and it is evident that the Haimean bodies are de
veloped from it.
    The proximal ends of the Eotteken bodies retain their sharp and
rounded contour amidst the dense layers of small granular cells which
everywhere underlie them.
    Those granular cells form a tissue through which light passes with
difficulty under the microscope. They are regularly placed in series near
the Eotteken bodies ; but deeper they become less so, and then other
anatomical elements may be observed between them and the muscular
fibres upon which       the whole chromatophore rests, and which in their
turn limit externally the endothelium.
 III. A    Notice of Rottelens discovery of Fusiform Cells and of the different
        appearances of the Xervous Elements voir first observed in the
                                                                             " Pledi-
       form Tissue"
    Eotteken describes these nervous elements           as extremely fine fibres and
 spindle-shaped    cells,  and asserts  that they   ire   probably nerve-fibres and
cells.    But he has not traced them in conjunction, nor have the fibres
been seen of sufficient length to anastomose.
    I  have found the fusiform bodies and their long ends — the fine fibres
 mentioned above.         Moreover the connexion of these irregular-shaped
 cells has been determined in these investigations, and the anastomosis of
 their processes and their connexion with parts of a plexiform nervous
 tissue also.
    These structures      are in the midst of a mass         of viscous protoplasm,

                            Nervous System      of Actinia.                      271
granules, and granular cells, which merge gradually into the close layers
of granular cells under the Eotteken bodies, and they transgress here
and there on those layers.
    The fusiform cells are numerous (PI. II. figs. 18-24), and may be di
vided into two kinds       : — (a) Those with irregular shapes and short ter
minal processes, which are prolongations of the cell-wall and are rounded
off.     These cells contain either highly refractile nuclei, or several nuclei
with granular nucleoli. The fusiform shape is not invariable, and in
Plate II. fig. 20 a large cell twice the diameter of a Eotteken body
is seen amidst the granular plasm.           It has a tail-shaped   prolongation and
some highly refractile nuclei.
    P. Those which are rounder in outline, and whose projections are long
and continuous with those of others.             The outlines of these cells are
soft, and without definite and sharp margins, and the colour is a very
pale blue-grey.       They contain one or more very distinct nuclei.             Our
type,     illustrated  in  Plate   II. fig. 21,  has  its   cells rather  wider than
a Eotteken body, and they are connected by a process with sharply
defined wells — the cell, with many nuclei, having a long caudal fibril of
a pale grey colour       and rather sharp marginal        liues which had suffered
disruption.
    A   second type has large spherical or elliptical cells, which do not have
processes passing out in opposite directions, but they are restricted to
one part.        Usually the cells have only one process, but sometimes two
exist close together (fig. 22).
    These cells are granular within and have very indistinct nuclei ; the
cell-wall is extremely delicate, and the whole is of a pale grey colour.
The fibrils of these cells are particularly connected with the plexiform
tissue.        In Plate II. fig. 22 there is a cell with two fibrils — one is
 short, for it dips down and is foreshortened, and the other is very long ; it
bifurcates, and one end joins a rounded mass of the plexus, and the other
the rugged fibrillar part.
    In Plate II. fig. 24 a cell with one fibril is shown. The fibril swells
 slightly, and then passes down to join a transverse fibre belonging to the
 plexus.
    The plexiform tissue is probably continuous around the Actinia beneath
 the chromatophores, for it is found between the circular band of mus
 cular fibres and every chromatophore.           It consists of an irregular main
 structure and of lateral prolongations, which either anastomose with the
 fibrils from the fusiform and more spherical cells, or are directly con
 tinuous with the cells (fig. 23).
    The main structure resembles, in its indistinctness of outline and its
 pale grey colour and indefinite marginal arrangement, the fibre of the
 sympathetic of mammals, but it is less coherent and smaller.                     The
 usual appearance (Plate II. fig. 23) is that of a grey film with definite
 branches, and the whole has few granules here and there and a very few

 272                          Prof. P. M. Duncan on the
nuclei.     It   is intimately associated with the surrounding cell-structures,
 but they may be separated by accident or compression.                    Here and
 there the structure enlarges and a ganglion-like cell is seen (Plate             II.
fig. 22).
    I have   traced this structure almost across the whole field of the micro
scope   in some sections.
    It appears that this portion of the nervous system of Actinia (namely,
the fusiform and spherical cells with fibrils and the plexiform structure)
is distinct histologically from the fibrillar and cellular structures amidst
the Haimean and Eiitteken bodies. These structures are connective and
developing     ;  but it must be remembered that      it is possible for both series
to  come   in contact in the midst of the layers of granular cells which
underlie the Eiitteken bodies.
     IV.  Examination       into the Physiological Relation between  the Chroma-
                            tophores, the Serves, and Light.
    The question arises, Are these nerves of special sense ? MM. Schneider
and Eiitteken answer that the small portion of the nervous arrangement
they described, i. e. the fusiform bodies and their fibrils, are optic nerves.
They are satisfied with the physical arrangement of the bacilli, Haimean
and Eiitteken bodies, and the nature of the colouring-matter imitating
that of an organ of vision.
    The discovery of the anastomosing fibrils and the plexiform arrangement
favour this theory ; but there are reasons to be considered which throw
much doubt on the views of the distinguished investigators.              All Actinia
have not chromatophores, and closely allied genera may or may not
 have them.         Thus, amongst the Actinia with smooth tentacles, there is
 a group with non-retractile and another with retractile                  tentacles :
amongst those with non-retractile arms are the genera Anemonia and
Eumenides without chromatophores, and Comactis and Ceratactis with
 them ; amongst the Actinia with retractile tentacles are Actinia with,
and Paractis without, chromatophores.
    Amongst the tubercular division, the genus Phymaciis has chromato
phores, but its close ally Cerens has them not.
    Whatever may be the value of this classification of the Actinia, it is
 quite evident that to group together those with and without chromato
  phores in separate divisions would be the reverse of producing a natural
 arrangement.         It is therefore difficult to believe that these ornaments,
 with something resembling an optical arrangement, can be the seat of
special sensation.
     MM. Eiitteken and Schneider have observed the large refractile
 Haimean bodies in the tentacles, and, ns will be noticed further on,
 I have found them of enormous size in the peristome.
     They are surrounded in those places, but not covered, with pigment-
 cells and granules, and are situated just beneath the nematocyst layer            in

                         Nervous System of Actinia.                      273
 the tentacle, and beneath a corresponding layer, or one of bacilli, in the
 peristome.    I  have failed to recognize any nervous elements in the
 tentacles save the fusiform bodies, and there are none in the peristome
 except these irregular cells.
    Again, the Haimean bodies are found in the chromatophores, in some
places, amidst the Ebtteken bodies, separating them.
    Nevertheless it is true that light falling on the surface of an Actinia
•will reach further into its structures where there are Haimean bodies,
and further still    if the Ebtteken cells underlie them. Where there is
no pigment intervening between the bodies when placed side by side, or
between the Ebtteken cells, a diffused glare of light would impinge on
the granulo-cellular layer below them, in which the nerves ramify and
the nerve-cells exist. But when the pigment-granules and cells exist,
they break up the general illumination and confine it to a series of
separate bright rays.     Each of them is brighter than the corresponding
space of diffused light ; and it would appear that the bacilli, the Haimean
bodies, and the Ebtteken cells in combination, concentrate light.
   Two or three bacilli are placed side by side and behind each other over a
small Haimean refractile spherical cell, and perhaps twenty or more cover a
large cell (PI. II. fig. 15). Usually a Haimean body is placed immediately
over a Ebtteken body ; but, as Ebtteken has pointed out, this is not an
invariable arrangement, for some cover the spaces between and over
them.     The refractibility of the fluid contents of the Haimean bodies
and Ebtteken cells appears to be the same ; but the elongated form of the
last-mentioned structures may act upon light as if their internal fluid
were more viscid.
   In  every instance there is a more or less opaque tissue between the
proximal end of the Ebtteken body and the nerve-cells ; and, moreover,
the delicate protoplasmic layer, which is slightly impervious       to light,
surrounds the Haimean bodies.
   In  my opinion the Haimean bodies, wherever they exist, carry light
more deeply into the tissues than the ordinary epithelial structures.
This is also the case with the bacilli and Ebtteken bodies, even when they
exist separately and with or without the Haimean bodies.           There are
three ordinary constituents of the skin, and through their individual gifts
and structural peculiarity they place the Actinia in relation with light.
When they are brought together in this primitive form of eye, they con
centrate and convey light with greater power, so as to enable it to act
more generally on the nervous system —probably not to enable the
 distinction of objects, but to cause the light to stimulate a rudimentary
nervous system to act in a reflex manner on the muscular system, which
is highly developed. The Actinia, therefore, may feel the light by means
of the transparent histological elements when they are separate and
constitute integral portions of the ectoderm j but this sensation will be in

tensified when the three kinds of cells are placed in such order                 as has
been observed in the chromatophores.
    The evolution of an eye, which can distinguish outlines, shadows, and
colours, probably took the path which is thus faintly indicated in the
Actinia, which doubtless has an appreciation of the difference between
light and darkness.
          V. On   the Nerves   of  the base   of Actinia mesembryanthemum.
    A   large specimen of a pale green variety from the Mediterranean               was
examined.
    The    base being free and expanded, a        rapid incision cut out  a triangular
piece comprehending           the    ectothelium,    the muscular    layers, and the
mucous endothelium.            The apex of the triangle reached the centre of
the base of the Actinia, and the base of the triangle, which was covered,
corresponded with the basal margin of the animal.
    Sections were made parallel with the original aspect of the                 base of
the Actinia, and then some others at right angles.
    The histological elements were studied separately and compared, so
that the following tissues could be distinguished readily : —
    1. A fibrous-looking        tissue like ordinary white fibrous tissue with
dark nuclei,      to  which    the muscular fibres are attached and from which
they originate.
    2. A dense layer of muscular fibres, or rather fibrils, which originates
at right angles to the fibre of the fibrous tissue.            Each fibril is refractile
and nucleated. Each is separate from its neighbours, and lies in the midst of
granules and small cells which contain granules, all being highly refractile.
In some places the fibrils are gathered together in masses, so as to leave
areola) between them.
    'A.  Large muscular fibres in contact laterally,           so as to form a thin
layer.       Each  fibre is long, broad, has several pale elongate nuclei and a
distinct lateral dark line. There are no stria).
    4. The elements of the endothelium and ectothelium, which, as they do
not bear on the immediate subject, will be described in a future memoir.
    The object of the investigation being to discover some trace of a
nervous system, which was presupposed to resemble somewhat the traces
observed below the chromatophores, the necessity of becoming familiar
 with the fibrous and muscular tissues, so as to decide what was not
 muscle and fibre, is apparent.
    I have not    found any isolated fusiform cells amongst the tissues of the
base ; but under the endothelium, and also between the layers of muscular
fibres, there are structures which          I feel disposed to believe must belong
to the nervous system.          1. They are in the position of nerves. 2. Their
 structure is not that of muscle or fibre.             3. Their structure resembles,
 in some instances, the plexiform tissues beneath the chromatophores.

                                  Nervous System of Actinia.                                     275
    The nervous           structures           are    found    to   present    three characteristic
shapes       :   —
    1.   A
         thin layer of muscular fibrils of the small and separate
                                                                  (see
2 above) kind, with well-defined dark nuclei in them, was examined.
The whole was very transparent and well defined under the jij-inch
objective.
   Underlying this layer, and extending on either side beyond   so as                      it,
to appear in one of the meshes between groups of these fibrils, was                               a
ramified pale grey tissue, which was less pervious to light than the mus
cular fibrils (PI.        III.
                        fig. 25). Swollen in one part and faintly granular
throughout,      bad its margins very faintly visible.
                     it                                It was flat, and had
a  definite resemblance to the widest portion of the plexus already men
tioned.
    2.   A
         large section of muscular tissue was examined.         It consisted of
one layer of large muscular fibres                    in close lateral contact.
                                      (see    above)       3
Running obliquely over the layer was an irregular but continuous cord
ramifying here and there, the branches breaking up into fibrils. In one
part the cord was swollen (PI.         figs. 26 III.
                                                 27).    A second ramification
                                                                  &
passed from the opposite end of the field of the microscope and broke up
into ultimate fibrils, and in this structure there was fusiform cell.         a
    Careful manipulation
                       separated     portion of the upper cord from the
                                                      a
muscular fibres, but part of a  evidently dropped down amongst them.
                                               it
  3. A layer of muscular fibres of the same kind as those just mentioned
was examined. It was marked, as usual, with the lateral dark lines and
pale elongated nuclei.
   Three long and irregular fibres passed more or less obliquely over the
muscular tissue (PI.             III.
                          figs. 28-30).  They had distinct lateral or mar
ginal lines, were swollen out in several places, and their texture was faintly
granular.
I     believe that these fibres were continuous with the fine ramifications
of the plexiform arrangement just described.
   4. Above the muscular layers, and under the folds of the endothelium,
I found an inosculating series of ramifications arising from       common              a
cord.    It was situated upon the layer of muscular tissue, with small and
separate long fibrils.
   The structure was faintly granular, pale grey in colour, with faint
outlines, and was swollen in some places      covered  considerable por
                                                              :   it           a
tion of the field of the microscope and portions of  ;had a close resem       it
blance to the ramifying structure mentioned as having been observed
below the muscular layer                (PI.   III.   fig. 31).
   The multiplication,      be justifiable, of these structural elements in
                                  ifit
the other segments of the base which were not examined would give                                 a
fair notion of the plexiform arrangement of the basal nervous tissue.                            I
presume that     consists of reticulate structure beneath the endothelium,

muscular layer, and which communicates with a ramifying tissue in con
tact with the other muscular layers, and that this ends in long fibres
which supply the wide fibres of this last-mentioned layer.
  The diffused nature of this nervous tissue is what might be anticipated
would be found in animals possessing such general irritability of tissue,
and probably its function is to assist in the reflex movements of the
animal, and to produce expansion of the disk on the stimulus of light.

 I. " On      the Pneumatic Action which accompanies the Articulation
         of Sounds by the Human Voice, as exhibited by a Recording
         Instrument."          By W. H. Barlow, F.R.S., V.P.Inst.C.E.
         Received February 23, 1874.
     All articulated sounds made by the human voice are accompanied by
 the expulsion of a!r from the mouth ; and in a series of articulated
 sounds the air is ejected in impulses which vary in quantity and pres
 sure, and in the degree of suddenness with which they commence and
 terminate.
    It appeared     to me that   it would  be interesting and probably useful, as
 tending to elucidate the process and effects of articulation, to construct
 p   instrument which should record these pneumatic actions by diagrams,
 h.     manner analogous to that in which the indicator-diagram of a steam-
      '
 en fie records the action of the engine.
    In considering a suitable form of recording instrument, the conditions
 to be met were : — first, that the pressures and quantities were very vari
 able, some of them being extremely small ; and, secondly, that the im
 pulses and changes of pressure follow each other occasionally with great
rapidity.
    It  was therefore necessary that the moving parts should be very light,
and that the movement and marking should be accomplished with as little
friction as possible.
    The instrument        I   have constructed consists of a small speaking-
trumpet      about  4 inches   long, having an ordinary mouthpiece connected
to a tube \ an inch in diameter, the other end of which is widened out
so as    to form an aperture of 2| inches diameter.
    This aperture is covered with a membrane of goldbeater's skin or thin
gutta percha.
    A spring which carries the marker is made to press against the mem
brane with a slight initial pressure, to prevent as far as practicable the
effects ¦f jar and consequent vibratory action.
    A   v ry light arm of aluminium is connected with the spring and holds
the marker ; and a continuous strip of paper is made to pass under the
marker in the same manner as that employed in telegraphy.
    The marker consists of a small fine sable brush placed in a light tube
of glass    ^   of an inch in diameter.      The tube is rounded at the lower
end, and pierced      with  a  hole about jff of an inch in diameter. Through-
this hole the tip of the brush is made to project, and it is fed by colour

278          Mr. W. H. Barlow       on the Pneumatic     Action     [Apr. 16,
put into the glass tube in which it is held.        To provide for the escape
of the air passing through the instrument, a small orifice is made in the
side of the tube of the speaking-trumpet,        so that the pressure exerted
upon the membrane and its spring is that due to the difference arising
 from the quantity of air forced into the trumpet and that which can be
delivered through the orifice in a given time.
    There being an initial pressure upon the membrane to prevent vibra
 tory action as before described, the strength of the spring and the size
of the orifice had to be adjusted, so that while the lightest pressures
arising under articulation could be recorded, the greatest pressures
 should not produce a movement exceeding the limit of the width of the
paper.
    It will be seen that  in this construction of the instrument the sudden
application   of pressure is as suddenly recorded, subject only to the modi
fications occasioned by the inertia, momentum, and friction of the parts
moved. But the record of the sudden cessation of pressure is further
affected by the time required to discharge the air through the escape
orifice.
    Inasmuch, however, as these several effects are similar under similar
circumstances, the same diagram should always be obtained from the
same pneumatic action when the       instrument is in proper adjustment ; and
this result is fairly borne out by the experiments.
    We are thus enabled to trace to what extent the pneumatic action
varies with different articulations ; and it will be seen that although there
are instances in which      considerable differences in sound do not make
much variation in the diagram, yet, as a rule, every change of sound or
articulation  produces a change in the diagram, and that there are pneu
matic actions revealed by this instrument which are imperceptible to
ordinary observation.
    Before referring to the peculiarities   of the diagrams, it may be desir
able to say a few words on the quantities of air used in articulation.
    On reference to medical authorities, it appears that the average
quantity of air expelled in one respiration is estimated at 40 cubic
inches, and that the total air-space of the lungs is estimated to average
1 10 cubic inches.
    I have ascertained   by experiment that a balloon made of goldbeater's
skin, whose cubic content when full was 523 cubic inches, was filled
with twelve ordinary respirations, or at the rate of about 44 cubic inches
for each respiration.
    Also that by filling and emptying the lungs as completely as practi
cable, the 523 cubic inches could be filled with six respirations, or about
88 cubic inches for each respiration.
   I also  made the following experiment to ascertain the average quantity
of air used in pronouncing syllables.
    Using the  same balloon and speaking      into an elastic tube communi

one are consecutively uttered, and is most developed in those syllables

   In these diagrams the part marked d is the silent discharge, and its
appearance in the diagram is under the control of the will ; for by holding
the breath immediately after pronouncing the word, this part of the
diagram can be altered and the discharge of air postponed or let off
gradually, as exhibited in fig. 2.
   If, instead of terminating with the                  " Explodents," another syllable         be
added to each word, making them terminate with consonants of softer
sound, the air which would have been silently discharged is used to form
the syllable added, and the subsequent silent discharge is very much
diminished (see fig. 3).
  There are other silent or, rather, insensible actions which occur within
certain   words,          as     is exhibited    in the differences         between     the   word
" Excommunicate " and the syllable " Ex " and the word " Communicate"
pronounced separately.

  It will   be observed that the diagrams  of the separate words, although
they become modified when grouped together, are more or less discern
ible in the Lines continuously spoken ; and the similarity of sound at the
termination of the first three lines, which constitutes the rhyme of the
verse, is represented in the similarity of form, or in the character of the
form, of the terminations of the diagrams of these three lines.
   The subject might be pursued much further by showing the diagrams
of the same words spoken by different individuals, the outlines produced
by the words and sentences of other languages, the effect produced by
change of accent, Ac.
   My object, however, has not been to pursue the subject into minute
 detail, "but to show that the articulation of the human voice is accom
panied by definite pneumatic actions, and that those actions, many of
which are insensible to ordinary observation, are capable of being
recorded.

rainfall varies with the sun-spot area, examined the register kept at the
office of the Superintendent of the Great' Trigonometrical Survey of India,
and am enabled, through the courtesy of Colonel J. T. "Walker, R.E., to
communicate the results.          These are probably not devoid of peculiar
interest, from the abnormal conditions presented by the stations of
observation, which are far inland, and on, or adjoining, lofty mountains,
as appears from the following brief descriptions.
   2. Mussoorie station is on the southernmost range of the Himalaya
Mountains, lat. N. 30° 28', long. E. 78°      7',  height 6500 feet  ; this range
rises suddenly and forms the northern boundary of the Dehra Boon (or
Dehra valley), which     is   some 18 miles wide and 40 miles long, and            is
bounded to the south by the Sewalik range of hills, about 3500 feet high.
Dehra station    is 2200 feet high, 10 miles south of Mussoorie station, and
in the Dehra valley.
   3. Owing to the absence of the observers in the winter months from
Mussoorie station, the rainfall     is  not recorded there during that period      ;
this, however,  is  of little consequence to the inquiry in hand, for the total
annual fall occurs almost entirely in June, July, and August.                    I
accordingly     give in Table      I.  the total fall at Mussoorie between
May   1  and October 31 of each year     ;   and in order to make these totals
comparable at the     two   stations,

Notwithstanding the exceptional localities of the stations, the above
results are generally in keeping with the Meldrum theory : the Dehra
observations for 1860 and prior years are unfortunately wanting ; but it
will be seen in Table I. that heavy falls occurred in the two years suc
ceeding the epochal year 1860.
   5. It may, however, be questioned whether stations inland are ineligible
to test the theory under notice. No doubt far more rain falls on certain
parts of the globe than on others, and Mussoorie and Dehra are included
in the former : but a large rainfall is in fact a recommendation, presenting
as it does a large measure of the periodicity in question ; so that stations
under this condition appear highly eligible unless the rainfall is subject
to abnormal fluctuations, apart from the supposed influence of sun-spot
area ; indeed, were it practicable to measure the total rainfall on the
whole globe, the total results would present the most effective argument
for periodicity. Projecting the facts of Table I.,
                                                with the help of ordinates
and abscissae we obtain the appended diagram,        whereI   am unable to

our system and the source of terrestrial heat and light, it appears certain
that at least some of the circumstances attending our globe are directly
or indirectly the results of solar conditions, of which we can read but too
few, and interpret still fewer rightly.     In the present instance we see
that, as in other curves, a certain rainfall maximum may be less than
minima not immediately preceding or succeeding ; and this alone suggests
the desirability of comparison with actual magnitudes of sun-spot areas ;
but the introduction of this more accurate test would doubtless prove a
waste of time, unless the approximate relation at present under view can
be maintained.
III.   "  Studies on Biogenesis."         By William Roberts, M.D.,
      Manchester.      Communicated       by Henry E. Roscoe, F.R.S.
       Received March 3, 1874.
                                  (Abstract.)
   The object of the investigation is to inquire into the mode of origin of
Bacteria and toruloid vegetations.      The inquiry is divided into three
sections.
   Section 1. On the sterilization by heat of organic liquids and mixtures. —
When beef-tea or a decoction of turnip is boiled for a few minutes and
afterwards preserved from extraneous contamination, it passes into a
state of " permanent sterility."
   This state is characterized by loss of power to originate organisms with
conservation of the power of nourishing and promoting the growth of
organisms.
   All  organic liquids and mixtures seem capable of being brought to this
state by exposure to the heat of 212° F. ; but the length of time during
which exposure to this heat is necessary to induce sterilization varies
greatly according to the .nature of the materials.         Ordinary infusions
and decoctions were sterilized by boiling      for five  or ten minutes ; but
milk, chopped green vegetables in water, pieces of boiled egg in water,
and other mixtures were not sterilized unless the heat was continued for
twenty to forty minutes.       Hay-infusion was sterilized, like other infu
sions, by boiling for a few minutes ; but when the infusion was rendered
alkaline with ammonia or liquor potassae, it was not sterilized except
after an exposure to the heat of boiling water for more than an hour.
Sometimes it germinated after two hours, and once after three hours of
 such exposure.
   There appeared to be two factors of equal importance in the induction
of sterilization — namely, the degree of heat and the duration of its appli
cation.   These two factors appeared to be mutually compensatory in such
fashion that a longer exposure to a lower temperature was equivalent to

290                     Dr. W. Roberts     on Biogenesis.            [Apr. 16,
a shorter    exposure to a higher temperature.         For example, speaking
roughly, an exposure for an hour to a heat of 212° F. appeared to be
equivalent to an exposure for fifteen minutes to a heat of 228° F.
    Section  II. On the capability of the normal tissues and juices to generate
Bacteria    and Toruke without extraneous infection. — The following sub
stances were examined : — egg-albumen, blood, urine, bb'ster-serum, milk,
grape, orange- and tomato-juice, turnip and potato.          These substances
were conveyed into previously prepared sterilized bulbs and tubes, which
were hermetically sealed at one end and plugged with cotton-wool at the
other end. When the several steps of the experiment were quickly and
dexterously performed, the risks of extraneous contamination, although
not altogether avoided, were reduced to small proportions.           The bulbs
and tubes thus charged were afterwards maintained at a temperature
ranging from 60° to 90° F., and were finally examined at periods varying
from four to ten weeks. Out of 90 experiments performed in this way,
67 preparations remained barren and 23 became fertile. When the ideal
conditions of the experiment could be carried out in approximative per
fection, as with urine, blister-serum, orange-, grape-, and tomato-juice
 (34 experiments), the preparations, all save one, remained barren ; but
when the risks of extraneous infection were (from the mechanical dif
ficulties) obviously greater, as with blood, milk, turnip, and potato, the
proportion of fertile preparations was considerable, though even with
these (except in the case of milk) the barren preparations were in a large
majority.
   The experiments seemed clearly to lead to the conclusion that the
normal tissues of plants and animals were incapable of breeding Bacteria
and Torulce except under the stimulus of extraneous infection.
   Section III. On the bearing of the facts adduced in the. preceding sec
tions on the origin of Bacteria and Torulas, and on the real explanation of
some   of the alleged cases  of Abiogenesis. — Seeing that organic liquids and
mixtures sterilized    by heat, and the normal juices and tissues, continued
permanently barren under the most favourable conditions of air, moisture,
warmth, and light, so long as they were preserved from extraneous con
tamination,    and seeing that the admission of ordinary air or water into
contact with them was invariably followed by germination, it was im
possible to avoid the conclusion that ordinary air and water contain, in
addition to their proper elements, multitudes of particles capable of pro
voking germination.         The exact nature of these particles may be a
matter of dispute, but the reality of their existence is not doubtful ; nor
is it doubtful that the ordinary and common development of Bacteria and
Torulce is directly due to their agency.
   The greatest difficulty hitherto encountered to the general acceptance
of the panspermic theory has been the appearance of Bacteria (without
the possibility of fresh infection) in certain liquids which have been
exposed for a considerable time to a boiling heat. Only two explanations

 1874.]                 On the Circulation of the Blood.                    291
 of this fact   seem possible — either  germs preexisting in them have sur
 vived the heat, or the organisms have arisen in them abiogenically.
 These alternatives were subjected to two series of test experiments.        In
 the first series it was proved directly that there exist in ordinary air and
 water particles which preserve their germinal activity after being boiled
 for five minutes in previously sterilized liquids. The second series of
 experiments showed that, in the extraordinary increase of resistance to
 sterilization by heat exhibited by alkalized hay-infusion, the action of the
alkali is to heighten the surviving power of preexisting germs, and not
 to exalt the abiogenic aptitude of the infusion itself.
    The issue of the whole inquiry has been to fully confirm the main
propositions of the panspermic theory, and to establish the conclusion
that Bacteria and TorvXce, when they do not proceed from visible parents
like themselves, originate from invisible germs floating in the surrounding
aerial and aqueous media.
    Nevertheless the author is unable to withstand the impression that this
 general and common mode of origin is possibly supplemented, under
 rare conditions, by another and an abiogenic mode of origin. The facts
 on which this impression rests are comparatively       few.   They consist in
 certain instances of greatly retarded germination       of Bacteria in liquids
which had been exposed to a boiling heat, and in two very remarkable
instances of the growth of fungoid vegetations (not identical with those
usually developed after air infection) in plugged bulbs which had been
boiled in a can of water.
    If it should be hereafter established that Bacteria and fungoid vege
 tations do, under exceptional circumstances, arise abiogenically, this would
not overturn the panspermic theory, it would merely limit the univer
 sality of its application.

        by Prof. A. B. Garrod, M.D., F.R.S.            Received March 12,
        1874.
                                   (Abstract.)
    The author commences by giving        a table containing  a fresh  series of

292                      On the Circulation       of the Blood.              [Apr. 23,
measurements of the ratio borne by the cardiosystole * to its component
beat in the cardiograph-trace.            These tend strongly to substantiate the
law previously published by him, viz. that the length of the cardiosystole
is constant for any given pulse-rate, and that it varies as the square root
of the length of the pulse-beat only — being found from the equation
xy = 20      x, where #=the pulse-rate, and j/=the ratio borne by the               car
diosystole to the whole beat.
   A similar series of fresh measurements are given in proof of the                  law
previously published by him, that in the sphygmograph-trace from                     the
radial artery at the wrist the length of the sphygmosystole t is constant
for any given pulse-rate, but varies as the cube root of the length of the
pulse-beat — it being found from the equation xy'=47 tyx, where A-=the
pulse-rate, and y'=the ratio borne by the sphygmosystole                  to the   whole
beat.
    By measurement of sphygmograph-tracings from the carotid in the neck
and the posterior tibial artery at the ankle, it is then shown that the
length of the sphygmosystole in those arteries is exactly tlu same
as in the radial ; so that the above-stated law as to the length of the
sphygmosystole in the latter applies to them also, and must therefore
apply equally to the pulse in the aorta.
    Such being the case, by comparing the equation for finding the length
of the cardiosystole with that for finding the aortic sphygmosystole, the
relation between the duration of the whole cardiac systolic act and the
time during which the aortic valve remains open can be estimated with
facility ; for by subtracting the shorter sphygmosystole from the longer
cardiosystole, a remainder is obtained which can be nothing else than the
expression of the time occupied by the ventricle at the commencement of
its systole in elevating its internal pressure to that of the blood in the
aorta, which must occur before the aortic valve can open up. This in
terval is named the " syspasis."           Its length is found to be constant for
any given pulse-rate, but to decrease very rapidly with increase in
rapidity of the heart's action, becoming nil when that reaches 170 a
minute.      An attempt is made to explain these phenomena.
    If the above considerations        are correct, certain independently obtained
measurements ought,          on  comparison, to correspond ; for by reference to
one of the author's papers in the ' Proceedings of the Eoyal Society,' it is
shown that the length of the there-termed second cardio-arterial interval
(which may      be called the second cardio-radial
                                                         interval) can only represent
the time taken by the second or dicrotic pulse-wave in travelling from
the aortic valve to the wrist.             This being so, there is every a priori
reason in favour of the earlier primary wave taking the same time in going
   * The cardiosystole is the interval between the commencement    of the systole and the
closure of the aortic valve in each cardiac revolution.
   f The sphygmosystole    is the interval between the opening and closing of the aortic
valve in each cardiac revolution.

 the same distance    — which can   be expressed  in other terms by saying that
 the length of the first cardio-radial interval, from which that of the
 syspasis has been subtracted, ought to be exactly the same as that of the
 second cardio-radial interval.        That such is the case is proved by the
 measurement     of  the lengths   of these two intervals independently ; and
 it is found that in all cases they agree to three places of decimals, which
 is great evidence in favour of the accuracy of the methods and arguments
 employed.
    The latter part of the paper is occupied with the description of, and the
results obtained by, the employment of a double sphygmograph, by means
of which simultaneous tracings are taken from two arteries at different
distances from the heart.          The arteries experimented on are the radial
at the wrist and the posterior tibial just behind the ankle, 29 and 52-5
inches respectively from the aortic valves. From the resulting tracings,
the time occupied by the pulse-wave in travelling the difference of
distance (52-5- 29=), 23-5 inches, is found and stated to be 0-0012 of a
minute in a pulse of 75 a minute ; and it is shown that this varies very
little with differences in pulse-rate, as might have been previously          ex
pected ; it is also proved that there is an appreciable acceleration of       the
movement    of the pulse-wave as it yets further from the heart.
    By superposing the simultaneous trace from the wrist on that from
the ankle, direct verification is obtained of the earlier proposition — that
the sphygmosystole at the wrist and that at the ankle are of exactly similar
duration. The peculiarities of the ankle-trace are also referred to.

    This is the  case at the   pyloric end of the stomach, on the villi, over
Peyer's patches, and in Lieberkiihn's glands.                               •

anatomical continuity with the reticulum of nucleated cells (connective-

lymphatic vessel are only transformed connective-tissue corpuscles.
    3. In animals killed during the absorption of fat (cream) the fat can
be seen in preparations stained by osmic acid as small black particles :
                                                                                —

observers, in the connective-tissue stroma of the villus, whence it can be
traced into the lymph-vessel.       This indicates that the fat is absorbed by
the processes of the connective tissue which exist between the epithelial
cells, and thence finds its way by the connective-tissue stroma to the
lymph-vessel.
    4. The reticulum      of nucleated cells of the mucosa forms        a special
 sheath to the vessels and unstriped muscular tissue.
    In the villi the muscular bundles, having approached the apex, termi
nate, the connective tissue which forms their sheath being continuous
with the corpuscles forming the basement membrane.
    In the mucosa of the colon of the rabbit the slender muscle-bands
divide into single muscle-fibres, on which the common sheath is con
 tinued.    This sheath becomes often connected with peculiar large, oval,
nucleated cells lying close under the epithelium.
    5. State  of  the  mucous  glands of the tongue in rest and secretion. —
It   has been found, in accordance with the researches of Professor von
Ebner, of Graz, that there are two kinds of acinous glands in the tongue,
which have been distinguished as serous and mucous — the former being
 always found in relation to the papillae vallatae and circumvallatae, the
 latter always at the root of the tongue and partially surrounding the
former.
    In the course of the present inquiry it has been further found (in sec
 tions stained in haematoxylin and carmine, made from the hardened tongue
 of an animal which had been left for a few hours without food) that the two
 kinds of glands are coloured red and blue respectively ; but in sections
 of the tongue of an animal killed while feeding, both kinds of glands were
 stained red, while any mucus in the duct of the mucous glands was
 stained blue — showing that, in the state of inanition, the cells of the mucous
 glands contain mucus, while, during secretion, the cell-substance is
 affected by the staining fluids in a manner not unlike that in which ordi
 nary cell-substance would be acted on.

upwards by the atmosphere in direct proportion to the upward diminu
tion of the temperature, and hence to explain several phenomena of sound,
and particularly the results of Prof. Tyndall's recent observations off the
South Foreland.
   The paper commences by describing the explanation of the effect of
wind upon sound, viz. that this effect is due to the lifting of the
sound from the ground, and not to its destruction, as is generally sup
posed.
   The lifting of the sound is shown to be due to the different velocities
with which the air moves at the ground and at an elevation above it.
During a wind the air moves faster above than below, therefore sound
moving against the wind moves faster below than above, the effect of which
is to refract or turn the sound upwards ; so that the " rays " of sound,
which would otherwise move horizontally along the ground, actually move
 upwards in circular or more nearly hyperbolic paths, and thus, if there
is sufficient distance, pass over the observer's head.       This explana
tion was propounded by Prof. Stokes in 1857, but was discovered inde
pendently by the author.
   The paper then contains    the description of experiments made with a
view to establish this explanation, and from which it appears that : —
   1. The velocity of wind over grass differs by one half at elevations of
1 and 8 feet, and by somewhat less over snow.
   2. When there is no wind, sound proceeding over a rough surface
is destroyed at the surface, and is thus less intense below than above.
   3. That sounds proceeding against the wind are lifted up off the ground,
and hence the range is diminished at low elevations ; but that the
sound is not destroyed, and may be heard from positions sufficiently
elevated with even greater distinctness than at the same distances with
the wind.
   4. That sounds proceeding with the wind are brought down to the
ground in such a manner as to counterbalance the effect of the rough sur
face (2) ; and hence, contrary to the experiments of Delaroche, the range
at the ground is greater with the wind than at right angles to its direc
tion, or where there is no wind.
   On one occasion it was found that the sound could be heard 360 yards
with the wind at all elevations, whereas it could be heard only 200 yards
at right angles to the wind, standing up ; and, against the wind, it was lost
at 30 yards at the ground, 70 yards standing up, and at 160 yards at an
                                                            2a2

elevation of 30 feet, although                 it could      be heard     distinctly at this latter
point a few feet higher.
  As might       be expected, the effect            of raising the bell was to extend its
range to windward, to even a greater extent than was obtained                               by an
equal elevation of the observer.
  These       results        so well with what might be expected from the
                         agree
theory as to place its     truth and completeness beyond question.
     It   is thus argued that, since the wind raises the sound so that it cannot
be heard at the ground, by causing         it to move faster below than above,
any other cause         which produces such a difference in velocity will lift the
sound in the same way ; and therefore that an upward diminution in the
temperature of the air must produce this effect ; for every degree of tem
perature  between 32° and 70° adds nearly one foot per second to the
velocity of sound.   Mr. Glaisher's balloon observations * show that when
the sun is shining with a clear sky, the variation from the surface is 1°
for every hundred feet, and that with a cloudy sky 0°-5, or half what it
                      Hence it is shown that " rays of sound, otherwise
                                                      "

horizontal,     will    be refracted upwards             in the form of circles, the radii of
which are 110,000 feet with a clear sky, and 220,000 with a cloudy sky
— that is to say, the refraction on bright hot days will be double what it
is on dull days, and still more under exceptional circumstances, and com
 paring day with night.
     It
      is then shown by calculation that the greatest refraction (110,000
 radius) is sufficient to render sound, from a cliff 235 feet high, inaudible
 on the deck of a ship at 1| mile, except such sound as might reach the
 observer by divergence from the waves passing over his head ; whereas,
 when the refraction is least (220,000 radius), that    when the sky            is,                is
 cloudy, the range would  be extended to  miles, with  similar extension

 for the diverging waves, and under exceptional circumstances the exten
 sion would be much greater.      It hence inferred that the phenomenon
                                                   is
 which Prof. Tyndall observed on the 3rd of July and other days (namely,
 that when the air was still and the sun was hot he could not hear guns
 and other sounds from the cliffs 235 feet high more than            miles,               2
 whereas when the sky clouded the range of the sounds was extended to
 3  miles, and, as evening approached, much further) was due, not to the
  stoppage or reflection of the sound                   by
                                       clouds of invisible vapour, as Prof.
 Tyndall has supposed, but to the sounds being lifted over his head                                by
 refraction in the manner described and that, had he been able to ascend
                                                    ;
 30 feet up the mast, he might at any time have extended the range of the
 sounds by    quarter of
                a         mile at least.

    The paper consists of observations made on the uteri of nine women
who had died in different stages of the monthly period.
    In two of the uteri the menstrual flow had almost ceased, and the
mucous membrane was wanting in the bodies of the organs.                     The
muscular      fibre-cells were  more   or  less exposed  in  the cavity, and  the
meshes formed by their bundles contained glands and groups of round
cells.
    In   one uterus menstruation      had ceased three days before death, and
the muscular fibres were not exposed in the cavity of the organ, but im
posed upon them was a layer of tissue composed of fusiform and round
cells.     This tissue contained glands.        The muscular tissue near the
internal orifice was devoid of glands, but nearer the fundus it contained
numerous glands.
    In one uterus,     in which the catamenial flow had    ceased probably about
a  fortnight before death, the layer of superficial tissue was thicker than
in the last    ; and near the internal orifice there was a marked and abrupt
distinction between it and the subjacent muscular tissue.
    In   one uterus the flow had ceased three weeks before death, and the
superficial layer was still thicker ; and the distinction between it and the
subjacent muscular layer was well marked, except at the fundus.              The
uterine glands were tubular, and arranged in some parts obliquely, in
others perpendicularly to the surface.           They were lined by columnar
ciliated epithelium.

    In two uteri menstruation      was imminent, but the flow had not begun.
In these the     mucous    membrane  of the body of the uterus was fully deve
loped, and had begun to undergo fatty degeneration.                There was a
marked distinction between it and the muscular tissue throughout the
uterine cavity : it was highly congested.
     In one uterus the menstrual flow had taken place for one day, and in
another for two or three days before death.          In these there was extrava
 sation of blood into the mucous membrane, and the latter had in part been
 disintegrated and removed.
     Menstruation appears essentially to consist, not in a congestion or a
 species of erection, but in growth and rapid decay of the mucous mem
 brane.      The menstrual discharge consists chiefly of blood and of the
 debris of the mucous membrane of the body of the uterus.             The source
 of the haemorrhage is the vessels of the body of the uterus.        The mucous
 membrane having undergone fatty degeneration, blood becomes extrava-
  sated into its substance; then the membrane undergoes rapid disinte
 gration, and is entirely carried away with the menstrual discharge.            A
 new mucous membrane is then developed by proliferation of the inner
 layer of the uterine wall, the muscular tissue producing fusiform cells,
 and the groups of round cells enclosed in the meshes of the muscular
 bundles producing the columnar epithelium of the glands.

  tained in a previous paper by the 6ame author, read 27th February,

      The main facts of leaf-arrangement to be accounted for are : —
  (1) the division into v&rticillate and alternate leaf-order;

           by the leaves of each whorl, and the alternation, in angular posi

           stem, with uniform angular divergence between successive leaves,

           fraction of the circumference) to certain fractional values

           Gewachse,' p. 449.         Leipzig, 1868.)
    Dealing first with the phenomena of alternate leaf-order, the theory is
 advanced that, in each of the series A, B, C, &c., the higher orders have
 been derived from some lower order of the same series by a process of
 condensation advantageous to the species in which those higher orders are
 found ; that the scene of this condensation of leaf-order has been the
 bud and other close-packed forms of plant-growth                  ; and that the imme
 diate gain has been better economy of space.
    In   support of this theory it is argued, first, that the use of leaf-order
 is to be found in that stage of the life of a shoot in which the leaf -order
 is most regular and perfect.           Leaf-order is seen in perfection in close-
 packed forms of plant-growth, such as the bud, the bulb, the radical rosette,
 the involucre, the composite head, the catkin, the cone, even the seed itself.
 Therefore it must be in these forms that leaf-order is especially useful.
 In elongated shoots, on the contrary, with long internodes and distent
 leaves,   the leaf-order      has  a tendency to lose          that regularity which it
 enjoyed in the bud, and is often disarranged by a twist of the stem
 or by contortion of the leaf-stalks (required for the better display of the
 leaf-blades to the light).       The native arrangement of the leaves (excluding
 the order         is often a positive disadvantage            to them in lateral twigs.
 It  is only in the more vertical and unembarrassed shoots that the leaf-
 blades remain content with their distributive position.                Indeed, one chief
 use of the leaf-stalk       seems to be to enable the leaf -blade to make the best
 of an unfavourable birth-place.             (Yew, silver fir, box, and privet are in
 stanced aB examples.)          Hence    it  appears probable that the use of leaf-
order is not to be found in the elongated shoot.
    Looking, then, to the above-mentioned close-packed forms of plant-
growth as the scene of the usefulness of leaf -order, it is seen that the cha
racteristic feature which distinguishes them from the elongated forms is
contact between neighbouring leaves (or shoots). The whole surface of the
stem is occupied by their bases, and no vacant interstices are left between
them.       It is plain that the process of cell-growth has resulted in great
mutual pressure between neighbouring                leaves     and shoots.   Becoguizing

300                  Dr. H. Airy      on Leaf-Arrangement.              [Apr. 30,
this fact of mutual pressure, we can       see that leaf-order is useful in these
close-packed forms by securing equal development of
                                                            leaves and therefore
economy of space.        If the whole space is to be occupied, and the leaves
or shoots are to have equal development, there must be orderly ar
rangement of some kind.           The principle of economy of space under
mutual    pressure is put forward as of chief importance
                                                                in leaf-arrange
ment.
    It appears  that economy of space is especially demanded in a longi
tudinal direction, for the sake of protection against vicissitudes of tem
perature and the attacks of enemies. In a bud, for example,
                                                                   it is evidently
important, on the one hand, that as many leaves as possible should attain
as high development as their situation will allow, in order that they may
be ready at the     first approach of spring to complete that development
and enter on their function without loss of time ; but, on the other hand,
it is evidently important that the embryo shoot should be as short as
possible, in order that it may be well within the guard of the protecting
 scales and less exposed to danger during the long period of bud-life.
These claims will be satisfied by a vertical condensation of the leaf -order,
such as the state of mutual pressure of the embryo leaves and shoots is
calculated to bring about.
    That the arrangements represented by the lower terms of the above-
 mentioned series A, B, C, &c. would, under a force of longitudinal con
densation, actually give rise to the successive arrangements represented
 by the higher terms of the same series, is shown by diagrams, in which
the necessary consequences of each step of condensation are made
apparent to the eye.        In these diagrams a leaf or shoot is represented
 (for mechanical considerations) by a sphere, and the spheres are numbered
from 0 upwards.           Taking, first, series A, the lowest order of that
series,     is represented     by two vertical  rows of spheres, those of each
         g,
row being in contact and alternating with those of the other. If these
two rows remain vertical, no longitudinal condensation can take place.
 The first step towards such condensation must be their spontaneous
deviation from the vertical.       (Instances of such deviation in nature are
found in the genus Gasteria and others, to be considered further on.)
The next step required is some force of vertical compression, such as
 would result in nature from the stunting of the bud-axis (due directly to
 cold or indirectly to the advantage of protection gained thereby), attended
 with less, if any, stunting of the leaves. Then it is seen that the succes
 sive stages of condensation, beginning with the order 1, will bring succes-

cessive maxima of stability in the process of change from the simple to
the complex.   These results are not invalidated by the consideration
that the natural development of leaves     not simultaneous but succes   is

     From the striking correspondence thus brought out between fact and
theory, the conclusion                 is       anticipated           that we have here
                                                             clue to the                       a
secret of complex spiral leaf-order — that    the result of condensation   it   is
operating on some earlier and simpler order or orders, the successive
stages of that condensation being ruled by the geometrical necessities of
mutual accommodation among the leaves and axillary shoots under
mutual pressure in the bud (taking the bud as the type of close-packed
forms).
   From this point of view, Hofmeister's law, that every leaf    found at                          is
that point in the circumference of the stem which has been left most open
by the earlier leaves of the cycle, means that every leaf stands in that
position relative to its neighbours which gave   most room for develop               it
ment in the bud.
   Allusion was made above to deviation of leaf-ranks from the vertical
as   necessary first step towards condensation.

vertical,  to   a form     in which    they are strongly     twisted   into  a com
plex order with angular divergence           nearly      differing from    - by only
i. of   the circumference,       and evidently admitting       of further twist and
closer approximation        to the order         From this striking series it is
                                            |.
inferred that ranks originally vertical can and do acquire and transmit a
tendency to deviate from the vertical, and that this tendency admits of
augmentation      to a high degree.
    Assuming     a   twist, then, as a probable primary variation from an
originally vertical condition of leaf-ranks, it is plain that each leaf would
take a lower position, and the whole bud (with the same number of
leaves) would be shorter, than in the untwisted form.              The shorter bud,
it is supposed, would have an advantage in cold seasons.                   The direct
action of cold, by stunting the bud-axis (provided it did not stunt the
leaves in the same proportion), would increase the twist.              It may fairly
be supposed that this twist would be taken advantage of and increased
by natural selection in subservience to the close packing of the leaves.
This course of modification is equivalent to the continued action of a
force of vertical compression (mentioned above as the second requisite for
condensation).
    Transition similar to that in Gasteria is seen in the genus Aloe.
Compare the two vertical ranks of A. verrucosa with the two twisted ranks
of A. obliqua. In A. serra (Sachs, ' Lehrbuch der Botanik,' fig. 144)
the change from the vertical to the strongly twisted form is found in the
                                                     *
same    plant :  the basal leaves are in order         ;  the higher take complex
 order.
    Exactly comparable (in this respect) with Aloe serra are the common
 laurel, Portugal laurel, Spanish chestnut, ivy, and others, which exhibit a
 similar change of leaf-order.         These instances agree in presenting the
 complex   order   in the buds   or parts of buds which occupy the most exposed
 situations,  while they       retain  the  simple  order 1 in the      less exposed
 lateral buds or in      their    basal  portion. The exposure in the former
 case may be regarded as a sample of that which, in the course of
 many generations, has (it is supposed) occasioned the condensation of
leaf -order.
    It is here contended that the force of           gravity (to which the two-
ranked leaf-order of lateral twigs is referred by some authors) could
not have been equally the cause of the phenomena seen in the inclined
lateral shoot of Spanish chestnut and in the upright Aloe serra : but the
phenomena in the two cases are the same, and admit of a common
explanation by the condensation theory,          if we regard the basal portion

of the shoot    as retaining   the ancient order, and the more exposed terminal
portion   as having undergone       protective modification.

   The various     degrees   of obliquity of spiral ranks in the alternate orders
of leaf-arrangement,       and the complicated numerical relations existing
between those various ranks, are all fully accounted for by the conden
sation theory.
   Analyzing the spiral arrangement seen in a sunflower-head, a dandelion-
head, a house-leek rosette, and an apple-twig, the result is found to be
that any leaf (or fruit, in the first two instances), taken as zero, has for next
neighbours successively, in rising steps of complexity of order, the 1st, 2nd,
3rd, 5th, 8th, 13th, 21st, 34th, 55th, 89th, 144th, &c. (in order of growth)
alternately on the right side and on the left, producing alternately right-
and left-handed spirals in sets of 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144,
&c. ; and these numbers are identical with those which would result
from     condensation    of one of the lower orders of series A. Similar
 considerations apply to series B and C.
    It is a significant relation that, in the sunflower and similar examples,
the arrangement of the fruits in the composite head is such as would
result from condensation of the arrangement of the leaves on the stem.
   Among the whorled orders also there is equally strong evidence of the
working of the same force of condensation.
    First there is a series (a) derivable from the crucial arrangement.
 (This is shown by diagrams.)          In the orders thus formed it is seen that
conspicuous     sets of  parallel spirals will form the most striking feature,
and that these spirals will be found in sets of 2, 4, 6, 10, 16, 20, 42, &c.
 (series a).
    Instances are seen     in the genera Mercurialis and Sagina, and the order
Dipsacacece,   in which last the whole series a finds exemplification.
    Here also it is a significant relation that the fruit-order in the com
posite heads of Dipsacacece is such as would result from condensation of
the crucial order of their stem-leaves.          Some of these plants exhibit in
their radical leaves a minor degree of the same condensation.
    In like manner it is shown that condensation of whorls of three
would produce orders with spirals in sets of 3, 6, 9, 15, 24, 39, 63, &c.
 (series /3). For examples see Hofmeister, op. cit. p. 460.
    Condensation (if any) of whorls of four would give spirals in sets of
 4, 8, 12, 20, 32, &c. (series y).
    It is  contended that the preceding evidence, drawn from both divisions
 of leaf-arrangement (alternate and whorled), is sufficient to establish the
 principle of condensation        as  having   played an important part in the
 history of leaf-arrangement.

 304                  Dr. H. Airy     on  Leaf- Arrangement.            [Apr. 30,
     But there are phenomena in leaf-arrangement which are not explained
 by condensation.       We have still to account for (1) the origin of alter
 nate orders with 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, &c. "vertical ranks     ; and (2) the origin of
 the different    whorled   orders, with whorls of two, three, four, five, &c.
 (with   4, 6, 8, 10, &c. vertical ranks).
     The whole course of condensation depended on obliquity of ranks ; but
 the distinguishing feature in these cases is that the ranks are exactly or
 almost exactly vertical.
     All these cases are explained on the hypothesis that there has been in the
 vegetable kingdom a variability (per saltum) in the number of leaf-ranks;
 that a plant originally having two vertical ranks has, by a stroke of
 variation, produced shoots or seedlings with three vertical ranks ; that
 three have varied to four, four to five, five to six, and so on ; and that
 these " sports
                  "
                    have survived in some cases because of some advantage
 which    they   enjoyed   (probably the same    advantage as that gained by
 condensation — the accommodation of the            same number of leaves in
 a shorter   bud).
     This hypothesis is supported by the variability which is found at the
 present day in the number of leaf -ranks in one and the same species.
 For instance, Scdiun scxangulare exhibits seven nearly vertical ranks in order
 ?, or six exactly vertical in whorls of three.       Fraxinus  excelsa  has   nor
 mally four exactly vertical ranks       in whorls of two, but may      be   found
 with five nearly vertical ranks in order ?, or with six exactly vertical in
 whorls of three.      (These three varieties may be found on shoots growing
 from the same stump.)         Whorls of three are often produced by plants
 usually bearing    whorls   of two (e. t/. sycamore, lilac, laurustinus, maple,
 horse-chestnut,    elder, ash, &c.), and whorls of four instead of three are
 seen in some species of Sedum and Verbena.          Among these forms it does
 not seem possible that one could be produced from another by accumu
 lative modification.
     Professor Beal   has  found well-marked    variation in the cones of larch,
 spruce, &c, the majority belonging to series A, but a considerable minority
to series B or series a.
    In dandelion-heads about 5 per cent, belong to series a.
    Different species of the same genus (e. g. Aloe verrucosa and variecjatay
Haworthia viscosa and pentaijona, and different species of Sedum and
 Cactus) often exhibit differences of leaf-order which can hardly be under
stood but as resulting from direct variation in number of leaf-ranks.
    This hypotheses is also supported by analogy drawn from the animal
kingdom.       Among starfishes there is variability in the number of rays :
Asterias rubens has sometimes four or six instead of five ; A. papposa has
from twelve to fifteen.       Among mammals there is some variability in the
number of digits.

    Supposing, then, that, by strokes of variation, forms have been pro
duced with (2) 3, 4, 5, 6, &c. vertical leaf-ranks, it is next to be con
sidered how the arrangement of the leaves in each form would be affected
by the demands of economy of space and mutual accommodation of ranks,
supposing the ranks to be similar in point of size and number of leaves.
    Two vertical ranks would gain lateral accommodation by taking
alternate    order 1.     Under vertical condensation,         with twist in either
                     z
direction, they would give rise to the successive orders of series A. (Two
ranks are found in uneconomical opposite order in the genus Mesenibry-
antlumum.        This arrangement would be prone to fall into crucial order
under vertical compression.)
     Three vertical ranks would, with least surrender          of lateral accommo
dation, assume alternate order       \  (illustrated by diagram).      A slight twist
                                     o
in one direction       (No. 3 towards         No. 1) would allow perfect lateral
accommodation.         In three-ranked       plants (e. g. Carex and Alnus) such
twist is usually found.        Vertical condensation operating on three ranks
possessing     this obliquity would   produce subsequent orders of series A. If
the obliquity were in the opposite direction (No. 3 towards No. 2), con
densation would produce successive orders of series B.
     Four vertical ranks would economically fall into crucial order, the
members of each rank fitting into the intervals between those of its
neighbours.        Opposite members therefore would stand at the same
 height, and would occupy one and the same node ; they would also
 divide the circumference equally, and would stand over the intervals of
 the next lower pair. This crucial order under vertical condensation
 would produce series a. In rare cases four ranks might assume an
 alternate    order        Vertical condensation         of this order  i with   twist
 (No. 4 towards No. 1) would produce series B ; with opposite

    Thus      it    appears that          the whorled orders would               naturally arise from
economic arrangement of even numbers (except 2), and the alternate
orders from economic arrangement of odd numbers (including also 2), of
vertical ranks.
    It
     also appears that, in the whorled division, the members of each
whorl will divide the circumference of the stem equally, and that succes
sive whorls will alternate in angular position.
   It has already been shown that in the alternate                                 division the spiral
arrangement of the leaves, with angular divergence limited to certain
series of fractional values (A, B,                        C,
                                      &c.), would follow on the hypothesis
of condensation.

                 Grubb, F.R.S.                 Received    April   30, 1874.
  The importance, as an instrument of research, which the spectroscope
has reached within a few years, renders any improvement therein
a matter   of general scientific interest.   Hitherto it has been under a
disadvantage,   which,  though slight  in amount  in those cases in which the                       .
dispersive power of the instrument is moderate, becomes a rather serious
annoyance to the observer when a number of prisms are used in serial
combination, and the curvature of the spectral lines is proportionally
increased, and only to be restrained in appearance by using a narrow
breadth of the spectrum.
  I  have lately thought of a very simple and practical remedy (which
may indeed have occurred to others, but which                       I
                                                         have not seen men
tioned), whereby those lines are rendered palpably straight in a very
large field ; but previous to describing         desirable to refer to
                                                    it, it   is         state            a
ment appearing in the Astronomical Notices for last month (March), viz.

that  the spectral lines can be rendered perfectly straight simply                             by
returning them (after their first passage through       series of prismsa
arranged for minimum deviation) by      direct reflection from
                                                     a             plane                 a

in construction for the Royal Observatory.
  Such    statement has, as might be expected, produced several inquiries
            a                                                                                   ;
in one case the querist     much interested, viz. by having a very large
                                  is
spectroscope in hand which, from its construction, involves the ques
tion of straight or curved lines resulting. It therefore seems desirable
to remove any illusion which may be entertained, by short considera     a
tion of the economy of the spectroscope, so far as the question of curva
ture   is   concerned.
   The curvature of the spectral lines may be considered         function of     a
the dispersion of     prism
                         a        (the curvature) not only always accom
                                      ;   it
panies the dispersion, but, further, its character     always the same with
                                                                   is
respect to the dispersion —  that    to say, the centre of curvature will be
                                               is
found invariably to lie    the same direction with respect to the direction
                                 in
of the dispersion, the lines being invariably concave towards that end
of the spectrum having the more refrangible rays*. This (which admits
of the clearest proof)    adequate to show the impossibility that, by any
                             is
 *   Professor Stokes has indeed investigated form of compound prism in which the
                                                    a
resulting lines are straight, and on the same principle we may combine prisms (using
of course media of different optical powers) in which, with a balance of dispersion
remaining, the curvature might be found reversed but this does not affect the general

law. The curvature in that compound prism (which was the result of various trials, and.
first used in the spectroscope of the Great Melbourne Telescope, and now, apprehend, I
in pretty general estimation and use) probably has Icsb proportional curvature of the

kind of inversion, whether by reflections or otherwise, we can neutralize
the curvature while doubling the dispersion.
   If we examine the spectrum, as produced by a series of prisms placed
in the position of minimum deviation, we necessarily find that the lines
of higher refrangibility, also their centres of curvature, lie towards the
centre of the polygon which the prisms themselves affect ; and if we arrest
the rays at any part of the circuit, and reflect them directly back by a
plane mirror, this reflection reverses (right for left) not only the direc
tion of the centre of curvature of the lines, but also the direction of the
spectrum itself, both which are consequently doubled in amount after
the rays have performed the second, or return, passage through the
prisms ; or (conversely)          if,
                             after the first passage through the prisms, we
reflect the rays so as to pass through a similar set in such manner as to
neutralize the curvature of the first set, we shall find the resulting dis
persion reduced to zero.

                                                    is
incurred in construction, and no apparent objection to its use.   It may
be objected that for each variation of prism-power in use there should be
a special slit. It is, however, only in spectroscopes arranged for high
dispersion that the curvature becomes objectionable     in such there;                 is
seldom    change required, and a single slit of medium balancing-power
           a
would probably remove all practical difficulty, or             objectionable curvature
of the lines.    Ihave found by trial that, when                two compound prisms
were in use, giving a dispersion from A to H of                nearly 14°, the spectral
lines were straight in a field of one degree, when             the radius of curvature
of the slit was made l-25 inch.

        By Professor Balfour Stewart, LL.D., F.R.S., and            Arthur
        Schuster, Ph.D. Received March 30, 1874.
    1. The following experiments were made in the Physical Laboratory
 of Owens College, Manchester.       The copper wire employed (A B C D,
see   fig.) was found to contain   no perceptible trace of iron, nor was it
sensibly magnetic, behaving quite in a neutral manner when tested by
the highest magnetic power at our disposal.       It was covered with gutta
percha.     The diameter of the wire was O0487 inch. The wire was
wound fifty-three times, in one direction, round the poles of a powerful
electromagnet, the length of wire encircling these poles being about
twelve metres. The direct distance of the magnet from the galva
nometer,    Q-, was about twelve metres.
   A   Wheatstone    bridge was employed, and a very delicate Thomson's
reflecting   galvanometer by Elliott Brothers, of which the resistance was
5540 B.-A. units.     A circuit-breaker was placed in the circuit at E, close
to the bridge.      On some occasions, we used one consisting of a solid
key, which might be removed, thus breaking the circuit ; but, on other
occasions, a fluid or mercurial circuit-breaker was employed.
   When the left-hand pole of the electromagnet (see fig.) was made north
the arrangement was called (1), and when the other pole was made north
the arrangement was called (2). It will thus be seen, from the figure,
that the current went round the magnet in the same direction as the mole
cular currents of arrangement (2).
   Experiments were made at intervals of two minutes ; s ad. on each
occasion, the current was allowed      to pass through   the bridge for ten

battery were used for producing this current ; but, on the other hand, six
similar cells were employed for magnetizing the electromagnet.         The
arrangements for magnetizing are not shown in the figure. The distance
of the magnet was too great to affect the galvanometer-needle so as to
alter its sensibility, the average deflection causing a difference in the
zero of about four divisions of the scale.
   2. In the first experiments made, the key at E (see fig.) was not taken
out before the magnetism was put on or off, in consequence of which the
induction-current, due to the wire coiled round the magnet, affected the
galvanometer on these occasions ; but, after December 12th, the key was
taken out, so that no induction-current passed.

  It will   be seen from this experiment that the first tfftct of putting on
the magnetism was a marked increase'of resistance ; but, with this excep
tion, the resistance, when the magnetism was on, was less than the mean
of the two resistances on both sides of                it,

  3. The arrangement remained untouched, as far as we know, from
December 15, when      was finally made, until December 19, when the
                        it
experiments were interrupted during the Christmas holidays  and in all
                                                                  ;

eases the   first  effect of   putting on the magnetism was           a marked   increase
of resistance.       For instance,       we have —

   It  was soon seen that this          first effect had some reference to the time
elapsing   since    the   last  experiments were made. For instance, in the
above Table, we see for December 18th a marked increase of resistance
when the magnet was first put on; but, on the afternoon of that day, the
experiments were repeated, and there was no apparent increase of
resistance in this first effect. Next, with regard to the average effect : on
Dec. 16th, 17th, and 18th, this average effect of magnetism was a decrease
of resistance; but on Dec. 19th there was an apparent increase of resist
ance when the magnetism was on.                    We cannot say that nothing had
been done to the arrangement between the 18th and 19th of December
that might account for this change ; but whatever was done must have
escaped our recollection.           Undoubtedly a good many experiments were
made during the time between the 15th and 19th of December, and the
direction    of the magnetism             was   frequently changed.        This curious
anomaly, occurring        unexpectedly,       induced   us  to  limit our future  experi
ments to a definite set each day.
   4. The experiments were resumed                   on January 7th, the arrange
ment having remained untouched during the holidays.                      From this date
until January 10th inclusive, the key was taken out before beginning
experiments in the morning : there was no peculiar first effect ; while, on
the other hand, an average effect denoting a decrease of resistance came
out very prominently. On January 12th and 13th the key was only
taken out before magnetizing, and on these occasions the first effect,
denoting increased resistance, was sufficiently marked.
   Our method of procedure was varied in the above manner up to
January 27th ; and it was invariably found that, whenever the key was
taken out before commencing experiments, there was no first effect; but
when it was kept in until before magnetizing, this first effect was suffi
ciently marked. These experiments concur in proving that the first
effect has some reference to the previous
                                                     treatment of the wire ; but they
do not prove that it is at the same time connected with the putting on
of the magnetism.           To determine this point we made a set of experi
ments on January 22nd, 26th, and 27th. When the current had become
constant the key was taken out, but the magnetism was not put on ; and
on these occasions there was no first effect of the current upon itself in the
direction of increased resistance, but rather in the opposite direction. It
thus appears that the first effect which increases the resistance has not

only reference to the previous treatment of the wire, but depends also
upon the magnetism being put on.
   This result is confirmed by experiments made previous to Dec. 12th,
in which the key was not taken out at all. For instance, we have on
Dec. 9th,
              First   off.                   On first effect.         Second   off.

  We have hitherto           spoken of the first effect obtained after
                                 only
January 7th ; we now come to the average effect. From January 7th
to January 27th inclusive, the magnetism was always put on in the
direction (1), and the average effect invariably denoted a decrease of
resistance when the magnetism was on.
  5.  On January 28th the magnetism was reversed ; the effect during                      this
day  was very irregular. On January 29th, 30th, 31st, and February                        2nd
the key was left in until before magnetization.   The first effect was                    now
extremely large ; but it was suspected that, during these experiments,                     the
contact of the key was not very good.
  On January 29th the average effect denoted a decrease of resistance,
but on January 30th, 31st, February 2nd, 4th, 6th, the average effect
denoted an increase of resistance.
  6. From February 6th until February 11th the wires were left broken ;
on February 11th there was a very slight first effect in the direction of
increased resistance,and a slight average effect in the direction of de
creased resistance. On February 12th a mercury interrupter was used
instead of a metal key, both the wires being broken by      and its use  it,
was continued until February 18th.                     The interrupter was left in over
 night and the current was only broken                    before magnetization, but no
first effect was observed.
   From February 19th to February 26th one wire only was broken by
the fluid interrupter nevertheless there was no first effect.
                             ;
   On February 12th, when the fluid interrupter was first employed, there
was    very small average effect in the direction of increased resistance
       a                                                                                     ;
but, in all the experiments afterwards, this average effect was in the direc
tion of decreased resistance.     The magnetism had been in the direction
(2) from  January 28th     but, during the experiment of February 25th,
                                 ;                                                          it
was reversed and retained in this condition through the experiment of
February 26th, without appearing to affect the results.
   7. From these experiments we may perhaps conclude as follows —                     :
   In the first place, there     first effect in the direction of increased
                                        is   a
resistance which appears to have reference to three things — namely, the
previous state of the wire, the solidity of the circuit, and its mag
netization.
   Inthe second place, we have an average effect, of which the normal state
appears to denote       decreased resistance while the magnetism
                             a                                          on,           is
without reference to the direction of the magnetism.

    In  the third place, when, in a solid circuit, the direction of the mag
 netism   has been recently changed, there appears to be a temporary
 reversal of the average effect, which appears, at first, as an increase of
 resistance.    Besides the evidence herein detailed, we have other evidence
 in favour of the third conclusion     ; for in  some   preliminary experiments,
 in which we frequently reversed the poles, we found an increase of
resistance when the magnetism was on.               We have given, in a Table
appended to this paper, a synopsis of our various experiments.
    8. We are led to conclude, from other experiments besides these, that
 the effect of the magnetism is not merely confined to the part of the copper
 wire wound round the poles, but is propagated all along the wire.              On
 December 2nd, for instance, the current was passed through the wire,
the galvanometer being joined as a secondary circuit. The main current
 was therefore measured.
    The deflections were    as follows : —
            297                  off            300                  off
            300                 (1)             302                  (1)
            297                  off            301                  off
            300                  (1)
    This shows an average strengthening of the current, equal to about
one two-hundredth part of the whole.           Were this strengthening due to
merely the change of resistance of that part of the wire wound round
the poles, the effect, as measured by the much more delicate arrangement
of Wheatstone's bridge, would be much larger than was actually observed.
    9. Allusion was made in article 7 to some preliminary experiments, in
which increased resistance was observed when the magnetism was put on
(1) and (2) alternately.        Similar experiments were made, giving the
same result    with a piece  of coke and graphite, which were placed between
the poles of the magnet.
    10. We have also some evidence that a copper wire, one end of which
is wound round the pole of the magnet, changes its position in the
electromotive series.     Two copper wires were dipped into dilute nitric
acid and connected with the galvanometer.               A weak current passed
through   the  galvanometer owing    to  a slight difference  in the copper wires,
one of which was also connected with the copper wire wound round the
magnet.      When the magnet was on, the current, as a rule, changed in
intensity ; but the effect was small, and the difficulty of having two
copper wires which, when joined together and dipped into nitric acid,
give a current sufficiently weak and constant, prevented us from getting
any decided results.
   11. In conclusion we have to state that we regard these results which
we have ventured to bring before the Eoyal Society as preliminary, the
correctness of which will, we trust, be confirmed         by the further experi
ments which it is our intention to make.

                      Alps."        By E. Frankland, F.R.S.
    During the past winter,          I spent a fortnight at the village of Davos,
Canton       Graubiinden, Switzerland, and had thus an opportunity of
experiencing some of the remarkable peculiarities of the climate of the
elevated valley (the Priittigau) in which Davos is situated.                    The village
has of late acquired considerable repute as a climatic sanitarium for
persons suffering from diseases of the chest.                 So rapidly has its reputa
tion grown, that while in the winter of 1865-66 only eight patients
resided there, during the past season upwards of three hundred have
wintered in the valley.
    The summer climate of Davos is very similar to that of Pontresina and
St. Moritz, in the neighbouring high valley of the Engadin — cool and
rather windy ; but so soon as the Prattigau and surrounding mountains
become thickly and, for the winter, permanently covered with snow,
which usually happens in November, a new set of conditions come into
play and the winter climate becomes exceedingly remarkable.                        The sky
is, as a rule, cloudless or nearly so ; and, as the solar rays, though very
powerful, are incompetent to melt the snow, they have little effect upon
the temperature, either of the valley or its enclosing mountains ; conse
quently there are no currents of heated air ; and, as the valley is well
sheltered from more general atmospheric movements, an almost uniform
calm prevails until the snow melts in spring.

   According to Dufour's trigonometrical             measurements,      Davos is 1556
metres, or 5105 feet, above           the sea;     the measurements       of the Swiss
Meteorological Society make the height 1650 metres, or 5413 feet ; and
my own estimation with an aneroid gave it as 4000 feet above Zurich,
or 5352 feet above the sea.           The village of Davos is therefore about 500
feet lower than the summit of the Bigi.
   I  arrived on the evening of the 20th of December, and found the snow
lying from two to three feet deep on the flat sole of the valley. On the
following morning the thermometric observations were commenced with
instruments supplied to me by Mr. L. Casella, all of which had been
certified at the Kew Observatory.              For the corresponding readings at
Greenwich        I am indebted    to Mr. Glaisher.
    December 21st,     1873.  —  From behind the sharp peak of the Sehwarz-
hom the sun rose at the Seehof Hotel, Davos-Dorfli, at 8.35 a.m.
Throughout the day the sun was alternately clear and obscured by
clouds.      At Davos-Platz it did not rise until 9.44 a.m. At 10 a.m. the
mercurial thermometer with blackened bulb in vacuo showed 44° C.
(lll°-2 Fahr.) in the sunshine, and 45° C. (113° Fahr.) at 2.50 p.m. At
Greenwich the readings on this day with the blackened bulb in vacuo
placed on the grass
                            * in the sunshine were : — at 9 a.m., 9°-3 C.
                                                                                    (48°-7
Fahr.), at noon and at 3 p.m., 21°-9 C. (71°"5 Fahr.), the maximum
during the day being 21°-9 C. (71°-5 Fahr.).                The maximum tempera
ture observed in the shade was 10o-9 C. (51Q,7 Fahr.), and the minimum
on grass in the shade 2°-l C. (35°-7 Fahr.).
   December 22nd. —A mercurial thermometer with black glass bulb was
laid on the snow at 8 a.m. ; twenty minutes later, or fifteen minutes
before sunrise, it marked — 18°-3 C. ( — 1° Fahr.).                The sky was deep
blue, and almost perfectly cloudless during the whole day. Five minutes
after sunrise many of the patients at the Seehof Hotel were walking in
the open air without any special wraps, and many of them without over
coats. In the brilliant sunshine one felt comfortably warm sitting in
front of the hotel in a light morning coat. The following thermometrical
observations were made on this day : —
   *  Sinoe the above was written  I have ascertained that the readings of this kind of in
strument are much higher when it is laid on grass than when it is clamped upon a
staff at a height of 5 feet above the ground. Thus, at St. Leonard's-on-Sea on the 7th
of April last, this thermometer in sunshine stood at 42°'3 C. at 11.50 a.m., when placed
5 feet from the ground, but when laid on the grass it promptly rose to 56°-5 C.       It is
therefore evident that the readings of the solar thermometer at Greenwich, given
throughout this paper, are much too high for fair comparison with the Davos tempera
ture,  the  thermometer at Greenwich having been always laid upon the grass.            On
the 7th of  April the sky at St. Leonard's was clear, the air warm with but little wind,
and the sun bright ; nevertheless the maximum temperature during the day in sunshine
was 2°-7 C. lower than that observed with the same instrument at Davos on the 21st of
December    last. — May 7, 1874.

12°-6 C. (54°-6 Fahr.) ; at 3 p.m., 22°-8 C. (73° Fahr.).                    The maximum
in the    shade was 8°-3 C. (46°-9 Fahr.),             and the minimum          on grass    in
the shade -2°-3 C. (270,9 Fahr.).
   December       2ith. — As the Fluela pass, the highest carriage-road in Swit
zerland, was still open for sledges,           I  determined to make some observa
tions on the summit, which is 7890 feet above the sea, and consequently
about 2538 feet above Davos.               Starting from Davos at 8 a.m.,           I arrived
at the summit of the pass, where there is a small hotel and telegraph
station, at 10.30 a.m.
    The early morning was somewhat cloudy, but, about ten o'clock, the
sky became perfectly clear and deep blue, and continued so until the sun
set behind the Schwarzhorn, a few minutes past noon.                          The fpllowing
temperatures were recorded : —
   I. The blackened bulb in vacuo marked 41°- 7 C. at 11 a.m. in the sun
shine, 42°-3 C. at 11.30 a.m., and 42°-3 C. at 12 o'clock.
    II.  The plain black glass bulb in the shade showed at noon — 7°"2 C.
when freely suspended about two feet above the snow in a brisk breeze.
    The highest temperature in sunshine which                  I  have observed at Davos
at noon, with the blackened bulb in vacuo, was 420-5, which scarcely
differs from that read on the Fluela pass at the same hour.                        So far as
these limited observations go, therefore, they indicate that the solar rays
are not of appreciably higher thermal intensity at a height of 7890 feet
                                                                                 -
than at a height of 5350 feet.             I may add that the thermometer in the
sunshine was sheltered from the wind on the Fluela pass, and was, in all
respects but one, in a more favourable position for attaining a high tem
perature than at Davos. The one unfavourable condition was its expo
sure to less solar heat reflected from the snow than at Davos.

   At Greenwich         the readings were, with blackened bulb in vacuo : —
maximum 19°-5 C. (67°-l Fahr.) ; at 9 a.m., 9°-6 C. (49°-3 Fahr.) ; at
noon, 18°-6 C. (65°-5 Fahr.) j and at 3 p.m., 19°-5 C. (67°-l Fahr.).                    The

grass in the shade -3°-l C. (26°-5 Fahr.).
   December 25th. — The sky was again deep blue and perfectly cloudless.
The air was also apparently clear, except at about 9 a.m., when the village
and valley became immersed in a light fog, which consisted of minute
snow crystals.        On this and most subsequent days isolated crystals could
be  distinctly seen floating in the air, by placing the eye in shadow and
then     looking into the sunshine.             The abundance or paucity of these
suspended and, under ordinary circumstances, invisible snow crystals
must exercise a powerful influence upon the intensity of solar radiation.
To this cause, for instance, it was probably due that at 1.45 p.m. on this
day, although the sky was perfectly clear and the sunshine most intensely
brilliant, the blackened bulb in vacuo only stood at 35° C. in the sun,
whereas at noon,           when     all the conditions      were apparently the same
 (except, of course, the sun's altitude), the temperature was 5° C. higher.

    The chief remarkable things about the observations made last winter
 are, first, the very high sun-temperatures prevailing contemporaneously
 with very low air- or shade-temperatures, and secondly, the compara
 tive uniformity of the solar heat from sunrise to sunset.                    Thus on the
 29th of December, whilst the temperature of the air was                   —  18°*1 C, the
 sun-thermometer       stood at +37° C, and on the following day, with an air-
 temperature not exceeding — 120,8 C, the sun-temperature was 38°-5 C.
 Again, the sun-temperatures observed on the 26th of December illustrate
the comparative uniformity of solar radiation during the day, when the
sky remains        cloudless.    Twenty-five minutes          after   sunrise    the solar
thermometer        indicated   310-8 C. ; at noon       it stood at 42°-5 C, and at
thirty-five minutes before sunset it recorded 330,1 C.
    Besides the intensity of solar radiation and its comparative uniformity
during the day, the rarity and calmness of the air are important factors
amongst the causes of the peculiar climate of Davos.                     With the baro
meter standing at 615 millims. the weight of air in contact with a given
surface of the skin is about one fifth less than it is at the sea-level. The
excessive dryness of the air at Davos has probably but little special influ
ence upon the sensation of heat and cold, because the maximum proportion
of aqueous vapour present in air near 0° C. is everywhere small, and the
specific heats of equal volumes of air and aqueous vapour are not widely
    TOI. xsii.                                                               2 o        ,

 different.      On the other hand, the    absence   of suspended watery particles
 in the air      has, no doubt, very considerable      influence in preventing the
 chilling of the skin.         Not only are such liquid particles present when
 there is visible fog, but they often exist in great numbers when the air
 possesses its usual transparent appearance.           Another very important in
 fluence upon the sun-temperature is         the reflection   of solar rays from the
 snow.      The valley of Davos is about one mile wide, and has precipitous
 sides and a flat sole.       The villages of Davos-Dorfli and Davos-Platz are
 situated on the north-west slope of the valley, and consequently receive
 the scattered solar rays reflected from a large area of snow.               I  have no
 doubt that the sun-temperature at the opposite side of the valley is
  markedly lower ; but having no second sun-thermometer,               I could not as
 certain this by the comparison of simultaneous thermometric observa
  tions.    When staying at Ventnor, in the winter of 1872-73, 1 noticed
 that a not inconsiderable proportion of the total solar heat falling upon
  a house on a cliff, near the shore, was reflected from the sea. M. Dufour
 has since observed the same phenomenon between Lausanne and Vevay
  on the Lake of Geneva*, and has actually measured the proportions of
 direct and reflected heat incident at five different stations on the northern
'shore of the lake.       He found that the proportion of reflected heat was as
 much as 68 per cent, of the heat directly incident from the sun, when
 the sun's altitude was between 4° 38' and 3° 34'. At about 7° altitude
 the proportion was between 40 and 50 of reflected to 100 of direct heat.
 Even at about 16° altitude the proportion was between 20 and 30 of
  reflected to 100 of direct heat ; but when the sun was higher than 30°,
  the reflected heat was hardly appreciable.             It will be seen that this
  action of extensive reflecting surfaces of snow or water must exert a
  powerful influence upon the maximum temperature of places favour
  ably situated for receiving the reflected rays ; and, moreover, where
  the proportion of heat reflected varies (as it has been proved to do in the
  case of water, and as it doubtless also does in the case of snow) inversely
  as the angle formed by the incident        rays and the reflecting      surface, this
  action must       materially contribute, especially in winter, to the main
  tenance of an approximately uniform sun-temperature throughout the
  day. At Davos and similar elevated stations, however, the comparative
 freedom      of the air from suspended liquid and solid particles must
  obviously contribute, to a still greater extent, to such a result ; for as pure
  and dry air is transcalent and reflects light but slightly, the horizontal
  sunbeams, passing through such air, would be nearly as powerful as ver
 tical rays.
     The peculiar winter climate of Davos appears, therefore, to depend
  upon the following conditions :—
     1 . Elevation above the sea, which causes greater rarity of the air, and
     *   Comptes   Eendus   hebdomadaires  des  Seances   de  l'Acad^mie   des  Scienoea,
 June   80th, 1873.

 1874.]            Thermometric Observations in the Alps.                    327
 consequently     less abstraction  of heat from the body.       It also secures
 greater transcalency in the atmosphere by a position above the chief region
 of aqueous precipitation, and which is comparatively out of the reach of
 the dust and fuliginous matters that pollute the lower stratum of the
 air. On my journey from London to Davos           I never saw the sun until    I
 had arrived nearly at my destination ; and during the greater portion of
 the fortnight of brilliant weather recorded above, there was a dull leaden
 sky at Zurich, about 60 miles distant.
    2. Thick and (during the winter montlis) permanent snow, which reflects
 the solar heat and prevents the communication of warmth to the air, and
 consequently the production of atmospheric currents.           In still, though
 cold, air the skin is well known to be less chilled than in much less cold
 air, which impinges with considerable velocity upon the surface of the
 body. The effect of motion through the air upon the sensation of warmth
 and cold at Davos is very striking. Sitting perfectly still in the sunshine,
 the heat in mid winter is sometimes almost unbearable ; on rising and
 walking about briskly, a delicious feeling of coolness is experienced ; but
 on driving in a sledge, the cold soon becomes painful to the unprotected
 face and hands.
    3.  A  sheltered position favourable  for receiving both the direct and re
flected solar rays.
                     —  In this respect Davos-Dorfli, situated opposite to the
 entrance of the Dischma valley, has the advantage over Davos-Platz, two
 miles lower down the valley ; for, in the latter village, the sun rises on
 the 21st December lh 9™ later, and sets about ten minutes earlier, than at
 Dorfli.
    All  these conditions    contribute not only to a high sun-temperature
 during   the  winter   months,  but also to a comparatively uniform radiant
 heat from sunrise to sunset.
                     I
    In conclusion will only point to the general bearing which these ob
 servations have upon winter refuges for invalids.          While the primary
 conditions   to  be secured in such places  must   ever be fine weather and a
 sheltered position, the next in importance is, undoubtedly, exposure all
 day long to reflected, as well as direct, solar radiation.       To accomplish
 this, a southern aspect and a considerable expanse of water, or nearly
 level snow, are necessary ; and it is important that the sanitarium should
 be considerably, and somewhat abruptly, elevated above the reflecting sur
 face, so that it may receive, throughout the entire day, the uninterrupted
 reflection of the sun's rays.       At the sea-side, for instance, only those
 houses which command such an uninterrupted view of the sea, ranging
 from S.E. to S.W.,       as shows the reflection of the sun throughout the
 entire day, enjoy the full advantages of the place. At, or near, the sea-
 level, however,     it is impossible, owing to the suspended matters in the
 lower regions of the atmosphere, to enjoy any thing approaching to a
 uniform temperature from sunrise to sunset. For this purpose it is
 necessary to leave the grosser air of the plains behind, and to ascend
                                                                  2 c 2

    Referring to his original paper (Phil. Trans. 1873), the author re
marks here that, upon the basis of the heat annually dissipated from our
 globe being equal to that evolved by the melting of 777 cubic miles of
 ice at zero to water at the same temperature, and of the experimental
 data contained in his paper, he had demonstrated, in terms of mean
 crushed rock, the annual supply of heat derivable from the transforma
tion of the mechanical work of contraction available for volcanic energy,
 and had also estimated the proportion of that amount of heat necessary
 to support the annual vulcanicity now active on our globe ; but, from the
 want of necessary data, he had refrained from making any calculation as
 to what amount in volume of the solid shell of our earth must be crushed
 annually, in order to admit of the shell following down after the more
 rapidly contracting nucleus.         This calculation he now makes upon the
 basis of certain allowable suppositions, where the want of data requires
 such to be made, and for assumed thicknesses of solid shell of 100, 200,
 400, and 800 miles respectively.
    Prom 'the curve 'of total contraction         (plate x. Phil. Trans, part i.
 1873) obtained by his experiments         on the contraction of slags, he has
 now deduced partial mean coefficients of contraction for a reduction in
 temperature of 1° Fahr.,for intervals generally of about 500° for the entire
 scale, between a temperature somewhat exceeding that of the blast
 furnace and that of the atmosphere, or 53° Fahr.               And applying the
 higher  of these coefficients to the data of his former paper, and to the
 suppositions of the present, he has obtained the absolute contraction in
volume of the nuclei appertaiuing to the respective thicknesses of solid
 shell above stated.    In order that the shell may follow down and remain
in contact with the contracted nucleus, either its thickness must be in-

creased, its volume remaining constant, or the thickness being constant,
a portion of the volume must be extruded.          The former supposition is
not admissible, as the epoch of mountain-building has apparently ceased ;
adopting the second, the author calculates the volume of matter that
must be crushed and extruded from the shell in order that it may remain
in contact with the nucleus.       He tabulates these results for the four
assumed thicknesses of shell, and shows that the amount of crushed
and extruded rock necessary for the heat for the support of existing
volcanic action is supplied by that extruded from the shell of between
600 and 800 miles thickness, and that the volume of material, heated or
molten, annually blown out from all existing volcanic cones, as estimated
in his former paper, could be supplied by the extruded matter from a
shell of between 200 and 400 miles in thickness.
   On data which seem tolerably reliable the author has further been
enabled to calculate, as he believes for the first time, the actual amount
of annual contraction of our globe, and to show that if that be assumed
constant for the last 5000 years, it would amount to a little more than a
reduction of about 3-5 inches on the earth's mean radius.        This quantity,
mighty as are the efEects it produces as the efficient cause of volcanic
action, is thus shown to be so small as to elude all direct astronomical
observation, and, when viewed in reference to the increase of density due
to refrigeration of the material of the shell, to be incapable of producing,
during the last 2000 years, any sensible effect upon the length of the
day.   The author draws various other conclusions, showing the support
given by the principal results of this entirely independent investigation
to the verisimilitude of the views contained in his previous memoir.

    334            Prof. A. C. Ramsay on Geological Ages
   "  On the Comparative Value of certain Geological Ages (or groups
         of Formations) considered as items of Geological Time." By A.
         C. Ramsay, LL.D., V.P.R.S.          Received December 16, 1873*.
      There are several methods by which attempts have been made to esti
   mate the value of minor portions of geological time, one of which is
   founded on calculations of the probable age of deltas, deduced from
   estimates, more or less accurate, of the quantity of matter annually car
   ried in suspension in rivers, in relation to the area occupied by, and the
   thickness of, any given delta, such as that of the Mississippi.      But as
  none of these deltas are completed, and as it is unknown when, in the
  course of terrestrial changes, such completion may take place, no one
  can, as yet, successfully attempt to apply this kind of knowledge to the
  amount of time that was occupied in the formation of any of the ancient
  geological deltas, such, for instance, as that of the Purbeck and Wealdeu
  area.
      Mr. James Croll has, with considerable success, attempted to measure
  that portion of geological time which relates to the last great Glacial
  epoch, founding his conclusions on astronomical data calculated back
  wards for a million of years ; but, as yet, the precise beginning of that
 epoch has not, in my opinion, been shown ; and in the absence of precise
  data respecting the number of local glacial episodes that may have pre
 ceded the last, and the complicated     calculations that would be necessary
 to measure these intervals, even if all these episodes were known, no
 data are yet accessible for the application     of  Mr. Croll's method to the
 greater part of geological time.
     There are other ways in which the subject has been approached, but
 always, of necessity, with a total want of definiteness with regard to their
 value in the measurement of time.         The relative thickness of different
 formations gives no clue, or only a very slight one, to the solution of
 the question.    Again, when in great and thick formations that spread
 over wide areas, such as those of Silurian age, an upper part of the
 series is found to lie quite unconformably on the lower half, it requires
but little experience in geology to infer that the unconformity indicates
a long lapse of unknown time, unrepresented by strata over a given area.
When we link such phenomena of striking unconformity with the disap
pearance in that area of some of the genera and most of the species in the
older strata, and their replacement by new and, to a great extent, generally
of closely allied forms, this addition to our data gives no clear help in the
absolute measurement of time ; for no one as yet has even dared to speculate
on the length of time that may have been necessary for the production
of results so remarkable as those deduced from the theory of evolution.
    I  am well aware of much that may be said on the other side of this
particular question, such as that the incoming life of the later epoch
                     * Bead Jan. 29, 1874.  See antt, p. 145.

                          as items   of Geological Time.                          335
may be merely the result of migration from some other area or areas,
where it lived contemporaneously with the forms imbedded in the older
strata ; but this by no means gets rid of the question of time, with those
who may believe in an hypothesis so uncertain, if it so happen that they
also uphold- the doctrine of evolution.            Looked at in this light, it is
obvious that the balance of probability is largely in favour of the greater
proportion of the specific forms in a new formation being, in the common
meaning of the word, of later date than those of an older formation, on
which the newer strata lie unconformably.
     Neither is the main question altered by the circumstance that a pro
portion of Palaeozoic genera are, in some parts of the world, occasionally
and unexpectedly found along with Mesozoic associates. The fact remains,
that changes in life have been produced, during lapses of time, in specific
and consequently in generic forms, and that such contrasts of specific,
 and often of generic, forms are always most striking where marked un
 conformities are found of a kind which prove that the lower strata had
 previously been much disturbed, and, as land, had suffered much denuda
 tion before being again submerged.
      Seeing that speculations such as those enumerated, even when founded
 on well-established facts, afford but little help in the absolute measure
 ment of geological time, it has occurred'to me to look at the question
 from another point of view, and, in a broad manner, to attempt to esti
 mate the comparative value of long and distinct portions of geological
 time, all of which are represented by important series of formations.
                        I
      In two papers* have attempted to show that the Old Eed Sandstone,
  Permian, and New Eed series were all deposited, not in an open sea, but in
  great inland lakes, fresh or salt ; and this, taken in connexion with the
  wide-spreading terrestrial character of much of the Carboniferous series,
  showed that a great continental age prevailed over much of Europe and
  in some other regions, from the close of the Upper Silurian epoch to the
  close of the Trias.      The object of the present memoir is to endeavour to
  show the value of the time occupied in the deposition of the formations
  alluded to above, when compared with the time occupied in the deposi
  tion of the Cambrian and Silurian rocks, and of the marine and fresh
  water     strata which were deposited between the close of the Triassic
   epoch    and  the present day.
                                             I
       Partly for the same reasons that consider the Old Red Sandstone to
   have been a lake formation,         so  I  think it probable that the red and
   purple Cambrian       rocks of Scotland,      Shropshire,    and Wales were also
   chiefly    deposited in inland waters, occasionally alternating, as at St.
   David's, with marine interstratifications, generally marked by grey slaty
   f ossiliferous shales, somewhat in the same manner that several bands con-

taming marine fossils are interstratified among the freshwater strata of
the Miocene rocks of Switzerland.             The probability of these Cambrian
 strata being partly of lacustrine origin is increased by the occurrence
of analogous beds beneath the Silurian strata of the Punjab.                There, in
what is known as the Salt Range,           I  am informed by Professor Oldham,
 are certain red marly and sandy strata believed to be the general equi
valents of our purple Cambrian rocks.              They contain several thick beds
of rock-salt, such as could only have been deposited by supersaturation
due to solar evaporation, in the manner that rock-salt seems to have
been formed      in the Keuper Marl.
    If the red Cambrian       beds   of Britain were partly deposited in inland
waters, then     it appears likely that our Silurian formations, from the so-
called Menevian and Lingula beds upwards, were all deposited under
marine conditions between two continental epochs, the close of the
first of which is indicated by the nature of the Cambrian rocks, and the
beginning of the second by the passage             of the Upper Ludlow beds into
the base of the Old Red Sandstone.
    The physical conditions and long duration of the second continental
epoch have been described in my two memoirs on the Red Rocks of Eng
land *. The faunas of the Cambrian and Lingula-flag series (which pass
conformably into each other), in the comparative paucity of species and
their fragmentary character, seem partly to indicate occasional inland
shallow seas, possibly comparable to the great inlet of the Bay of Fundy ;
and this scanty life probably gives but a poor idea of the fuller fauna of
the period, hints of which we get from the equivalent formations of
Sweden and Bohemia.
    In the ' Geology of North "Wales
                                            '
                                               (I860)   I  have shown that there is
a gradual passage      between the Cambrian         rocks and that portion of the
Lingula-flag series now sometimes called Menevian ; and, for some years,
I  have held that the whole series of formations, from the lowest known
Cambrian to the top of the Ludlow beds, may, in Britain, be most
conveniently classed under three groups : Cambrian, Lingula, and
Tremadoc      slates form     the lowest    group,    succeeded   uneonformably      by
the second group, consisting of the Llandeilo and Bala, or Caradoc,
beds ; above these we have the Llandovery, or May Hill, beds, over
laid by the "Wenlock and Ludlow series, the Llandovery beds lying
quite uneonformably on any and all of the formations of older date, from
the Cambrian to the Caradoc strata inclusive.             With each unconformable
break in stratigraphical succession there is a corresponding break in the
succession of species, very few (about 2| per cent, out of 68 known
species) passing from the Tremadoc            slate into the Llandeilo beds, while

from the Caradoc Sandstone only about 11 per cent, pass onward into
the Upper Silurian strata.        These phenomena indicate gaps in geolo
gical time unrepresented in the Silurian series of Britain by stratified
deposits, and, therefore, also unrepresented by genera and species, that,
did we know them, might serve to link together the life of the uncon
formable formations in a more graduated succession of forms.         I recapi
 tulate these opinions, which were in part originally given in my first
Presidential Address to the Geological Society (1863), because they bear
on the arguments that follow.
¦
    Like the Cambrian and Silurian rocks, the Devonian        strata have also
 been classified in three divisions by palaeontologists — Lower, Middle, and
Upper. In Britain the Lower Devonian fauna is poor in numbers,
while it is rich both on the continent of Europe and in North
 America. In England both the Middle and Upper Devonian fossils are
 plentiful enough. According to Mr. Etheridge, out of 74 English forms
 25 per cent, pass from the Lower into the Middle division ; while, out of
 268 forms, 25 per cent, pass from the Middle into the Upper Devonian
 strata.   No one    has   yet proved that these breaks in pakeontologieal
 succession in the Devonian strata are accompanied by unconformable
 stratification ; but the entire region has never been accurately mapped
 according to the detailed methods of modern work. However this may
 turn out, the vast thicknesses of these strata, characterized, like the great
 Silurian divisions, by three marine faunas, of which the species are
 mostly distinct, would seem to indicate that the time occupied in their
 deposition may be fairly compared with that occupied in the accumula
 tion of the Silurian series.
    I accept the view that the Old Eed Sandstone, as a whole, is the
 general equivalent in time of the Devonian formations, and probably of
 a good deal more ; for our Lower Devonian beds have no defined base,
 and, therefore, their precise relation to the British Upper Silurian rocks
 is unknown, whereas the Upper Ludlow rocks of Wales and its borders
 pass conformably, and somewhat gradually, into the Old Eed Sandstone.
 If the Devonian rocks be the equivalent of the Old Eed Sandstone, it
 follows that the time occupied in the deposition of the latter may have been
 as long as that taken in the deposition of the Cambrian and Silurian series.
 This position is greatly strengthened by the thorough specific, and in
 great part generic, differences in the fossils of the Upper Ludlow and
 those found in the marine Carboniferous series — differences that, to my
 mind, indicate a long lapse of time, represented by the deposition of the
 marine Devonian strata, during which time the Old Eed Sandstone was
 being elsewhere deposited in the large lakes of an ancient continent.
 These    palajontological    comparisons seem to me to indicate the vast
 length of time necessary for the accumulation of these old lacustrine strata.
    The next question to be considered is, what time the deposition of
 the Old Bed Sandstone may have taken, when compared with the time

338                Prof. A. C. Ramsay on Geological Ayes
occupied    in the deposition of certain members of the Mesozoic series.
This may    be attempted,  partly on stratigraphical  and partly on palseonto-
logical cou si derations.
    The Lower Lias, at its junction with the Middle Lias, or Marlstone,
passes gradually into that formation on the coast-clifEs of Yorkshire,
where    it is impossible to draw     a boundary-line    between them, either
lithologically or palajontologically.    Both contain beds of the same kind
of ironstone ; and the marly and somewhat sandy clays, through about
twenty feet of strata, are similar in character, while a good proportion
of the fossils in these passage-beds are common to both formations.
Higher up, where the Marlstone becomes more sandy, a suite of fossils,
to a great extent new, appears, due apparently to altered conditions of the
sea-bottom    : the water was shallower and nearer shore ; and the topmost
strata of sandstone often contain many stem-like bodies, sometimes two or
three feet in length, lying on the surfaces of the beds in curved lines, the
same stems sometimes bending and crossing each other         in a manner that
strongly reminds the observer of the broken stalks of Laminarian seaweeds
lying on a sandy shore, within close reach of a Laminarian zone. Taking
these things into account, there seems to be a much more intimate connexion
between the Lower and Middle than there is between the sandy beds of
the Middle Lias and the Upper Lias clays of Yorkshire, between which,
though there is a perfect conformity, yet a sudden break in lithological
character occurs, accompanied by a nearly complete change of fossil
species. But the three divisions being conformable to each other, the
diversities of fossil contents, more or less, seem to be owing to changes
in the physical condition of the sea, caused, in the case of the Upper Lias
shale, to sudden depression of the area, which resulted in the deposition
of the muddy sediments of the Upper Lias in deeper water than that
which received tne uppermost sediments of the Marlstone.                In the
Midland Counties, however, the lithological break between the Middle
and Upper Lias is not so sudden, and, in that region, there is a greater
community of species.
   In Yorkshire the strata immediately above the Lias are of mixed ter
restrial, freshwater, and marine beds    ; but even there and in the middle of
England,    as shown by   Dr. "Wright, there is a certain community of fossils
in the passage-beds that unite the Upper Lias to the Inferior Oolite.
There is no perfect stratigraphical or palseontological break between them :
and when we pass in succession through all the remaining members of the
truly marine Oolitic series of Gloucestershire, Somersetshire, and Dorset
 shire, no real unconformity anywhere exists.       The same species of fossils,
in greater or less degree, are apt to be common to two or more formations ;
for example, such community exists between the fossils of the Inferior
 Oolite and those of the Combrash, between those of the freestones of
the Inferior and Great Oolites, of the Stonesfield and Collyweston slates,
and between Ihose of the Kimmeridge and Portland Oolites.

    The change of life in the sea-bottoms was, so to say, partly local, and
due more to minor accidental physical causes than to that larger kind of
change that is marked by great disturbance of a lower set of strata,
long-continued denudation, and the subsequent unconformable deposi
tion of a newer set of beds upon them, thus clearly indicating a long
lapse of time unrepresented by stratified deposits over a given area.                  I
therefore infer that the whole of the Liassic and Oolitic series must be
looked upon as presenting the various phases of one facies of marine life,
belonging to one geological epoch, marked by boundaries below and above
which depended on definite physical conditions over a large area. Such
a state of things in this Mesozoic epoch is comparable to the changes in
the fossil contents of the various subfoimations of the Cambrian and
Lingula-flag series, of which the Tremadoc slates form an upper member ;
 and, in my opinion, the comparison holds good even partly in the
manner of their deposition, parts of both series having been locally
 deposited in waters not marine.               On these grounds, therefore, the
Jurassic formations, as a whole, may be compared with these early Palaeo
 zoic formations      in  the length of time occupied  for tlie deposition of each.
     If this inference be just, then, in like manner, they may be compared
 with the Lower Devonian strata — in England poor in fossils as far as is
 yet known, but rich on the continent of Europe and in North America ;
 and this (assuming that the Devonian and Old Bed Sandstone strata are
 equivalents) implies that a lower portion of tlie Old Red Sandstone may
 have taken as long for its deposition as the whole        of the time occupied  in tlie
 deposition of    the  Liassic and Oolitic  series.
     It is now generally allowed that the "Wealden beds of England are the
 freshwater and estuarine equivalents of the Lower aild Middle Neo-
 comian      strata   of the Continent, which, in      a pala3ontological sense, may
 be said, in some degree, to be       related to  the uppermost" Jurassic strata, in
 so far that a certain proportion of the species of Mollusca are common
 to both,     as shown by Eorbes and Godwin- Austen ; while, in our own
 country, from the Lower Greensand (Upper Neocomiau) about 14 or
 15 per cent, of the fossils pass on into the Upper Cretaceous strata.
 The same kind of proportion, but in less degree, is found in the relations
 of the Tremadoc to the Llandeilo and Bala series, and of the latter to
 the Upper Silurian formations, and also of the Lower to the Middle, and
 of the Middle to the Upper, Devonian strata. Those last named being
 representatives in time of parts of the Old Bed Sandstone, it follows
  that the whole of tlie time occupied in the deposition of the Old Bed Sand
 stone may have been equal to the whole        of the time occupied   in the deposition
 of all   the  Jurassic, Purbeck, Wealden, and Cretaceous strata collectively.
      The next term of the continental era under review is the Carbonifer
  ous epoch, which, in its various conditions and numerous local subdivi
  sions, may with considerable propriety be compared to the Eocene period.
  The deposits of both are locally of marine, estuarine, freshwater, and

  340               Prof. A. C. Ramsay on Geological Ages
 terrestrial origin, and both are clearly connected with long special con
 tinental epochs.
     Next come the various members of the Permian series, which, if mv
  published conclusions are correct, were partly formed in great inland
 lakes, analogous to the Caspian Sea and other salt lakes of Central Asia
 at the present day.       Having been deposited in lakes, these subforma-
 tions may, in     this one  respect, be compared to the lacustrine strata of
 Miocene age ; and if Gastaldi's conclusions with regard to part of the
 Italian Miocene beds, and my own opinions respecting part of the
 Permian strata, be correct, each series shows evidence of having included
 a glacial episode.
    Later than the Permian comes the New Eed, or Triassic, series, which,
 in this region, is not directly connected with the Permian strata, in so
 far that, where they occur in contact, the New Eed Sandstone is gene
 rally unconformable to the Permian beds. In the threefold division of
 the New Bed series in France and Germany, the marine beds of the
 Muschelkalk (unknown in England) may be compared to the Lower or
 Coralline Crag strata ; and, though the Keuper Marls of Britain and of
 much of the Continent were evidently deposited in inland continental
 salt lakes, in the region of the Alps the St. Cassian and Hallstadt
 marine beds, being equivalent to the Keuper Marls, may in this respect
 be compared to the Eed Crag series.                        I
                                                No one is, think, likely to con
 sider  that  the  marine   strata  of   Triassic age took a shorter time in their
 deposition than the marine beds of the Crag ; and, if we take the New
 Eed Sandstone into account, the probability is, that the whole of the
 Triassic series occupied in their deposition a much longer time than that
 taken in the deposition of the Pliocene marine strata.
    In my opinion, a great Tertiary continental phase began with the
 Eocene strata; and that continent having undergone many physical
 changes, has continued, down to the present day, with a certain amount
 of identity ; and an analogous, though not strictly similar, state of thingB
 prevailed for an older continent, during the deposition of a large part of
the formations treated of in this memoir.
    If the method founded on the foregoing comparisons be of value, we
then arrive at the general conclusion, that the great local continental era,
which began with the Old Red Sandstone and closed with the Netv Red
Marl, is comparable, in point of geological time, to that occupied in th*
deposition   of  the whole of the Mesozoic, or Secondary, series, later titan the
New Red      Marl, and of all       the Cainozoic, or Tertiary,   formations, and,
indeed, of all the time that has elapsed since the beginning of the dejwsi-
tion of the Lias down to the present day.               To attempt to prove this
theorem is the special       object   of  this  paper ;  and if I  have been suc
cessful,   the   corollary must be deduced that the modern continental
era which followed the oceanic submersion of a wide area, during which
the greater part of the Chalk was being deposited, has been of much

                             as items    of Geological Time.                    341
shorter duration than the older continent mentioned above in italics        ;   and
which, to us, seems so ancient, when we think that the Alps and the         Jura
had then no more than a rudimentary existence.
   There are other points that bear on the comparative value of
different epochs of geological time.  During the older local continental
epoch there flourished four distinct floras, those of the Old Eed Sand
stone, Carboniferous,        Permian, and Triassic series.     Of these the first
three, notwithstanding considerable generic and complete specific differ
ences, may yet be said to be of one Palaeozoic type. The Triassic flora,
as   far   as   it is known, is of                 with generic affinities, how
                                     a mixed character,
ever, that unite it more closely to the Jurassic flora than to that of the
Permian age. The whole series may therefore be considered as resolving
itself into two types — the first extending from the Old Eed Sandstone
to the Permian times, and the second belonging to the Trias.
   During the later period that elapsed, from the beginning of the
deposition of the Lias down to the present day, we have also four
distinct floras —the first of Jurassic type, embracing the little we know
of the Neocomian flora ; the second, Cretaceous, which, as regards the
Upper Cretaceous strata of Aix-la-Chapelle and of Greenland, is to a
great extent of modern type ; third, an Eocene, and, fourth, a Miocene
flora — the last three being closely allied, and the Miocene flora of Europe,
in its great features, being nearly indistinguishable, except in species,
from the kind of grouping incident to some of the modern floras of the
northern hemisphere.         The whole of this series may, therefore, in
European regions, be also considered as resolving itself into two types —
the first Jurassic, and the second extending from the later Cretaceous
times to the present day.       In this respect, the analogy to the floras ,of
two types of the more ancient continent is obvious ; and, in both epochs,
this kind of grouping is clearly connected with the lapse of time, which,
in my opinion, may for each be of approximately equivalent value.
   The evidence derived from terrestrial Vertebrata is not quite so simple.
In the Old Eed Sandstone none are yet known. In the Carboniferous
rocks all the known genera (fourteen in Britain) are Labyrinthodont
Amphibia. The same is the case, though the known genera are fewer in
number, with the Permian rocks, excepting two land-lizards of the genus
Proterosawns.     Labyrinthodonts seem to decrease still more in the number
of species in the Trias ; but Crocodiles appear, together with seven named
genera of land-lizards, two genera of Anomodontia (Dicynodon and
jRhynchosaurus), three genera of Deinosauria, and two of Marsupial Mam
malia.     As far as we yet know, therefore, this ancient continental fauna
pretty nearly resolves itself into two types ; and, just as the Triassic
 type of flora passed into Jurassic times, eo the Triassic land-fauna
docs the same.      The oldest, or Palaeozoic, type (Carboniferous and Per
mian)   is  essentially  Labyrinthodontian, and the second, or Triassic          is,
characterized         by
                      the appearance of many true land-lizards and other
terrestrial reptiles, together with marsupial mammals and. this typical
                                                               ;

  fauna, as regards genera, with the exception of Labyrinthodontia and
 the appearance of Pterosauria, is represented, pretty equally, through all
 the remaining members of the Mesozoic formations, from Jurassic to
  Cretaceous inclusive.       After this comes the great Pachydermatous Mam
  malian Eocene fauna, and after that the Miocene fauna, which, in its
 main characters, is of modern type.
      The'general result is that, from Jurassic to Cretaceous times inclusive,
 there was a terrestrial fauna in these regions, chiefly Reptilian, Saurian,
 and Marsupial, and, in so-called Cainozoic or Tertiary times, chiefly
 Reptilian and Placental.          In brief, the old continental epoch that lasted
 from the beginning of the Old Red Sandstone to the close of the Trias,
 locally embraces two typical land-faunas —one Carboniferous and Per
 mian, and one Triassic        ; while the later epoch, from the beginning of the
 Lias to the present day, also locally contained two typical land-faunas,
 the latter of which is specially Placental. (See Table.)
     I am aware    that such inferences are always liable to be disturbed         by
                             I
 later discoveries, and therefore merely offer the above suggestions as
 being in accordance with present knowledge.
     Another point remains.           The earliest known marine faunas, those
 of the Cambrian, Lingula-flag, and Tremadoc beds, include many of
the existing classes and orders of marine life, which are much more fully
developed in the succeeding Llandeilo and Bala strata, such as Spongida,
 Annelida, Echinodermata, Crustacea, Polyzoa, Brachiopoda, Lamelli-
branchiata, Pteropoda, Nucleobranchiata, and Cephalopoda.                 This im
portant fact was insisted on by Professor Huxley in his Anniversary
Address to the Geological Society in 1862. The inference is obvious,
that in this earliest known varied life* we find no evidence of its having
lived near the beginning of the zoological series. In a broad sense, com
pared with what must have gone before, both biologically and physically,
all the phenomena connected with this old period seem to my mind to
be quite of a recent description        ; and the climates of seas and lands were
of the very same kind as those that the world enjoys at the present day —
one proof of which, in my opinion, is the existence of great glacial boulder
beds    in the Lower Silurian strata of Wigtonshire, west of Loch Ryant.
     This conclusion, not generally accepted, has since been confirmed by
Professor Geikie and Mr. James Geikie, both with regard to the Wigton-
shire    strata and to the equivalent beds in Ayrshire.           In the words of
Darwin, when discussing the imperfection of the geological record of
this history, " we possess the last volume alone, relating only to two or
                     "
three countries ; and the reason why we know so little of pre-Cambrian
faunas, and the physical characters of the more ancient formations as
originally deposited, is, that, below the Cambrian, strata we get at once
involved in a sort of chaos of metamorpbic strata.

       The connexion of this question with the principal subject of this
   paper, that of the comparative value of different geological eras as items of
   geological time, is obvious.            I  feel that this subject is one of, great
   difficulty    ; and, as far as   I know,     this is the first time that any/attempt
   of the kind has been made to solve the problem. If my metho^be incor
   rect, it may yet help to suggest a better way to some one else/ and in the
   meanwhile, even if partly heterodox, I hope it may deserve toleration.

                                      (Abstract.)
   The author commences by expressing his obligations to Professor
Thomson, who gave him assistance in some parts of his work, and every
encouragement in the further prosecution of it.
   Specimens of Peripatus were collected at the Cape of Good Hope
during the stay of H.M.S. ' Challenger ' at Simon's Bay, with a view to
the investigation of the development of the animal.               A specimen was
dissected and at once seen to be provided with trachea, and to contain
far developed young.       This led to as careful an examination being made as
time would permit, and hence the present paper.                 The most modern
paper on Peripatus is that of Grube*.          Grube, after examining the ana
tomy  of the  animal,   came  to the conclusion that it was hermaphrodite, and
placed it among the " Bristle- Worms
                                            " in a
                                                   separate order, Onychophora.
Grube has been followed in most text-books, such as those of Clans
and Schmarda ; but uncertainty on the matter has been generally felt.
De Quatrefagest follows Gervais in placing Peripatus in affinity with the
Myriopods, and the result of the present investigation is to show that he
is not far wrong.
   The species made use of appears to be Peripatus capensis, described
                                                              '

animal   has  invariably seventeen pairs of ambulatory members, a pair
of oral papillae, and two pairs of horny hooked jaws, shut in by tumid
lips. The specimens found varied in Jength from 1-6 to 7 centims., in
the contracted condition.         About thirty specimens were found, all of
them but one at Wynberg, between Simon's Bay and Cape Town.                    The
animals appear to be somewhat local and not very abundant ; they live
in damp places under trees, and especially frequent rotten willow-wood.

They feed on rotten wood. They are nocturnal in their habits. They
coil themselves up spirally like lulus when injured. They have a remark
able power of extension of the body, and when walking stretch to nearly
twice the length they have when at rest. They can move with consider
able rapidity. They walk with the body entirely supported on then-
feet. Their gait is not in the least like that of worms, but more like that
of caterpillars.  When irritated they shoot out with great suddenness
from the oral papillae a peculiarly viscid tenacious fluid, which forms a
meshwork of fine threads, with viscid globules on them at intervals, the
whole resembling a spider's web with the dew upon it. The fluid is
ejected at any injuring body, and is probably used in defence against
enemies, such as insects, which would be held powerless for some time
if enveloped in its meshes. The fluid is not irritant when placed on
the tongue, but slightly bitter and astringent ; it is as sticky as bird
lime : flies, when they light in            it,
                                   are held fast at once. The fluid                           is
structureless, but presents an appearance of fine fibrillation when dry.
The animal     best obtained dead in an extended condition by drowning
                  is
it in water, which operation takes four or five hours.
   Only those points in anatomy are touched on which appear to have
hitherto been wrongly or imperfectly described.

                                                        Grube, but longer
than the body, and usually presents one vertical fold             presents      ;   it

segment, as stated       by   Grube.      Special regions,    amuscular pharynx, short
oesophagus,       long stomach,        and short rectum       are distinguished in the
tract.  The viscid fluid ejected from the oral papillae  secreted          is            by   a
pair of ramified tubular glands lying at the sides of the stomach and
stretching nearly the whole length of the body.   These glands are those
described      by
              Grube as testes they show common glandular structure,
                                       ;             a
but no trace of testicular matter. A pair of enlargements on the ducts
of the glands, provided with spirally arranged muscles, serve as ejacula-
tory reservoirs.   The lateral elongate bodies lying outside the nerve-
cords, considered by Grube to be vessels, show        fatty structure, vary
                                                                  a
much   in extent, and are probably to be regarded as representing the fatty
bodies of Tracheata.
  No structure like that of the heart of Myriopods was found in. the
dorsal vessel.
     Thetrachea} system consists of long fine tracheal tubes, which very
rarely branch     these arise, in densely packed bunches, from short com
                  :
mon tubes, which open all over the body                  by
                                                  small outlets in the epi
dermis     ;these outlets have no regular structure and are difficult to
see.   The whole of the tracheal system, very conspicuous in the fresh
condition, becomes almost invisible when the animal examined has been
a    short time  in spirit, and the air has been thus removed from the
trachea.       Hence the failure of Grube to see them.     The tracheae

346                Mr. H. N. Moseley        on the Structure         [May 21,
are  distributed   in meshworks     to all 'the  viscera.  The spiral filament
is very imperfectly developed.         A row of larger oval spiracles exists
along  the  middle   line  of the under   surface, the spiracles being placed
opposite the interspaces of the feet, but not quite regularly.            Other
large spiracles    exist on the inner sides of the bases      of the feet.     A
large supply of trachea goes to the rectum and muscular pharnyx.              In
many points the structure of the tracheal system resembles that in
lulus.
   Peripatus is not hermaphrodite.        Out of thirty specimens about ten
were males. No outward distinction of the sexes could be discovered. The
female organs consist of a small oblong ovary situate behind the stomach,
about one sixth of the length from the end of the body ; from this lead a
pair of oviducts, which, at their terminations, become enlarged and per
form a uterine function, appearing, when filled with embryos, like a
string of sausages.       In nearly all cases, even when the embryos were
far advanced, two large masses of spermatozoa were found in the ovary,
and others attached to the ovisacs externally.         A long loop, formed by
the oviducts on each side being quite loose in the body, becomes often
thrown into    a knot through the constant protraction and retraction of the
body-wall. The knot is known to sailors as an overhand knot on a bight.
The knot sometimes becomes drawn very tight, and then prevents the
passage of the embryos above it.           A case was met with in which this
had occurred.     The upper parts of the oviducts were mortified off at the
knot, and remained attached only to the ovary.           The ducts were dilated
into large single sacs, the usual constrictions between the embryos having
disappeared, and were full of decomposed embryos and fatty tissue. The
knot was met with in many specimens — in some cases on both sides of
the body, in others (as in that figured) on only one. The oviducts unite
in a short common tube to open at the simple vulva. The male organs
consist of a pair of large ovoid testes, surmounted by short tubular
prostates.    The vasa deferentia are long and tortuous, forming, near the
testes, spiral coils in which the ducts are enlarged, and which may be
called vesiculee seminales.     A muscular ejaculatory tube, or penis, lies on
one side of   the body   — sometimes   on one, sometimes on the other.      One
vas deferens passes across, at the end of the body, under both nerve-cords
to join the penis ; the other takes a more direct course, not passing
under the cords at all.       In the original condition both ducts probably
passed one under each       nerve-cord,  to join the centrally placed common
terminal tube, homologous with that of the female organs.
   The spermatozoa are filamentary, as in insects and in Scolopendra, but
not in lulus.    Their development is described. They are very long, and
their tails have a spiral movement as well as an undulatory one. They
twist into all sorts of loops.
   The muscular tissue of Peripatus is unstriated.
   The development of Peripatus was only partially followed.         As  a rule,

all the embryos found in one mother are of the same age. In some
cases slight differences were found, which were very valuable for deter
mining the development of the parts of the mouth. The embryos lie
coiled up in simple hyaline envelopes, enclosing an ovoid cavity, within
the enlargements of the uterine tubes.       In the earliest stage observed
the embryo had large round cephalic lobes and was without members, but
showed distinct segmentation about its middle ; it was coiled up spirally,
the head being free, the tail in the axis of the coil. Later on the embryo
becomes bent round in an oval, with the tip of the tail resting between
the antennae.
   The front members are formed first : they arise as undulations of the
lateral wall of the body, which become pushed further and further out
wards, and are at first hollow, formed of two layers of cells, the inner of
which is reflected over the intestine.    The members form one after
another, from the head downwards.      A line of segmentation is formed
across the body before the pair of members swells out, but disappears as
they develop.  The wall of the digestive tract            is,
                                                  in the early condition,                    .
drawn out laterally at each interspace between the pairs of members, to
become attached there to the body- wall.    The cephalic lobes early show
traces of   separation
              a         into two  segments,  anterior and posterior  from     ;
them, anteriorly, bud out the antennae, which gradually become more and
more jointed.   The mouth forms before the anus.
   The full number of body-members          very early attained.
                                                is                 The second
pair   is the largest   at first, but  subsequently    become  the  small oral
papillae.    The first pair turn inwards towards the primitive mouth-
opening,   and, developing their claws greatly, form the pair of horny jaws             ;
these are covered by processes which grow down from the lower part of
the head, and which eventually unite with the tissues at the bases of the
oral tentacles and form the tumid lips, which, eventually closing in, hide
all the parts of the mouth in the adult.      The head-processes are probably
homologous    with  the  mandibles  of higher  Tracheata, the horny jaws with
the maxillae and the oral papillae with the foot-jaws of Scolopendra                ;   a
regular labrum       formed by
                    is              downward growth from the front of the
                                     a

                                       the tumid lips.
  It   is   uncertain whether    a   corresponding     structure beneath the mouth
represents the second under lip of Scolopendra or true labium.  a  The
foot-claws are developed in invaginations of the tips of the ambulacral
members.    The young members develop five joints each, the typical
number in insects, and one which seems to be retained in the adult.
  In  the present state of our knowledge concerning                 the structure       of
Peripatus, the most remarkable fact in its structure                is   the wide   di
varication of      the ventral          The fact was considered re

ence of tracheae in the animal was known, and when       was thoughtit

to be hermaphrodite, but it is doubly remarkable now.               The fact shuts
off at      once  all  idea   of  Peripatus being   a degenerate Myriopod, the
evidence against which possibility is overwhelming.             The bilateral Sym
metry and duplicity of the organs of the body, the absence of stria-
tion in the muscles, of periodical moults of the larval skin in deve
lopment, and of any trace of a primitive three-legged condition, taken
in conjunction with the divarication of the nerve-cords, are conclusive.
The parts of the mouth are not to be regarded as degraded to any great
degree ; and homologies for some of them, at least, may perhaps be found
amongst the higher Annelids.             The structure of the skin is not at all
unlike that in some worms, especially in its chitinous epidermic layer,
which occasionally strips off in large pieces as a thin transparent pellicle.
The many points of resemblance of Peripatus to Annelids need not be dwelt
 upon ; they led to its former placing in classification ; but it is difficult
 to understand how the very unannelid-like structure of the foot-claws
 did not lead others, beside De Quatrefages, to draw a line between Peri
patus and the Annelids.           In being unisexual, Peripatus is like the higher
 Annelids, as well as the whole of the higher Tracheata.                To Insects
 Peripatus shows affinities in the form of the spermatozoa, and the elabo
 ration, structure, and bilateral symmetry of the generative organs, though
 there is a very slight tendency towards the unilaterality of Myriopods in
 the male organs.
    To Insects, again,      it is allied by the five-jointing of the feet and oral
 papillffl  and  the  form   and number of its claws. It should be remembered
 that spiders' feet are two-clawed, as are those of some Tardigrades, and
 that some of these latter forms have two-clawed           feet in the early condi
 tion even when they possess more claws in the adult state. In Newport's
 well-known figure of the young lulus with three pairs of limbs, the
 tips of these latter are drawn with two hair-like claws ; these are not
 mentioned in the text.          To the ordinary lepidopterous larva the resem
 blances of Peripatus are striking — as, for example, the gait, the glands
 (so like in their function and position to silk-glands), the form of the
 intestine, and the less perfect concentration of the nervous organs, as in
 larval    insects.    To Myriopods Peripatus is allied by the great variety
 in number of segments in the various species, in its habits, and in these
 especially to lulus. The parts of the mouth perhaps show a form out of
 which those of Scolopendra were derived by modification ; but the resem
 blance may be superficial.           Our knowledge is not yet sufficient to deter
 mine such points.         The usual difficulties occur in the matter. Segments
 may have dropped out or fused, and their original condition may not
 be represented at all in the process of development.            In structure Peri
patus is more like Scolopendra than lulus, viz. in the many joints to the
 antennse (in Chilognaths never more than fourteen), in the form of
 spermatozoa, and in being viviparous, as are some Scolopendra! ; fur

    Peripatus thus shows affinities, in some points, to all the main branches
 of the family tree of Tracheata ; but a gulf is fixed between it and them
 by the divarication of the nerve-cords : tending in the same direction are
 such facts as the non-striation of the muscles, the great power of extension
 of the body, the arrangement of the digestive tract in the early stage, the
 persistence of metamorphosis, and the nature of the parts of the mouth,
 the full history of the manner of origin of these being reserved.
    There are many speculations as to the mode of origin of the trachea
themselves in the Tracheata.          Professer Hiickel (' Biologische Studien,'
                                                                     '
p. 491) follows Gegenbaur, whose opinion is expressed in his Grundziige
 der vergleichenden Anatomie,' p. 441.               Gegenbaur concludes that
tracheae were developed from originally closed tracheal systems, through
the intervention of the tracheal gills of primaeval aquatic insects now
represented     as larvae.    If Peripatus be as ancient in origin as is here
supposed, the condition of the tracheal system in it throws a very
different light on the matter.          Peripatus is the only Tracheate with
tracheal stems opening diffusely all over the body. The Protracheata pro
bably had their tracheae thus diffused, and the separate small systems after
wards became concentrated along especial lines and formed into wide main
branching trunks.         In some forms the spiracular openings concentrated
towards a more ventral line (lulus) ; in others they took a more lateral
position (Lepidopterous larvae, &c.).        A concentration along two lines of
the body, ventral and lateral, has already commenced in Peripatus.              The
original   Protracheate    being supposed   to have  had numerous   small  tracheae
diffused all over its body, the question as to their mode of origin again
presents itself.     The peculiar form of the tracheal bundles in Peripatus,
which consist of a number of fine tubes opening into the extremity of a
single short common duct leading to the exterior of the body, seems to
give a clue.      The trachea? are, very probably, modified cutaneous glands,
the homologues of those so abundant all over the body in such forms as
Bipalium or Hirudo. The pumping extension and contraction of the body
may well have drawn a very little air, to begin with, into the mouths of the
ducts ; and this having been found beneficial by the ancestor of the Pro
tracheate, further development is easy to imagine.            The exact mode of
development      of the tracheae in the  present form   must be carefully studied;
there was no trace of these organs in the most perfect state of Peripatus
which    I obtained.
   Professor Gegenbaur's opinion on the position of Peripatus (' Grund
ziige der vergleichenden Anatomie,' p. 199) is, that its place among
the worms is not certain, but that, at any rate, it connects ringed
worms with Arthropods and flat worms.             The general result of the pre
sent inquiry is to bear out Professor Gegenbaur's opinion ; but it points
to the connexion of the ringed and flat worms, by means of this inter

mediate step, with three classes only of the Arthropods — the Myriopods,
Spiders, and Insects, ». e. the Tracheata.           From the primitive condition of
the tracheae in lulus, and the many relations between Peripatus and Scolo-
pendra, it would seem that the Myriopods may be most nearly allied to
Peripatus, and form a distinct branch arising from it and not passing
through Insects.        The early three-legged stage may turn out as of not
so much significance as supposed.            If these speculations be correct, the
Crustacea     have  a  different  origin   from    the Tracheata.       Peripatus itself
may well be placed amongst Professor Hackel's Protracheata ; Grube's
term Onychophora becomes no more significant than De Blainville's Mala-
copoda.      Some notions of the actual history of the origin of Peripatus
itself may    be gathered from its development.
    In  conclusion   I  would beg indulgence for the many defects in this
paper, due to the hurry with which it was written (all available time, almost
up to the last moment of our sailing for the Antarctic regions, having
been consumed in actual examination of the structure of Peripatus), and
due, further, to the impossibility of referring to original papers in any
scientific library. At all events it is hoped that Peripatus has been shown
to be of very great zoological interest, as lying near one of the main sterna
of the great zoological family tree, and that further examination of the
most minute character into the structure of this animal will be well
repaid.

        Memb.Inst.C.E.          Communicated by W. Froude, M. A., F.R.S.
        Received    April    11, 1874.
                                      (Abstract.)
    The results of the investigation worked out in this paper correspond
 with those previously deduced by other analysts, particularly by Mr.
 W. Froude, F.R.S. The paper is therefore presented, not because it
 discloses any novel result, but rather as an example of a method which
the author has found useful in the discussion of other dvnamieal problems.
    The object of the paper is to trace the conditions under which the
 separate molecules of a liquid such as water move, when a body of that
liquid is in a state of oscillatory wave-movement. It is assumed that the
 wave-movement        is established in a channel of uniform width and of
 length and depth so great that the conditions of motion are not affected
 by the interference of fixed ends or a fixed bottom.
    The wave treated of has as its characteristics permanence of form and
 uniformity of apparent velocity.
     In order that these conditions may         be  fulfilled, it is asr.imed,  as bei'ig

capable of ready geometrical demonstration, that all molecules which in
repose would be at the same level, move in equal and similar trajectories,
but that each molecule towards the one hand, as towards the right, is by
a certain interval of time in advance of the contiguous molecule on the
left.  It is also taken as a necessary condition of the wave-movement
that the excursions of the molecules are periodic, and effected in closed
orbits returning into themselves.
   With these general postulates, the author proceeds to investigate first
the conditions necessary to maintain continuity of the liquid, or the con
stancy of the vertical sectional area of an elementary portion of the
liquid, in all parts of its orbit.  He then traces the operation on such an
element of the forces to which it is subjected, these forces being gravity,
or the weight of the element itself, and the pressure directed on it by
the surrounding liquid.
   The liquid in repose is supposed to be divided into numerous hori
zontal strata, each stratum forming an undulating film when the wave-
movement is established.        The length of any such stratum is supposed
to be divided into numerous portions, the width of each of which is the
distance apparently traversed by the wave in a very short interval of
time.    By taking the depth of a stratum, and the interval of time which
determines the width of one of its divisions, such that the element of
liquid may be considered a parallelogram of constant area, the several
differential equations expressing the continuity of the liquid and the
effect of the forces on the element are developed in an integrable form.
   The parallelogram representing the liquid element is determined in its
form and position by the position of the points at its four angles.
   One of those points, namely that at the lower left-hand angle, is
assumed to move in a path the horizontal and vertical coordinates of
which, x and y, are referred to an origin situated at a height h mea
sured from the bottom of the liquid, and the position of the point in its
path is taken at a time t reckoned from the epoch when the point was
vertically under its origin. The point at the lower right-hand angle of
the parallelogram is referred to an origin on the same level with the
former, but separated horizontally from it by a space, vAt, where v is the
apparent velocity of the wave, and At is the short interval of time by
which  the one point is in advance of the other in its trajectory.      The
coordinates  x and y of  the first point being  functions of h and t, those
of the other point are the same functions of h and <+ At. The upper left-
hand point being referred to an origin which is at a height Ah above the
level of the former origins, but being taken as contemporaneous in its
movement with the point below          its coordinates are functions of

tigation it is shown that this must be the ease), the author has, in the
first instance, assumed that the upper origin is somewhat in advance of
the lower, the amount of such advance being a quantity of the order AA,
which he has taken as            m\h (it being afterwards proved that nt=0).
   With this nomenclature, the equation of continuity is deduced in the
 following terms        :   —
                             h£)H)-(-+£)i-*.
a constant area independent                of t.
  The pressure p at the lower left-hand angle of the element being a
function of h and t, equations are deduced giving values for the horizontal
accelerating        force,      —,   and   the     vertical    accelerating   force   including
gravity,    S'   + ^p in terms of the differential coefficients of x, y, andjp.
   From these equations it is shown that ^£=0, or that the pressure
along any wave-stratum is uniform                   ;   and this result leads to the simpli
fication of the differential equations.
    From the integration of those equations it is shown that every mole
 cule of the liquid revolves with uniform velocity, and with the same
 angular velocity at all depths, in a truly circular orbit, the radius of
 which depends on the depth of the molecule below the surface of the
 liquid. The law of variation of the radius is, that while the depths
 increase in arithmetical progression, the radius diminishes in geometrical
 progression, or that the logarithm of the reciprocal of the radius is
 directly proportional to the depth of the centre.
    The resultant of the forces acting on a molecule is shown to be always
 normal to the profile of the wave-surface of which the molecule forms a
part, such resultant being compounded of gravity, a constant force
acting vertically downwards, and of the centrifugal force of the molecule,
also a constant force acting radially outwards from the centre of the orbit.
The direction and magnitude of this resultant are represented by the
position and length of a line drawn from any point in the orbit to a fixed
point in the vertical line passing through the centre of the orbit. The
liquid element in traversing its circular path varies in width and in
height to suit the varying direction of the forces acting on    its greater    it,

where the centrifugal force acts along with gravity. Thus the uni
formity of pressure throughout the orbit      maintained. is
    As a molecule revolves uniformly round the centre of its orbit, this
centre is  the mean centre of gravity of the molecule during      complete       a

period.    It is shown that during wave-movement this centre is elevated
above the level that would be occupied by the molecule in repose, a
height due to the vis viva of the molecule.
    The profile of any wave-stratum is a trochoid, the length of which is
the distance from hollow to hollow or from crest to crest, and the height
is the diameter of the orbit of the molecule belonging to that stratum.
The highest      possible wave is that where the trochoid becomes the
cycloid, or where the length of the wave is equal to the circumference of
the orbit.    No trochoid of greater height is physically possible, as such
a curve must have a looped crest, where the      liquid moleoules would have
to cross the paths of each other, producing broken water.
    The velocity and period of a wave, and the angular and actual velo
 cities of the liquid molecules, are deduced in terms of the length of the
 wave.                        •

III.   " On Combinations of Colour by means of Polarized Light."
       By W. Spottiswoode, M.A., Treas. & V.P.R.S.                      Received
       April   8, 1874.
   The results of combining two or more colours of the spectrum have
 been   studied by Helmholtz, Clerk Maxwell, Lord Rayleigh, and others ;
and the combinations have been effected sometimes by causing two
spectra at right angles to one another to overlap, and sometimes by
bringing images of various parts of a spectrum simultaneously upon the
retina.    Latterly also W. v. Bezold has successfully applied the method
of binocular combination to the same problem (Poggendorff, Jubelband,
p. 585).     Some effects, approximating more or less to these, may be pro
duced by chromatic polarization.
   Complementary Colours. — First as regards complementary colours.            If
we use a Nicol's prism, N, as polarized, a plate of quartz, Q, cut per
pendicularly to the axis, and a double-image prism, P, as analyzer, we
shall, as is well known, obtain two images whose colours are comple
mentary.      If we analyze these images with a prism, we shall find, when
the quartz is of suitable thickness, that each spectrum contains a dark
band, indicating the extinction of a certain narrow portion of its length ;
these bands will simultaneously shift their position when the Nicol X is
turned round.        Now, since the colours remaining in each spectrum are
complementary      to   those in the other, and the portion of the spectrum
extinguished in each is complementary to that which remains, it follows
that the portion extinguished in one spectrum is complementary to that
extinguished in the other ; and in order to determine what portion of
the spectrum is complementary, the portion suppressed by a band in any
position we please, we have only to turn the Nicol X until the band in
one spectrum occupies the position in question, and then to observe the
position of the band in the other spectrum.         The combinations considered
in former experiments are those of simple colours ; the present com
binations are those of mixed tints, viz. of the parts of the spectrum sup
pressed in the bands.         But the mixture consists of a prevailing colour,
corresponding     to  the  centre  of the band, together with a slight admixture
of the spectral colours immediately adjacent to it on each side.
   The following results,        given by Helmholtz, may be approximately
verified : —
                               Complementary Colours.
                          Bed,                Green-blue   ;
                          Orange,              Cyanic blue   ;
                          Yellow,              Indigo-blue.
                          Yellow-green,        Violet.
   When in one spectrum the band enters the green, in the other a band
will be seen on the outer margin of the red and a second at the opposite

end of the violet — showing that to the green there does not correspond
one complementary colour, but a mixture of violet and red, t. e. a reddish
purple.
    Combination of two Colours. — Next as to the combination of two parts
of the spectrum, or of the tints which represent those parts. If, in
addition to the apparatus described above, we use a second quartz plate,
Q, and a second double-image prism,          P„  we shall form four images, say
0 0, O E, E O, EE; and if A, A'              be the complementary        tints ex
tinguished by the first combination           QP    alone, and B, B' those ex
tinguished     by the second Qt V1 alone, then it will be found that the fol
lowing pairs of tints   are extinguished in the various images : —
                        Image.                Tints extinguished.
                         00                          B, A,
                         OE                          B , A ',
                         EO                          B', A,
                         EE                          B, A'.
    It  is to be noticed that in the image 0 E the combination Q, P, has
extinguished the tint B' instead of B, because the vibrations in the
image E were perpendicular to those in the image 0 formed by the com
bination Q P. A similar remark applies to the image E E.
    The total number of tints which can be produced by this double com
bination Q P, Q; P, is as follows     : —
                                     4 single images,
                                     6 overlaps of two,
                                     4 overlaps of three,
                                     1  overlap of four.
                          Total. . 15
    Collateral   Combinations. — The     tints   extinguished      in the overlap
00+EO         will be B, A, B', A ;    but since B and B' are complementary,
their suppression will not affect the resulting tint except as to intensity,
and the overlap will be effectively deprived of A alone ; in other words,
it will be of the same tint as the image 0 would be if the combination
Q, P, were removed.       Similarly the overlap OE + EE will be deprived
effectually of A' alone ; in other words, it will be of the same tint as E,
if Q, P, were removed. If therefore the Nicol N be turned round, these
two overlaps will behave in respect of colour exactly as did the images
0 and E when Q P was alone used. We may, in fact, form a Table
thus   : —
                Image.                       Colours extinguished.
             00 + EO               B   +A+B'+A=B + B'+A=A
              OE+EE                B'+A' + B+A'=B            + B' + A'=A'.
And since the tints B, B' have disappeared from each of these formulae,
it follows that the second analyzer P may be turned round in any direc-
•tion without altering the tints of the overlaps in question.

  356                       Mr. W. Spottiswoode         on               [May 21,
     In like manner we may form the Table
                 OO + EE             B +A +B +A'(=B + A+A ?=B
                 OE+EO               B' + A' + B'+A=B'+A + A'=B'.
 Hence if the Nicol N be turned round, these overlaps will retain their
 tints ; while if the analyzer Pt be turned, their tints will vary, although
 always remaining complementary to one another.
    There remains the other pair of overlaps, viz. : —
                       OO + OE                B+A + B' + A'
                       EO+EE                  B' + A+B+A'.
     Each of these is deprived of the pair of complementaries A, A', B, B' ;
 and therefore each, as it would seem, ought to appear white of low illumi
 nation, i.   e. grey. This effect, however, is partially masked by the fact that
 the dark bands are not sharply denned like the Fraunhofer lines, but have
 a core of minimum or zero illumination, and are shaded off gradually on
 either    side until at a short distance from the core the colours appear in
 their full intensity. Suppose, for instance, that B' and A' were bright
 tints, the tint resulting from their suppression would be bright ; on the
 other hand, the complementary tints A and B would be generally dim,
 and the image B+A bright, and the overlap B + A+B' + A' would have
 as its predominating tint that of B+A ; and similarly in other cases.
    There are two cases worth remarking in detail, viz., first, that in which
                                   B=A', B'=A,
t.  «. when the same tiats are extinguished by the combination Q P and
by Qj P,. This may be verified by either using two similar quartz plates
 Qj Q„ or by so turning the prism Pt that the combination Q, P, used
alone shall give the same complementary tints as Q P when used alone.
 In this case the images have for their formulae the following : —
              00               OEO                 EO               EE
            A+A'               A+A'                2A               2A';
in pther words,       0O and   E 0 will  show similar tints, and  E 0, E E   com
plementary.        A similar result will ensue  if B?=A, B'=A'.
    Again,    even  when neither of the foregoing conditions are fulfilled, we
may sfall, owing to the breadth of the interference-bands, have such an
effect produced that sensibly to the eye
                                  B+A^B'+A';
and in that case
                          B' + A=B + A-A' + A
                                  =B+A' + 2A-2A',
which     imply that the images O 0 and 0 E may have the same tint, but
that   E O and E E need not on that account be complementary.                They
will differ in tin); in thjp, that E E, having lost the      same   tints as  E 0,
wjU have lost also the tint A, and will have received       besides   the addition
of two measures of the tint A'.

                                             — A similar train of reasoning
might be applied to  the  triple overlaps.   But the main interest of these
parts of the figure consists in this, that each of the triple overlaps is
complementary to the fourth single image, since the recombination of
all four must reproduce white light : hence the tint of each triple over
lap is the same to the eye as the mixture of the two tints suppressed in
the remaining image ; and since by suitably turning the Nicol N or the
prism P,, or both, we can give any required position to the two bands of
extinction, we have the means of exhibiting to the eye the result of the
mixture of the tints due to any two bands at pleasure.

                                            — A further step may be made in
the combination of colours by using a third quartz, Q„, and a third double-

for the eight images may be thus written :->—

   Low-tint Colours. — A slight modification of the arrangement above de
scribed furnishes an illustration of the conclusions stated by Helmholtz,
viz. that the low-tint colours (couleurs degradees"), such as russet, brown,
olive-green, peacock-blue, &c., are the result of relatively low illumina
tion.        He mentioned that
                             he obtained these effects by diminishing the
intensity of the light in the colours to be examined, and by, at the same
time, maintaining a brilliantly illuminated patch in an adjoining part of
the field of view.         If therefore   we use the combination           N, Q, P, P,   (i.   «.
if we remove the second quartz plate), we can, by turning the prism                        P
round, diminish to any required extent the intensity of the light                          in
one  pair of the complementary                 images, and at the same time increase
that in the other pair. This              is    equivalent to the conditions of Helm-
holtz's      experiments   ;   and the tints in question            will   be   found   to be
produced.

IV. "     Further      Experiments      on the Transmission        of Sound."
       By John Tyndall,            D.C.L., LL.D., Professor         of Natural
       Philosophy     in   the Royal Institution. Received May 21, 1874.
   The author describes a number of experiments made with heterogene
ous atmospheres obtained by saturating alternate layers of air with the
vapours of various volatile liquids. Starting from his observation on the
transmission     of sound through      a snow-storm    on the  Mer  de Glace,  in
the winter of 1859, he shows the extraordinary power of sound to pass
through the interstices of solid bodies as long as the continuity of the
air is preserved.      Sound, for example, penetrates through twelve layers
of  a  silk handkerchief, while a single layer of the same handkerchief
dipped into water, so as to fill the interstices, cuts off the sound.
   He also describes numerous experiments with artificial fogs of a
density so great that a depth of three feet sufficed to intercept the con
centrated beam of the electric light ; the effect of such fogs on sound
was sensibly nil.      Experiments were also executed on the illumination
of such fogs by sudden flashes, obtained by the combustion of gun
powder or gun-cotton, or by the alternate extinction and revival of the
electric and other lights.        Such flashes promise to be extremely useful
as fog-signals.
   The author corrects the mistake of supposing that, in the experiments
at the South Foreland, the lower trumpets were not compared with the
higher ones. This, in fact, was the first step of the inquiry.
   He also communicated an extraordinary instance of the interception of
sound during one of the battles of the late American war.
   In these experiments the author has been ably aided by his assistant,
Mr. John Gottrell. An account of the experiments will be found in a
paper now printing for the Philosophical Transactions.
V. " On some recent Experiments with a Fireman's Respirator."
       By John Tyndall, D.C.L., LL.D., Professor of Natural
       Philosophy in the Royal Institution. Received May 21, 1874.
   In vol.  clx. of the  '
                            Philosophical Transactions,' 1870, p. 337, 1 refer to
certain experiments on the " floating matter of the air," which were
afterwards considerably expanded and in part described in my ' Frag
ments of Science.' These experiments, in which my object was to obtain
optically   pure air by filtration through cotton-wool, suggested to me the
notion of      a fireman's respirator.       Cotton-wool had been previously
employed by Schroeder and Pasteur in their experiments on spontaneous
generation.
    I had heard that smoke was a formidable obstacle to the fireman, and
 that cases of suffocation were not rare ; hence the desire to construct a

 360          On Experiments with a fireman's Respirator.             [May    21 ,
 respirator.   My first trials were made with cotton-wool alone. Asso
 ciated with the respirator was a mouthpiece with two valves : through
 one the inhaled air reached the lungs, having first passed through the
 cotton-wool, while through the other the exhaled air was discharged di
 rectly into the atmosphere. The smoke was generated in small rooms,
 and in some experiments in a cupboard ; but though the irritation of
 the smoke was greatly mitigated by the cotton-wool, it was unbearable
 for any considerable time.
    The cotton-wool was next carefully moistened with glycerine, no clots
 which could intercept the air being permitted.           The respirator was
 distinctly improved by the stickiness of the fibres of the wool : still, when
 the smoke was very dense, an amount of irritation continued, which
 materially interfered with the usefulness of the respirator.        Thinking it
 certain that the mechanically suspended matter would be intercepted by
 the moistened wool,     I concluded that this residual irritation was due to
 the vaporous     hydrocarbons    generated during combustion : hence the
 thought of associating with the cotton-wool Dr. Stenhouse's excellent
 device of a charcoal respirator.      The experiment was successful.      "With
 this combination it was possible to remain with comparative comfort
 for half an hour, or even an hour, in atmospheres a single inhalation
 of which without the respirator would be intolerably painful.
    Captain Shaw, of the Metropolitan Fire Brigade, has worked ener
 getically towards the completion of the respirator by associating with it
 a smoke-cap.      Mr. Sinclair has done the same, and he informs me that
 the respirator is now in considerable demand.
    Having heard from Captain Shaw that, in some recent very trying
 experiments, he had obtained the best effects from dry cotton-wool, and
 thinking that   I could not have been mistaken in my first results, which
 proved   the dry  so much inferior to the moistened wool and its associated
 charcoal,  I proposed to Captain Shaw to bring the matter to a test at his
 workshops in the city.      He was good enough to accept my proposal, and
          I
 thither went on the 7th of May. The smoke was generated in a con
fined space from wet straw, and it was certainly very diabolical. At this
season of the year     I am usually somewhat shorn of vigour, and there
fore not in the best condition     for  severe experiments  ; still I wished   to
test the matter in my own person.          With a respirator which had been
in  use some days previously, and which was not carefully packed,          I fol
lowed a fireman into the smoke, he being provided with a dry-wool
respirator.    I was compelled to quit the place in about three minutes,
while the fireman remained there for six or seven minutes.
   I then tried his                                                      I
                      respirator upon myself, and found that with it could
not remain more than a minute in the smoke ; in fact the first inhalation
provoked coughing.
   Thinking that Captain Shaw himself might have lungs more like mine
than those of his fireman,      I  proposed that he and     I  should try the

1874.]                        Election of Fellows.                         361
respirators ; but he informed me that his lungs were very strong.
He was, however, good enough to accede to my request. Packing the
respirator with greater care,    I entered the den with Captain Shaw.        I
could hear him breathe long, slow inhalations ; and after the lapse of
seven minutes      I heard him cough. . In seven and a half minutes he
had to quit the place, thus proving that his lungs were able to endure
the irritation seven times as long as mine could bear it.         I continued
in the smoke with hardly any discomfort for sixteen minutes, and cer
tainly could have remained in it much longer.
                       I
   During this time was in a condition to render very material assistance
to a person in danger of suffocation.
    The smoke-cap     I  wore was one made by Mr. Sinclair, which has a
mouthpiece similar to that used in the inhalation of nitrous oxide.       But,
to show the care necessary in packing the respirator, it is only necessary
to remark that, with the packing furnished to me by Mr. Sinclair, it
was not possible for either myself or Mr. Cottrell to continue in a dense
smoke for more than three minutes ; and even these were minutes of
laborious breathing.      Flannel disks are employed in these respirators,
but   I   cannot recommend them.       Cotton-wool carefully moistened and
teased is,   in my opinion, much better.
    It  is always possible to associate fragments of lime with the respirator,
thus, if necessary, intercepting a portion of the carbonic acid.       But in
most fires we have a more or less free circulation of air    ; and  I venture
to think that not in one case in a thousand of actual fires would the com
bination of smoke and carbonic acid be so noisome as it was in the
experiments here described.

 I. "Note     on the Absorption- Spectra of Potassium and Sodium
       at low Temperatures."      By H. E. Roscoe, F.R.S., and Arthcr
       Schuster, Ph.D. Received April 30, 1874.
    In order to obtain the absorption-spectrum   afforded by the well-known
 green-coloured potassium vapour, pieces of the clean dry metal were
 sealed up in glass tubes filled with hydrogen, and one of these was then
 placed in front of the slit of a large Steiuheil's spectroscope furnished
 with two prisms having refracting angles of 45° and 60°. The magnify-
 ing-power of the telescope was 40, and was sufficient clearly to separate
 the D lines with one prism.      A continuous spectrum from a lime-light
 was used, and that portion of a tube containing the bright metallic
 globule of potassium was gently heated until the green vapour made its
appearance.    A complicated absorption-spectrum was then seen, a set of
 bands (a) in the red coming out first ; whilst after a few moments two
other groups appeared on either side of the D lines, the group /3 (less
refrangible) being not so dark as the group y.          These bands are all
shaded off towards the red, and in general appearance resemble those of
the iodine-spectrum.     In order to assure ourselves that the bands are not
caused by the presence of a trace of an oxide, tubes were prepared in

 1874.]       Absorption-Spectra    of Potassium and Sodium.              363
 which the metal was melted in hydrogen several times on successive days
until no further change in the bright character of the globule could be
 perceived.    On vaporizing the metal, which had been melted down to a
clean portion of the tube, the bands were seen as before, and came out
even more clearly, the globule, after heating, exhibiting a bright metallic
 surface.    An analysis of the potassium used showed that it did not con
 tain more than 0-8 per cent, of sodium, although, of course, the double
 line D was always plainly seen.
     In order to ascertain whether an alteration in the absorption-spectrum
 of the metal takes place at a red heat, fragments of potassium were
 placed in a red-hot iron tube, through which a rapid current of pure
hydrogen gas was passed, the ends of the tube being closed by glass
plates.    The magnificent green colour of the vapour was clearly seen at
this temperature, on looking through the tube at a lime-light placed at the
other end. Owing, doubtless, to the greater thickness or increased pres
 sure of the vapour, the bands seen by the previous method could not be
 resolved by the small spectroscope employed, the whole of the red being
 absorbed, whilst a broad absorption-band in the greenish yellow was seen
 occupying the place of the group y.
     The positions of the bands obtained by the first method were measured
 by means of a telescope and distant scale, and the wave-lengths obtained
 by an interpolation curve, for which well known air-lines were taken as
references.     The following numbers give the wave-lengths of the most
distinct, that is, the most refrangible edge of each band. As the
measurements had to be made quickly, owing to the rapid darkening
of the glass by the action of the metallic vapour, these numbers do not lay
claim to very great accuracy, but fairly represent the relative positions
of the band, and show that they do not always occur at regular intervals,
although they are pretty regularly spread over the field and all are
shaded alike.

    The bright potassium-lines in the red and violet were not seen re

render an observation possible.

in thin layers, appears nearly colourless, exhibits similar absorption-bands,

tubes containing the pure metal, which had been manufactured and pre
served out of contact with any hydrocarbon, were prepared, the metal being
obtained free from oxide and the absorption-spectrum being observed in the
manner already described.   As soon as the metal began to boil, a series of
bands in the blue (Na y) made their appearance, and shortly afterwards
bands in the red and yellow (Na o), stretching as far as the D lines, came
out.        At
          this period of the experiment the D lines widened, thus blotting
out a series of fine bands occurring in the orange (Na /3), some of which,
consequenly, could not be mapped.     All the bands of the sodium-spec
trum shade off, like the potassium-bands, towards the red.
   When the vapour of sodium is examined in a red-hot iron tube, the
colour of the lime-light, as seen through        dark blue. As the sodium

becomes  lighter, and the transmitted rays can be analyzed     the spectro     by
scope.         At first,
                   the whole red and green and  part of the blue    cut out           is
entirely. The D lines are considerably widened, and an absorption-band
is seen in the green, apparently coinciding with the double sodium-line,
which       comes next      in strength to the D lines.         All    the colours, therefore,
seem to be shut out, except part of the orange, part               of the green, and the
 ultra-blue. As the sodium-vapour becomes                  less dense, more light passes
through, and the same absorption-bands are seen as are observed in the
other method.    The vapour then has    slight bluish-green tint, but

III.   " On   the alleged Expansion in Volume of various Substances
       in passing by Refrigeration from the state of Liquid Fusion
       to that of Solidification."      By Robert Mallet, C.E., F.R.S.
       Received   April 28,   1874.
                                   (Abstract.)
    Since the time of Reaumur        it has been stated, with very      various
degrees   of evidence, that certain     metals expand in volume at or near
their points of consolidation   from fusion. Bismuth, cast iron, antimony,
silver, copper, and gold are amongst the number, and to these have
recently been added certain iron furnace-slags.         Considerable physical
interest attaches to this subject from the analogy of the alleged facts to
the well-known one that water expands between 39° F. and 32°, at which
it becomes ice ; and a more ¦extended interest has been given to it quite
recently by Messrs. Nasmyth and Carpenter having made the supposed
facts, more especially those relative to cast iron and to slags, the
foundation of their peculiar theory of lunar volcanic action as developed
in their work, 'The Moon as a Planet, as a World, and a Satellite'
(4to, London, 1874).      There is considerable ground for believing that
bismuth does expand in volume at or near consolidation ; but with
respect to all the other substances supposed to do likewise, it is the
object of this paper to show that the evidence is insufficient, and that
with respect to cast iron and to the basic silicates constituting iron
slags, the allegation of their expansion in volume, and therefore that
their density when molten is greater than when solid, is wholly
erroneous.      The determination of the specific gravity, in the liquid
state, of a body having so high a fusing temperature as cast iron is
attended with many difficulties.       By an indirect method, however, and
operating upon a sufficiently large scale, the author has been enabled to
make the determination with considerable accuracy.         A conical vessel of
wrought iron of about 2 feet in depth and 1-5 foot diameter of base, and
with an open neck of     6 inches  in diameter, being formed, was accurately
 weighed empty, and also when filled with water level to the brim ; the
weight of its contents in water, reduced to the specific gravity of distilled
water at 60° F., was thus obtained.         The vessel being dried was now
filled to the brim with molten grey cast iron, additions of molten metal
being made to maintain the vessel full until it had attained its maximum
temperature (yellow heat in daylight) and maximum capacity.                 The
vessel and its content of cast iron when cold were weighed again, and
thus the weight of the cast iron obtained.        The capacity of the vessel
when at a maximum was calculated by applying to its dimensions at 60°
the expansion calculated from the coefficient of linear dilatation, as given
by Laplace, Riemann,     and others, and from its range of increased tem
perature   ; and the weight of distilled water held by the vessel thus e.\

  panded was calculated from the weight of its contents when the vessel
  and water were at 60° F.
      We have now, after applying            some   small corrections,    the elements
  necessary for determining the specific gravity of the cast iron which filled
  the vessel when in the molten state, having the absolute weights of equal
  volumes of distilled water at 60° and of molten iron. The mean spe
  cific gravity of the cast iron which filled the vessel was then determined
  by the usual methods.            The final result is that, whereas the specific
  gravity of the cast iron at 60° F. was 7"170, it was only 6-650 when in
¦ the molten condition ; cast iron, therefore, is less dense in the molten
  than in the solid state. Nor does it expand in volume at the instant of
  consolidation, as was conclusively proved by another experiment.                 Two
  similar 10-inch spherical shells, 1-5 inch in thickness, were heated to
  nearly the same high temperature in an oven, one being permitted to
  cool empty as a measure of any permanent dilatation which both might
  sustain by mere heating and cooling again, a fact well known to occur.
  The other shell, when at a bright red heat, was filled with molten
  cast iron and permitted to cool, its dimensions being taken by accurate
  instruments at intervals of 30 minutes, until it had returned to the
  temperature of the atmosphere (53° F.), when, after applying various
  corrections, rendered necessary by the somewhat complicated conditions
  of a spherical mass of cast iron losing heat from its exterior, it was
  found that the dimensions of the shell, whose interior surface was in
  perfect contact with that of the solid ball which filled it, were, within
  the limit of experimental error, those of the empty shell when that also
  was cold (53° F.), the proof being conclusive that no expansion in
  volume of the contents of the shell had taken place.             The central portion
  was much less dense than the exterior, the opposite of what must have
  occurred had expansion in volume on cooling taken place.
      It is a fact, notwithstanding what precedes, and is well known to iron-
  founders, that certain pieces of cold cast iron do float on molten cast
  iron of the       same   quality, though they cannot do so through their
  buoyancy.      As   various    sorts of cast iron vary in specific gravity at
  60° F., from nearly 7'700 down to 6-300, and vary also in dilatability,
   some cast irons    may thus float or sink in molten cast iron of different
   qualities from themselves through buoyancy or negative buoyancy alone ;
  but where the cold cast iron floats upon molten cast iron of less specific
   gravity than itself, the author shows that some other force, the nature
   of which yet remains to      be investigated,   keeps it floating ;  this the author
   has  provisionally    called   the repellent    force, and has      shown    that its
   amount is, cceteris    paribus, dependent upon the relation that subsists
   between the volume and
                                   " effective " surface of the floating
                                                                             piece. By
   " effective surface is meant all such part of the immersed solid as is in
               "
   a horizontal    plane or can be reduced to one.          The repellent force has
   also relations to the difference in temperature between the solid and the
   molten metal on which it floats.

  The author then extends his experiments to lead, a metal known to
contract greatly in solidifying, and, with respect to which, no one has sug
gested that it expands at the moment of consolidation. He finds that pieces
of lead having a specific gravity of 11-361, and being at 70° F., float or
sink upon molten lead of the same quality, whose calculated specific
gravity was 11-07, according to the relation that subsists between the
                           "
volume and the " effective   surface of the solid piece, thin pieces with
large surface always floating, and vice versd.    An explanation is offered
of the true cause of the ascending and descending currents observed in
very large
            " ladles " of liquid cast iron, as stated by Messrs. Nasmyth
and Carpenter.      The facts are shown to be in accordance with those
above  mentioned,    and when rightly interpreted to be at variance with
the views of these authors.
   Lastly, the author proceeds to examine the statements made by these
writers, as to the floating of lumps of solidified iron furnace-slag upon
the same when in a molten state ; he examines the conditions of the
alleged facts, and refers to his own experiments upon the total contrac
tion of such slags, made at Barrow Iron- works (a full account of
which he has given in his paper on
                                       " The true Nature aud Origin of
Volcanic Heat and Energy," printed in Phil. Trans. 1873), as conclusively
proving that such slags are not denser in the molten than in the solid
state, and that the floating referred to is due to other causes.       The
author returns thanks to several persons for facilities liberally afforded
him in making these experiments.
IV. " Note    on the Excitation of the Surface of the Cerebral Hemi
       spheres by Induced  Currents."    By  J. Burdon Sanderson,
       M.D., F.R.S., Professor of Practical Physiology in University
       College, London.   Received April 30, 1874.
  In   a paper recently communicated to the  Royal Society by Dr. Ferrier
(Proceedings, No.  151)  it is shown that when   two ends of copper wire
distant from each other not more than a couple of millimetres, and in
metallic communication with the terminals of the secondary coil of a
Du Bois's induction-apparatus in action, are applied to certain spots of the
surface of either hemisphere, and great intensity is given to the induced
currents thereby directed through the living tissue, by previously bringing
the secondary coil into such a position that it is very close to the primary
coil or even partially covers it,
                                characteristic combined movements of the
opposite side of the body are produced.
  With reference to these effects, was observed
                                    it              by  Dr. Ferrier (1) that
excitation of the same spot always produces the same movement in the
same animal, (2) that the area of excitability for any given movement
(or, as itmay be called for shortness, the active spot)  is extremely small
aud admits of very accurate definition, and (3) that in different animals

  1874.]              Brain-surface by Induced Currents.                    369
  excitations of anatomically corresponding spots produce similar or corre
  sponding results.      From these remarkable facts and from others similar
  to them relating to other parts of the brain to which     I do not now advert,
  it was inferred that, at the surface of the hemispheres, certain " centres "
  are to be found, of which it is the function to originate combined or even
  purposive movements.
      To this inference objections have been recently raised by Dr. Dupuy,
   based on the results of experiments made by him, in which he found that,
   after the ablation of those parts of the hemispheres which contain the
»  supposed centres, movements, similar to those described by Dr. Ferrier, can
   still be produced by electrical excitation of the cut surface. In com
   menting on these counter experiments, Dr. Ferrier has since pointed out
   that the effects described by Dr. Dupuy are entirely different from those
   observed by himself, and, particularly, that the movements produced in his
   experiments are of an uncertain character, affecting sometimes one, some
   times several groups of muscles.
       As it appeared to  me that, although   Dr. Dupuy has failed to prove that
   the movements he described -are      of the same nature with those described
   by Dr. Ferrier, the latter has not proved that they are different,           I
   thought it necessary to make a series of experiments for the purpose of
   clearing up this uncertainty.                     I
                                     With this view determined to investigate
   the most characteristic of the combined movements, so accurately described
   by Dr. Ferrier as produced by excitation of particular spots on the anterior
   part of either hemisphere, by comparing them with those produced by
    excitation of deeper parts.    The results of my experiments, in which cats
    were employed, are as follows : —
       1. By removing the integument, skull, and dura mater to an extent
    corresponding to the anterior half of the right parietal bone and the
    adjoining thin portion of the frontal bone, an area of the surface of the
    brain is brought into view which comprises several spots by the excita
    tion of which the following characteristic movements can be produced : —
    (1) Extraction of the left fore paw, with flexion of the carpus, accom
    panied by similar movements of the left hind leg. (2) Closure of the
    left eye and elevation of the left upper lip. (3) Retraction of the left
    ear. (4) Rotation of the head to the left side.
        The active spots for these several movements are as follows : — For (1),
    a point immediately behind the outer end of the crucial sulcus ; for (2),
    the surface about the outer end of a sulcus which lies immediately behind
    (1) ; for (3), the surface behind the sulcus last mentioned ; for (4), a spot
    about a centim. further back on the same convolution.         Movements (1),
     (2) , and (3) can be produced in the cat with very great certainty, and the
     active spots for them are well defined.      Their limits and relations are
     in exact accordance with the statements of Dr. Ferrier.
        2. If that part of the surface of the right hemisphere which comprises
     the active spots above mentioned is severed from the deeper parts by a

nearly horizontal incision made with a thin-bladed knife, and the instru
ment is at once withdrawn, without dislocation of the severed part, and
the excitation      of the active spots thereupon         repeated, the result is the
same as when the surface of the           uninjured organ is acted upon.
    If a similar incision is made in a parallel plane, but at a lower level,
this is not the case ; but on removing the flap and applying the electrodes
to the cut surface, it is found that there are on it active spots, which, as
regards the effect of excitation, have the same properties as the active
spots previously observed on the natural surface, and that the latter have
the same topographical relation to each other as the former.
    3. In a brain hardened in alcohol a needle plunged vertically, i. e. at
right angles to the surface, from the active spot for retraction of the
opposite ear, reaches the posterior             part   of the    corpus   striatum at a
depth of from 10 to 12 millims.                If  a horizontal     incision is  made     in
the living brain, at this depth, and is met by two others, of which one is
directed antero-posteriorly          and the other transversely, and the part
comprised     within   the  incisions  removed, a surface of brain is exposed in
the deepest part of the wound           which corresponds to the outer and upper
part of the corpus striatum*.         If now   the electrodes are applied to this sur
face, the movements (1), (2), (3) are produced in the same way as before,
but more distinctly ; the active spots are quite as strictly localized, and
their relations to each other are the same as at the surface —the spot for
the movement of the extremities being in front, that for the closure of
the eye and retraction of the upper lip being to the outside, and that for
the ear behind.
    From these facts it appears that the superficial convolutions do not
contain organs which are essential to the production of the combinations of
muscular movements now in question.                  They further make it probable
that the doctrine hitherto accepted by physiologists, that the centres for
such movements are to be found in the masses of grey matter which lie in
the floor and outer wall of each lateral ventricle, is true.
   * In  case it should be necessary to repeat this experiment, it will be found best (after
having noted the effects of exciting the surface at the several active spots and ascer
tained the degree of excitation required for the production of the corresponding move
ments) to proceed to remove the part of the brain containing them, bo as to expose the
outer aspect of the anterior part of the corpus striatum at once ; and then, as soon as
hemorrhage has ceased, to investigate the relative positions of the active spots on the
surface so exposed.    [Since the above paper was communicated, I have ascertained that
at the lowest part of this surface there is a spot, of which excitation induces opening of
the mouth and alternate protrusion and retraction of the tongue — a group of move
ments which Dr. Ferricr has localized on the under surface of the brain, in front of the
Sylvian fissure.— J. B. S., June 3, 1874.]

      Norman Lockyeb, F.R.S. Received April 20, 1874.
   It has   been assumed hitherto     that a great thickness of a gas or vapour
causes   its radiation,   and therefore its absorption, to assume more and
more    the   character    of a continuous spectrum as the thickness is
increased.
   It has been shown by      Dr. Frankland and myself that such a condition
obtains when the density of a vapour is increased, and my later researches
have shown that it is brought about in two ways.               Generalizing the
       I
work have already done, without intending thereby to imply necessarily
that the rule will hold universally, or that it exhausts all the phenomena,
it may   be stated that metallic elements of low specific gravity approach
the continuous spectrum by widening their lines, while metallic elements of
high specific gravity approach the continuous state by increasing the
number of their lines.        Hence in the vapours of Na, Ca, Al, and Mg
we have a small number of lines which broaden, few short lines being
added by increase of density ; in Fe, Co, Ni, &c. we have many lines which
do  not so greatly broaden, many short lines being added.
   The observations     I  made in India during the total solar eclipse of 1871
were against the assumption referred to ; and if we are to hold that the

lines, both "fundamental        and " short," which we get in a spectrum, are
due to atomic impact (defining by the word atom, provisionally, that mass
of matter which gives us a line-spectrum), then, as neither the quantity
of the impacts nor the quality is necessarily altered by increasing the
thickness of the stratum, the assumption seems also devoid of true
theoretical foundation.
   One thing is clear, that     if the assumed continuous      spectrum   is ever
reached by increased thickness, as by increased density, it must be reached
through the
                " short-line " stage.
                         I
   To test this point have made the following experiments : —
   1.  An iron tube about 5 feet long was filled with dry hydrogen               ;
pieces of sodium were carefully placed at intervals along the whole
length of the tube, except close to the ends.        The ends were closed with
glass plates.      The tube was placed in two gas-furnaces in line and
heated. An electric lamp was placed at one end of the tube and a
spectroscope at the other.
   When the tube was red-hot and filled with sodium-vapour throughout,
as nearly as possible, its whole length, a stream of hydrogen slowly
passing through the tube, the line D was seen to be absorbed ; it was no
thicker than when seen under similar conditions in a test-tube, and far
thinner than the line absorbed by sodium- vapour in a test-tube, if the
density be only slightly increased.

  Only the longest
                    " fundamental " line was absorbed.
  The line was thicker than the D line in the solar spectrum, in which          spec
trum all the short lines are reversed.
  2. As it was difficult largely to increase either the temperature or the
density of the sodium-vapour,        I have made another   series of experiments
with iodine-vapour.
  I have  already pointed out the differences indicated by the spectro
                                                     " atom " of a metal
scope between the quality of the vibrations of the
and of the " subatom

                        of a metalloid (by which term        I
                                                         define that mass
of matter which gives us a spectrum of channelled spaces, and builds up
the continuous spectrum in its own way). Thus, in iodine, the short lines,
brought about by increase of density in an atomic spectrum, are repre
sented by the addition of a system of well-defined " beats

bands of continuous absorption to the simplest spectrum, which is one
exquisitely rhythmical, the intervals increasing from the blue to the red,
and in which the beats are scarcely noticeable.
  On increasing   the density of a very small thickness by a gentle
heating, the beats and bands are introduced, and, as the density is still
further increased, the absorption becomes continuous throughout the
whole of the visible spectrum.
  The absorption of a thickness of 5 feet 6 inches of iodine-vapour at a
temperature of 59° F. has given me no indication of bands, while the
beats were so    faint that they were scarcely visible.

       tion in Molecular Structure." By J. Norman Lockyer, F.R.S.
       Received   May    26, 1874.
  1.   In   an accompanying note     I have shown   that when different degrees
of dissociating power are employed the spectral effects are different.
   2. In the present note    I
                             propose to give a preliminary account of some
researches which have led me to the conclusion that, starting with a mass
of elemental matter, such mass of matter is continually broken up as the
temperature (including in this term the action of electricity) is raised.
   3. The evidence upon which        I
                                   rely is furnished by the spectroscope in
the region of the visible spectrum.
   4. To begin by the extreme cases, all solids give us continuous spectra ;
all vapours produced by the high-tension spark give us line-spectra.
   5. Now the continuous spectrum may be, and as a matter of fact                  is,
observed in the case of chemical compounds, whereas all compounds
known as such are resolved by the high-tension spark into their consti
tuent elements.    We have right, therefore, to assume that an element
                                 a
in the solid state  is
                    a  more complex mass than the element in        state ofa
vapour, as its spectrum     the same as that of
                           is                       mass which
                                                    a             known to

    6.   The spectroscope supplies us with intermediate        stages between these
extremes.
    («) The spectra vary as we pass from the induced current with the
jar to the spark without the jar, to the voltaic arc, or to the highest
temperature produced by combustion. The change is always in the same
direction ; and here, again, the spectrum we obtain from elements hi a
state of vapour (a spectrum characterized by spaces and bands) is similar
to that we obtain from vapours of which the compound nature is un
questioned.
    (/3)  At high temperatures, produced by combustion, the vapours of            some
elements (which give us neither line- nor channelled space-spectra at those
temperatures, although we undoubtedly get line-spectra when electricity is
employed, as stated in 4) give us a continuous spectrum at the more
refrangible end, the less refrangible end being unaffected.
    (y) At ordinary temperatures, in some cases, as in selenium, the more
refrangible end is absorbed ; in others the continuous spectrum in the
blue is accompanied by a continuous spectrum in the red.                       On the
application    of  heat, the  spectrum     in the  red  disappears, that  in  the  blue
remains ; and further, as Faraday has shown in his researches on gold-
leaf, the masses      which absorb in the blue may be isolated from those
which absorb in the red.         It is well known that many substances known
to be compounds       in solution  give us absorption in the blue or blue and
red   ;  and, also, that the addition of a substance known to be compound
(such as water) to substances known to be compound which absorb the
blue, superadds an absorption in the red.
    7.   In those  cases which do not conform        to what has been stated the
limited range of the visible spectrum must be borne in mind.                    I
                                                                         Thus have
little doubt that the simple gases, at the ordinary conditions           of  tempera
ture and pressure, have an absorption in the ultra-violet, and that highly
compound vapours are often colourless because their absorption is beyond
the red, with or without an absorption in the ultra-violet.               Glass is a
good case in point ; others will certainly suggest themselves as opposed
to the opacity of the metals.
    8.   If we assume, in accordance with what has been stated, that the
various spectra to which       I have referred are really due to different mole
cular aggregations, we shall have the following series, going from the
more simple to the more complex : —
        First stage of complexity     1

      Fifth  stage                      Unique continuous absorption.
   9.  I shall   content  myself   in the present note by giving one or two
instances of the passage     of spectra from one stage to another, beginning
at the fifth stage.
                                    From 5 to    4.
   1.  The absorption of the vapours of        K  in the red-hot tube, described
in another note, is at first continuous.        As the action of the heat is con
tinued, this continuous spectrum breaks in the middle ; one part of it
retreats to the blue, the other to the red.
                                    From 4 to    3.
   1. Faraday's researches on gold-leaf best illustrate this ; but            I hold
that my explanation of them by masses of two degrees of complexity
only is sufficient without his conclusion (' Researches in Chemistry,'
p. 417), that they exist
                            " of intermediate     sizes  or proportions."
                                   From 3 to 2.
   1.  Sulphur-vapour first gives a continuous spectrum at the blue end ;
on heating, this breaks up into a channelled space-spectrum.
   2. The new spectra of K and Na (more particularly referred to in the
third note) make their appearance after the continuous absorption in the
blue and red vanishes.
                                    From 2 to    1.
   1.  In many metalloids the spectra, without the jar, are channelled; on
throwing the jar into the circuit the line-spectrum is produced, while the
cooler exterior vapour gives a channelled absorption-spectrum.
   2. The new spectra of K and Na change into the line-spectrum                (with
thick lines which thin subsequently) as the heat is continued.

      Norman Lockyer, F.R.S. Received May 26, 1874.
   1.  I have recently attempted to bring the spectroscope to bear upon
the question whether vapours of elements below the highest tempera
tures are truly homogeneous, and whether the vapours of different
chemical elements, at any one temperature, are all in a similar molecular
condition.     In  the present note,   I beg to lay before the Royal Society the
preliminary results of my researches.

 1874.]              Mr. J. N. Lockyer's Spectroscopic Notes. — No.                  III.        375
        2.   We start with the following facts : —
             I. All    elements driven into vapour by the induced current give line-
                     spectra.
             II.    Most elements driven into vapour by the voltaic arc give us the
                     same.
             III.    Many metalloids when greatly heated,            some     at ordinary tem
                    peratures, give us channelled-space spectra.
             IV.    Elements in the solid state give us continuous spectra.
        3.   If we
             grant that the spectra represent to us the vibrations of dif
 ferent molecular aggregations (this question is discussed in Note II.),
 spectroscopic observations should furnish us with facts of some import
 ance to the inquiry.
   4. To take the lowest ground.    If, in the absence of all knowledge on
the subject, it could be shown that all vapours at all stages of temperature
had spectra absolutely similar in character, then it would be more likely
that all vapours were truly homogeneous and similar among themselves,
as regards molecular condition, than if the spectra varied in character, not
only from element to element, but from one temperature to another in
the vapour of the same element.
   5. At the temperature of the sun's reversing layer, the spectra of all
the elements known to exist in that layer are apparently similar in cha
racter — that            is,
                they are all line-spectra    hence    more probable that
                                                               ;   it   is
the vapours there are truly homogeneous, and that they all exist in the
same molecular condition, than      the spectrum were
                                                    if mixed one.         a
       The fact that the order of vapour-densities in the sun's atmosphere,

which we can in      measure determine
                                 a                           by
                                              spectroscopic observations, does
not agree with the order of the modern atomic weights of the elements,
but more closely agrees with the older atomic weights, led me to take up
the present research.    Thus may mention that my early observations of
                                                I

vol.         mi.                                                                 2   a

tube closed at each end with glass plates ; and         I  have to express my ob
ligations   to  Dr.   Russell  for allowing  them  to be  conducted  in his labora
tory, and for much assistance and counsel concerning them.
   A stream of dry H was allowed to pass. The tube was heated in a
Hofmann's gas-furnace, pieces of the metal to be studied having previ
ously been introduced.          It was found that the glass tube melted ; it was
therefore replaced by an iron one.          The inconvenience of this plan, how
ever (owing to the necessity for introducing the metal into the end of the
hot tube when          the first charge had volatilized),     and, moreover, the
insufficiency of the heat obtainable from the gas-furnace, soon obliged me
to replace both tube and furnace by others, which have now been in use
for many weeks, and which still continue to work most satisfactorily.
   The iron tube is 4 feet in length, and is provided with a central en
largement, suggested to me by Mr. Dewar, forming a T-piece by the
screwing in of a side tube, the end of which is left projecting from the
door in the roof of the furnace.             Caps are screwed on at each end
of the main tube ; these caps are closed by a glass plate at one end,
and have each a small side tube for the purpose of passing hydro
gen or other gases through the hot tube.                The furnace is supplied
with coke or charcoal ; an electric lamp, connected with thirty Grove's
cells, is placed at one end of the tube and a one-prism spectroscope at the
other.     The temperatures reached by this furnace may be conveniently
divided into four stages : — -
   I. When the continuous spectrum of the tube extends to the sodium-
line D, this line not being visible.
   II. "When the continuous spectrum extends a little beyond D, this line
being visible as a bright line.
   III. When the spectrum extends into the green, D being very bright.
   IV. When the spectrum extends beyond the green and D becomes in
visible as a line, and the sides of the furnace are at a red heat.
   I  may add (1) that       I have only within the last few days been able to
employ    the   third  and  fourth  stages of heat, as the furnace was previously
without     a chimney, and the necessary draught could not be obtained ;
                 I
and (2) that was informed, a little time ago, by Prof. Boscoe that, with a
white-hot tube, he had observed new spectra in the case of Na and K.
These spectra, which        I  now constantly see when these temperatures are
reached,    I  shall call the " new spectra."
   9. The results of the experiments, so far as the visible spectrum is
concerned, between the stages indicated may be stated as follows           : —
      H. No        absorption.
      N. No absorption.

   11.   It will be seen from the foregoing statement that if similar spectra
be taken as    indicating similar molecular conditions, then the vapours,
the densities of which have been determined, have not been in the same
molecular condition among themselves.          Thus the vapours of K, S, and
Cd, at the fourth stage of heat, gave us line, channelled-space, and con
tinuous absorption in the blue respectively.         This is also evidence that
each vapour is non-homogeneous for a considerable interval of time, the
interval being increased as the temperature is reduced.

       tion Phenomena."        By  J. Norman Lockyer, F.R.S. Received
       May 26, 1874.
   1.   In  the experiments on the absorption-spectrum          of Na and K
vapour heated in a red-hot tube, to which further reference is made in
separate notes,      I have observed phenomena quite new to me, some
rough drawings of which       I lay herewith before the Royal Society.        As
the phenomena are only momentary,         I cannot answer for the    final accu
racy of the drawings, nor have      I been able to represent the softness of
the gradations of shade.
   2. In the drawings, the red end of the spectrum is to the left ; the D
line common to them all is the image of a slit about half an inch long,
on which slit the light falls from an electric lamp, through the tube and
chamber in which the vapours are produced.             The lower part of the
drawings would generally represent, therefore,        the spectrum of the less
dense vapours were the vapours at rest.                      •
   3. One of the phenomena referred to consists of what may be described
as a unilateral widening of the line D : the side absorption, however, is
much less dense than that of the line ; it is bounded by D on one side
and by a curved line on the other.       Figs. 1, 2, and 3 will give an idea of
this appearance in three stages as it is frequently actually seen, i. e. as
the absorption travels up or down the line it widens as shown.

    4. Figs. 4 and 5 give two variations sometimes observed — fig. 4 showing
the darkening in the absorption and an increased steepness in the curve ;
 fig. 5 the simultaneous existence of apparently different absorptions,
all bounded by D on one side, but by different     curves on the other, and
 being of different intensities.
 Fig.  4.
Fig.   5.
    5. Although, in the preceding drawings,    I have represented this uni
lateral widening exclusively on the more refrangible side of D,       I have
observed it on the other, though scarcely so frequently.
    6. Accompanying these appearances, but generally best visible when
the absorption with curved boundary is visible on both sides of D, is a
brilliant boundary replacing the mere change of shade.
    7. At times the brilliant boundary is continuous across D, as shown in
fig. 6 ; but I  append figs. 7 and 8 to show that the phenomena on either
 side of  D are independent of   each other.

    8. At times, D puts on the appearance of the limiting line of a chan-
nelled-space spectrum, the
                              " easing off " of the absorption being now on
one side and now on the other.
    9. Should all these phenomena be ultimately referred to the causes
which produce a channelled-space spectrum (one of which undoubtedly is
the tendency to a unilateral instead of a bilateral widening), a line-spec
trum will be regarded as a special case merely, and not as an entirely          •
different spectrum, as it has been hitherto ; and the range of molecular
combinations in any one element from which line-spectra may be pro
duced is extended.
    10. The question further arises, whether many of the short lines in
 spectra are not remnants of channelled-space spectra.

          By William Shanks. Communicated by the Rev.G. Salmon,
          F.R.S. Received May 19, 1874.
   In a former communication (supra, p. 200) gave a Table showing the    I
number of figures in the period of the reciprocal of every given prime up to
20,000.   The Table here introduced is intended to solve the converse pro
blem, and to show what primes have a given number of figures in their
period.      It appears
                    at once, from the ordinary rule for converting a pure cir
culating decimal into a proper fraction, that if the reciprocal of a prime have
n figures in its period, that prime must be a factor in the number formed
by writing down n nines, and therefore also, generally, in the number
formed by writing down n ones. We denote that number by n ; that is
to say, 5 (in the left column), for example, =11111, except where
3, 3a, 3s.    . .   .3' are concerned, when we havefor example, =999. The
                                                                    3,
problem now before us is equivalent to that of breaking np n into its
prime factors ; and the previous Table gives us great facility in doing
this, for it exhibits every factor of n which is less than 20,000* ; and                                 if,
after accounting for all these, the remaining factor of n         less than               is
30,0002,     we may be sure that               it   is   a   prime number, and that the resolu
tion   is   complete.
   If we                    composite number mn, this may obviously be
              have to deal with           a
written down either as m groups of n ones or as n groups of m ones. It
follows that mn contains m and n as factors. We may also state here that
12, besides the          factor 9901, obviously              has all the factors belonging to any
submultiple of           12, e. g.   2,   3,   4,
                                               6    ;    and that this holds   in all other similar
cases, and need not be stated again.  When we affirm that the resolution
in any case    complete (and,
                    is        indeed, throughout the Table),         to be                it   is
clearly understood that the submultiples have all been carefully attended
to, and thus any result may easily be verified.  The high factors found
(those, we mean, above 30,0002) have involved considerable labour      and                          ;
though we may not say absolutely that they are primes, yet we are
certain that,     composite, their component factors are primes each
                     if
greater than 30)000, and that the periods of their reciprocals have readily
been found.   It only remains to add here that the left column contains
the given number of figures in the reciprocal of the prime or primes
found and placed opposite in the right column, or, in  few cases, of the       a
second powers of primes, and as far as the sixth power of the prime 3.
   If the number of figures in the reciprocal of be n, then the general  P
rulet, which may be drawn from particular cases such as the following
two,   is   that the number of figures in the reciprocal                     of P*   is   nP, of    P3   is

resulting from dividing         18 such periods successively by 19 are,     in order, 15,

~ = 18 x 19=342.               The law of such remainders,          after  the first has
At?
been     obtained, is simple         enough, and may be written down at once.
Again, since the period of           -i- = 81, also   since the remainders      resulting
                                     .Loo
from      dividing 163 such periods, each of 81 figures, successively by 163
are, in order, 149, 135, 121, 107, 93, 79, 65, 51, 37, 23, 9, 158, 144. .. .0
(the series consisting of 163 terms, of which the last is 0), it follows that
—
163
   i- =81 x         163 = 13203.       The law of the above series is evident, and
the     number       of terms     is   easily found to be 163.            There is an
obvious exception when P 3; then the period is divisible by P,
                                        =
and the number of figures in the reciprocal of 3" is 1, of 3s is 3, and of
3" is 3"~3.          There are other exceptions also, or at all events one.
Desmarest, for instance, has remarked that               in the   case  of P=487, the
period is divisible by 487 ; and therefore the number of figures in the
reciprocal of 487a is the same as that in the reciprocal of 487, viz. 486.
I  am not acquainted with the general theory of such exceptions ; nor do
I   know what other primes (if any) besides 3 and 487 have the same
peculiarity.
    With these explanations the following Table can readily be under
stood.       We mark with an asterisk those cases in which the resolution is
complete, thus 28 | 29 . 281 . 12149 9449.                  We are to be understood

III. "       On the Number of Figures in the Reciprocal of every
         Prime between 20,000 and 30,000." By William Shanks.
         Communicated by the Rev. George Salmon, F.R.S. Received
         June 6, 1874.
    In a former communication*                I  gave the number of figures in the
reciprocal of every prime below 20,000 ; the present Table is simply an
extension of the former, and has been calculated by the same method.
Towards the close of the former Table, viz. opposite the prime 19841,
instead of 1984 read 64. The whole of the former Table has kindly been
verified by the Rev. Dr. Salmon.                 For the accuracy of the following
Table     I  am entirely responsible, and believe it is free from error.

IV. " Research       on the Smallpox of Sheep."             By E. Klein, M.D.,
      Assistant     Professor at the Laboratory of the Brown Institu
      tion, London.           Communicated          by John Simon, F.R.S.,
      D.C.L., Medical Officer          of  the  Privy Council, &c. Received
      June   11-,  1874.
   Variola ovina, or smallpox of       sheep, is a disease which, although it is
not communicable      to   man,  and  possesses a specific contagium of its own,
very closely resembles human smallpox, both as regards the development
of the morbid process and the anatomical lesions which accompany it.
This correspondence is so complete, that it cannot be doubted that the
pathogeny of the two diseases is the same.             The present investigation
was therefore undertaken in the confidence that the application of the
experimental method to the investigation of the ovine disease would not
only yield results of value, as contributory to our knowledge of the infec
tive process in general, but would throw special light on the pathology
of smallpox.
   The paper consists of four sections. In the first, the author gives an
account of his experimental method, which consisted in communicating
the disease by inoculation to a sufficient number of sheep, and in investi
gating anatomically (1) the pustules produced at the seat of inoculation,
and (2) those constituting the general eruption.             The lymph employed
was obtained by the kindness of Prof. Chauveau, of Lyons, and Prof.
Cohn, of Breslau.
   In the second section, the organisms contained in fresh lymph, and the
organic forms derived from them by cultivation, are described.                 The
author finds that fresh lymph contains spheroidal bodies of extreme
minuteness, which correspond to the micrococcus of Hallier and to the
spheroids described by Cohn and Sanderson in vaccine lymph.                It also
contains other forms, not previously described, which in their develop
ment are in organic continuity with the micrococci.
   The third section contains a complete anatomical description of the skin

of the sheep, with special reference to those particulars in which    it differs
from that of man.
     The remainder of the paper is occupied with the investigation of the
changes which occur in the integument at the seat of the inoculation, and
with the anatomical characters of the secondary pustules.
     The most important results are the following : —
     1.  The development of the primary pock may be divided into three
 stages, of which the first is characterized by progressive thickening of the
 integument over a rapidly increasing but well-defined area ; the second, by
 the formation of vesicular cavities containing clear liquid (the " cells
                                                                                "
 of older authors) in the rete Malpighii ; the third, by the impletion of
 these cavities with pus-corpuscles and other structures.          It is to be
 noted that the division into stages is less marked than in human small
 pox.
     2. The process commences in the rete Malpighii and in the subjacent
 papillary layer of the corium — in the former, by the enlargement and in
 creased distinctness of outline of the cells, and by corresponding germi-
 native changes in their nuclei ; in the latter, by the increase of size of the
 papillae, and by germination of the epithelial elements of the capillary
 blood-vessels.
     3.  It is next seen that the interfascicular channels (lymphatic canali-
 culi) of the corium are dilated and more distinct ; that the lining cells of
 these channels are enlarged and more easily recognized than in the
 natural state ; and that, in the more vascular parts of the corium, the
 channels are more or less filled with migratory, or lymph, corpuscles. At
 the same time, the lymphatic vessels, of which the canaliculi are tribu
 taries, can be readily traced, in consequence of their being distended with
 a material which resembles coagulated plasma.
      4. About the third day after the appearance of the pock, the contents
  of the dilated lymphatics begin to exhibit characters which are not met
 with in ordinary exudative processes. These consist in the appearance,
 in the granular material already mentioned, of organized bodies, which
 neither belong to the tissue nor are referable to any anatomical type —
  viz. of spheroidal, or ovoid, bodies having the characters of micrococci and
  of branched filaments.     These last may be either sufficiently sparse to be
  easily distinguished from each other, or closely interlaced so as to form
  a felt-like mass.
      5. The process, thus commenced, makes rapid progress.       After one or
  two days, the greater number of the lymphatics of the affected part of
  the corium become filled with the vegetation above described ; and on
  careful examination of the masses, it is seen that they present the cha
  racters of a mycelium, from which necklace-like terminal filaments spring,
  each of which breaks off, at its free end, into conidia.     In most of the
  filaments, a jointed structure can be made out, and, in the larger ones, the

390              Dr. E. Klein on the Smallpox of Sheep.            [June 18,
contents can be distinguished    from the enclosing membrane by their yel
lowish-green colour.
   6.  At the same time that these appearances present themselves in the
corium, those changes are beginning in the now much thickened rete Mal-
pighii which are preparatory to the formation of the vesicular cavities
already mentioned.      By a process which the author designates horny
transformation, having its seat in the epithelial cells of the middle layer of
the rete Malpighii, a horny expau sion, or stratum, appears, lying in a plane
parallel to the surface, by which the rete Malpighii is divided into two
parts, of which one is more superficial, the other deeper than the horny
layer.   Simultaneously with the formation of the horny layer the cells of
the rete nearest the surface of the corium undergo very active germina
tion, in consequence of which the interpapillary processes not only
enlarge, but intrude in an irregular manner into the subjacent corium.
At the same time, the cells immediately below the horny stratum begin to
take part in the formation of the vesicular cavities, some of them en
larging into vesicles, while others   become flattened and scaly, so as to
form the septa by which the vesicular cavities are separated from each
other.
   7.  The vesicles, once formed, increase in form and number.      Originally
separate, and containing     only clear liquid, they coalesce,    as they get
larger, into irregular sinuses, and are then seen to contain masses of vege
tation similar to those which have been already described in the lymphatic
system of the corium — with this difference, that the filaments of which
the masses are composed are of such extreme tenuity, and the conidia
are so small and numerous, that the whole possesses the characters of
zooglaoa rather than of mycelium.        However, the author has no doubt
that these aggregations are produced in the same way as the others, viz.
by the detachment of conidia from the ends of filaments.        In the earlier
stages of the process the cavities contain scarcely any young cells.
Sooner or later, however, so much of the rete Malpighii as lies between
the horny stratum and the papillae becomes infiltrated with migratory
lymph-corpuscles.     The process can be plainly traced in the sections. At
the period of vesiculation, t. e. at a time corresponding to the commence
ment of the development of the vesicles in the rete Malpighii, the cutis
(particularly towards the periphery of the pock) is infiltrated with these
bodies.    No sooner has the coalescence of the vesicles made such progress
as to give rise to the formation of a system of intercommunicating
sinuses, than it is seen that the whole of the deep layers of the rete Mal
pighii become inundated ("so to speak) with migratory cells, which soon
find their way towards the cavities, and convert them into microscopical
collections of pus-corpuscles, the formation of which is proved to be due
to migration from the corium, not only by the actual observation of
numerous amoeboid cells in transitu, but by the fact that the corium itself,

   Maps of the spectra of calcium, barium, and strontium have been con
structed from photographs taken by the method described in a former
communication (the third of this series).     The maps comprise the portion
of the spectrum extending from wave-length 3900 to wave-length 4500,
and are laid before the Society as a specimen of the results obtainable by
the photographic method, in the hope of securing the cooperation of other
observers.    The method of mapping is described in detail, and tables of
wave-lengths accompany the maps. The wave-lengths assigned to the
new lines must be considered only as approximations to the truth. Many
of the coincidences between lines in distinct spectra recorded by former
observers have been shown, by the photographic method, to be caused by
the presence of one substance as an impurity in the other ; but a certain
number of coincidences still remain undetermined.        The question of the
reversal of the new lines in the solar spectrum is reserved   till better pho
tographs can be obtained.

   In  many diseased conditions of the body, occasionally also in perfectly
healthy individuals and in many of the lower animals, careful investi
gation of the blood proves that, in addition to the usual elements, there
exist pale granular masses, which on closer inspection present a corpus
cular appearance ( Plate V. fig. 1 ). There are probably few observers in the
habit of examining blood who have not, at some time or other, met with
these structures, and have     been   puzzled  for an explanation    1
                                                                       of their
presence and nature.

  .  In  size they vary greatly, from      half or quarter that of   a white blood-
corpuscle, to enormous masses occupying a large area of the field or
even stretching completely across it. They usually assume a somewhat
round or oval form, but may be elongated and narrow, or, from the
existence of numerous projections, offer a very irregular outline.               They
have a compact solid look, and by focusing are seen to possess consider
able depth ; while in specimens examined without any reagents the fila
ments of fibrin adhere to them, and, entangled in their interior, white
corpuscles are not unfrequently met with.
     It is not from every mass that a judgment can be formed of their true
nature,,as the larger, more closely arranged ones have rather the appear
ance of a granular body, and it is with difficulty that the individual
elements can be focused.           When, however, the more loosely composed
ones are chosen, their intimate composition can be studied to advantage,
especially at the borders, where only a single layer of corpuscles may
exist ; and when examined with a high power (9 or 10 Hartnack) these
corpuscles are seen to be pale round disks, devoid of granules and with
well-defined contours.        Some of the corpuscles generally float free in the
fluid about the mass ;     and if they turn half over their profile view has the
appearance of a sharp dark line (fig.         5, a & 6).   In  water the individual
corpuscles composing the mass swell greatly ; dilute acetic acid renders
them more distinct, while dilute potash solutions quickly dissolve them.
Measurements give, for the large proportion of the corpuscles, a diameter
ranging from one 8000th to one 10,000th of an inch ; the largest are as
much as one 5000th, and the smallest from one 15,000th to one 24,000th
of an inch ; so that they may be said to be from                \ the size of a red
corpuscle.       In the blood of cats, rabbits, dogs, guineapigs, and rats the
masses are to be found       in variable numbers.       ATew-born rats are specially
to be recommended         as objects of study,     as in their blood the masses are
commonly both numerous and large.                They occur also in the blood of
foetal kittens.
     Considering their prevalence in disease and among some of the lower
animals, they have attracted but little notice, and possess a comparatively
scanty literature.      The late Prof. Max Schultze * was the first, as far as
I   can ascertain, to describe and figure the masses in question.         He speaks
of them as constant constituents of the blood of healthy individuals, but
concludes that we know nothing of their origin or destiny, suggesting,
however, at the same time that they may arise from the degeneration
of granular white corpuscles.           Schultze's observations were confined to
the blood of healthy persons, and he seemed of the opinion that no
pathological significance was to be attributed to them.
     By far the most systematic account is given by Dr. Riess                t, in an

article in which he records the results of a long series of observations on
their presence in various acute and chronic diseases. His investigations
of the blood of patients, which were much more extensive than any
I  have been able to undertake, show that, in all exanthems and chronic
affections of whatever sort, indeed in almost all cases attended with
disturbance of function and debility, these masses are to be found.                   He
concludes that their number is in no proportion to the severity of the
disease, and that they are more numerous in the latter stages of an
affection, after the acute symptoms have subsided.             The former of these
propositions is undoubtedly true, as       I have rarely found masses larger or
more abundant than I, at one time, obtained from my own blood when in
a condition of perfect health.        These two accounts may be said to com
prise every thing of any importance that has been written concerning these
bodies. The following observers refer to them cursorily : —Erb *, in a
paper on the development of the red corpuscles, speaks of their presence
under both healthy and diseased conditions : he had hoped, in the begin
ning of his research, that they might stand, as Zimmerman supposes (see
below), in some connexion with the origin and development of the red
corpuscles ; but, as he proceeded, the fallacy of this view became evident
to him.    Bettelheim t seems to refer to these corpuscles when he speaks
of finding in the blood of persons, healthy as well as diseased, small
punctiform, or rod-shaped, corpuscles of various sizes.                  Christol and
Kiener   J  describe in blood small round corpuscles, whose measurements
agree   with  the ones under consideration ; and they also speak of their
exhibiting slight movements.         Biess §, in a criticism on a work of the
next-mentioned     author, again refers to these masses, and reiterates his
statements concerning them.           Birsch-Hirschfeld|| had noticed them and
the similarity the corpuscles bore to micrococci, and suggests that under
 some conditions Bacteria might develop from them.                Zimmerman If has
described corpuscular elements in the blood, which, with reference to the
bodies in question, demand a notice here. He let blood flow directly into
a solution of a neutral salt, and, after the subsidence of the coloured
elements, examined the supernatant serum, in which he found, in extra
ordinary numbers, small, round, colourless corpuscles with weak contours,
to which he gave the name of

500th to one 400th of a line), and speaks of them also as occurring in
clumps and groups of globules.             It is clear, on reading his account,
that in part, at any rate, he refers to the corpuscles above described.
Gradations such as he noticed between these and the coloured ele
ments    I have never met with, and undoubtedly he was dealing with the
latter in a partially decolourized condition.            Lostorfer's * corpuscles,
which attracted such attention a few years ago from the assertion of the
discoverer that they were peculiar to the blood of syphilitic patients,
require for their production an artificial culture in the moist chamber
extending over several days. They appear first after two or three
days, or even sooner, as small bright corpuscles, partly at rest, partly in
motion, which continue to increase in size, till, by the sixth or seventh
day, they have attained the diameter of a red corpuscle, and may possess
numerous processes or contain vacuoles in their interior. Blood from
healthy individuals, as well as from diseases other than syphilis, has
been shown to yield these corpuscles ; and the general opinion at present
held of them is that they are of an albuminoid nature.
    The question at once most naturally arose, How is it possible for such
masses, some measuring even one 400th of an inch, to pass through the
capillaries, unless supposed to possess a degree of extensibility                  and
elasticity such as their composition hardly warranted attributing to
them ? Neither Max Schultze nor Eiess offer any suggestion on this
point, though the latter thinks that they might, under some conditions,
produce embolism.
    During the examination of a portion of loose connective tissue from
 the back of a young rat, in a large vein which happened to be in the
 specimen, these same corpuscles were seen, not, however, aggregated
 together, but isolated and single among the blood-corpuscles (fig. 8); and
 repeated observations demonstrated the fact that, in a drop of blood
 taken from one of these young animals, the corpuscles were always to
 be found accumulated together ; while, on the other hand, in the vessels
 (whether veins, arteries, or capillaries) of the same rat they were always
 present as separate elements, showing no tendency to adhere to one
 another.     The masses, then, are formed at the moment of the withdrawal
 of the blood, from corpuscles previously circulating free in it.
    To proceed now to the main subject of my communication.                  If a drop
 of blood containing these «iasses is mixed on a slide with an equal quan
 tity of saline solution,    |-|  per cent., or, better still, perfectly fresh serum,
 covered, surrounded with oil, and kept at a temperature of about 37° C,
 a remarkable change begins in the masses.            If one of the latter is chosen
 for observation, and its outline carefully noted, it is seen, at first, that
 the edge presents a tolerably uniform appearance, a few filaments of

making       it    difficult    to define the individual forms.               The mass has now

displayed     by the small free corpuscles at the margins, which, previously
quiescent, begin a species of jerky irregular movement, at one time with
their pale disk-surfaces uppermost, at another presenting their dark
linear profiles (fig. 5, a & b). Not unfrequently, some of these are seen
with    a larger    or smaller segment of their circumference thicker and
darker    than  the   other (fig. 5, c).
    Earliest, and perhaps the most plentiful, of the forms are those of
a spermatozoon-like shape (fig. 5, d), attached to the mass either by the
head or tail ; while, simultaneously, long bow-shaped filaments appear
(fig. 5, «), having an enlargement in the centre. Straight hair-like filaments
(fig. 5,  /)  may also be seen, but they are not very numerous.         The time
which elapses before they begin the wavy movement is very            variable, as
is also the time when they break away after once beginning it.              Fila
ments may be seen perfectly quiescent for more than half an hour before
they move, and others may be observed quite as long in motion before
they succeed in breaking away from the mass. Commonly it is in the
 smaller masses, and where the development is feeble, that filaments re
 main for any time adherent.          The spermatozoon-like forms appear, at the
 head, on one view flattened           and pale, on the other dark and linear
 (fig. 5, d) ; consequently the head is discoid, not spheroidal.       The bow-
 shaped filaments also present a dark straight aspect when they turn over
 (fig. 5, «), and are by far the longest of the forms, some measuring as
 much as one 900th of an inch. Many intermediate forms between the
round discoid corpuscles and those with long tails are met with in the
field, and are figured at fig. 5, g.
     Small rod-shaped forms are very numerous, most of which, however,
on one aspect look corpuscular ; but in others this cannot be detected, or
 only with the greatest difficulty ; slight enlargements at each end may
 also be seen occasionally in these forms (fig. 5, h).
     Usually late to appear, and more often seen in the profuse develop
 ments from large masses, are the forms with three or more tail-like pro
 cesses attached to a small central body (fig. 5, k).       Among the granules
 it is extremely difficult to determine accurately the number of these pro
 cesses, the apparent number of which may also vary in the different posi
 tions assumed by the element.            As to the ultimate destiny of the indi
 vidual   forms,  I  have not much to offer ;   I have watched single ones, with
 this view, for several consecutive hours without noticing any material
 alteration in them.       The one represented at fig. 6 was watched for four
 hours, that at fig. 7 for five, and the changes sketched.             The diffi
 culty of following up individual filaments in this way is very great, not
 only from the ensuing weariness, but from the obstacle the red corpuscles
 offer to it.
     With regard to the movement of the filaments, this, at first sight,
 bears some resemblance to that known as the Brownian, exhibited by

granules in the field, or sometimes by the red corpuscles ; but an evident
difference is soon noticed in the fact that, while the former (also the
small corpuscles) undergo a change of place, the latter remain constant
in one position or vary but little.

masses even after prolonged warming.                    A temperature of about 37° C.
is necessary for the process ; none occurs at the ordinary temperature,
with or without the addition of fluid. Fresh serum is the medium most
favourable to the process, added in quantity equal to the amount of blood.
Not every mass develops when placed under conditions apparently
favourable ; but for this no good reason can, at present, be offered.
   Fig. 8 represents the corpuscles among the red ones while in the
vessel  ;  and, as is there seen, they appear somewhat more elliptical on the
profile view, and more elongated, than in blood after withdrawal, but
present the same disk-like surfaces when they roll over.                       On adding
saline solution        or serum, and warming the preparation, development
proceeds,     but  not   to such an extent as from the masses.             The individual
corpuscles become elongated, some tailed, and they move about in the
vessel.     At fig.    9 they are seen      in the    vessel after three hours on the
warm stage : the remarkable form seen                     at a was one 1300th of an.
inch in length, and had moved up from the opposite end of the vessel.
   It must still be confessed, with Max Schultze, that we know nothing
of the origin or destiny of these corpuscles ; and once admit their exist
ence as individual elements circulating in the blood, his suggestion,
and Riess's assertion that the masses arise from the disintegration of
white     corpuscles, becomes quite untenable.               We must also confess the
same ignorance of the reasons of their increase in disease ; nor do we
know at all what influence they may exert in the course of chronic
affections.
   Finally, as there is no evidence that these bodies are in organic con
tinuity with any other recognized animal or vegetable form, or possess
the power of reproduction, nothing can at present be said of their nature
or of their relation to Bacteria.
   These observations were carried on in the Physiological Laboratory of
University College, and my thanks are due to Prof. Sanderson and Mr.
Schafer for advice and valuable assistance.

            Communicated                      by   A. W. Hofmann, LL.D., F.R.S.                                  Received
            May 11, 1874.
   The sap of the cambium of coniferous trees contains  beautiful crystal                         a
line glucoside, coniferine, which was discovered by Hartig and examined
some years ago by                      Kubel, who arrived at the formula
                                                    CalHslOla+             3aq.
A   minute study of this compound leads us to represent                                                     the molecule
of coniferine by the expression
                                                    C„HaO,             +   2aqI
the percentages of which nearly coincide with the theoretical                                                    values of
Kubel's formula.
    Submitted to fermentation with emulsine, coniferine   splits into sugar
and   asplendid compound,    crystallizing in prisms  which   fuse at 73°.
This body    easily soluble in ether, less so in alcohol, almost insoluble
                        is

                    ;         represented by the formula
                                                   is

    The change                is   represented by the equation
                              C„   H„     O,   + H2      O   =    C,   HM

    Under the influence of oxidizing  agents the product of fermentation
undergoes    remarkable a metamorphosis.   On boiling   with mixture of                          it         a
potassium bichromate and sulphuric acid, there passes with the vapour
of water, in the first place ethylic aldehyde, and subsequently an acid
compound soluble in water, from which      may be removed     ether. Onit                                   by
evaporating the ethereal  solution, crystals  in stellar groups are left
behind, which fuse at 81°.                              These crystals             have the taste and odour of
vanilla. An accurate comparative examination                                         has proved them to be iden-

tical with the crystalline substance which constitutes the aroma of vanilla,
and which is often seen covering the surface of vanilla-rods.
   On analysis, the crystals we obtained were found to contain
                                    C8H903.
This is exactly the composition which recent researches of Carles have
established for the aromatic principle of vanilla.      The transformation of
the crystalline product of fermentation into vanilline is represented by
the following equation    : —
                    C10Hia03 +    0 = CaH40 + C8H80,
   To remove all doubt regarding the identity of artificial vanilline with
the natural compound, we have transformed the former into a series of
 salts which have the general formula
                                   C^MO,,
and into two substitution-products,
                                  C.H.BrO,
and
                                   C8H7IO„
both of which had previously      been prepared  by Carles from the natural
compound.
   In   order further to elucidate the nature of vanilline, we have submitted
this body to fusion with alkali.       The product of this action is a well-
known acid discovered by Strecker, and described by him as proto
catechuic acid,
which is thus formed —
                  C8H,0, + 40 = C7H804 + H,0 + CO,.
   We have identified       this substance by analysis,   by the study   of its
reactions, and also by transforming it into pyrocatechine, C, H0     02,
                         C7H,04 =     0,H,0,   +  C0>.
   The transformation into protocatechuic acid fixes the constitution of
vanilline.     This compound is the methylated aldehyde of protocatechuic
acid  ;  its composition referred to benzol is represented by the formula
                                       yOCH,
                                 C,H,fOH

   Indeed, submitted under pressure to the action of hydrochloric acid,
vanilline splits into chloride of methyl and protocatechuic aldehyde,

   A  corresponding uction takes place with hydriodic acid ; but in this
case  the aldehyde is destroyed.
   An additional proof of the correctness of our view regarding the con
stitution of vanilline is obtained by treating this substance with acetic
anhydride and benzoyl chloride.
   The action does not go beyond the formation of the compounds
                                    /OCH,

showing    that  vanilline  does not contain   more  than  one hydroxylic
group.
   The constitution of vanilline being thus made out, there could be no
doubt regarding the structure of the product of fermentation from which
vanilline arises. This compound is the ethylic ether of vanilline,
                                    /OCH.
                              C.H,<-OC,H,
                                    \COH.
   That such is the constitution of the body is proved by the simultaneous
formation of ethylic aldehyde when vanilline is formed.      We obtained,
however, an additional confirmation of this conception by submitting the
product of fermentation to the action of hydriodic acid under pressure,
when an alcohol iodide was formed, which we succeeded in separating
into the iodides of methyl and ethyl,
           . /OCH,                                             /OH

   The experiments we have described in this note were performed in the
laboratory of Professor A. W. Hofmann, to whom we are deeply indebted
for the advice and assistance he has given us in the course of these
researches.

           sation    at, a Surface."   By Prof. Osborne Reynolds, of
           Owens College, Manchester. Communicated                  by B.   Stewart,
           F.R.S. Received May 16, 1874.
      It
     has been noticed by several philosophers, and particularly by Mr.
Crookes, that, under certain circumstances, hot bodies appear to repel and
cold ones to attract other bodies. It is my object in this paper to point
out, and to describe experiments to prove, that these effects are the
results of evaporation and condensation, and that they are valuable
evidence of the truth of the kinetic theory of gas, viz. that gas consists
of separate molecules moving at great velocities.
   The experiments of which the explanation                 will   be   given were as
follows      :   —
   A light stem of glass, with pith-balls on its ends, was suspended by a
silk thread in a glass flask, so that the balls were nearly at the same
level.  Some water was then put in the flask and boiled until all the air
was driven out of the flask, which was then corked and allowed                to cool.
When cold there was          a   partial vacuum in   it,   the gauge showing from
\   to|     of an inch pressure.
      It   was now found that when the flame of    lamp was brought near
                                                       a
to the flask, the pith-ball which was nearest the flame was driven away,
and that with a piece of ice the pith was attracted.
   This experiment was repeated under        variety of circumstances, in
                                                a
different flasks and with different balances, the stem being sometimes of
glass and sometimes of platinum     the results, however, were the same in
                                       ;
all   cases, except such variations    as
                                        I    am about to describe.
  The pith-balls were more sensitive to the heat and cold when the flask
was cold and the tension within      low but the effect was perceptible
                                        it      ;
until the gauge showed about an inch, and even after that the ice would
attract the ball.
   The reason why the repulsion from heat was not apparent at greater
tensions, was clearly due to the convection-currents which the heat gene
rated within the flask.  When there was enough vapour, these currents
carried the pith with them they were, in fact, then sufficient to over
                                  ;
come the forces which otherwise moved the pith.       This was shown by
the fact that when the bar was not quite level, so that one ball was
higher than the other, the currents affected them in different degrees               ;
also that     different effect "could be produced by raising or lowering the
                 a
position   of the flame.
   The condition of the pith also perceptibly affected the sensitiveness of
the balls.    When      piece of ice was placed against the side of the glass,
                         a
the nearest of the pith-balls would be drawn towards the ice, and would
eventually stop opposite to it.       If allowed to remain in this condition
for some time, the vapour would condense on the ball near the ice,

402               Prof. O. Reynolds on Surface-Forces                  [June  18,
while the other ball would        become    dry (this would be seen to be the
case, and was also shown, by the tipping of the balance, that ball against
the ice gradually getting lower). It was then found, when the ice was
removed, that the dry ball was insensible to the heat, or nearly so, while
that ball which had been opposite to the ice was more than ordinarily
sensitive.
   If  the flask were dry and the tension of the vapour reduced with the
pump until the gauge showed        |  of an inch, then, although purely steam,
the vapour was not in a saturated condition, and the pith-balls which
were dry were no longer sensitive to the lamp, although they would still
approach the ice.
   From these last two facts it appears         as though a certain   amount of
moisture on the balls was necessary to render them sensitive to the heat.
   In order that these results might be obtained, it was necessary that
the vapour should be free from air.             I£ a small quantity of air was
present, although    not  enough   to  appear  in the gauge, the effects rapidly
diminished, particularly that of the ice, until the convection-currents      had
it all their own way. This agrees with the fact that the presence of a
small quantity of air in steam greatly retards condensation and even
evaporation.
   With    a dry flask and an air-vacuum,         neither the lamp nor the ice
produced    their effects  ; the  convection-currents    reigned supreme even
when the gauge was as low as \ inch.             Under these circumstances the
lamp generally attracted the balls and the ice repelled them, t. e. the
currents carried them towards the lamp and from the ice ; but, by placing
the lamp or ice very low, the reverse effects could be obtained, which
goes to prove that they were the effects of the currents of air.
   These experiments appear to show that evaporation from a surface is
attended with a force tending to drive the surface back, and condensa
tion with a force tending to draw the surface forward.             These effects
admit of explanation, although        not quite as simply as may at first sight
appear.
   It  seems easy to conceive    that when vapour is driven off from a body
there must be a certain reaction or recoil on the part of the body ; Hero's
engine acts on this principle.         If a sheet of damp paper be held before
the fire, from that side which is opposite to the fire a stream of vapour
will be drawn off towards the fire with a perceptible velocity ; and there
fore we can readily conceive that there must be a corresponding reaction,
and that the paper will be forced back with a force equal to that which
urges the vapour forwards.        And, in a similar way, whenever condensa
tion goes on at a surface it must diminish the pressure at the surface,
and thus draw the surface forwards.
   It is not, however, wholly, or even chiefly, such visible motions as these
that afford an explanation of the phenomena just described.          If the only
forces were those which result from the perceptible          motion, they would

be insensible,  except when the heat on the surface was sufficiently
intense to drive the vapour off with considerable velocity. This, indeed,
might be the case if vapour had no particles and was, what it appears to
be, a homogeneous          elastic medium, and         if,
                                                   in changing from liquid into
gas, the expansion took place gradually, so that the only velocity acquired
by the vapour was that necessary to allow its replacing that which                              it
forces before    and giving place to that which follows.
                 it
   But, although      appears to have escaped notice so far,
                      it                                           follows, as
                                                                            it                  a
direct consequence of the kinetic theory of gases, that, whenever evapo
ration takes place from the surface of a solid body or a liquid,           must           it
be attended with      reactionary force equivalent to an increase of pressure
                       a
on the surface, which force             quite independent of the perceptible
                                               is
motion of the vapour. Also, condensation must be attended with             force          a
equivalent to    diminution
                 a             of  the gaseous pressure over the condensing
surface, and likewise independent of the visible motion of the vapour.
This may be shown to be the case as follows —                :
   According to the kinetic theory, the molecules which constitute the
gas are in rapid motion, and the pressure which the gas exerts against

 that exerted on the molecule, just as in a gun the pressure of the powder
on the breech     is   the same as on the shot.
   The impulse on the surface from                  each     molecule which      is    driven off
by evaporation must therefore be equal to that caused                           by   the rebound
of one of the reflected molecules, supposing all the molecules to be of
the same size   that
                 ;     to say, since the force of rebound will be equal to
                            is
that of stopping, the impulse from a particle driven off by evaporation
will   behalf the impulse received from the stopping and reflection of                           a
particle of the gas.   Thus the effect of evaporation will be to increase
the number of impulses on the surface        and although each of the new

to the pressure.
   In the same way, whenever        molecule of gas comes up to

thus condensed into    molecule of liquid, the impulse which

Hence condensation will reduce the magnitude of some of the impulses,
and therefore will reduce the pressure on the condensing surface.
   For instance, if there were two surfaces in the same vapour, one of
which was dry and the other evaporating, then the pressure would
be greater on the moist surface than on that which was dry.                   And,
again, if one of the surfaces was dry and the other condensing, then
the pressure would be greater on the dry surface than on that which
was condensing.     Hence, if the opposite sides of a pith-ball in vapour were
in such different conditions, the ball would be forced towards the colder
side.
   These effects may be expressed more definitely as follows : —
   Let v be the velocity with which the molecules of the vapour move,
         p the pressure on a unit of surface,
         d the weight of a unit of volume of the vapour,
         w the weight of liquid evaporated or condensed in a second ;

   Thus we have an expression for the force in terms of the quantity of
water evaporated and the ratio of the pressure to the density of the
vapour; and if the heat necessary to evaporate the liquid (the latent
heat) is known, we can find the force which would result from a given
expenditure of heat.
   Applying these results to steam, we find that, at a temperature of 60°,
the evaporation of 1 lb. of water from a surface would be sufficient to
maintain a force of 65 lbs. for one second.
   It is also important to notice that this force will be proportional to the
square root of the absolute temperature, and, consequently, will be
approximately constant between temperatures of 32° and 212°.
   If we take mercury instead of water, we find that the force is only
6 lbs. instead of 65 lbs. ; but the latent heat of mercury is only -fa that of
water, so that the same expenditure of heat would maintain nearly three
times as great a force.
   It  seems, therefore, that  in this way we can give         a satisfactory  ex-

planation of the experiments previously described.         When the radiated
heat from the lamp falls on the pith, its temperature will rise, and any
moisture on it will begin to evaporate and to drive the pith from the
lamp.    The evaporation will be greatest on that ball which is nearest to
the lamp ; therefore this ball will be driven away until the force on the
other becomes equal, after which the balls will come to rest, unless
momentum carries them further.           On the other hand, when a piece of
ice is brought near, the temperature of the pith will be reduced, and it
will condense the vapour and be drawn towards the ice.
   It seems to me that the same explanation may be given of Mr. Crookes's
experiments    ;  for, although my experiments were made on water and at
comparatively high pressures, they were in reality undertaken to verify
the explanation as     I  have given it.  I used water in the hope of finding
(as  I have found) that, in a condensable vapour, the results could be
obtained with a greater density of vapour (that is to say, with a much less
perfect vacuum), the effect being a consequence of the saturated condition
of the vapour rather than of the perfection of the vacuum.
   Mr. Crookes only obtained his results when his vacuum was nearly as
perfect as the Sprengel pump would make it. Up to this point he hatl
nothing but the inverse effects, viz. attraction with heat and repulsion
with cold. About the cause of these he seems to be doubtful ; but            I
venture to think that they may be entirely explained by the expansion of
the surrounding gas or vapour, and the consequent convection-currents.
It must be remembered that whenever the air about a ball is expanded,
and thus rendered lighter by heat, it will exercise less supporting or
floating power on the ball, which will therefore tend to sink.       This ten
dency   will be  in opposition to the lifting of the ascending current, and it
will depend on the shape and thickness of the ball whether it will rise
or fall when in an ascending current of heated gas.
   The reason why Mr. Crookes did not obtain the same results with a
less perfect vacuum was because he had then too large a proportion of
air, or non-condensing gas, mixed with the vapour, which also was not in
a state of saturation.       In his experiments the condensable vapour was
that of mercury, or something which required a still higher temperature,
and it was necessary that the vacuum should be very perfect for such
vapour to be any thing like pure and in a saturated condition.       As soon,
however, as this state of perfection was reached, then the effects were
more apparent than in the corresponding case of water.            This agrees
well with the explanation ; for, as previously shown, the effect of mercury
would, for the same quantity of heat, be three times as great as that of
water ; and, besides this, the perfect state of the vacuum would allow
the pith (or whatever the ball might be) to move much more freely than
when   in the vapour of water at     a considerable tension.
    Of course this reasoning is not confined to mercury and water ; any
 gas which is condensed or absorbed by the balls when cold in greater

406                Prof. O. Reynolds on Surface-Forces             [June    18,
quantities   than when warm would        give the same results ; and, as this
property appears to belong to all gases, it is only a question of bringing
the vacuum to the right degree of tension.
    There was one fact connected with      Mr. Crookes's experiments which,
independently of the previous considerations, led me to the conclusion
that the result was due to the heating of the pith, and was not a direct
result of the radiated heat.
    In  one of the experiments exhibited at the Soiree of the   Eoyal Society,
a candle was placed close to a flask containing a bar of pith suspended
from the middle : at first, the only thing to notice was that the pith was
oscillating considerably under the action of the candle ; each end of the
bar alternately approached and receded, showing that the candle exercised
an influence similar to that which might have been exercised by the torsion
of the thread had this been stiff.         After  a few minutes' observation,
however, it became evident that the oscillations, instead of gradually
diminishing, as one naturally expected them to do, continued ; and, more
than this, they actually increased, until one end of the bar passed the light,
after which it seemed quieter for a little, though the oscillations again
increased until it again passed the light.       As a great many people and
 lights were moving    about,  it seemed  possible that this might be due to
external disturbance, and so its full importance did not strike me.
Afterwards, however,      I  saw that it was only to be explained on the
ground    of the force being   connected with the temperature of the pith.
During part of its swing one end of the pith must be increasing in tem
perature, and during the other part it must be cooling.       And it is easily
seenthatthe ends will not be hottest when nearest the light, or coldest when
furthest away ; they will acquire heat for some time after they have begun
to recede, and lose it after they have begun to approach.        There will, in
fact, be a certain lagging in the effect of the heat on the pith, like that
which is apparent in the action of the sun on a comet, which causes the
 comet to be grandest after it has passed its perihelion.     From this cause
it is easy to see that the mean temperature of the ends will be greater
 during the time they are retiring than while approaching, and hence the
 driving force on that end which is leaving will, on the whole, more than
 balance the retarding force on that which is approaching ; and the result
 will be an acceleration, so that the bar will swing further each time until
 it passes the candle, after which the hot side of the bar will be opposite
 to the light, and will for a time tend to counteract its effect, so that the
 bar will for a time be quieter.      This fact is independent evidence as to
 the nature of the force ; and although it does not show it to be evapora
 tion, it shows that it is a force depending on the temperature of the pith,
 and that it is not a direct result of radiation from the candle.
     Since writing the above paper, it has occurred to me that, according to
 the kinetic theory, a somewhat similar effect to that of evaporation must
 result whenever heat is communicated from a hot surface to gas.

    The particles which impinge on the surface will rebound with                  a greater
velocity     than    that   with  which   they approached ;       and    consequently the
effect of the blow must be greater than it would have been had the surface
been of the same temperature as the gas.
     And, in the same way, whenever heat is communicated from a gas to a
surface, the force on the surface will be less than it otherwise would be,
for the particles will rebound with a less velocity than that at which they
approach.

 particles will come up td the hot surface, which is very slow when
 it depends only on the diffusion of the particles of the gas inter se and
 the diffusion of the heat amongst them.
     It will   be much increased by convection-currents ; but these will (as
 has been      already explained), to a certain extent, produce an opposite
 effect.     It would also seem that this action cannot have had much to do
 with    Mr. Crookes's experiments,         as one can      hardly conceive that much
 heat could be communicated to the gas or vapour in such a perfect
 vacuum as that he obtained, unless, indeed, the rate of diffusion varies
 inversely as the density of a gas*.              It will be interesting, however, to
  see what light experiments will throw on the question.

  the  amount    of  heat communicated from a surface to a gas would be independent
  of the density of the gas, and hence the force    /  would be independent of the density ;
  that is to say, this force would remain constant as the vacuum improved, while the
  convection-currents    and counteracting forces would gradually diminish.         It seems
  probable, therefore, that Mr. Crookes's results are, at least in part, due to this force.

    After an historical      review of the investigations and theoretical views
relating to the results produced upon the explosion of gunpowder, which
have been published during the last 150 years, the authors proceed to
describe the chief objects contemplated by their researches, which are in
continuation       of  some   commenced by Captain Noble in 1863,              and    de
scribed in a lecture delivered at the Royal Institution in 1871.
    These objects were as follow : —
    First. To ascertain the products         of combustion of gunpowder, fired
under circumstances similar to those which exist when it is exploded in
guns or mines.
    Second. To ascertain the tension of the products of combustion               at the
moment of explosion, and to determine the law according to which the
tension varies with the gravimetric density of the powder.
    Third. To ascertain whether any, and, if so, what well-defined variation
in the nature or proportions of the products accompanies a change in the
density or size of grains of the powder.
    Fourth. To determine whether any, and,         if so, what influence    is exerted
on the nature of the metamorphosis by the pressure under which the gun
powder is fired.
    Fifth. To determine the volume of permanent               gas liberated     by the
explosion.
    Sixth. To compare the explosion of gunpowder fired in a close
vessel with that of similar gunpowder when fired in the bore of a gun.
    Seventh. To determine the heat generated by the combustion of gun
powder, and thenoa\ to deduce the temperature at the instant of ex
plosion.
    Eighth. To determine the work which gunpowder is capable of per
forming on a shot in the bore of a gun, and thence to ascertain the total
theoretical work, if the bore be supposed of indefinite length.
    The several methods of experiment adopted by the authors, and the
most important apparatus employed in their researches, are next described
in detail.       The experimental operations include : — 1 . Measurement of
pressure developed ; 2. Measurement of volume of permanent gases ;
3. Measurement of heat developed ; 4. Collection of gases ; 5. Collection
of solids ; 6. Analysis of the gaseous and solid products.

        The quantities of gunpow der exploded in the several operations ranged
     from 750 grammes to 100 grammes.                   The following is a description of
    the apparatus in which the charges were exploded : —
        The apparatus consisted of a mild steel vessel, of great strength, care
    fully tempered in oil, in the chamber of which the charge to be exploded
    was placed.       The main orifice of the chamber was closed by a screwed
    plug, called the firing-plug, fitted and ground into its place with great
    exactness;
        In   the firing-plug itself was a conical hole, stopped by a plug, also
    ground into its place with great accuracy, and, for purposes of insulation,
    covered with the finest tissue-paper.                Two wires (one in the insulated
    cone,    the other in the plug) were inserted, and joined by a very fine
    platinum wire passing through a small glass tube filled with mea'ed
    powder.        By completing connexion with a Daniell's battery, the charge
    could be fired.
        There were two other apertures in the chamber — one communicating
    with the arrangement for letting the gases escape, the other containing
    the crusher-apparatus         for determining         the tension      at the moment of
    explosion.
        The pressures       actually   observed with the apparatus               just described
                                                                                 2 i  2

varied from over 36 tons on the square inch to about      1   ton on   the square
inch.
   The dangerous nature of the operations of explosion, carried out on so
considerable a scale as in these investigations, rendered great precautions
necessary. Unless the explosion-cylinder was most perfectly closed, the
violent escape of gas resulted in its immediately cutting way out for itself,

destroying the arrangement for closing the apparatus.
   Special observations' were made to ascertain how long a period elapsed
after explosion before the non-gaseous products assumed the solid form.
They appeared to do this little within two minutes after explosion, when
                             a
a charge nearly filling the vessel was used.
  The method employed for collecting the gaseous products as soon as
possible after the explosion presented no special feature of novelty. On
opening the explosion-vessel after the gases had been allowed to escape,
the solid products were found collected at the bottom, there being gene
rally an exceedingly thin (in fact, with large charges, quite an inappreciable)
deposit on the sides. The surface of the deposit was generally perfectly
smooth and of    very dark grey, almost black, colour.
                 a                                      This colour, how
ever, was only superficial, and through the black could be perceived what
was probably the real colour of the surface, dark olive-green.

face of the deposit, and the sides of the cylinders, had  asomewhat greasy           .
appearance, and were indeed greasy to the touch.      On the smooth surface
                                                                                     '
were frequently observed very minute particles, in appearance like soot,
but of the greasy texture to which allusion has been made.
   The removal of the deposit was generally attended with great difficulty,
as   formed an exceedingly hard and compact mass, which always had to*
    it
be cut out with steel chisels. Lumps would frequently break off, but            a
considerable portion flew off before the chisel in fine dust.  In various
experiments, on examining the fraeture as exhibited by the lumps, the
variation in physical appearance was very striking, there being marked
differences in colour, and also, frequently,  marked absence of homo
                                                a
geneity, patches of different colours being interspersed with the more
uniform shade of the fracture. There was no appearance of general crys
talline structure in the deposit but, on examination with
                                 ;                          microscope,

and sometimes with the naked eye, shining crystals of metallic lustre
(sulphide of iron) were observed.  On the whole, the general appearance              ,
of the deposit was attended with such considerable variations, that, for
minute details, reference must be made to the account of the experiments
themselves.    The deposit always smelt powerfully of sulphuretted             hy
drogen, and, frequently, strongly of ammonia. It was always exceedingly
deliquescent, and after  ashort exposure to the air became black on the
surface, gradually passing over into an inky-looking pasty mass.   As          in
physical appearance, so in behaviour, when removed from the cylinder,
there were considerable differences between the experiments.     The de
posit was transferred to thoroughly dried and warm bottles, and sealed

up as rapidly as possible.   In most cases, during the very short time that
elapsed while the transference was being made, no apparent change took
place ; but, in some, a great tendency to development of heat was appa
rent ; and in one instance, in which a portion of the deposit (exhibiting
this tendency in a high degree) was kept exposed to the action of the air,
the rise of temperature was so great that the paper on which it was
placed became charred, and the deposit itself changed colour with great
rapidity, becoming a bright orange-yellow on the surface.
   This tendency to heat always disappeared when the deposit was con
fined in a bottle and fresh access of air excluded.
   The methods employed in the analysis of the gaseous and solid products
of explosion differed only in a few respects from those adopted by
Bunsen and Schischkoff in their investigation of the products of explosion
of powder.
   As regards the proportions of total solid and gaseous products fur
nished by the several powders, remarkable uniformity was exhibited         by
the results of explosion of the same powder at different pressures, and    no
very considerable difference existed between the proportions furnished     by
the three powders chiefly used in the researches.      The largest grain,  or
pebble powder, yielded most gas ; the quantity furnished by E. L. G.
powder was not greatly inferior, but was decidedly more considerable
than that yielded by the smallest powder (F. G.).
   The composition of the gas furnished by the explosion of all the Eng
lish powders was throughout remarkably uniform, but presented certain
apparently   well-defined small variations, regulated by the pressure under
which the products were developed, the chief being a steady increase in
the proportion of carbonic anhydride, and decrease in that of carbonic
oxide, in proportion as the pressure was increased.       The composition of
the solid products exhibited much greater variations, chiefly in regard to
the state of combination in which the sulphur existed.      These variations
were exhibited not merely by the products obtained from the different
powders, but also, and to as great an extent, by those which one and the
same powder furnished at different pressures, and apparently without
reference to the pressure, excepting in the case of the very lowest
                                 cent, of the total space in the chamber).

   The authors institute a comparison between the composition of the
products of explosion obtained in their experiments and the analytical
results published by Bunsen and Schischkoff and other recent experi
menters, and proceed to a critical examination of the methods pursued by
these for obtaining the products of the composition of gunpowder, giving
reasons why the results which those methods of operation have furnished
cannot be accepted as representing the changes which powder undergoes
when exploded in a closed space.
   The authors further proceed : — It is evident that the reactions which
occur among the powder-constituents,       in addition to those which result

form as regai us the pi opor ions which it bears to the solid), from powders
not, d.ffering widely m (.oiistituaoii from each other, are susceptible of
very considerable variations, regarding the causes of which it appears only
possible to form conjectures.             Any attempt to express, even in a com
paratively complicated chemical equation, the nature of the metamor
phosis which a gunpowder of average composition may be cons.dered to
undergo when exploded in a comined space would therefore only be
calculated to convey an erroneous impress. on as to the simplicity, or the
definite nature, of the chemical resul's and their uniformity under dif
ferent conditions, while it would, in reality, possess no important bearing
upon the elucidation of the theory of explosion of gunpowder.
    The extensive experiments which the Committee on Explosive Sub
 stances has instituted, with English and foreign gunpowders of very various
 composition, have conclusively demonstrated that the influence exerted
upon the action of fired gunpow der by i omparath ely very considerable
variations in the constitution of the powder (except in the ease of small
charges applied in firearms) is often very small as compared with (or
even more than counterbalanced by) the modifying effects of variations in
the mechanical and physical* properties of the powder (t. e. in its density,
hardness, the size and form of the grains or individual masses, &c.).
Hence it is not surprising to find that a fine-grain gunpowder, which
differs much more in mechanical than in chemical points from the larger
powder (it. L. G.) used in these experiments, should present decided dif
ferences, not only in regard to the pressures which it develops under
 similar conditions, but also as regards the proportions and uniformity of
the products which its explosion furnishes.                 On the other hand, the dif
ferences in regard to size of individual masses, and other mechanical pe
 culiarities, between the li. L. Or. and pebble powders are, comparatively,
not so considerable, and are in directions much less likely to affect the
results obtained by explosions in perfectly closed spaces.
    Again, the analysis of solid residues furnished bv various kinds of gun
 powder, which presented marked dissimilarity in composition, did not esta
blish points of difference which could be traced to any influence exerted
by such variations        ; indeed the proportions of the several products com
posing residues which were furnished by one and the same powder, in
    * Tbe desirability   of applying these means to effecting modifications in the action of
fired gunpowder was pointed out by Colonel (row Gmenl) Boxer in a memorandum
submitted to the War Office in !8."¦9; and the first Government Committee on Gunpowder,
soon afterwards appointed (of which General Bo^cr and Mr. Abel were members , ob
tained successful results, which were reported officially in 18, A, by limiting ti e altera
tions in the manufacture of gunpow der intended for use in heavy guns to modifications
in the form, size, density, and hardness of the indivjdu il grains or masses, the composition
 of the powder remaining una'tercd.        The Committee on Explosive Substances lave
 adhered to this system iu producing gunpowder suitable for the largest Ordnance ol the
present day.

distinct experiments     made at varied pressures, differed, in several in
stances, quite as greatly as those found in some of the residues of powders
which presented decided differences in composition.
   Although, for the reasons already given, the authors cannot attempt
to offer any thing approaching a precise expression of the chemical
changes which gunpowder of average composition undergoes when ex
ploded in a conlined space, they feel warranted, by the results of their
experiments, in stating, with confidence, that the chemical theory of the
decomposition of gunpowder, as based upon the results of Bunsen and
Schischkoff and accepted in recent text-books, is certainly as far from
correctly representing the general metamorphosis of gunpowder as was
the old and long-accepted theory, according to which the primary products
were simply potassium sulphide, carbonic anhydride, and nitrogen.
Moreover,   the following broad facts regarding the products furnished by
the explosion of gunpowder appear to them to have been established by
the analytical results arrived at.
   1. The proportion of carbonic oxide produced in the explosion of a gun
powder in which the saltpetre and charcoal exist in proportions calculated,
according to the old theory, to produce carbonic anhydride only is much
more considerable than hitherto accepted.
   2. The amount     of potassium carbonate formed, under all conditions
(as regards  nature  of  the gunpowder and pressure under which it is ex
ploded), is very much larger than has hitherto been considered to be pro
duced, according to the results of Bunsen and Schischkoff and more recent
experimenters.
   3. The potassium sulphate is very much smaller in amount than found
by Bunsen and Schischkoff , Linck, and Karolyi, even in the highest results
obtained in the authors' experiments.
   4. Potassium sulphide is never present    in very considerable amount,
though, generally, in much larger proportion than found by Bunsen and
(Schischkoff ; and there appears to be strong reason for believing that, in
most instances, it exists in larye amount as & primary result of the explo
sion of gunpowder.
   5. Potassium hyposulphite is an important product of the decomposi
tion of gunpowder in closed spaces, though very variable in amount.         It
appears probable (the reasons being fully discussed in the paper) that its
production is in some measure subservient to that of the sulphide; and it
may perhaps be regarded as representing, at any rate to a considerable
extent, that substance in powder-residue — i. e. as having resulted, partially
and to a variable extent, from the oxidation, by liberated oxygen, of sul-
phi le which has been formed in the first instance.
   6. The proportion    of sulphur which does not enter into the primary
reaction  on the explosion of powder is very variable, being in some
instances high, w hile, in apparently exceptional results, the whole amount
of sulphur contained in the powder becomes         involved  in the metamor

414                    Capt. Noble and    Mr. F. A. Abel             [June    18,
phosis.      In  the case of pebble powder, the mechanical condition (size and
regularity    of grain) of which is perhaps more favourable to uniformity of
decomposition, under varied conditions as regards pressure, than that of
the smaller powders, the amount of sulphur which remains as potassium
polysulphide is very uniform, except in the products obtained at the lowest
pressure ; and it is noteworthy that with E. L. G. powder, under the
 same conditions, comparatively little sulphur escapes ; while in the case of
 F. G. powder, under corresponding circumstances, there is no free sulphur
at all.
     7. But little   can be said  with regard to those products, gaseous and
 solid, which, though almost always occurring in small quantities in the
 products, and though apparently, in some instances, obeying certain rules
 with respect to the proportion in which they are formed, cannot be
 regarded as important results of the explosion of powder. It may, how
 ever, be remarked that the regular formation of such substances as
 potassium      sulphocyanate   and ammonium     carbonate, the regular escape
 of hydrogen and sulphydric acid from oxidation, while oxygen is occa
 sionally coexistent, and the frequent occurrence of appreciable proportions
 of potassium nitrate, indicate a complexity as well as an incompleteness
 in the metamorphosis.        Such complexity and incompleteness are, on the
 one hand, a natural result of the great abruptness as well as of the com
 parative difficulty with which the reactions between the ingredients of
 the mechanical mixture take place ; on the other hand, they favour the
 view that, even during the exceedingly brief period within which
  chemical activity continues, other changes may occur (in addition to the
  most simple, which follow immediately upon the ignition of the powder)
  when    explosions take place at pressures such as are developed under
  practical conditions.
      The tendency to incompleteness of metamorphosis,          and also to the
  development of secondary reactions, under favourable conditions, appears
  to be fairly demonstrated by the results obtained in exploding the different
  powders in spaces ten times that which the charges occupied (Experi
  ments 8, 1, and 16). It appears, however, that, even under conditions
  apparently the most favourable to uniformity of metamorphosis (namely,
  in explosions produced under high pressures), accidental circumstances
  may operate detrimentally to the simplicity and completeness of the
  reactions.      But the fact, indisputably demonstrated in the course of
   these researches, that such accidental variations in the nature of the
  changes resulting from the explosion do not, even when very consider
  able, affect the force exerted by fired gunpowder, as demonstrated by the
  recorded pressures, &c., indicates that a minute examination into the
  nature of the products of explosion of powder does not necessarily con
  tribute, directly, to a comprehension of the causes which may operate in
  modifying the action of fired gunpowder.

    The detenninuion of tlie heat developed by the explosiou was also
made the subject of careful direct experiment, and, from the mean cf
several closely concordant results, it was found that the combustion of a
gramme of the powders experimented with generated about 705 gramme-
units of heat.            Bunsen and Schischkoff's assumption, that the specific
heats of the solid products remain invariable over the great range of
temperature through which they pass, is considered by the authors
untenable ; they have, however, deduced the temperature (about 3S00° C.)
 upon this hypothesis, both to facilitate comparison of their results with
 those of Bunsen and Sehischkolf, aud to give a high limit, to which the
 temperature of explosion can certainly not attain.
    The      volume     of solid products obtained from                  a gramme of powder                  is
 fixed by the authors at             about    -3  cub.  cent,    at   ordinary temperatures.
    A comparison is next instituted of the pressures actually observed                                       to
 exist in a close vessel with that calculated upon the assumption that,                                      at
 the moment of explosion, about 57 per cent, by weight of the products                                       of
                                                             cent,    in  the    form      of

 ducts of combustion may be expressed by the following equation,

     The authors consider that the accordance of this comparison with
 observed results fully establishes the accuracy of their views.
     The data furnished by the foregoing enable the authors to determine
 theoretically the temperature of explosion of gunpowder, which they find
 to be about 22i»0° C. The correctness of this theoretical es imate they
 confirm by experimental observations on the behaviour of platinum when
 exposed to the temperature of explosion.                         In all instances thin platinum
 wire or foil showed signs of fusion, but actual fusion took place only in
 one instance.
     'lhe   mean spicific heat of the non-gaseous products and                   their probable    expan
 sion between U° C. and the temperature of explosion are next discussed.
      The means of obtaining the tensions of the products of explosion in
  the bores of ordnance, and the results obtained in this direction by the
  Committee on Explosives, are then examined, as far as regards the
  particular powders with which the authors have experimented.
      The correctness of the view propounded by Robins, that the work
  obtainable from gunpowder is not importantly increased by increments
  to the weight of the shot, is confirmed by the authors, and the influence
  upon the tension of tired gunpowder exerted by the existence of water in
  ponder is illustrated.
      The extent of communication of heat to the envelope (or gun) in which
  the powder is exploded is next considered, and experiments and calcu
  lations are given to show that such communication of heat varies from
  about 35 per cent, of the total heat generated m the case of a small
  nrm to about 3 per cent, in the case of an 18-tou gun.
      A comparison is instituted between the pressures actually found to
  exist in the bores of guns and those which would follow from the facts
  established by these researches.                      It is pointed out, on the one hand,
   that the assumption,               that    all  the     products of combustion are in the
   gaseous state, is irreconcilable with the pressures actually obse.ved; and,
   on the other hand, Buus.m and Schischkoff s hypothesis that the work on
   the projectile        is accomplished only by the permanent gases, without
   addition or subtraction of heat, is shown to be equally irreconcilable with

experimental observations.           When, however, the heat stored up in the
solid residue is taken into account, it is found that calculation ami
experimental observation accord with great exactness ; and the authors
express the relation between the tension of the products in the bore of *
gun and the volume they occupy by the equation
                     Wi {!&=!!)          }*+*                                        (30).
    The temperature of the products of explosion during their expansion
in the bore of a gun is then given, and the maximum work that can be
realized from powder for any given expansion, as also the                 total   theoretic
work of powder, are given.
    The principal results of the authors' investigations are summarized as
follows, and for convenience are computed upon one gramme of powder,
occupying      1 cub. cent.  : —
    (a) First, with regard to powder fired in a close vessel.
    1. On explosion, the products of combustion consist of about 57 hun
dredths, by weight, of matter, which ultimately assumes the solid form, and
43 hundredths, by weight, of permanent gases.
    2. At the moment of explosion, the fluid products of combustion, doubt
less in a very finely divided state, occupy a volume of about -6 cub. cent.
    3.   At the same instant, the permanent gases occupy a volume of
•4   cub. cent., so that both the fluid and gaseous matter are of approxi
mately the same specific gravity.
    4.   The permanent       gases generated    by the explosion of a gramme of
powder are such that, at 0° C. and 760 mm. barometric pressure, they
occupy about 280 cub. cents., and therefore about 280 times the volume
 of the original powder.
     5. The constituents of the solid products are as shown in Tables           II. III.
                                                                                    &
     6. The composition of the permanent gases is shown in the same Tables.
     7. The tension of the products of combustion, when the powder fills
entirely the space in which it is fired, is about 6400 atmospheres,                     or
 about 42 tons per square inch.
     8. The tension varies with the mean density of the products of com
 bustion, according to the law given in equation (3).
     9. About 705 gramme-units of heat are developed by the decompo
 sition of one gramme of powder, such as used in the experiments.
     10. The temperature of explosion is about 2200° C.
     (b) When powder is fired in the bore of a gun.
     1. The products of explosion, at all events as far           as regards the pro-
    *  In this equation p denotes the tension and « the volume of the products of explo
sion, a the proportion occupied by the solid products, C„ and Cp the specific heats of the
permanent gases at constant volume and pressure,      \ the mean specific heat of the non
gaseous products, j3 the ratio between the weights of the gaseous and non -gaseous
portions of the charge.

portions of total solid and   gaseous matters, are the same as in the case
of   powder fired in a close vessel.
     2. The work on the projectile is effected by the elastic force due to
the  permanent gases.
   3. The reduction of temperature and pressure due to the expansion of
the permanent gases        in       is,
                                 great measure, compensated by the heat

    With regard to one or two other points to which the authors specially
 directed their attention, they consider that their results warrant them in
 stating that      :—
     1.   Very small-grain powders, such                   as   F. G. and E. F. G., furnish very
 decidedly smaller          proportions of gaseous products than       large-graina
 powder        (R. L. G.)   ; while the latter, again, furnishes somewhat smaller
 proportions than        a   still larger powder (pebble), though the difference
 between the total          gaseous products of these two powders     compara       is
 tively inconsiderable.
     2.The variations in the composition of the products of explosion
 furnished, in close chambers, by one and the same powder under different
 conditions as regards pressure, and by two powders of similar composition
 under the same conditions as regards pressure, are so considerable that no
 value whatever can be attached to any attempt to give     general chemical   a
 expression to the metamorphosis  of a gunpowder   of normal  composition.
                                                                                               ;
     3.The proportions in which the several constituents of solid powder-
 residue are formed are quite as much affected by slight accidental varia
 tions in the conditions which attend the explosion of one and the same
 powder   in different experiments, as by decided differences in the compo
 sition, as well as in the size of grain, of different powders.
     4. In all but very exceptional results, the solid residue furnished                      by
 the explosion of gunpowder      contains, as important constituents, potas-
 Bium carbonate, sulphate, hyposulphite, and sulphide, the proportion of
 carbonate being very much higher, and that of sulphate very much lower,
  than    is   stated by recent investigators.

        Brunton, M.D., D. Sc., and          Henry   Power,    M.B., F.R.C.S.
        Communicated by Dr. Sanderson, F.R.S. Received Juue 1,
        1874.
    It has been shown, by    Max Herrmann and Ludwig, that the rapidity of
the urinary secretion depends on' the difference in pressure between the
blood in the renal glomeruli and the urine in the urinary tubules.
    At present, it is generally assumed that the diuretic action of Digitalis
is not caused by any specific influence of the drug upon the kidney, but
is due exclusively to its power of increasing the blood-pressure in the
arterial system.
    The results of some experiments made by us nearly a year ago show
that this is not the fact.     Chi injecting a considerable dose of digifalin
(1-2 centigrammes) into the veins of an etherized djg, we have observed
that the secretion of urine was either greatly diminished or ceased alto
gether, while the blood-pressure rose, occasionally to a considerable
extent.     After  some   time the blood-pressure again fell : and in some of
the experiments     the secretion of urine recommenced at the instant the
fall   began.   In  other   instances it did not recommence      till the blood-
pressure had sunk below the normal.          Occasionally the secretion did not
flow    with its original r pidity,     but in o'hers it was poured forth
copiously, even although the blood-pressure       had suuk considerably below
the normal.
    If Digitalis acted  as a diuretic only by raising the blood-pressure,    the
flow of urine should have been greatly increased immediately after the
injection, and shou'd have diminished with the fall of arterial tension.
Instead of this the secretion was least when the blood-pressure             was
highest, and most copious when the tension had fallen below the normal.
    The explanation we would offer of these phenomena is, that Digitalis
probably stimulates the vaso-mo'or nerves generally, but affects those of
the kidney more powerfully than those of o her parts of the body. Thus,
it  causes a moderate contraction      of the systemic vessels, and raises the
blood-pressure in them, buf, at the same time, produces excessive contrac
tion of the renal vessels, so as to stop the circulation in the kidneys and
arrest the secretion of urine.
    As the action of the drug on the systemic vessels passes off they relax,
and the blood-pressure falls ; but the renal arteries probably dilate more
quickly and to a greater extent than the others.         The pressure of blood
in the glomeruli    may thus be increased above that normally present in
them, although the tension in the arterial system generally may have
fallen below the normal.
    Additional evidence in favour of this explanation is afforded by the fact
that the urine collected after the reestablishment of secretion contains
albumen, just as Herrmann found it to do after mechanical arrest of the
circulation through the renal arteries.

    We   do not overlook the possibility    that the alteration in secretion may
be partlv due to the direct action of the drug on the secreting elements
of the kidneys, and we are still engaged in experiments on this subject.
XI. " Description        of the Living and Extinct Races of Gigantic
       Land-Tortoises. — Parts I. and II. Introduction, and the Tor
       toises of the Galapagos Islands."           By Dr. Albert Guxthek,
       F.R.S. Received June 4, 1874.
                                    (Abstract.)
    The author having had the opportunity of examining             a considerable
collection of the remains of Tortoises       found in the islands of Mauritius
and Eodriguez associated with the bones of the Dodo and Solitaire, has
arrived at the following conclusions : —
    1.  These remains     clearly  indicate   the former    existence of several
species of gigantic Land-Tortoises, the Eodriguez species differing more
markedly from those of the Mauritius than these latter among them
selves.     All  these species appear to have become          extinct in modern
times.
    2. These extinct Tortoises     of the Mascarenes are distinguished       by a
flat cranium, truncated      beak, and a broad bridge between the foramina
obtunitoria.
    3.  All the other examples of gigantic Tortoises preserved in our mu
seums,    and said to have been brought from the Mascarenes, and likewise
the single species which is known still to survive, in a wild state, in the
small island of Aldabra, have a convex cranium, truncated beak, and a
narrow     bridge between the obturator foramina ; and therefore are
 specifically, if not genetically, distinct from the extinct ones.
    4. On the other hand, there exists the greatest affinity between those
contemporaries of the Dodo and Solitaire and the Tortoises still inhabit
 ing the Galapagos archipelago.
    These unexpected results induced the author to subject to a detailed
 examination all the available material of the gigantic Tortoises from the
 Mascarenes and Galapagos which are still living, or were believed to be
 living, and are commonly called Testudo indiea and Testudo elephantopus,
 and to collect all the historical evidence referring to them. Thus, in the
first (introductory) part of the paper a selection from the accounts of tra
 vellers is given, by which it is clearly shown that the presence of these
 Tortoises at two so distant stations as the Galapagos and Mascarenes
 cannot be accounted for by the agency of man, at least not in historical
 times, and therefore that these animals must be regarded as indi
 genous.
    The second part consists of a description of the Galapagos Tortoises.
 The author shows that the opinion of some of the older travellers, viz.

422        Dr. A. Gunther on Gigantic Land-Tortoises.                 [June 18,
that the different islands of the group are inhabited by different races, is
perfectly correct ; and he distinguishes four species, the adults of which
are characterized as follows   : —
   A. Shell broad, with more or     less corrugated plates.      Skull with the
palatal region concave ; outer pterygoid edge sharp in its entire length
or for the greater part of its length ; a deep recess in front of the occi
pital condyle ; anterior wall of the entrance of the tympanic cavity con
stricted.    One of the two species is from James Island.
   1. Shell depressed,   with the upper anterior profile subhorizontal in the
male, and with the striae of the plates not deeply sculptured ; sternum
truncated behind.      Skull with the facial portion very short, and with an
immensely     developed and raised occipital     crest.   Testudo   elephan. ^
                                                                               as
(Harlan).
   2. Shell much higher, with the upper anterior profile declivous in the
male, and with the striae deeply sculptured ; sternum excised behind.
Skull with the facial portion much longer, and with low occipital crest.
Testudo   nigrita (Dum. & Bibr.).
   B. Shell oblong, smooth. Skull with the palatal region shallow ; the
outer pterygoid edge expanded in its whole length ; no deep recess in
front of the occipital condyle ; anterior wall of the tympanic cavity not
constricted.
   3. Shell with some traces of former concentric striae, compressed ante
riorly into the form of a " Spanish saddle in the male ; sternum trun
                                               "
cated behind.     Skull with the tympanic cavity much produced backwards.
 Testudo ephippium (Gthr.), from Charles Island.        Extinct.
   4. Shell perfectly smooth, with declivous anterior profile in the male,
and with truncated posterior extremity of the sternum.             Skull resem
bling that of the young of the larger species, with the tympanic case not
produced backwards.       The smallest species. Testudo microphyes (Gthr.),
from Hood's Island.
   Part III. will contain the account of the still existing Tortoises of the
Mascarenes, and Part IV. that of the extinct species.
                           Received   June 9,  1874.
   PS. The author     has just received from Professor Huxley the carapace
and skeleton of anotheradult male, which evidently belongs to a fifth species
of Galapagos Tortoises.       With regard to the form of the carapace, it
resembles much that of T. elephantopus, the dorsal shell being depressed,
broad, with the upper profile nearly horizontal.         Striae distinct, broad.
However, the skull differs widely from that of T. elephantopus, and has
all the characteristics of that of T. ephippium, from which it differs in
having a circular tympanic opening.       The form of the sternum is quite
peculiar, the gular portion being much constricted and produced forwards,
whilst the opposite end is expanded into the large anal scutes and deeply
excised. This species may be named Testudo vicina.

                                                    Melbourne, March 17, 1874.
      Dear Admiral Richards, — 1 have the pleasure of informing you
  that, during our voyage from the Cape of Good Hope to Australia, all
  the necessary observations in matters bearing upon my department have
  been made most successfully at nineteen principal stations, suitably
  distributed over the track, and including Marion Island, the neighbour
  hood of the Crozets, Kerguelen Island, and the Heard group.
      After leaving the Cape several dredgings were taken a little to the
  southward,    at depths from 100 to 150 fathoms.      Animal life was very
  abundant ; and the result was remarkable in this respect, that the general
  character of the fauna was very similar to that of the North Atlantic,
  many of the species even being identical with those on the coasts of Great
  Britain and Norway.         The first day's dredging was in 1900 fathoms,
  125 miles to the south-westward of Cape Agulhas; it was not very
  successful.
     Marion Island was visited for a few hours, and a considerable collec
  tion of plants, including nine flowering species, was made by Mr. Mose-
  ley.    These, along with collections from Kerguelen Island and from
, Yong Island, of the Heard group, are sent home with Mr. Moseley's
  notes, for Dr. Hooker's information.
     A shallow-water dredging near Marion Island gave a large number of
  species, again representing many of the northern types, but with a mix
  ture of southern forms, such as many of the characteristic southern
  Bryozoa and the curious genus Serolis among Crustaceans.          Off Prince
  Edward's Island, the dredge brought up many large and striking speci
  mens of one or two species of Alcyonarian zoophytes, allied to Mopsea
  and Isis.
     The trawl was put down in 1375 fathoms on the 29th December, and
  in 1600 fathoms on the 30th, between Prince Edward's Island and the
  Crozets. The number of species taken in these two hauls was very large ;
  many of them belonged to especially interesting genera, and many
  were new to science.     I may mention that there occurred, with others, the
  well-known genera Euplectella, Hyalonema, Umbellularia, and Flubellum ;
  two entirely new genera of stalked Crinoids belonging to the Apio-
  crinidae ; Pourtalesia ; several Spatangoids new to science (allied to the
  extinct genus Ananchytcs) ; Salenia; several remarkable Crustaceans ; and
  a few fish.

of the weather   ;       but we dredged in 210 fathoms and 550 fathoms, about
18 miles   to the         8.W. of the island, with a satisfactory result. We
reached Kerguelen Island on the 7th of January, and remained there
until the 1st of February. During that time Dr. v. Willemoes-Suhm
was chiefly occupied in working out the land-fauna, Mr. Moseley col
lected the plants, Mr. Buchanan made observations on the geology of
those parts of the island which we visited, and Mr. Murray and carried I
on the shallow-water dredging in the steam-pinnace.     Many observations
were made, and large collections were stored in the different departments.
We detected at Kerguelen Island some peculiarities in the reproduction
of several groups of marine invertebrates, and particularly in the Ecbino-
dermata, which       I
                   have briefly described in a separate paper.
    Two days before leaving Kerguelen Island, we trawled off the entrance
of Christmas Harbour ; and the trawl-net came up, on one occasion, nearly
filled with large cup-sponges belonging to the genus Rossella of Carter,
and probably the species dredged by Sir James Clark Ross near the ice-
barrier, Rossella antarctica.
  On the 2nd of February we dredged in 150 fathoms, 140 miles south of
Kerguelen, and on the 7th of February off Yong Island, in both cases with
success.
   We reached Corinthian Bay, in Yong Island, on the evening of the 6th,
and had made all arrangements for examining          it,
                                                   as far as possible, on
the following day; but, to our great disappointment,   sudden change of
                                                           a
weather obliged us to put to sea.     Fortunately Mr.  Moseley and Mr.
Buchanan accompanied Captain Nares on shore for an hour or two on
the evening of our arrival, and took the opportunity of collecting
the plants and minerals within their reach. A cast of the trawl
taken in lat. 60° 52' S., long. 80° 20' S., at 1260 fathoms, was not very
productive, only   few of the ordinary deep-sea forms having been pro
                     a
cured.
    Our most southerly station was on the 14th of February, lat. 65° 42' S.,
 long. 79° 49' E.    The trawl brought up, from    depth of 1675 fathoms,
                                                    a
a   considerable number of animals, including Sponges, Alcyonarians,
 Echinids, Bryozoa, and Crustacea, all much of the usual deep-sea cha
 racter, although some of the species had not been previously observed.
 On February 26th, in 1975 fathoms, UmbeUularice, Hohthuria', and many
 examples of several species of the Ancuiehytida' were procured    and we
                                                                   :
found very much the same group of forms at 1900 fathoms on the 3rd of
March. On the 7th of March, in 1800 fathoms, there were many animal
forms, particularly some remarkable starfishes, of      large size, of the
                                                           a
genus Hijmenaster and on the 13th of March, at depth of 2600 fathoms,

occurred attached to peculiar concretions of manganese which came up
in numbers in the trawl.

    It  is of course impossible to determine the species with the books of
reference at our command ; but many of them are new to science, and
some arc     of great interest from their relation to groups supposed to be
extinct.      This is particularly the case with the Echinodermata, which
are here, as in the deep water in the north, a very prominent group.
    During the present cruise special attention has been paid to the nature
 of the bottom, and to any facts which might throw light upon the source
of its materials.
    This department has been chiefly in the hands of Mr. Murray ; and             I
 have pleasure     in referring to the constant industry and care which he has
 devoted to the preparation, examination, and storing of samples.            I  ex
tract from     Mr. Murray's notes : —
    "In    the soundings     about the Agulhas bank, in 100 to 150 fathoms,
the bottom was       of a greenish colour, and contained many  * crystalline   par-
                                                                 2 k 2

 4,26                         Prof. W. Thomson on                      [June   18..
 tides (some dark-coloured       and some clear) of Foraminifera, species of
  Orbulina,   Globigerina,   and  Pulvinulina, a pretty species of Uvigerina,
 Planorbulina,     Miliolina, Bulimina, and Nummulina.          There were very
 few Diatoms.
    "In the deep soundings and dredgings before reaching the Crozets, in
  1900, 1570, and 1375 fathoms, the bottom was composed entirely of
  Orbulina, Globigerina, and Pulvinulina, the same species which we get on
 the surface, but all of a white colour and dead.        Of Foraminifera, which
 we have not got on the surface,         I noticed one Rotalia and one Polgsto-
 mella, both dead.      Some Coecoliths and Bhabdoliths were also found in
 the samples from these soundings.          On the whole, these bottoms were, I
 think, the purest carbonate of lime we have ever obtained. When the
 soundings were placed in a bottle and shaken up with water, the whole
 looked like a quantity of sago.        The Pulvinulina were smaller than in
 the dredgings in the Atlantic.        "We had no soundings between the Cro
 zets and Kerguelen.
    " The
             specimens of the bottom about Kerguelen were all from depths
 from 120 to 20 fathoms, and consisted usually of dark mud, with an
 offensive sulphurous smell.      Those obtained furthest from land were made
 up almost entirely of matted sponge-spicules.          In these soundings one
 species of Rotalina and one other Foraminifer occurred.
    " At 150 fathoms, between Kerguelen and Heard Island, the bottom
 was composed of basaltic pebbles. The bottom at Heard Island was much
the same as at Kerguelen.
    "The sample obtained from a depth of 12G0 fathoms, south of Ileanl
Island, was quite different from any thing we had previously obtained.
It was one mass of Diatoms, of many species ; and, mixed with these,
 a few small Globigerina: and Eadiolarians, and a very few crystalline par
ticles.
    " The soundings and dredgings while wo were among the            ice in 1675,
 1800, 1300, and 1975 fathoms, gave another totally distinct deposit of yel
lowish clay, with pebbles and small stones, and a considerable admixture of
 Diatoms, Eadiolarians, and Globigerina;.          The clay and pebbles were
evidently a sediment from the melting icebcgs, and the Diatoms, Eadio
larians, and Foraminifera were from the surface-waters.
    "The bottom from 1950 fathoms, on our way to Australia from the
 Antarctic, was again exactly similar to that obtained in the 12G0-fathoms
sounding south of Heard Island.            The bottom at 1800 fathoms, a little
further to the north (lat. 50° 1' 8,, long. 123° 4' E.), was again pure
 '
   Globigerina-oo7.e,'  composed of Orbulina; Globigerina', and Pulvinulina'.
    " The bottom at 2150 fathoms
                                        (lat. 47° 25' S., long. 130° 32' E.) was
similar to the last, with a reddish tinge ; and that at 2000 fathoms (lat.
42° 42' S., long 134° 10' E.) was reddish clay, the same which we got at
like depths in the Atlantic, and contained manganese nodules and much
decomposed Foraminifera."

     Mr. Murray           has beenby the observations which have been
                                             induced,
made in the Atlantic, to combine the use of the towing-net, at various
depths from the surface to 150 fathoms, with the examination of the
samples from the soundings.      And this double work has led him to a
conclusion (in which                 I
                         am now forced entirely to concur, although it is
certainly contrary to my former opinion) that the bulk of the material of
the bottom in deep water                     is,
                              in all cases, derived from the surface.
    Mr. Murray has demonstrated the presence of Globiyerinm, Pulvinu-
liiue, and Orbulince throughout all the upper layers of the sea over the
whole of the area where the bottom consists of " Glolijjerina-ooze" or of
the red clay produced by the decomposition of the shells of Foraminifera                      ;

from that of the shells at the bottom, that        impossible to doubt that
                                                                 it   is
the latter, even although they frequently contain organic matter, are all
dead.      mean this to refer only to the genera mentioned above, which
           I
practically form the ooze. Many other Foraminifera undoubtedly live in
comparatively small numbers, along with animals of higher groups, on the
bottom.
     In
      the extreme south the conditions were so severe as greatly to inter
fere with all work.  We had no arrangement for heating the work-rooms                         ;
and at a temperature which averaged for some days 25° F., the instru
ments became so cold that    was unpleasant to handle them, and the
                                               it
vapour of the breath condensed and froze at once upon glass and brass
work.   Dredging at the considerable depths which we found near the
Antarctic Circle          became         a   severe and somewhat    critical operation, the gear
being stiffened and otherwise affected                   by   the cold, and we could not repeat
itoften.
  The evening of the 23rd of February was remarkably fine and calm,
and   was arranged to dredge on the following morning.
         it                                             The weather
changed  somewhat during the night, and the wind rose.   Captain Kares
was, however, most anxious to carry out our object, and the dredge was
put over at  a.m. We were surrounded

disappointment,            it   was empty, — probably the drift of the ship and the
motion had prevented                  its reaching the bottom. In the mean time the
wind had risen to               a   whole gale (force=10 in the squalls), the thermo
meter         fell to   210-5   F., the snow drove in          dry blinding cloud of ex

bridge.
     Careful observations on temperature arc already in your hands, reported
     Captain Nares. The specific gravity of the water has been taken daily
 by by   Mr. Buchanan

7 from    the bottom, and 2 from intermediate        depths.    The smallest
amount of carbonic acid was found in surface-water on the 27th January,
near Kerguelen ; it amounted to 0-0373 gramme per litre. The largest
amount, 0-0829 gramme per litre, was found in bottom-water on the 14th
February, when close to the Artarctic ice. About the same latitude the
amount of carbonic acid in surface-water rose to the unusual amount of
0-0656 gramme per litre; in all other latitudes it ranged between
0-044 and 0-054 gramme per litre.             From the greater number of
these samples the oxygen and nitrogen were extracted, and sealed up in
tubes.
   The considerations connected with the distribution of temperature and
specific gravity in these southern waters are so very complicated, that      I
prefer postponing any general resume of the results until there has been
time for full consideration.
   "While we were among the ice all possible observations were made on
the structure and composition of icebergs.        We only regretted greatly
that we had no opportunity of watching their birth, or of observing the
continuous ice-barrier from which most of them have the appearance of
having been detached.        The berg- and floe-ice was examined with the
microscope,    and found  to  contain the usual Diatoms.     Careful drawings
of the different forms of icebergs, of the positions which they assume in
melting, and of their intimate structure were made by Mr. "Wild, and
instantaneous    photographs of several were taken from the ship.
   Upwards of 15,000 observations in meteorology have been recorded
during the trip to the south. Most of these have already been tabulated
and reduced to curves, and otherwise arranged for reference in consider
ing the questions of climate on which they bear.
   Many specimens in natural history have been stored in about seventy
packing-cases and casks, containing, besides dried specimens, upwards of
500 store-bottles and jars of specimens in spirit.
   I  need only further add that, so far as   I am able to judge, the expedi
tion is fulfilling the object for which it was sent out. The naval and the
civilian staff seem actuated by one wish to do the utmost in their power,
and certainly a large amount of material is being accumulated.
   The experiences of the last three months have of course been somewhat
trying to those of us who were not accustomed to a sea-life ; but the
health of the whole party has been excellent.      There has been so much to
do that there has    been  little time for weariness ; and the arrangements
continue to work in a pleasant and satisfactory way.

                                              (Abstract.)
     The paper of which this is               a short   abstract premises that its argu
 ment is conditional, that             it adopts all the fundamental optical conditions
 as they are received, that the received centre                 of motion is not one of
these, but is supposed to be legitimately derived from them, and that the
author disputes this and proposes : —
   1st. To show that this conclusion is inconsistent with its premises,
and that    different though indefinite conclusion is thence derivable ;
               a
   2nd. By experiment, to develop and reduce that conclusion to a de
finite form ;
   3rd. To verify it by anatomical induction.
   The latest investigations (those of Prof. Donders) have placed the
centre of motion nearly two millimetres behind the centre of the globe,
and in the cornea's axis. The process of proof assumed that the centre
of motion is equidistant from the outer and inner margins of the cornea,
and, moreover, that the eye's visual line (ordinarily at 6° with the
cornea's axis) will, by mere rotation, in turn coincide with three or more
radii of the same circle ; or that, without moving the head, we can suc
cessively sight the lines on a graduated circular arc, seeing them as so
many points.
   The paper first proves, by                 diagram, that if the eye, by
                                           a geometrical
simple rotation, can thus see the radii of a circle, the centre of motion
must be in the visual line, not in the cornea's axis, as hitherto supposed ;
proves next, by pairs of sights set up on the radii of a circle, and actually
seen as so many points, that the centre of motion      in fact, in the visual
                                                                    is,
line and proves, lastly, by measuring (mechanically) how far the front
     ;
of the cornea    from the converging point of the radii thus sighted, that
                     is
the centre of motion      about ^ of an inch, instead of
                              is                           of an inch, be ^
hind the cornea's  anterior surface.

  (1st) If the eye rotated on   point in the antero-posterior diameter (or
                                          a
cornea's axis), then any two points equidistant from the cornea's centre
would in turn occupy the same point in space, as assumed by Prof.
Donders.           The first experiment shows that two such corresponding points
will not,     as the eye turns, fall into the same place   whilst other examina

tions of the living eye show not only that symmetrically situated points
move asymmetrically, but move asymmetrically in such      way as would    a
occur    if   the centre     of   motion were external to the antero-posterior      axis,

or somewhere in the visual line behind the nodal point, a position
which agrees with that assigned to the centre of motion by the preceding
analysis.
   (2nd) The dissected organ exhibits an asymmetrical attachment of
the recti muscles, so that a vertical plane cutting these attachments
is further from the external than from the internal margin of the
cornea.
   The circumference of this plane would      be a circle, and the attachment
of the globe's suspensory ligament, that resists the backward traction of
these muscles, is found also to be a circle parallel to, and one line further
back than, the former circle.     The latter may be considered the base cf
a cone, whose vertex is the optic foramen,      in the surface of which cone
the recti muscles are situate.      The base is therefore kept in equipoise
by the symmetrical arrangement of the contracting muscles behind
and the resisting suspensory ligament in front ; so that the contrac
tion of a single rectus, as it draws back the ligament on one side,
increases its forward traction on the other side, and moves any two
opposite points of the cone's base equally in opposite directions, or
rotates it on its centre, a centre which is thus the anatomical centre of
motion.
   But however the recti are situate (and act) symmetrically with the base
of this cone, the base is oblique with respect to the cornea (not at right
angles to its axis), and consequently its centre will be on one side of the
cornea's axis ; and again, since the cone's base is further from the outer
than from the inner margin of the cornea, its centre will be outside
the cornea's axis.     Now that part of the visual line where the preceding
experiments have placed the centre of motion is outside the cornea's axis,
while the base of the cone, whose centre has thus proved to be the ana
tomical centre of motion, is found to pass through the visual line       of an
inch behind the cornea, exactly in accordance with the results of the
experiment with sighted radii of a circle.
   Lastly, the obliquity of the cone's base with the base of the cornea
proves to be a consequence of the hitherto unexplained want of lateral
 symmetry in the attachment of the recti muscles, thus explained as
a most important       means of adjusting    the eye's visual line to the ob
ject  ; while   some   further peculiarities  in the insertion of the recti,
 demonstrated     in the author's dissections, conspire to attain the same
end.

XIV. " Some Observations           on Sea-water     Ice/' By J. Y. Buchanan,
                                              '
       Chemist on        Board H.M.S.           Challenger/ Communicated
       by Professor      A. W. Williamson, For. Sec. R.S. Received
       June 9, 1874.
   Many different opinions have been expressed as to the nature of ice
resulting from the freezing of sea-water, all agreeing, however, in one
point, that, when melted, the water is unfit to drink. During the
antarctic cruise of H.M.S. 'Challenger'          I took an opportunity of exa
mining some of the broken pack-ice, into which the ship made an
excursion on the morning of the 25th of February, and also some ice
which had formed over night in a bucket of sea-water left outside the
laboratory port.
   The piece of pack-ice which      I  examined was, in substance, clear, with
many     air-bells, most  of them   rather  irregularly shaped. Two portions
of this ice were allowed to melt at the temperature of the laboratory,
which ranged from 2° C. to 7° C.           The melting thus took place very
slowly, and made it possible to examine the water fractionally. My
experiments consisted in determining the chlorine in the water by means
of tenth-normal nitrate-of-silver solution, and observing the temperature
of the ice when melting.
   A   lump, which, when melted, was found to measure 625 cub. centims.,
was allowed to melt gradually in a porcelain dish.            When about 100
cub. centims. had melted, 50 cub. centims. were taken for the determi
nation of the chlorine     ; they required 13'6 cub. centims. silver solution,
corresponding       to 0-0483   gramme chlorine.      When 560 cub. centims.
had melted, 50 cub. centims. were titrated, and required 1-6 cub. centim.
silver solution, corresponding to 0-0057 gramme chlorine.         The remainder
(65 cub. centims.) of the ice was then melted and 60 cub. centims. titrated ;
they required 0-39 cub. centim. silver solution, corresponding to 0-0014
gramme chlorine.         We have then in the first 50 cub. centims. 0-0483
gramme chlorine,       in  the next 510 cub. centims. 0-0579 gramme, and
in the last 65 cub. centims. 0-0015 gramme.              Hence the whole lump
(625 cub. centims.) contained 0-1077 gramme chlorine, or, on an average,
0- 1 723 gramme chlorine per litre.        A qualitative analysis of the water
 showed lime, magnesia, and sulphuric acid to be present.
    Another piece of the ice was pounded and allowed to melt in a beaker.
When about half was melted, the water was poured off and found to
measure 95 cub. centims. ; 75 cub. centims. were titrated with silver
 solution, and required 1-9 cub. centim.           The remainder, when melted,
 measured 130 cub. centims., and required 0-9 cub. centim. silver solution.
 Hence the first fraction of 95 cub. centims. contained 0-0085 gramme
 chlorine, and the second of 130 cub. centims. 0-0032 gramme chlorine.
 The whole quantity (225 cub. centims.) of ice therefore contained 0-0117
 gramme chlorine, or, on an average, 0-0520 gramme per litre.

   From these results it is evident that the ice under examination was
very far from being an homogeneous body; and, indeed, nothing else
could be expected, when it is borne in mind that the ice in question
owes its existence, not only to the bond jide freezing of sea-water, but
also to the snow which falls on its surface and is congealed into a
compact mass by the salt-water spray freezing amongst it.
   The ice formed by freezing sea-water in a bucket was found to have
formed all round the bottom and sides of the bucket, and forming a
pellicle on the surface, from which and from the sides and bottom the ice
had formed in hexagonal planes, projecting edgewise into the water.
The water was poured off, the crystals collected, washed with distilled
water, pressed between filtering-paper,      and one portion melted.       It
measured 9 cub. centims., and required 4 cub. centims. silver solution,
corresponding to 0*0142 gramme chlorine, or 1'5780 gramme per litre.
The other portion was used for determining the melting-point. The
thermometer used was one of Geissler s normal ones, divided into tenths
of a degree Centigrade, whose zero had been verified the day before in
melting snow.      The melting-point of the ice-crystals was found to be
 — 10,3.   The temperature of the melting mass was observed to remain
constant    for twenty minutes, after which    no further observations were
made.
   In   the same way the melting-point of the      pack-ice was determined.
The fresh ice     began to melt at — 1° ; after   twenty minutes the ther
mometer had risen to — 0°-9, and two hours         and a half afterwards it
stood at — 0°-3, having remained constant for     about an hour at — 0°-4.
Another portion of the ice rose more rapidly ; and when three fourths of
the ice was melted, the thermometer stood at 0°.
   These determinations of the temperature of melting sea-water ice
show that the salt is not contained in it only in the form of mechanically
enclosed brine, but exists in the solid form, either as a single crystalline
substance or as a mixture of ice- and salt-crystals.     Common salt, when
separating from solutions at temperatures below 0°, crystallizes in
hexagonal planes ; sea-water ice, therefore, may possibly have some
analogy to the isomorphous mixtures occurring amongst minerals.

   It is well known that quinine, cinchonine, or strychnine yield, when
distilled with caustic potash, two homologous series of bases, named the
pyridine and chinoline series. Bases isomeric with these may also be

obtained by the destructive distillation of coal, or from Dippel's oil, got
from bone. Greville Williams has pointed out that chinoline obtained
from coal-tar differs in    some  respects from that yielded by cinchonine.
 In this research the authors endeavoured to ascertain (1) the physio
logical action of the various members of the series ; (2) whether there
 was any difference in this respect between the members of the series
 obtained from cinchonine and those got from tar ; and (3) whether, and
if  so, how, both as regards extent and character, the physiological action
of   these bases differed from that of the original alkaloidal bodies.
    The bases in both series are difficult to separate from each other ; but
this has been done as far as possible by repeated fractional distillation.
The salt employed was the hydrochlorate.         This, dissolved in water, was
introduced by a fine syringe under the skin of the animal.         The action of
 chinoline was tested on frogs, mice, rabbits, guineapigs, cats, dogs, and
 man ; but as the effects were found to be similar in all of these instances,
 the majority of the observations were made on rabbits.             The experi
 ments with the other substances were made on rabbits and frogs.             The
physiological     action of  hydrochlorate   of chinoline  was  first examined.
 Its action was then compared with that of the hydroehlorates of the
 chinoline   series of bases distilling at higher      temperatures, including
 such as lepidine, dispoline, tetrahiroline, &c.       In the next place, the
physiological action     of the pyridine series was studied, beginning with
pyridine itself, and passing upwards to bases obtained at still higher
boiling-points, such as picoline, lutidine, &c. Lastly, the investigation
was directed to the action of condensed bases, such as dipyridine, parapi-
coline, &c.  ; and the effects of these substances were compared with those
produced    by  the members of the chinoline series and among themselves.
    The following are the general conclusions arrived at
    1. There is a marked gradation in the extent of physiological action of
the members of the pyridine series of bases, but it remains of the same
kind. The lethal dose becomes reduced as we rise from the lower to the
higher.
    2.  The higher members of the pyridine series resemble in physiologi
cal action the lower members of the chinoline series, except- (1) that the
former    are more liable to cause      death by asphyxia, and (2) that the
lethal dose of the pyridines is less than one half that of the chinolines.
    3. In proceeding from the lower to the higher members of the chino
line series, the physiological action changes in character, inasmuch      as the
lower members appear to act chiefly on the sensory centres of the
encephalon and the reflex centres of the cord, destroying the power of
voluntary    or reflex movement   ; while the higher act less on these centres,
and chiefly on the motor centres, first, as irritants, causing violent con
vulsions, and at length producing complete paralysis.         At the same time,
while the reflex activity of the centres in the spinal      cord appear to be
inactive, they may be readily roused to action by strychnine.

   4. On comparing the action of such compounds as C„ H. X (chiuoline)
with C„ H13 N (parvoline Ac), or C8 H„ N (collidine) with C„ H15 N (eonia,
from hemlock), or C10 H10 N2 (dipyridine) with C10 HH Na (nicotine, from
tobacco), it is to be observed that the physiological activity of the sub
stance      is,
           apart from chemical structure, greatest in those bases con
taining the larger amount of hydrogen.
     5. Those artificial          bases which approximate the percentage             composition
of natural        bases are much weaker physiologically,                 so   far as can be esti
mated by amount of dose, than the natural bases but the kind of action
                                                                     ;
isthe same in both cases.
  6. When the bases of the pyridine series are doubled by condensation,
producing    dipyridine, parapicoline, &c, they not only become    more
active physiologically, but the action differs in kind from that of the
simple bases, and resembles the action of natural bases or alkaloids
having     a    similar chemical constitution.
     7.   All   the substances examined in this research                  are remarkable for
not possessing any specific paralytic action on the heart likely to cause
syncope   but they destroy life either by exhaustive convulsions, or
            ;                                                                                       by
gradual paralysis of the centres of respiration, thus causing asphyxia.
     8. There     isno appreciable immediate action on the sympathetic system
of nerves.         There      is
                            probably   secondary action, because after large
                                                 a
doses      the vasomotor           centre, in common with other               centres,     becomes
involved.
   9. There    no difference, so far as could be discovered, between lie
                  is
physiological action of bases obtained from ciuchoniue and those derived
from tar.

line of the curve is no longer a straight line, but exhibits a certain de
gree of curvature, so that the difficulty of determining the hourly or
other values by means of an engraved scale, bearing parallel straight
lines, is very considerable.
    At   the suggestion   of Mr. Francis Galton, the Meteorological Com
mittee gave instructions that measurements should be made of the curves
by means of the instrument called Amsler's Planimeter, of which a full
description, by Mr. F. J. Bramwell, F.R.S., is printed in the Report of
                                                                    '

the British Association      for 1872. The object of this invention is de
fined, in the paper quoted, to be " that the area of any figure, however
irregular, can be recorded in definite standard units of measurement bv
the mere passage of a tracer along the perimeter of that figure."
    It is perfectly obvious that the measurement of the area of the curve,
if it can be executed with sufficient accuracy, must give a far more satis
factory mode of ascertaining the value of the mean ordinate of the curve
than the calculation of the average of any number of measured individual
ordinates, while the economy of time ensured by the use of the planimeter
forms a most important recommendation for its use.
    The mode of employing the instrument is as follows : — The entire
perimeter of the curve, down to the base-line, is measured, and the value
noted.      Then using the same base-line, a rectangle of known height, in
units of the scale of the curve, is next measured in the same wav, and
the value noted again.
    The ratio of these two values is the mean value of the ordinate of the
curve, or the mean pressure or temperature for the interval embraced bv
the curve.
    It  may be remarked that       I have learnt within the last few days that
the present occasion is not the first on which a planimeter has been used
for the deduction of meteorological means. Mons. van Rysselberghe,
Professor at the School of Navigation, Ostend, has employed it in con
nexion with his new electrical Meteorograph.
    The subjoined Table shows for a period of eight months the means of
temperature for Kew Observatory obtained by the planimeter, as well as
those yielded by the old method, both for daily and for five-day means.
It  will  be seen that the difference    in 242 determinations of dailv means
only amounted to 0o-5     on six occasions, and to 0°-6 in one instance : while
out of 49 cases of five-day means the grentest difference was only 0°-4,
and this was only once attained.
    At the end of the Table the column headed " Wr. Rep. Plates " gives
the values obtained      by measurement of the plates published in the
                                 '

meats to which    I
                  have just alluded.    It will be seen from it that the
five-day means so obtained hardly differ from those which are yielded by
the direct measurement of the photographic curve by means of the plani
meter.
   The plates in question are obtained by the use of Mr. Francis Galton's
Pantagraph, which transfers the records at a reduced time-scale to zinc
plates, which plates are subsequently further reduced and transferred to
copper by Wagner's Pantagraph,            as explained   in the Report of the Com
mittee for 1870.
  I therefore   hope that the Society will allow me to remark that such a
test as this affords a satisfactory proof of the accuracy of the reproduc
tions of our automatic records which are executed in the Meteorological
Office.
   The result of these preliminary experiments is that the planimeter
means are practically identical with those obtained by treatment of the
values of the hourly ordinatcs.
  It is  found that the mean from the photographic record of temperature
for one day can be obtained in about the same time as is required for the
calculation of the hourly values ; while in the case of pressure the saving
of time would     be considerable.          In   both cases the   hourly values are
supposed to have been previously measured.                  If,
                                                  however, the five-day
                                                                    '
mean from one of the plates of the ' Quarterly Weather Eeport         be
admissible, the economy of time would be very great indeed.
  It   doesnot appear that the liability to error in following the course of
the curve with the tracer of the planimeter is greater than that of mea
suring the ordinates of the curve by a glass scale ; while we escape one
serious cause of uncertainty in the latter operation, the difficulty of
assigning the exact ordinate to the hour at a period of rapid change of
temperature, &c. — a case of frequent occurrence ; and we almost entirely
dispense with arithmetical calculations.
   It is very unfortunate that the use of the planimeter will not enable
us to dispense with the necessity of taking hourly readings, inasmuch as
it affords us no means of averaging any but consecutive values, and so
renders us no assistance in any determination of the march of meteoro
logical phenomena.
   A further series of planimeter measurements, for pressure and dry-
and wet-bulb temperature, for all the observatories for three months is
now in progress   ;   and   if,   as we hope, the results   will prove   as satisfactory
as those which  I                 to submit to the Society on the pre
                      have the honour
sent occasion, would appear that there

          My dear Sir, — I enclose                  a report    of  some magnetic          observations         made
      at the New Observatory of Zi-Ka-Wei with instruments which                                              I   sent
      from England some time since. A complete set of self-recording mag-
      netographs have just been completed for the same observatory by Mr.
      Adie, and will be forwarded to their destination this week. The Director
      of the Observatory of Zi-Ka-Wei, as well as his first assistant, have both
      received full instructions in the use of these instruments, so we may rea
      sonably hope that the science of terrestrial magnetism will be much
      advanced by the foundation of this new establishment.
                                                                             Tours sincerely,

       Received May 4, 1874.
    After the occurrence of a great colliery-explosion it is usually very
difficult, and sometimes impossible, to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion
as to what were the causes which probably led to the catastrophe, and
when safety-lamps have been exclusively used by the workmen its origin
seems    to be shrouded in mystery.                The explosions      which happened at
Risca, Morfa, Cethin,            High Brooks, and Pelton Collieries between the
1st of March, 1860, and the 21st of October, 1866, appeared to be alto
gether inexplicable ; and, in the last two cases, when all the safety-lamps
were found locked after the accident, no attempts were made to explain
the phenomena.
    On the 12th of December,              1866, however, the great explosion took
place   at   the      Oaks  Colliery,   and     fortunately several of the men who
survived could give an account of some of the circumstances which
immediately preceded it. A stone drift had been cut from near the
bottom of the downcast-shafts to within a few feet of one of the intake-
airways, and shortly before the accident a shot-hole was drilled at its
inner end, and charged with a considerable quantity* of gunpowder; the
men who were about the pit-bottom were warned into a sheltered place ;
the shot was fired, and in a few seconds afterwards                       the shock of the
explosion was felt. It" was ascertained subsequently that a part of the
rock at the bottom of the shot-hole had been blown into the intake-airway,
leaving the tamping intact, so that the concussion of the air would be
almost as great as if the tamping alone had been blown out.
    A coincidence so remarkable as this attracted considerable attention,
 and after every great explosion which has happened since the Oaks' a
 search has evidently been made for some evidence of recent shot-firing.
 The following Table will give an idea of the magnitude of the important
 explosions which have happened within recent years, and of some of the
 circumstances under which they occurred.

    It will  be seen from the data given above that           shot-firing was carried
on in 17 of the 22 collieries at which important explosions took place
after the 12th of December, 1866 ; safety-lamps were certainly used in
 12, and probably also        in the 5 which are marked doubtful         ; in 8 cases   it
was ascertained that a shot had blown out the tamping at or about the
time of the explosion ; in 2 an empty shot-hole was found, from which the
tamping is supposed to have been blown ; and in 3 a shot had been fired
bringing down the coal or rock ; finally, at Bisca, Ferndale (1867), Hay-
dock (1869), Low Hall, Renishaw Park, and Seaham, two or more explo
sions appear to have taken place simultaneously in different parts of the
mine unconnected by a train of explosive gas. The Seaham explosion is
a remarkable one : a heavily charged shot was fired in pure air in one of
the intake-aircourses, and, according to the statement of three men who
survived, the explosion of firedamp followed the shot immediately ; one
of the men further asserted that, in several minutes more, he heard the
distinct report of another explosion.
    Two methods of accounting for the simultaneousness of the explosion
of firedamp with the firing of the shot have been suggested in the
Reports of the Inspectors of Mines : one of them supposes that the fire
damp is ignited directly by the shot ; the other, that the concussion of
the air caused by the explosion of gunpowder dislodges gas from cavities
in the roof and from goaves, and that this gas, passing along in the air-
currents, is ignited at the lamps of the workmen.                 In some instances,
when it has been known to be highly improbable that any gas existed
nearer to the shot-hole than 10, 20, or even 40 feet, the advocates of the
former hypothesis have taken it for granted that the gases issuing from
the shot-hole were projected through the air as far as the accumulation of
firedamp, retaining a sufficiently high temperature to ignite it on their
arrival.     On the other hand, the advocates of the latter hypothesis have
not attempted       to show how the gas, which they assumed could be dis
lodged in quantity by a sound-wave and its reflections, could be ignited

in those    cases  in which safety-lamps only were used.            It  is no doubt
highly probable, however, that when once an explosion of firedamp has
been initiated in one way or another, and large bodies of air are driven
through the passages of a mine with great velocity, explosive accumula
tions will be dislodged from cavities and goaves, and pressed through the
safety-lamps with the velocity requisite to pass the flame.
                                                      I
    In the beginning of the year 1872, when was giving attention to this
subject, it appeared to me to be probable that the sound-wave originated
by a blown-out shot, in passing through a safety-lamp burning in an
explosive mixture, would carry the flame through the meshes of the wire
gauze, in virtue of the vibration of the molecules of the explosive gas.
It had long been known*, indeed, that if an explosive current were made
to impinge upon a lighted safety-lamp in a direction perpendicular to its
axis, and with a velocity of 8 to 14 feet per second, the flame would pass
through the meshes after a short time, and ignite the explosive mixture
on the outside ; but it does not seem to have been suspected that the
same result might be produced by the passage             of an intense sound-wave
through     a safety-lamp     burning quietly in an explosive mixture.             The
explosion at Cethin Colliery in 1865 is a good example             of  one that may
have been caused in this way, by the firing of a shot. Several days after
the explosion the safety-lamp of the overman was found, securely locked
and uninjured, lying at the distance of a few yards, within an abandoned
 stall which was known to have contained firedamp : shot-firing was
carried on in this mine, and it is not improbable that a sound-wave from
an overcharged or blown-out shot had passed through this lamp and
ignited the explosive mixture shortly after the overman had entered it :
moreover the Inspector of Mines says t he has no hesitation in stating
that, in his opinion, the gas in this stall had been ignited, and was there
fore the origin of the explosion       ; but he is unable to state by what means
 it was fired.
    It  is certain that, in every fiery mine, safety-lamps are placed in an
 explosive mixture from time to time, either by accident (as when men
 retire hurriedly, perhaps into disused places, after the fuse of a shot has
 been ignited) or by design to test the quality of the air, as the overman
 at Cethin Colliery may have been doing ; and it is equally certain that
 shots are fired, occasionally, which blow out the tamping and cause a
 violent concussion of the air.          If, therefore, the explanation which is
 brought   forward    in this paper   to  account for the relation between explo
 sions and shot-firing be the true one, then the question as to how often
 explosions of this kind are likely to occur would resolve itself into one of
probability as to how often an ordinary Davy or Clanny lamp, burning in
 an explosive mixture, would be traversed by a sound-wave of a certain
 amplitude of vibration.

1874.]            Mr. W. Galloway       on Sufety-Lamps.                   415
    On the 16th of January, 1872, 1 made the first experiment in connexion
with this subject in the Physical Laboratory of University College, Loudon :
Professor G. C. Foster was present and co-operated with me. A sheet
of wire gauze, 1 foot square, was inclined at an angle of 70°, and a slow
current of gas and air from a Bunsen burner was directed against its
under surface. Part of the explosive mixture thus formed passed through
the meshes, and, when ignited, produced a flat flame on the upper surface
3 in. long by 1 in. wide, and symmetrically situated in regard to the
sides of the sheet.    A glass tube, 3 ft. 4 in. long by 3| in. diameter, was
placed with one end at a distance of 1| in. from the upper surface
of the sheet of wire gauze; its axis was horizontal, passed through
the middle point of the flat flame, and was at right angles to the
line of intersection of a horizontal plane with the sheet. At the end of
the tube furthest from the wire gauze, a vessel, 3| in. diameter, containing
a solution of soap in water was placed ; the point at which the axis of
the tube cut the perpendicular from the centre of the liquid was 2\ in.
from the end of the tube, and at the same distance above the surface of
the liquid. An explosive mixture of coal-gas and oxygen was forced
into the solution of soap until bubbles containing about 2 cub. inches
had formed    on the surface.       A light   was then   applied   to the gas
at the upper surface of the wire gauze, and immediately afterwards
to the bubbles ; and after the explosion it was found that the flame had
vanished from the upper surface, and that the gas issuing from the
Bunsen burner was on fire.
   In  December    1872,  I made   a number of experiments similar to the
foregoing in the Laboratory     of  the Royal College of Chemistry, when I
was much indebted to Dr. Frankland for his valuable suggestions.          The
glass tube of the   first experiment   was  replaced by two   tin-plate tubes,
each 2 in. diameter (one 10 ft. 11 in., the other 9 ft. 7 in. long) ; they
were joined to form a continuous tube 20 ft. 6 in. long.            The vessel
containing the solution of soap was small enough to be placed just inside
of one end of the tube, and the sheet of wire gauze was at a distance of
1 in. from the other end.        The same explosive mixtures were again
employed, and the same result was obtained as before. A diaphragm,
consisting of four sheets of brown paper of ordinary thickness, was now
inserted at the junction of the two tubes ; the centre of the diaphragm
was bulged to a distance of about half an inch towards the origin of dis
turbance.   After the passage of the sound-wave, it was found that the
flame had shifted    to the opposite side of the wire gauze, and the dia
phragm was bulged to about the same extent, but in the opposite direc
tion. A quantity of loose cotton-wool, sufficient to fill the end of the
tube completely    for  a length   of three inches, was then pushed into
the end  of the  one   furthest from the wire gauze, at its junction with
the  other.    After the sound-wave       had  passed, the flame was again
found to have removed to the opposite side of the wire gauze, and the

cylinder of cotton-wool was one inch further from the origin of disturb
ance.
  Two    sets   of apparatus (figs. 1 & 2, Plate VI.) were now constructed :
in both the sound-wave of a pistol-shot is conveyed through tin-plate
tubes to a distance of 20 feet; then it passes through a safety-lamp,
which can be surrounded by an explosive mixture of gas and air.
    In the apparatus represented in fig. 1 there are two tubes, each 10 feet
long by 3 inches in diameter.         At the end o a disk of wood, £ in. thick,
with a hole   in the centre large enough to receive the muzzle of the pistol, is
fitted into the tube a; at c a sheet of india-rubber,             in. thick, is tied
over the end      of  the tube b, and a tubular ring, one end of which is
 covered with a network of wire            in. thick, with meshes         in. square,
 is drawn    over  the fastening till the network is close to the diaphragm.
 The part of the apparatus which is surmounted by the safety-lamp is of
 the following construction : — A round sheet-iron plate, g, of 6 in. dia
 meter, rests on four short legs : above this, and joined to             it,  circular

to -272 gramme, or be decreased to 'ISO gramme, the experiment does
not succeed ; and if the wire gauze has become smoked by the flame of

   In the apparatus represented in fig. 2, there are again two tin-plate
tubes, each 10 ft. long by 8 in. diameter, but they are joined to form one
    continuous   tube 20 feet long.    At the end o there is a disk of wood,
    | in. thick, with a hole in the centre for the muzzle of the pistol.      The
    tube b (figs. 2 & 3), of tin plate, 12 in. long, has its interior isolated by
    an india-rubber sheet tied over the end e, and a sheet of paper tied over
    the end      fc.   A ring, with   a   network of wires        J in. thick,   and with meshes
    |   in. square, is drawn over the diaphragm in the same way as in the
    apparatus already described.      Two short tubes, of 6 in. diameter, are
    joined to 6 to form a chamber large enough to receive a safety-lamp ;
    they are closed by flat ends, with the exception of a hole 3 in. diameter
    in the upper one, opening into a chimney e, and an opening of 2 in.
    diameter into the tube       /
                                in the lower one. The upper end of the tube
    /  opens into a flat round chamber, with holes | in. diameter and | in. apart
    round about its outside ; its position is indicated by the dotted line in
    fig. 3.    At the top of the chimney « there is a draught regulator, g,
    which can be raised or lowered by means of the screwed spindle which
     supports it. The safety-lamp to be tested is placed on the discoid
     chamber, with its top projecting into the chimney if it is so long.     Gas
     is supplied by a Bunsen burner at the bottom of the tube /, and, mixing
     with air, it flows upwards through the discoid chamber into the isolated
     space around the lamp.        The products of combustion pass upwards
    through the chimney.
       The experiment is made thus              :   —The pistolis loaded with -41 gramme t
    of gunpowder in the same way as before :                  an ordinary Davy or Clanny
    lamp is lighted and put into the space d, which is afterwards closed at
    the ends. Gas is then made to flow into the tube/; the lamp is observed
    through the window A, and as soon as it is seen that the atmosphere in the
    space d is explosive, the shot is fired at o. The paper at k is blown out and
    set on fire ; and the flame of the explosive mixture, passing backwards
    down the tube /, ignites the gas escaping from the Bunsen burner.
       The lamps which were tested with this apparatus are those known as
    the Davy, Clanny, Stephenson, Mueseler, and Eloin.       The flame was
    easily passed through  the Davy lamp, with rather more difficulty through
    the Clanny, and not at all through any of the others.
       The first experiments with firedamp were made in No. 7 Pit, Barleith,
    near Glasgow.     A wooden plug, with a small pipe through     was driven       it,
        * This experiment was shown        by   Mr. Spottiswoode         Institution on the

     apparatus was afterwards used at one of the Cantor Lectures of the Society of Arts.

into a horizontal borehole which had struck a blower, and the firedamp
was conducted in tubes to a collecting vessel at a short distance.   soon         I
found that this firedamp was very impure, as a mixture of one part of ii
with thirteen parts of air was not explosive ; however,       I
                                                           made a number
of experiments in the mine with both sets of apparatus (figs. 1 &                        "2,
Plate VI.), but did not succeed in passing the flame, except perhaps in one
doubtful instance with the larger apparatus, when the gas issuing from
the Bunsen burner was not set on fire.
  The next experiments with firedamp were made in the             C   Pit, Hebburn
Colliery, near Newcastle-on-Tyne. The gas, which issued               from        a bore
hole similar to that in the Barleith    Pit, was collected in the same                way.
and conveyed in the collecting vessel to     a   convenient        place    near       the
stables, where naked lights could be used.  The experiments with both
sets of apparatus were quite successful, the quantity of gunpowder
required being, in each case, the same as when coal-gas was used. The
Davy lamp employed in the experiments with the larger apparatus
belonged to the colliery, and was in constant use below ground.   At the
fifth trial (when    had ascertained the quantity of gunpowder required)
                     I
the flame passed through the wire gauze, set fire to the paper tied over
the end    k,and passing backwards down the tube         kindled the gas
                                                         /,
issuing from  the Bunsen   burner.  My brother, Mr. R.  L. Galloway, who
was the resident viewer of the colliery at that time, was observing the
lamp through the window       h when the shot by which the flame was
passed was fired.   The flame of the wick, which was of ordinary dimen
sions before    was surrounded by the explosive mixture, had sent up
                it                                                                      a
long smoky point to near the top of the gauze, which showed that the
explosive mixture was composed of about     part of firedamp to 12 or 13
                                            1
parts of air.   The lamp was carefully examined after the trial, and was
found to be in good order.
   The Directors of the Company to whom the colliery belongs were un
willing to allow any further experiments to be made in the mine, so that
this series had to be abandoned before any more results had been obtained.
   Following are the analyses of the firedamp used in the foregoing
experiments.    The sample of gas from the Barleith blower was collected
by myself at the time the experiments were being made, and analyzed                     by
Dr. T. E. Thorpe, of Glasgow; that from the Hebburn blower was
collected by my brother several weeks before the experiments, and was
analyzed by     Dr. Wright, of St. Mary's Hospital, London.

 of Mr. Carrick, the City Architect  of Glasgow, part of a new sewer in

   It is remarkable that, in these latter experiments, it was not necessary
to increase the quantity of gunpowder as the distance from the lamp «s
increased.    The large charge required at the first station seems to haw
been owing to the presence of the manhole between the lamp and th*
point at which the shot was fired ; but this waste of energy having been
provided for, no further addition to the charge was required.           It would
seem as if part of the energy of the sound-wave was expended in the
space C L in shaking the brickwork and a narrow wooden gangway
supported on cross-pieces at a height of 1 ft. 5 in. from the sole;
whereas in the space A L, in which no gangway had been laid down, it
was conveyed through the tunnel in the solid rock without much loss it
intensity.
   The temperature of the air in the sewer was 55°-56° Fahrenheit ; and
there was generally a current travelling in the direction C to A at the
rate of 5 to 10 ft. per minute.
   These are the last experiments from which important results have been
obtained ; they were concluded in November 1873.
                I
   After this made some experiments with firedamp in a stone-mine in
No. 2 Pit, Douglas, near Glasgow.        1 filled a sheet-iron box of 18 cub. ft
capacity   with  firedamp   at the borehole in the C Pit of Hebburn Colliery,
and brought    it to this mine.    As the  gas appeared to have become miied
with air through leakage during the transport, and would not burn
satisfactorily in the lamp of the apparatus (fig. 1, Plate VI.), the apparatus
shown in fig. 7, Plate VII., was constructed.         Two boards, each   | of an
inch thick, and of the shape and dimensions of the top of the apparatus,
are joined together by iron rods | of an inch in diameter, one at each
angle. A sheet of india-rubber,            of an inch thick, is then fastened
round the frame thus formed by nailing it to the boards, and an isolated
 space of the form d, fig. 7, is obtained.     An opening, 1§ inch in diameter,
in the upper board       serves as an outlet for the products of combustion ;
 and a similar opening in the lower board serves as an inlet for fresh air
and the firedamp from a Bunsen burner.              This apparatus is placed on
two legs fastened to one of the sleepers in the roadway, and it is stayed
tightly before and behind by four stout wires in positions analogous to *,
the only one that can be seen in the figure.
    A Davy lamp was lighted and placed in the inside of d, on a block of
 wood 3 inches high by 3 inches in diameter, so as to have its wire gauze
as near as possible to the centre of the space ; firedamp was then admitted
at the lower opening, and the draught was regulated at a. The appear
ances presented by the lamp were observed through a glass window, A,
fastened in the sheet of india-rubber ; and as soon as the flame showed

that      the mixture surrounding it was explosive, shots were fired from a
gun     at a distance of 30 yards.     The barrel of the gun which was used is
       of an inch in diameter, and it is rifled for a length of 3 ft. with
seven grooves ; the breech which received the charge is smooth-bored,
and 4^ inches long. Each measure of gunpowder weighed 3-822 grammes
( = 59 grains), and the charges fired ranged between 1 and 9 measures ;
 paper tamping was rammed down tightly, and the charge was fired by a cap.
     The gun was tied to a prop in the middle of the mine, with its barrel
 at an angle of about 35° upwards, pointing towards the apparatus ; the
 muzzle was 18 inches from the floor. At the part where the experiments
 were made, the sizes of the mine are : — width at top, 4 ft. ; width at
 bottom, 6 ft. ; height, 5 ft. 6 in.
     The sound-wave from a shot of two measures extinguished the flame
 of the Davy lamp when it was placed on the outside of the apparatus ;
 but when it was placed in the inside of d, the flame could not be extin
 guished nor passed through the meshes, even when the quantity of gun
 powder was raised to nine measures. However, after the lamp had been
 allowed to burn in the isolated space for a few minutes (the .supply of
 fresh air not being very good), its flame could be extinguished by the
 sound-wave from a shot of four measures.            The whole quantity of fire
  damp     was so  small  that there was no  opportunity for enlarging or varying
  the apparatus.
     These experiments, and one which         I made formerly in the sewer   with

vent se couper," and offers a proof which rests upon the assumption
that if a body could undergo a series of operations represented as to the
changes of pressure and volume by PQMP (where PQ is an isothermal
and  PM, QM two adiabatics), no heat would           be gained   or lost at any parr
of the cycle except PQ.
     It    is, however, evidently impossible that the body could, at the point
M,        pass from one adiabatic to another without absorbing or emitting heat,
i.   e.   while fulfilling the very condition that it should not pass from one
adiabatic to another; and the question as to the possibility of the inter
section of two adiabatics must therefore be submitted to a more general
investigation, as it is certainly conceivable that heat might be gained or
lost during the passage from the point M considered as lying on the first
curve to the point M considered as belonging to the second, whether it
took place, as supposed by M. Verdet, without any accompanying changes
of pressure or volume, or whether, as we shall see would be generally the
case, it could only be accomplished if the body were caused to assume a
series of intermediate states involving such changes.
   The question admits of an easy answer if we consider the case of
bodies which can exist in two distinct states under the same circumstances
of pressure and volume ; and for the present we may confine our atten
tion to water, which is the most conspicuous representative of the class,
and which, at the ordinary atmospheric pressure and at temperatures
between 0° C. and 4° C.,exists in a series of states in which the volumes
are the same as those which        it assumes if heated at the       same    pressure
from 4° C. to about 8° C.
   Heuce whereas for higher temperatures all the properties of water
at atmospheric pressure are completely defined if we know the volume,
such is not the case between the limits above indicated ; but each point
on the line of constant pressure given by p=1 atmosphere between its
intersections with the isothermals 0° C. and 4° C. corresponds to two
states of the water, or rather, since     if   the water-substance    be converted
into ice it will, if cooled sufficiently, again pass through the same range
of volumes, each point corresponds to three states and is the intersection
of three isothermals ; and as a similar remark may be made with respect
to neighbouring lines of constant pressure, it follows that there is a
region in the plane of pv such that three states of the water-substance
correspond to each point within         it,
                                          and that therefore the values of          p
and    given by any such point do not define the state of the water.

   If, however, from every point in the plane of pv we draw perpendicu
lars to that plane, proportional to those values of some other property of
the water (say, in this case, its temperature) which correspond to the
conditions of pressure and volume represented by the points from which
they are drawn, the extremities of such ordinates will form    surface      a
which will be met once, or more than once, by any particular ordinate,
according as the water can exist under the circumstances of pressure

drawn in only one or in several states.
  This surface will be represented by the equation
                                  /Qn.<)=0     ;
and curves may be drawn on it showing the relations between the
pressure, volume, and temperature when the state of the water is altered
in any determinate manner, the projections on the plane of pv of those
represented by the equation to the surface, combined with
                                   (IH
forming the boundaries of the region from all points in which               ordinates
can be drawn parallel to the axis of t which intersect the surface in two
or more points.  The ordinary adiabatics drawn on the plane of pv are
the orthogonal projections of curves on the surface, each of which is
defined by the condition that the water in passing through the series of
states indicated by its successive points neither gains nor loses heat, and
which, to avoid confusion, will be called complete adiabatics.
    Let now the line LM in the plane of pv (fig. 1)         be the   line p = 1   atmo
sphere.       Draw an ordinate from    L
                                       meeting the surface in A-andB;
then, if different complete adiabatics pass through A and B, their pro
jections on the plane of pv will intersect ; and the only hypothesis on
which we can avoid the assumption of the intersection of adiabatics is
that the complete adiabatics are the intersections of the characteristic
surface fiipvt)=0 with cylindrical surfaces, the director curves of which
are the plane adiabatics, and the generating lines parallel to the axis
of t. In this case the same complete adiabatic would pass through
every such pair of points as A and B, which is evidently impossible, as
in performing the cycle AQBPA the water would absorb heat along
AQB without at any time emitting        it,
                                       and yet would neither increase its
internal energy nor perform any external work, since the cycle projects
into straight line and discontinuous curve meeting in only one point.

As, therefore,   complete adiabatic cannot pass through A and B, and as
                  a
a similar train of reasoning would hold for the third point in which AB
meets     the surface,   three adiabatics as well    as three isothermals          pass
through the point on the plane of pv, which         is   the common projection       of
these points.
    As this conclusion disproves M. Verdet's theorem, we may               proceed to
consider     few simple propositions based on the hypothesis of the possi
              a
bility of the intersection of adiabatics and in so doing will be advisable
                                           ;                     it
to use    new term to distinguish between two classes of points of inter
          a
section of the projections on the plane of pv of curves on the surface                ;
and reserving the usual expressions (intersect, cut, meet, Ac.) for the pro
jections of points of intersection on the surface, we shall say that two curves
cross one another when they meet in        point which does not correspond

to any such point of intersection, but is only the common projection of
two separate points on the surface.
   In the first place, then, we know that if water, starting from an initial
state such that addition of heat at constant pressure is accompanied by
diminution of volume, be allowed to expand without receiving or emitting
heat, its temperature will rise ; t. e. it will at the same time be doing
work, solely at the expense of its internal energy, and rising in tempera
ture — a process which cannot gdfci indefinitely, as at last all the internal
energy would be due to the temperature alone, and any further per
formance of work would necessarily involve a fall in temperature.
   Hence there must be a point of maximum temperature on the complete
adiabatic drawn through the point representing the initial state ; and the
isothermals through all other points on the same curve which lie within
the region, in which addition of heat involves contraction, must meet it
twice.    The projections of these curves will also necessarily intersect in
two points ; and since when an adiabatic and isothermal meet the
tangent to the former always makes the larger acute angle with the axis
of v (Maxwell, ' Theory of Heat,' p. 130), it follows that the two curves
must also cross at some point between their points of intersection, and
will thus form two loops.
   This result holds however near the points of intersection may be
together ; and when they coincide the curves on the characteristic surface
touch one another, and their projections on the plane of pv have contact
of the second order, since three points, i. e. the two points of intersection
and the crossing point, are coincident ; and, further, the isothermal which
thus touches the adiabatic is evidently that which corresponds to the
maximum temperature above mentioned ; and the point of contact lies on
the curve which is the boundary between the regions in which elevation
and depression of temperature are respectively the results of compression,
for at neighbouring points on the adiabatic the temperature is lowered
when the volume is either increased or diminished.
   All  the points of maximum temperature on the complete adiabatics lie
on the curve defined by the condition
and since at all points on this curve the tangent planes to the surface are
perpendicular to the plane of pv, therefore the projections on that plane
of all curves intersecting it touch its projection, because their tangents
lie in a plane perpendicular   to that of pv, and are projected      into  one
line.
   Hence the projection of any curve which meets this curve must at the
projection of the point of section touch an adiabatic.
   But the ordinary interpretation  put upon contact of an odd order with
an adiabatic is that ths body passing     through the cycle of operations

represented by the curve, st the point of contact ceases to emit and
begins to absorb heat, or vice versa ; and that therefore every closed
cycle, if a continuous curve, must have 2n points of contact of an odd
order with adiabatics, and            if   a discontinuous        curve, 2n—
                                                            such points of         r
contact and    r
               points of discontinuity at which the curve does not cut the
adiabatics passing through them.
  This, however, evidently does not hold for a curve which                                meets     the
curve in the plane of pv, denned by  #
which is the projection of the curve in space, whose equations are
                                  /(j-0-o,(|)-o.
For since it   does not      follow that the curves in    contact because
                                                                   space have
their projections touch, we see that the curve in the plane of pv may
touch an adiabatic without any change taking place in the absorption or
emission of heat ; and such a curve may, even if continuous, have contact
of an odd order with an odd number of adiabatics. The point of contact,
for instance, of a curve which touches but does not intersect the limiting
curve at all points on which                               projects into a point       of contact    of

                                       and therefore                                                 lie
entirely between the adiabatic and projection of the limiting curve, which
only have contact of the first order — e.     has  single point of contact

an odd number of points of contact of an odd order with adiabatics.
  Let us now suppose that ABB'A' and                        a/3/3'a' are two adiabatics (fig.        4)
which meet the curve                   —    O.andlettwoisothermals, Aaa'A'andB/3/?B',
meet the first in       AA' and BB'             and the second in aa and               respectively.
We can now make the water go through Carnot's cycle of                                   operations
between the same temperatures in four different ways, of which we need
only consider the cycles a'A'B'fi and a'A'B/3. In each of these the quan
tities of heat received along A' are the same, therefore the quantities
                                           a'                                                        of

 classes,     according as the pressure corresponding to the freezing-point                            is
or    is   not less than the maximum tension of aqueous vapour at the given
temperature.

bility of the existence of water at the given temperature and pressure
proves that the freezing-point for the given pressure  below the tempe        is

great pressures contraction instead of expansion accompanies solidifica

      In
      conclusion it is only necessary to point out that some of the results
in the earlier  part of the paper follow immediately from the ordinary
formulae of thermodynamics.

           Cp and C„

and
where       Q    is   constant   for auy adiabatic.    From the first    it   follows   that

                                      dt
and therefore the contact is of the second order.
   P.S. Since the above was written, a paper has been published in the
'Annales de Chimie et de Physique' for March 1874, in which the
author, M. J. Moutier, is led, from thermodynamical considerations, to
the conclusion that it is impossible for aqueous vapour in contact with
ice to have the same tension as when it is in contact with water at the
same temperature     ; and as some conclusions have been pointed out in the
preceding pages    which  follow ou the assumption that at the triple point
the tension of the vapour is the same in each case, it may be well to show
that his arguments do not really touch the question as to which of the
two hypotheses is the true one.
   M. Moutier discusses the case of      a body which    can exist in two  dif
ferent states, M   and  M', such as the solid and liquid ; and supposing that
the tension of the vapour is different according as it is iu contact with
the first or second, he obtains a general formula for the heat of trans
formation from    M to M', from a consideration of the quantities of heat
gained or lost   if the body is compelled to undergo a definite series of
changes constituting a closed cycle (p. 348).
   The second operation in this cycle is that the body M' passes from the
pressure m to the pressure p' ; and in the application of the general
formula to the case of water, M is taken to represent ice at 0° C, M1
liquid water at the same temperature, is the atmospheric pressure, and y
the tension of aqueous vapour over liquid water at 0°C. (p. 362).
   If, however, the symbols have these meanings, the prescribed operation
is, in the case of water, impossible ; for as water cannot exist at 0° C.
in the liquid state at less than the atmospheric pressure, the body JT
would be converted into M as soon as the pressure m was diminished,
and no conclusions can be drawn from the cycle in question in the case
of water.               •
   M. Moutier employs      a second argument which can be      shown to   have
no greater weight than that already discussed, and which may be         stated
as follows : —
   If  Q is the latent heat of conversion of ice into water, and L     and L'
the latent heats of conversion of ice and water respectively into       steam,
then at the triple point we must have
                                  Q=L-L'.
L  and  L' are given by the well-known formulas

and v' the pressures and specific volumes of steam over ice and water

and as    —   is positive, being derived from formulae which have reference
          dt
to the maximum tension of the vapour, and u' — u is negative, it follows
that Q, or the latent heat of water, is negative, a result which shows that
some    of the premises must be false.
   The erroneous assumption, however, is not the possibility of the
existence of the triple point, but is contained in the equation

the northern hemisphere (of which No. XIII. comprised the higher lati
tudes).     It consists of a very brief explanatory introduction, followed by

    This paper was commenced by the author more than twenty years
since, with a view to the geological bearing of the subject, but was for
some years unavoidably interrupted.             It has now been brought down
                                 '            '
to 1868, the       date of  the    Lightning expedition, when the subject was
taken up by Dr. Carpenter, by whom it has since been so ardently and
ably carried on. Nevertheless, as Dr. Carpenter's work relates almost
solely to recent investigations, the author considers that there is yet con
siderable interest attached to the work of the earlier observers from 1 750
to 1868, though he feels that much of it is necessarily superseded by the
great and more exact work subsequent to 1868.               He is aware that the
older observations have also not been deemed reliable on account of the
error caused by pressure on the thermometers at depths ; but this is far
from applying to the whole of them, as that error was taken into account
so early as 1836, if not before, and a large number of these observations
are equally reliable with the more recent ones, while the greater part of
the others admit of corrections which render them sufficiently available.
     In  1 830, Gehler gave a list of 226 observations, and D'Urville, in 1833,
 tabulated 421 experiments according to depths.               The present paper
 contains    a  record  of about   1300  observations, which are arranged accord
 ing to the degrees of latitude : — 1st, for the northern hemisphere ; 2nd,
 the southern hemisphere ; 3rd, inland seas.            They are all reduced to
 common scales of thermometer, measure of depth, and meridian.               Their
 position is given on a map of the world, and the bathymetrieal isotherms
 from the Poles to the Equator, based on the correct and corrected obser
 vations, are given in a series of ten sections.        The author does not claim
 for these observations the exact value, or the unity and completeness of
 plan, of the more recent ones, while, as compared with them, the depths at
 which they were made are on the whole very limited ; still they include
 a few at great depths       ; and as they extend over much ground        that has
 not been covered by the expeditions of the ' Lightning,' ' Porcupine,' and
 '
   Challenger,' he trusts that these Tables may be of some use as comple-
 mental to these later researches, and as bringing together and reducing to a
 common standard, observations scattered through a large number of
 works and memoirs.         At the same time, the author would observe that he
 tliinks it due to our many distinguished foreign colleagues who have been
 engaged     in the inquiry, and whose work seems but little known, that the
 results of their researches should be understood in this country.           Their

 "Wanting a reliable self-registering thermometer, the early observers, for
 a considerable time, used a machine contrived by Dr. Hales to bring up
 ¦water, by means of a bucket with valves, from the depth at which the
 temperature was to be taken.        This was used by Ellis, Cook, Scoresby,
  Wauchope, and Franklin, and one of a form improved by Parrot was em
  ployed by Lenz. Scoresby's observations in the seas around Spitsbergen are
  of much interest.     He showed that while at the surface the temperature
  varied from about 29° to 42°, the temperature at depths of from 2000 to
  4000 feet was generally about 34° to 36° ; and there is reason to believe
  that, with the very slight corrections suggested by Lenz's subsequent
  researches, most of them are correct within a fraction of a degree.
      The most remarkable readings, however, taken with this apparatus were
  those obtained by Lenz in Kotzebue's expedition of 1823. He applied to
  the observations a correction founded on Biot's law of the variations of
  temperature experienced by bodies in passing through mediums of different
  temperature,    and determined the lowest temperatures hitherto noted in
   intertropical seas. Thus, one sounding in mid-Atlantic, 7° 21' N. lat., at a
   depth of 3435 feet, gave a corrected reading of 35°-8 F., and another at a
   depth of 5835 feet, in mid-Pacific, 21° 14' N. lat., gave 36°-4 F., the surface
   temperatures being 78°-5 and 79°-5.       His observations on the specific
   gravity of sea-water are also valuable.
       Saussure and Peron used thermometers surrounded with non-conduct
   ing substances, so that they might pass through the warmer upper strata of
   water with little change. Saussure's experiments deserve notice, inasmuch
    as, after applying a correction, they recorded, at that early period, for

464                       Mr. J.  Prestwich on Tables      of          [Juue    18,
the Mediterranean, at a depth of 1000 to 2000 feet, a temperature,               so
nearly right, of 550,5.
   Sir John Boss and Admiral Spratt sometimes used Six's thermometers,
and at others took the temperature of the silt brought up from the bottom.
The former obtained readings of 280,5 F. for Baffin's Bay, and the latter
of about 55° for the Grecian archipelago, agreeing therefore closely with
good thennometrical observations.
   Phipps used a differential overflow thermometer invented by Cavendish,
but it was not found to answer.           This form of instrument remained in
abeyance until a greatly improved form of it was contrived by "Wal-
ferdin {thermometre a deversement) in 1836.              It was used by Mar
tins and Bravais in the Arctic seas, and by Aime" in the Mediterranean,
and was said to give very satisfactory results.         Aime also used another
somewhat similar instrument, which, at a given depth, was reversed and
then hauled up. These instruments have the great advantage of being
free from errors arising from the shifting or immobility of the index.
It is not clear why their use was abandoned, except that they were dim-
cult to construct and not generally known.
   Six described his thermometer in 1782 ; but the first person to use it
was Erusenstern, in 1803. It did not come into general use for deep-
sea observations until the Arctic voyages of Boss and Parry, after
which date it was, with the exception of Lena's and Aime's, employed
for that purpose on all the expeditions sent out by foreign governments,
as well as by our own.           The necessity of protecting the instrument
against pressure was early insisted upon by Lenz, Arago, Biot, and
others  ;  and there is reason to believe that protected thermometers were
used by D'Urville and Berard, for their observations in the same Medi
terranean area show a remarkably close agreement with those recently
made by     Dr. Carpenter, with protected instruments, at and below depths
of about 200 fathoms, the results being : —

   It was, however, on       Du Petit .Thouars's  voyage of 1836 that the first
special steps were taken to protect the thermometer against pressure.
For that purpose an improved instrument of Bunten's was provided,
and this was enclosed in a strong brass cylinder.         Fifty-nine observations
were made, of which Arago reported that 21 might be considered perfectly
good.     Temperatures of 36°, 37°, and 38° F. were recorded at depths
(900  to   1100 brasses) in both the mid-Atlantic and mid-Pacific ; while
in one case, in taking a sounding at a depth of 12,271 feet near the
equator in the Pacific, the instrument came up crushed, but with the index
fixed at 34°-8 F. (l°-6 or 1°7 C). In a certain number of cases                the
                                                                         (24)

pressure forced water into the cylinder.          For these corrections were
made.
    In  1839,   MM. Martins     and Bravais made a series of observations in
the    sea between    Norway and Spitzbergen with instruments carefully
protected against pressure by means of glass tubes or metal cylinders.
They used both self-registering thermometers             (thermometrogrctphes)
and Walferdin's self-registering overflow thermometers, sending down
two to four of each in every sounding, and taking the mean of the readings.
These probably are amongst the most accurate observations on record.
To a great extent they confirm those of Scoresby; and they further
showed that the bottom-temperature         near the Spitzbergen glaciers was
about 29°   F.     None of the soundings   exceeded 3000 feet.
    In  1857, the late Admiral    FitzRoy furnished Captain Pullen with ther
mometers specially constructed to resist pressure, and some very interest
ing, though somewhat variable results, were obtained therewith.        On two
occasions a temperature of 35° F. was recorded — one in the Atlantic,
26° 46' 8., at a depth of 16,200 feet, and the other in the Indian Ocean,
at a depth of 13,980 feet.
    With regard to the many observations       made with unprotected instru
ments, they mostly admit of correction, which renders them available.
 Such corrections have been independently computed, with little difference,
 by Du Petit Thouars, Martins, Aime, and the late Dr. Miller.              The
 author, taking the mean of their estimates, uses as a coefficient —1°   F. for
every 1700 feet of depth.
    In the third part of the paper the author shows the " State of the
 Question at the date of the Lightning Expedition."            Ellis, Forster,
 Peron, and others early remarked on the decrease of temperature at depths
 in temperate and tropical seas, but it was not until 1823 that Lenz
 showed that a temperature of 35° to 36° existed at greater depths in
 those seas. Notwithstanding this, D'Urville in 1826, misled by incorrect
 readings obtained by previous observers with uncorrected instruments, and
 in the absence of sufficiently deep observations of his own, was led to
 believe that the temperature in open seas at and below a depth of 3214
 feet (600 brasses) was nearly uniform at 39°-8 F. (4°-4 O), and that be
 tween the latitudes of 40° and 60° there is a belt of a like nearly uniform
 temperature.      A few years later, Arago, discussing the results obtained
 by  Du   Petit Thouars,   insisted that they effectually disproved this hy
 pothesis.    Nevertheless, in 1839, Sir James Ross made the same mis
 take as D'Urville, and unfortunately obtained for it a wider circulation,
 which seems, however, to have been almost altogether restricted to this
 country.    Still, Ross's numerous observations, when viewed under cor
 rection, are of considerable value, though the author considers that some
 error has occasionally crept into that uniform reading, so often recorded,
 of exactly 39o-5.    Both D'Urville and Ross wrote under the opinion that
 sea-water, like fresh water, attained its maximum density at a tempera

   ¦1G6                  Mr. J. Prcstwich    on Tables   of           [June 18,
   tare of between 39° and 40°, — a point that had been investigated and
   disproved by Marcet in 1819, approximately determined by Ermann in
   1822, and which was finally settled by Despretz, in 1837, at 25°-4 F.
      While the law of the decrease of temperature with the depth, in both
   the great oceans, to a point but little above the zero of Centigrade was
  being established, experiments had been carried on in polar seas showing,
  on the contrary, that the temperature at depths was higher than the
  average surface-temperature.       The careful experiments of Scoresby and
  of Martins fully established this for the Arctic seas, and those of Eoss,
  after correction, establish the same fact for the Antarctic Ocean.         In
  one part, however, of the Arctic seas this rule has not been found to
  hold good ; for, in Baffin's Bay, the experiments of John Ross, Sabine, and
  Parry, at depths of from 600 to 6000 feet, agree in showing a decrease
  of temperature of from 30° to 32° near the surface, to 29° and 28°-5 at
  the greatest depths attained.     There are also two instances given of yet
  lower temperatures.
     Nor were observations wanting in inland seas. Those of Saussure,
  D'UrvUle, and Berard had indicated generally that, in the Mediterranean,
 the temperature decreased to a depth of about 1200 feet, after which it re
  mained uniform at from 54° to 55° F. ; and, in 1844, Anne instituted a series
 of experiments which resulted in showing that the diurnal influence ceased
  to be sensible at a depth of from 16 to 18 metres, and the annual variation
 at a depth of from 300 to 400 metres, below which the temperature
  remained constant at 12°-6 C. (54°-6) ; and this he showed to be the mean
 winter temperature of the area of the Mediterranean, over which his
  observations extended.       These observations w"ere confirmed, for the
 Eastern Mediterranean, by those of Admiral Spratt. His first experiments
 in the Grecian archipelago showed, at a depth of 1200 feet, a temperature
 of 54°'5 to 55° F., while the later ones, at greater depths in the open sea,
 give, after correction, a temperature of about 55°. In the Eed Sea,
 Captain Pullen found that while the surface-temperature varied from 77°
 to 86° F., it fell to 70° or 71° F. at 1200 to 1400 feet, below which
 it remained uniformly the        same to the greatest depth he attained of
 4068 feet.     Some curious results were obtained in 1803-6 by Dr. Horner
 in the Sea of Okhotsh.       The surface-temperature was 46°-4F. ; and the
 author finds (after correcting the original readings) at 360 feet a tempera
ture of 28°, and at 690 feet of 28°-6, which is almost exactly that determined
by Despretz as the temperature of sea-water at the moment of congelation.
     The cause of the decrease of temperature with the depth in the great
oceans was early investigated by physicists.        Humboldt concluded that
" the existence of   these cold layers  in low latitudes proves the existence
of an undercurrent    flowing from the poles to the equator."     DAubuisson
and Pouillet took the same view.        D'Urville went further, and remarked
that " it is rather a transport nearly in mass, and very slow, of the deep
waters of high latitudes towards the equator," and that from his zone of

1874.]          Temperatures of the Sea at various Depths.                  467
40° to 60° lat. there are two insensible     currents  — a lower one towards
the equator, and an upper one towards the poles.           Arago saw no other
explanation than
                     "  the existence of submarine currents carrying to the
equator the bottom waters of the icy seas."
    We are, however, indebted to Lenz for a      full and philosophical review
of the whole subject in 1847. After showing that all the facts proved the
existence of a temperature of from 34° to 35° F. at depths in the tropical
seas, and that this could only be maintained by a constant slow under
current from the poles to the equator (which, on the other hand, must
necessitate the transfer by an upper current of the equatorial waters to
the poles), he proceeds to show by a series of observations, chiefly those
of Kotzebue, and by a diagram, that a belt of cooler water existed at the
 equator, and that the temperature, at equal depths, was lower there
than a few degrees to the north and south of it ; and he concluded
 that this arose from the circumstance that the deep-seated polar waters
there met and rose to the surface.           As corroborating    this view, he
 showed that the waters      in the same zone were    of lower specific gravitv,
 a fact that had been before noticed by     Humboldt.
     The author then proceeds to consider some " General Conclusions.''
 Some of these have now been better established by the more recent
 expeditions and by the researches of Dr. Carpenter.          Taking, however,
 other areas, he shows that in the Arctic Ocean the bathymetrical isotherm
 of 35° is deepest on the west of Spitzbergen, while nearer Greenland and
 again nearer Norway the deep waters are colder.         The several isothermal
 planes of 40°, 50°, 60°, 70°, and 80° are then traced southward, attaining
 their maximum depth between 50° and 40° lat., and rising theneo towards
 the equator.    Section No. 2, from Baffin's Bay to the equator, shows that
 the higher isotherms are not prolonged so far north as on the first line,
 and that the water at the bottom of the bay is colder than in the Spitz
 bergen seas, approaching much nearer that of its maximum density and
  of its point of congelation ; whence he concludes that this is the main
  source of supply of the deep-seated cold waters in the Atlantic, which,
  after attaining their greatest depths between latitudes 40° to 50° N.,
  are found 3000 to 4000 feet nearer the surface ou approaching the
  equator.
     In the South Atlantic, the bathymetrical isotherms show lesser curves ;
  and while the isotherm of 40° crops out between the lat. of 50° and 55°,
  that of 35° is prolonged into high southern latitudes on a nearly uniform
  plane of 7000 to 8000 feet deep.
     In the Pacific,   the sections show that, notwithstanding there is no
  appreciable polar current through Behring's Straits, the bathymetrical
  isotherms of 60°, 50°, and 45° do not extend so far north as in the
  Atlantic, while that of 35° is apparently not prolonged beyond 60° N. lat.
  As the presence of temperatures lower than those which prevail in

468               On Tables of Temperatures of the Sea.           [June    18,
parallel latitudes in the Atlantic cannot be due to north polar waters,
and seems more than could be maintained by local influences, the author
concludes that the effect may probably be due to waters from the Antarctic
Ocean, of the presence of which the low temperatures at depths throughout
the Pacific affords evidence, passing, in the absence of any counter flow,
to the extremity of the North Pacific, where they are thrown upwards by
the rising slopes of the ocean-bed, as on banks in open oceans. On the
other hand, in the South Pacific the conditions seem very similar to those
in the South Atlantic. The bathymetrical isotherms appear, however, to
be prolonged   further south than in the South Atlantic, which arises pos
sibly from the circumstance that as none, or comparatively none, of the
warm equatorial water can pass into the Arctic Ocean, a larger proportion
passes into the Antarctic seas.
   In  the Southern and Indian Oceans the conditions     seem  analogous to
those of the North Pacific, only they are more masked by the high surface-
temperatures of the Arabian Gulf.
   The author agrees in the opinion which has been advanced of the
flow over the ocean-bottom of cold undercurrents at and below 35°, one
from the north and the other from the south pole to the equator,
and of their rise in the equatorial regions of the Atlantic.           They
must, then, necessarily tend to disperse and escape into other areas : but
whether by a movement in mass of the upper strata, or by currents in
more definite channels, or by both causes combined, remains to be proved
by further research.   He inclines to the latter view. He would suggest
the question whether the Gulf-stream, together with others which seem to
originate or acquire additional power in equatorial seas, such as the
Guinea and Brazilian currents, may not receive either their initial     start;
or bo strengthened and maintained by the surging-up of the Arctic
and Antarctic waters at the equator, while another portion of those
waters may be deflected back in insensible currents to polar regions.
In  the same way some of the great currents      of the North Pacific may
arise.
   The paper concludes by    a renew of the other causes connected with
these conditions, by a consideration of the normal isotherms of the polar
regions, and by a comparison of the temperatures of inland seas, which
are dependent on local climatal conditions, with those of the great oceans,
which are subject to such vast distant influences ; and he directs attention
to the important bearing which these questions of oceanic physics have
on many geological problems.

          XXIII. "On        the Sun-spot Period and the Rainfall."
                             By   J.   A. Bkoun, F.R.S.
    Having read with much interest Mr. Meldrum's communication to the
Eoyal Society on the apparent simultaneity of excess of rainfall and sun-
spot area*,     I have waited some confirmation of his conclusions from a
more extensive induction. Mr. Hennessey's " Note " in the Proceedings
of the Society for April 1874 t induces me to offer the following views
and results to the Royal Society.
     It is well known that the amount of rainfall is a very variable quan
tity in some countries and in certain positions, and that when there is
a year of drought in one part of the world, there is frequently an excess
of rain in another.        Any investigation, then, which should be occupied
with the average fall of rain over the earth's surface must be long and
laborious, unless the variation to be dealt with is large and marked com
pared with others which must be considered purely accidental relatively
to the sun's spots. In proof of this           I may cite the rainfall at Mussoorie
 given by Mr. Hennessey:}:, where, as far as the sun-spot area is known,
 any result favourable to the connexion of the two phenomena depends
 wholly on the rainfall for 1861, which is upwards of 50 inches in excess
 of the mean. If this excess be not due to the great spot-area, then a
 long series of years' observations might be requisite to make the positive
 and negative errors destroy each other.
     It has been with the intention of determining what may be the effect
 of a given change of sun-spot area, within a limited district, during a
 period favourable to the connexion of the two phenomena, that the fol
 lowing discussions have been made. We can then say approximately
 within what limits the      excess and deficiency of       rainfall lie for the years
 of greatest and least spot-area, what amount of observations may be re
  quired to destroy accidental variations, and whether the result may en
  courage   more extensive research.
     Mr. Meldrum finds      a mean difference      of 8-5 inches of rain between the
  falls for the years of greatest and least spot-area § ; but this result is
  derived to some extent from short series of observations made in different
  parts of the world, and gives no weight to the rainfall in other years than
  those considered years of maximum or minimum sun-spots.
      Should there be any connexion betwixt the rainfall and spot-area, we
  may always in the first instance represent it approximately by an equa
  tion of this form,

 is the excess or defect of spot-area for the same period                 of time, and/ is
 a constant to be deduced from the observations.
    Having obtained the mean spot-area for each year from 1832 to 1S67,
 from Table VII. of the paper on this subject by Messrs. De La En*.
 Stewart, and Loewy*, the mean for three periods of 11 years (1832 to
 1864) was found equal to G43 millionths of the sun's visible surface ; wrb
 this quantity the values of + AA (in millionths of the sun's surface) for
 each year were obtained.
    Mr. Meldrum's conclusion depends chiefly on observations during these
 periods in Great Britain ; and as he has deduced the rainfall for the fir?;
 period of minimum spots from observations at three stations, Greenwich,
 Carbeth (near Glasgow), and Aberdeen,                I first examined the observatio&;
 at these places together with simultaneous observations at Makerstoun
 for the two periods 1832 to 18531".                Applying the above equation to
 these observations, the following results were obtained                : —
                      Greenwich                AB= -0-00092 AA ;
                      Makerstoun         .... AB.= -0-00020 AA ;
                      Carbeth                  AE= +0-00158 AA ;
                      Aberdeen                 AE= 4-0-00128 AA.
 Greenwich and Makerstoun are thus opposed to the conclusion, and
Carbeth and Aberdeen are more strongly in its favour.                         It   should be
remarked, however, that the result for Aberdeen depends wholly on the
rainfall given for that place in 1834 (12-3 in.) being exact.                        As it b
 12 inches less than the mean, while at the other three stations the defi
ciency is only from 0-6 in. at Greenwich and Makerstoun to 1-2 in. at
Carbeth, this may be due to a leaky rain-gauge or to a clerical error of
10 inches.      In any case no great weight can be given to the conclusion
from these four stations J.
    I now sought for an approximation to the mean fall of rain for Great
Britain, and for this end have employed the quantities deduced by Mr.
Symons from ten stations (British Association Eeport, 18G5, p. 203 ;
1871, p. 102). The differences of spot-area from the mean, in millionths
of the sun's surface, and of the rainfall for each year are given in the
following Table : —
   * Phil. Trans. 1870, p. 399.

21-49 in. ; 1851, 25 57 in. ; 1852, 32-20in. ; 1853, 23-54 in.
   \ It may here be noted that the sum of the plus and minus differences of R and the
mean rainfall for the four stations during the twenty-two years were —
                           Greenwich.      Makerstoun.       Carbeth.      Aberdeen.

    If  we seek the value of        / for the mean of the three periods               of eleven

years commencing 1832 and 1835, we find the following equations                             :
                    1832 to 1864                   AE= +0-0019 AA ;
                   1835 to 1867                    AR= +0-0011 AA.
    These results, then, are, as we expected, in conformity with Mr. Mel-
 drum's conclusion ; so that if we compare the year of largest with that of
 smallest spot-area, the difference of rainfall should amount to 2-61 in. by
the first and to 1-51 in. by the second value of/.                    If we take the mean
 spot-area    for the    years  1834,    1844,   1856,   and    1866,    and for 1836, 1848,
 and 1861, we find that the mean difference of rainfall for these years
 should be 2-06 in. by the first and 1-20 in. by the second value of /, in
 stead of    8'45in.   as found by      Mr. Meldrum.
    It will   be seen also that the greatest mean difference                 of rainfall is that
 for the years 1841, 1852, and 1863, and this was an excess of rain for
 years of spot-area deficiency         ;  were another such opposite difference to
 present itself, it       would neutralize the conclusion derived from these
 means.      It should also be observed that while the first and third periods
 of eleven years are in favour of the connexion, the second (1843 to 1853)
 is opposed to it. (this is also the case for the eleven years 1857 to 1867).
     It  will be seen, then, that from this discussion a probable difference of
 about 2 inches       of rain may be expected betwixt years of greatest and
  least spot-area.
     This result is derived from observations               at ten stations, distributed
  over a very small patch         of the earth's surface      ;  and it is evident that for
  any serious investigation         a much larger series        of  observations represent
  ing the rainfall over a great extent of country would be essential.

    I now     examined observations made at different stations        in India   ; bat
this examination showed the extreme difficulty of obtaining a satisfactory
result, either way, from a few stations in that country,           when, in certain
years, the accidental excess of rainfall at some of the            stations may be
40 inches, even though           deficiencies at some    stations may diminish the
amount of the error.
    From my own experience of rainfall on the Indian ghats,                   I should
doubt that a mountain-station,            such as Mussoorie, is well fitted to be
employed in this discussion.           If a single station could be taken to repre
sent any tract of country, it ought to be one least liable to local causes of
variation.        Among the mountains a slight change in the average direc
tion of the wind will cause great differences in the rainfall at stations
but little distant from each other, and to eliminate accidental variations
of 40 or 80 inches would require observations during a very long series
of years.

 greatest spot-area.        The examination of many series of observations has
 shown how difficult it will be to arrive at a conclusion for a quantity so
 small as 2 inches of rain.
     It  is evident that a larger tract of country than Great Britain should
 be chosen, and the approximate rainfall be deduced from the greatest
    t For the rainfall at Mahabuleshwar, see Colonel Sykes's paper on Indian obserTa-
 tions, Phil. Trans. 1850, p. 367. The mean fall is 253 0 inches.

                      On the Absorption       of Carbonic Acid.                 483
" Ou     the     Absorption of Carbonic Acid by Saline Solutions."
        By J. Y. Buchanan, Chemist on hoard H.M.S. ' Challenger.'
        Communicated by Professor A.W.Williamson, For. Sec. R.S.
        Received December 11, 1873*.
    In the examination of sea- water, whether it be regarded from a chemical
or from a zoological point of view, the determination of and the varia
tions in the amount of carbonic acid in different parts of ocean must
always be an object of importance.             This is more especially so when a
parallel series of observations on the quantity of oxygen present is
carried out.       At the surface we should expect to find the quantities of
these gases following the law of partial pressures ; at greater depths,
however, where the water for long periods only comes in contact with
water, we should expect to find the quantity of oxygen decreasing and
that of carbonic acid increasing with the amount of animal life. The in
vestigation from this point of view of the bottom-water, at greater and
smaller depths, presents perhaps a more interesting field of observation
than that of intermediate depths. Down to nearly 2000 fathoms life is
still abundant ; below this depth, however, the amount rapidly decreases
till, at about 2800 fathoms, it is, for carbonic-acid producing purposes,
practically extinct.        We have, then, to settle the variation of the car
bonic acid with latitude and longitude, with depth, with nature of bottom,
and with nature of atmosphere.
    In order to solve these problems, it is before all necessary to have a
 reliable method for the determination of the carbonic acid.                For the
 discovery of a cause of error in the old method, and for the invention
 of a new one, we are indebted to Dr. Jacobsen, of Kiel. Dr. Jacobsen
 found that sea-water could not, as had been till then assumed, bo
 thoroughly freed from its dissolved carbonic acid by merely boiling in
 vacuo t.      He found that it was necessary to boil down almost to dryness
 before the last traces of carbonic acid could be expelled.             Being parti
 cularly   interested    in  the matter,   I  immediately  commenced     a series of
 experiments to determine, if possible, the salt or salts to which sea-water
 owes this peculiar property. A short resume of the results of these ex
 periments have been published            as an appendix    to Professor    Wyville
 Thomson's ' Depths of the Sea.'
     I purpose    here to give a detailed account of the experiments performed.
 They consisted of two series — the one analytical, the other synthetical.

    t Dr.  Andrews informs me that he had observed a similar phenomenon when at
 tempting to determine the amount of atmospheric gases in sea-water, by boiling it in
 the Torricellian vacuum after the manner of vapour-density determinations.

484          Mr.   J.   Y. Buchanan    on the Absorption          of
laboratory in the University of Edinburgh, and            I
                                                 gladly avail myself of
this opportunity to thank them both.
   The analytical series consisted of experiments on solutions of the
different salts saturated with carbonic acid.         A
                                                  certain quantity of each
was distilled almost to dryness, the steam being condensed in an ordinary
Liebig's condenser, to which was fitted a tubulated receiver, having a
bulbed V-tube attached containing baryta-water.       The distillation was
interrupted and the baryta-water changed after the passage of every
eighth of the distillate, the amount of carbonic acid passed being roughly
estimated by the apparent turbidity of the baryta-water.      The object of
these experiments being to find out which of a number of saline solutions
had the property of retaining carbonic acid, and to ascertain roughly what
length of time one must boil in order thoroughly to expel              it,
                                                                an accurate
determination of the carbonic acid actually passing during the intervals
would have been superfluous.     Besides these,   number of quantitative
                                                      a
determinations   were made of the amount of carbonic acid actually
absorbed by different solutions.
  The synthetical series consisted of experiments for the determination
of the absorption-coefficients of two solutions — the one of sulphate of
magnesia, the other of sulphate of lime.
   Let us take the analytical series first. As before remarked,      sub     it   is
divided into two sets, which we shall treat in their order.   In the one
observations were made on the elimination of the carbonic acid as the
distillation proceeded   ;  in the other an attempt was made to determine
how much carbonic acid, in    a    saline solution saturated with the gas, was
actually   retained   or bound,   or  at least kept from freely exercising its
properties as a    gas, by the presence of the salt in the solution.
    First Experiment.   — In  order to havea    certain standard of comparison
in judging the retardation caused by salts in the escape of carbonic acid
from solutions on boiling, distilled water was saturated with the gas and
distilled in the manner indicated above. During the passage of the first
eighth of distillate the gas evolution was of course abundant, during the
second  a   perceptible quantity passed, after which no more could be de
tected. It may be assumed, then, that, in the experiments which followed,
the carbonic acid held simply in solution by the water passes almost
entirely in the first eighth part of the distillate, and that whatever
passes afterwards has been retained, in some way or other, by the salt
in solution.      In conducting these experiments no baryta-water was
put in the receiver itself, but only in the V-tube. The water collected
was always tested with baryta-water, and with the general result that
in the first fraction carbonic acid was present in abundance, while in
the latter ones there was rarely   a     trace to be detected.     That the dis
tillate consisting of pure water should contain not           atrace of the gas,
whose presence in the atmosphere above      it   is  attested by the precipitate

                       Carbonic   Acid  by Saline Solutions.                      485
in   the exit-tube, shows that, at feeble pressures, the solution of carbonic
acid requires considerable time for its completion.
    Second Experiment. —A chloride-of-sodium          solution containing 2 per
cent. Na CI had a strong stream of
                                           COa passed through it for about ten
minutes and was then distilled. During the passage of the second*
eighth there was still a considerable quantity, during that of the third a
very slight trace, and after that none.
     Third Experiment. —A chloride-of-magnesium solution containing 0-25
per cent. Mg Cla was treated in the same way as the chloride-of-sodium
 solution, when the whole of the C02 passed in the first fraction.
    Fourth Experiment. —A solution containing 4 per cent. Mg CL, and 10
per cent. Na CI was saturated with COa and allowed to stand in a closed
vessel over night. On distilling, it was found that carbonic acid con
tinued to be given off in perceptible but gradually decreasing quantities
until the end.
    Fifth Experiment. — For this and the three following experiments                  a
 solution    containing 12-3 grammes crystallized sulphate of magnesia (in
a litre?) was used.         Carbonic acid was passed through some of this
 solution for about 10 minutes, and the liquid allowed to stand in a
closed vessel over night.        On distillation there passed during the second
fraction very little, during the third and fourth fractions decidedly
 more, during the fifth again much less, and afterwards, to the end, slight
but perceptible traces of carbonic acid.
    Sixth Experiment. —The solution was heated to nearly boiling, and C02
passed into it until it was cold, the whole being allowed to stand over
night. During the passage of the second, third, fourth, and fifth frac
tions, the amount       of gas was about constant and small.           It  increased
greatly during the sixth, falling away again during the seventh.
    Seventh Experiment. — The conditions were exactly the same as those
 of the fifth experiment ; and the results in the two cases agreed well with
each    other, the amount     of  gas coming off increasing slightly about the
middle of the operation.       In  order to see if the rise of temperature con
sequent on concentration       had any thing to do with the phenomena under
consideration, a thermometer was immersed in the boiling liquid. It read
at the end of the second, third, fourth, and fifth fractions 102°-5, 102°-9,
103°, and 103°-2 respectively.
    Eighth Experiment. — The conditions were the same as in the last,
only that the solution stood two days before distillation. In the re
sults there was this peculiarity, that in the fourth fraction the car
bonic acid disappeared altogether, reappearing, however, again in the
fifth.
    * It is unnecessary in the cases where no means were taken to free the solution
from simply dissolved carbonic acid to repeat in each ono that tho first fraction con
tained abundance.
                                                                   2p2

486            Mr.  J.  Y. Buchanan     on the Absorption   of
   Ninth, Experiment. — Sea-water from the Firth of Forth was distilled.
Hero, as in the case of the sulphate of magnesia, the amount coming off
increased about the middle, fallhig away again in the fifth fraction.       In
the sixth,    however,    it experienced a slight increase, falling off again
towards the end     of the operation.
   From these experiments we may conclude that, alone and in the
degree of concentration in which they occur in the sea, the two most
abundant salts, namely chloride of magnesium and chloride of sodium,
exercise no retarding influence on the liberation of carbonic acid on boil
ing. When mixed, however, as in the fourth experiment, they appear
to have this effect.       Whether, if sufficiently diluted to represent sea-
water, they    would   continue             I
                                 to do so was unable to ascertain, as the
investigation of the sulphates occupied all the time at my disposal.         It
is further evident that, in the sulphate-of-magnesia solution experimented
on, we have a solution which behaves towards carbonic acid in the same
way as sea-water.
   Let us pass now to the second set of the analytical series — namely, the
estimation of the amount of carbonic acid retained in consequence of the
presence of the salts in question.      The apparatus used was the same as
that in the last set, baryta-water being contained both in the receiver
and in the V-tube.
   Experiments were made on solutions of sulphate of magnesia, of sul
phate of magnesia and chloride of sodium, and of sulphate of lime, to
which were added some on sea-water itself. In every experiment the
quantity of solution operated on was 300 c. c.             The carbonic acid
coming    off  was  retained   by baryta-water     of known strength, the re
maining free baryta being afterwards determined by means of oxalic
acid.    Bosolic acid was used to determine the point of neutralization.
The oxalic acid was rather stronger than tenth-normal; it contained
6-478 grms. CaHa 04 + 2H20 in the litre, which is equivalent to 2-259
grms. carbonic acid.       1000 c. c. baryta-water required 3235 c. c. oxalic
acid for neutralization.
   The method of conducting the operation was as follows : — Carbonic
acid was passed through the solution until it could be assumed to be
saturated.     Six to seven litres of air were then drawn through it cold,
after which it was heated to boiliug, and allowed to boil for from two to
three minutes in a current of air.      The receiver with the baryta-solution
was then attached, and the distillation continued in a stream of air,
until the contents of the flask were nearly dry. The baryta-water then
remaining unneutralized was titrated, and from it the amount of carbonic
acid ascertained.
   Experiments on sulphate-of-magnesia solution containing 12'3 grammes
crystallized salt per litre. — As all were conducted in precisely the same
way, it will be sufficient to give the results in a tabular form. The first

three experiments were made with portions of one and the same solu
tion ; for the last two a fresh solution (prepared, to all appearance,
in exactly the same way as the previous one) was used. The differ

    Two experiments were made with a solution prepared as follows : —
The quantity of sulphuric acid necessary for the formation of 12-3
grammes crystallized sulphate of magnesia was diluted to a litre, and
pulverized carbonate of magnesia suspended in it. Although the mixture
was allowed to stand over night, shut off from the influence of the
atmosphere, the solution was still exceedingly acid.                   It is well known
that carbonate of magnesia is difficultly soluble in cold dilute acids.                To
have heated the solution would have frustrated the object of the experi
ment, which was, by bringing nascent sulphate of magnesia together
with nascent carbonic acid at ordinary temperatures, to give them the
best opportunity of combining.
    Two experiments were made with a similarly prepared solution of sul
phate of lime.        In this case sulphuric acid was added to the water in
quantity    sufficient  to form, with lime, more salt than was necessary for
the production of a saturated solution of gypsum.                  Here neutralization
took place      without    difficulty,  and,   as   might   have     been expected, the
amount of carbonic acid formed was considerably greater than in the
case of the magnesia salt.
    Two experiments       were made with an ordinary sulphate-of-magnesia
solution containing      2-05 grammes crystallized salt per litre.
    Two further experiments were made with a solution containing 2-05
grammes sulphate of magnesia and 20 grammes chloride of sodium per
litre. All were conducted in the way described above, and the results are
given in the following Table.          The experiments with the carbonates of
magnesia and lime were            made    at a considerably later date than the
others ; the value of 10 c. c. baryta-water had in consequence become
equivalent to 32 c. c. instead of 32-34 c. c. oxalic acid.

    Five experiments were made with sea-water taken at the end of
 Portobello Pier, on the Firth of Forth.                          In the first three it was sub
 mitted immediately to the same treatment as the saline solutions ; in the
 last two carbonic acid was first passed through it for some time. As the
 results given in the following Table are identical, it is evident that, in
 its natural state, the water in question was saturated with carbonic acid
 in this peculiar state of combination.

     Subsequent        experiments made at sea, on water from mid-ocean and
  from various depths, have shown me that the above quantities are very
  much in excess of the quantities usually contained in ocean-water. From
  the large quantity of organic matter poured into the Forth, not far from
  Portobello, there must be an abundant production of carbonic acid in the
  water itself, and we have seen above the effect of bringing sulphate of lime
  and carbonic together in the nascent state.                            Sea-water contains, on an
  average,    about      8   parts sulphate      of    lime in 10,000.           A saturated solution
  of the same salt in distilled water contains at 15° C. 24 parts in 10,000.

Under the most favourable circumstances, then, one would expect sea-
water   to bind about one third of the quantity retained by an equal
volume of sulphate-of-lime  solution. We have seen that a litre of this
solution is capable of rotaining 0"338 grm. COa, while the same volume
of sea-water contained only 0-07 grm., or considerably less than the third
of that held by the sulphate of lime. In ocean-water              I
                                                           have never yet
found more than 0-064 grm. COa per litre, including both the simply
dissolved and the    half bound. We have, then, in the sulphate of lime aloue,
an agent capable of retaining much more carbonic acid than is usually
found to exist in sea-water. Besides this there is also, at least, the sulphate
of magnesia possessing this property. How much it would be capable of
absorbing if the carbonic acid were presented in a nascent state iu a
neutral solution we do not know ; it would be interesting to determine
the amount of carbonic acid retained by a sulphate-of-maguesia solution
in which organic matter had been allowed to decay.
   The practical conclusion to be drawn from the preceding experiments
is that, as the carbonic acid is retained by the presence of certain sul
phates, the gas will be more easily boiled out if we get quit of these
sulphates.    For this purpose      I
                                  always add to the sample of sea-water,
in which the COa is to be determined, a sufficient quantity of a saturated
chloride-of-barium solution to precipitate all the sulphuric acid present.
The effect has answered my expectations.        After the first fifth of dis
tillate has passed, there is rarely a perceptible turbidity in fresh baryta-
water.    In practice, however, and as it costs but little trouble, always I
distil off from three quarters to seven eighths, and often quite nine
tenths of the solution.
  The determination       of the carbonic acid     in sea-water is carried on on

                             '          '
enough to give me when the Challenger     was fitting out.
  A  flask with a capacity of about 500 c. c. receives the sea-water to be
operated on, usually from 200 c. c. to 250 c. c. It is closed by an
india-rubber cork, through which pass two tubes ; one, reaching to the
bottom, communicates      with the condenser, a cylindrical copper vessel,
10 in. high by 51 in. diameter, with a block-tin worm.     The lower end
of the worm is attached to the receiver by a bent glass tube with a
flexible joint, from which a glass tube leads to the bottom of the
receiver.   The flexibility thus obtained     in practice, of the greatest
                                                 is,
use, enabling the operator,     shaking, to expose constantly fresh sur
                                   by
faces of baryta-water to the passing gases.  The receiver    connected by
                                                                      is
an india-rubber tube with two bulbed V-tubes.    An aspirator enables               a
stream of air to be drawn through the apparatus,    soda-lime safety-tube
                                                         a
being interposed between      it   and the V-tubes.     The water running from
the aspirator   is
                 conducted         outside   the port   by   a   tube which    passes

490            Mr.    J.  Y. Buchanan       on the Absorption   of
through a hole in the sash.          The flask containing the sea-water is sup
ported   on  a  ring,  by  a  clasp holding  its neck. Both of these, along with
the spirit-lamp underneath the flask, are attached in the usual way to an
iron rod, which is attached to the projecting side of the ship by an eye-
bolt, in which it has a play of rather more than an inch in the direction
of its length.      The lower end of the rod sits securely in a hole, let into
the top of the working-table. When the apparatus is dismounted the rod
is pushed up, till its lower end has freed itself from the hole and laid
 flat along the roof, being supported at one end by an eye-bolt, at the
 other by a hook.       The aspirator and the condenser are retained in their
places by   wooden     blocks,   which fit in between them and the ship's aide or
the battens on the bench.
     The water in which the carbonic acid is to be determined is introduced
into the flask by means of a tube reaching to the bottom.               When the
 carbonic acid is to be determined in a specimen of water, the apparatus is
 first put together and a current of air, free from carbonic acid, drawn
 through, care having been taken to see that it is thoroughly dry in all its
 parts.    The corks in the receiver and V-tubes are then eased, and
 from 15 c. c. to 20 e. c. baryta-water, usually of about -fa normal
 strength, run into them.          The water to be examined is introduced into
 the flask through a tube reaching to the bottom; 10 c. c. of a nearly
 saturated solution of chloride of barium are then added, the apparatus
 closed and heat applied.         When the liquid begins to boil, care must be
 taken to lower the flame to avoid frothing over.           A gentle current of
air is now conducted through the boiling liquid, and the receiver con
 stantly agitated. After half an hour's boiling, about 100 c. c. water
 have distilled over, and at the same time all the carbonic acid.             That
 the latter is the case,     I ascertained by changing the baryta-water at this
 point,  and   continuing the distillation, when no turbidity was produced.
 That, at any rate, no appreciable amount of carbonic acid passes after
 even the first 50 c. c. water have been distilled over, may be very easily
 seen by the liquid in the receiver passing from a turbid, somewhat'
 frothy solution, to a clear one, in which a well-defined precipitate is sus
 pended, and whose amount does not visibly alter as the distillation
 proceeds.       Although such is the case,       I  have usually, as it costs but
 little more time and trouble, carried on the distillation until seven
 eighths have passed, and indeed, in many cases, until crystallization has
 commenced.        When proper attention is paid to the agitation of the
 receiver during the first part of the distillation, the amount of carbonic
 acid reaching the first V-tube is quite insignificant, and the baryta-
 water in the second remains perfectly clear.             When this operation is
 finished, the contents of the V-tubes are washed into the receiver with
 boiled water, and the remaining alkalinity determined with hydrochloric
 acid of known and convenient strength.            The point of neutralization is
 indicated by rosolic acid.

   Synthetical Experiments. — In order to check the above experiments, it
appeared to me to be of importance to determine the absorption-coeffi
cients of one or more of the solutions for carbonic acid. Before knowing
                                                                I
any thing of the retention of carbonic acid by sea-water, had determined,
if possible before the sailing of the ' Challenger,' to investigate the solu
tions of some of the salts occurring in sea-water, with reference to their
power of absorbing the atmospheric gases.               It was well known that
sea-water,   in  common    with  most other   salt-solutions,  absorbed a smaller
quantity of air than distilled water would do under the same circum
stances ; but it had never, to my knowledge, been attempted to find out
whether this diminution of absorptive power was distributed equally
over the three gases, or was exhibited more strongly in the case of one
gas than in that of another.       From a preliminary experiment in which a
2 per  cent,   solution of Na CI in distilled water was saturated with air and
the air then expelled and analyzed, it appeared that the oxygen was
present in slightly greater quantity relatively to the nitrogen than would
have been the case if the liquid had been distilled water.         Of course, this
being the result of only one experiment, no conclusion can be drawn from
                                                                   I
it ; but it shows the necessity of the investigations which had proposed
to myself. Unfortunately, the time at my disposal was too short to allow
of any thing being done, except a few experiments with carbonic acid and
solutions of sulphate of magnesia and of sulphate of lime.
    For this purpose     I made use of a Bunsen's absorptiometer, and fol
lowed his method, with the modifications rendered necessary by having
to do, not with a simple liquid, but with a saline solution.         The carbonic
acid was introduced into the absorption-tube and measured, not in the
mercurial trough, but in the absorptiometer itself, the lid being left open.
This is a much more expeditious            way, inasmuch as the gas quickly
assumes    the  temperature   of the water   of the absorptiometer ; and as the
readings after absorption are all done in this way, there can be no
object in reading the gas alone in another way.             After absorption, the
instrument is always read with the lid shut, so that what corresponds
to the height of mercury in the trough is given by the height of it in the
outside graduated leg of the absorptiometer.         In all of the determinations
this height is given, not in the reading on the leg itself, but in the cor
responding reading on the absorption-tube,               which   can be directly
observed with sufficient accuracy with the ordinary telescope used in gas-
analysis.     As after shaking the instrument and opening the stopcock
connecting the leg with the body of the instrument some of the water
frequently passed into the former, we have generally a reading marked
" water in outer leg," which forms a factor in estimating the tension of
the gas.
    The solutions experimented on were, one containing 1-23 per cent,
crystallized sulphate of magnesia and one containing 0'205 per cent,
 gypsum.      It  was necessary that these solutions, before being introduced

492          Mr.   J.   Y. Buchanan     on the      Absorption of
into the absorption-tube, should be deprived of air without
their state of concentration.    This was effected in the following way.
A flask was filled up to a mark in the neck with the solution, half of it
was then emptied into another flask and the two boiled, while distilled
water was kept boiling in a third.   When the boiling had been kept up
for about half an hour, the contents of the second flask were emptied
into the first and washed out with the hot distilled water, the volume of
the solution being brought in this way up to the mark, and so far above
it as was equivalent to the expansion of the solution for the difference of
temperatures.    A glass syringe of convenient size was now filled with
the boiling liquid and passed hot into the absorption-tube.   This method
may be objected to on two grounds : first, that there is some uncertainty
about the exact concentration of the solution when introduced into the
absorption-tube ; and, second, that some air may have been absorbed by
the liquid in its passage through the syringe to the tube.      As to the
first objection, when the operation is carried out in the way          have I
described, the possible difference between the actual and assumed con
centration is so small that it would be extremely unlikely to have any
influence on the coefficient of absorption of the liquid. As to the second,
if the manipulations be expeditiously carried out, there is but little fear
that the liquid at so high a temperature, and exposed to the small quan
tity of air of diminished tension in the syringe, should be contaminated
in an appreciable way.     However much or little importance one mav
attach to these possible sources of error, they probably explain why the
whole subject has been left almost entirely untouched.
   Our object in these experiments          is,
                                         not to determine the absorption-
coefficient fora standard  pressure such  as 760 millims., but to determine
it for various pressures, the temperature being kept as uniform as cir
cumstances will permit, and to compare the results obtained with those
calculated for distilled water.

    In   series  III.   (Table IV.) with sulphate of lime, and in series I.
 (Table II.)    with   sulphate of magnesia, the readings were made without
 loss of time, the pressure being successively increased for each experi
 ment.     In series II. (Table III.) particular attention was paid to the
 length of time this gas and solution were in contact at the different
 pressures, and for each experiment the pressure was successively
 diminished.      They were left in contact for nine days at the highest
 pressure (column 1) before reading; No. 2 was read twenty-two hours
 later, No. 3 forty-one hours later than No. 2, No. 4 twenty-five hours
 later than No. 3, and No. 5 after the lapse of some days.

400                         Mr. R. Mallet        on the
  " On  the Mechanism of Stromboli."              By Robert Mallet,       M.A.,
                    F.R.S. Received May 17, 1874*.
    Stromboli and Masaya stand alone, so far as observation has yet gone,
amongst the volcanic vents of our planet, in the remarkable characteristic
of having a distinctly rhythmical intermittence and recurrence in their
eruptive action.    Masaya, though known for about 300 years, has been
but little observed, so that some doubt may exist as to whether its action
be truly intermittent and recurrent or not ; and if we leave it aside for
future observation, Stromboli stands unique amongst terrestrial volcanoes
in the rhythmical character of its eruptions, more or less accurate obser
vations as to which are upon record for above 2000 years.              Every vol
canic vent is indeed intermittent, and often recurrent, in its action, which
has been properly denominated paroxysmal, but no law can be traced in
the intervals of time elapsing between the paroxysms.             A vent may sud
denly open    and a cone  be thrown   up,  as  in  the case of  Monte Nuovo, and
after this burst volcanic effort may cease there, perhaps permanently ; or,
as in the case of Vesuvius, prior to a.d. 79, a period of repose may exist
in a volcanic cone already formed, exceeding human local tradition, to be
 succeeded by paroxysmal efforts, varying enormously in intensity, and
 with intervals in time between successive eruptions varying from hours to
centuries.    In all these there is no rhythmical recurrence, or at least none
that, upon the narrow scale open to our observation, can be viewed as
such. In Stromboli, on the contrary, there is a distinctly rhythmical inter
mittence and recurrence, so regular in time, and preserving for centuries
such a general uniformity in energy, and of such slight violence, as to
point to some distinct train of mechanism as producing it — that me
chanism, whatever be its nature, being comprehended within a moderate
distance from the surface, and not referable to the more mighty and deep-
 seated forces which determine the uncertain and altogether unpredictable
 paroxysms of volcanoes generally.         Not that the rhythmic intervals of
 Stromboli are precisely the same at all times, as has been erroneously
 stated by many travellers, nor the violence of its outbursts at all times
alike ; but both vary within narrow limits during the immense historic
period that it has been observed.        No satisfactory explanation has yet
been given, so far as the author is aware, of the physical and mechanical
condition constituting the mechanism upon which this extremely curious
rhythmical action depends ; and it is the object of this paper to point out
what appears to be its real nature.         It is the more worthy of attentive
study, as Stromboli is in reality the link that connects two widely different
phenomena —namely, the ordinary cone of eruption and the geyser.
 Stromboli is, in fact, a volcano and a geyser united and acting together
in the same vent, the rhythmical action which characterizes the geyser

being thus communicated, within certain limits, to the otherwise irregular
and accidental activity of the volcano.
    Passing ancient accounts, Stromboli has been visited in modern days,
amongst men of science, by Spallanzani, Dollomieu, Hoffman, Scrope,
Daubeny, and several others ; but no very full or exact description
of the crater and its "adjuncts, much less any adequate explanation
of the curious mechanism of its action, has been given by any of these
writers.
    Hoffman's account of the phenomena witnessed by him, though far
from clear or satisfactory, is curious enough to deserve translation
here : — " The volcano appeared to have changed into a hot mineral
spring ; then at irregular times we observed that the continually deve
loping steam became stationary, and, with a jerking uncertain motion,
rushed back into the mouth of the crater.           At the same time we felt a
terrifying trembling     of the ground, accompanied by visible oscillations of
the loose crater-sides.       Then followed a hollow roar, and a volume of
steam shot out of the crater, accompanied by a shrill crackling.             Thou
sands of lava-fragments, which had been carried up with the steam, spread
in the air like sheaves, and then fell back, either into the mouth or on
 the surrounding cinder and sand walls.         We could distinctly see (parti
 cularly on this occasion) the boiling, seething lava dash against the sides
 of the shaft, separate into two streams, and then fall back ; but the lava
 ejected   in bubbles flew far through the air, twisting and tearing along,
 foaming drops, bright     as cooled glass,  clattering  as they rolled down the
 declivity."
                                                                         '
     Mr.   Scrope makes the following remarks        in his  '
                                                               Volcanos    (second
 edition, pp. 332-334) :—
     " The remarkable circumstance in this small but interesting volcano is
 that the column of lava within its chimney is shown, by the constant ex
 plosions that take place from its surface at intervals of from five to fifteen
 minutes, casting up fragments of scoriform lava, to remain permanently
 at the same height, level with the lip of the orifice at the bottom of the
 crater, and therefore some 2000 feet above the sea-level.           It is evident
 from this that nearly a perfect equilibrium is preserved between the ex
  pansive force of the intumescent lava in and beneath the vent, and the
  repressive force, consisting in the weight of this lofty column of melted
  matter, together with that of the atmosphere above it ; consequently a
  very small addition to or subtraction from the latter, such, for instance,
  as a change in the pressure of the atmosphere, must to some extent, how
  ever small, derange the equilibrium.      It need not therefore surprise us
  that the inhabitants of the island, chiefly fishermen, who ply their perilous
  trade day and night, within sight of the volcano, declare that it serves
  them in lieu of a weather-glass, warning them by its increased activity of
  a lightening of the atmospheric pressure on the volcano — equivalent to a
  fall of the mercury —and by its sluggishness giving them assurance of the

4-98                           Mr. R. Mallet    on the
 reverse.    It  is the teusiou of heated steam or water disseminated through
 the lava in and beneath the vent which occasions its eruptive action, and
 the boiling-point of every drop or bubble must be sensibly affected by
 every barometric variation
     " In the foul weather of winter     I was assured   by the inhabitants that
the eruptions are sometimes very violent, and that the whole flank of the
 mountain immediately below the crater is then occasionally rent by a
 fissure, which discharges lava into the sea, but must be very soon sealed
 up again, as the lava shortly afterwards finds its way once more to the
 summit, and boils up there as before.        Captain Smyth found the sea in
front of this talus unfathomable, which accounts for the remarkable fact
that the constant eruptions of more than 2000 years have failed to fill up
this deep-sea hollow."
    Dr. Daubeny ('Volcanos,' second edition, p. 248) appears to have
given but a cursory examination to the crater ; and in his observations on
its phenomena only repeats Spallanzani, Hoffman, and Mr. Scrope, as
follows : —
    " The unrernittent character of the eruptions of Stromboli
                                                                      appears to
arise, as Mr. Scrope has suggested, from the exact proportion maintained
 between the expansive and repressive force.          The expansive arises from
the generation of a certain amount of aqueous vapour and of elasrie
fluids ; the repressive from the pressure of the atmosphere, and from the
weight of the superincumbent volcanic products."
    The mechanism, as imagined by Mr. Scrope, fails, in the author's opi
nion, to account either for the rhythmical character of the eruptions or
for the alleged connexion        between them and the state of the weather.
No equilibrium between the " expansive and the " repressive " forces
                                             "
                                                                              can
possibly exist at the moment of an outburst, the circumstances of which
prove an excess of pressure of many atmospheres, which has been gradually
increasing since the last outburst became quiescent.
    To account for the actual facts, we must      have such a   train of natural
mechanism       as   shall cause  a gradual, though rapid, increase of steam-
pressure within or beneath the vent or tube of the volcano, until the ac
cumulated pressure suffices to overcome whatever obstacles it may
encounter, solid or liquid, and by blowing these away release the pressure
itself in a burst of steam, stones, dust, &c.        The conditions    producing
this gradual increase of steam-pressure must        be such as shall give rise to
the rhythmical recurrence, at comparatively short intervals, of the pheno
mena. These conditions are certainly not to be found, either in the
general nearness of balance of any expansive and repressive forces alone,
or in any conceivable relation between these and variations of atmospheric
pressure.
    Mr. Scrope has, as the author believes, greatly overrated the altitude of
the fundus of the crater in stating it at 2000 feet above the sea. But let us
suppose the height of the column of liquid lava, between the level of the sea

and the fundus of the crater, to be one fourth of this, and the expansive
and repressive agencies in the nicely balanced equilibrium assumed, what
effect could any variation of barometric pressure, within the limits ever
experienced on any part of our globe, produce in disturbing such equi
librium   ?    A rise or fall of the barometer at the rate of a tenth of an inch
per   hour  is  known only to occur in connexion with the most violent hur
ricanes.     A fall of half an inch in the mercury within three or four hours
exceeds probably the utmost that occurs in connexion with the most vio
lent Mediterranean storms.            But let us suppose   a fall of two inches in
the barometer      to take place instantaneously,     how far would that affect the
equilibrium supposed of such a column, however supported, and whether
free from aeriform matter or containing vesicles thereof ? Two inches of
mercury are equivalent to about ^ of the usual pressure of the atmo
sphere,   or to less than one pound to the square inch at the sea-level. The
liquid  lava   supposed to fill the column may be allowed to have .a specific
gravity of at least 2*000 ; a rise or fall, therefore, of a single foot in the
top surface of this column would equilibrate this exaggerated amount and
 rapidity of barometric change.          But the head of the column itself is de
 scribed by Hoffman as continually in oscillation upwards and downwards
 through several      feet.   It  is obvious, therefore,   that changes of atmo
 spheric pressure have nothing whatever to do with the mechanism pro
  ducing the recurrent action of this volcano.
    Whatever reality there may be in the notion, long handed down,
 of some    connexion    between the degree of activity of this volcano and
 changes of weather appears to be merely superficial, and the true inter
 pretation will be referred to further on.            In any case this notion of
 equilibrium     within the chimney of this particular volcano, and its dis
 turbance by changes of atmospheric pressure, would be equally applicable
 to every volcanic vent in the world, and fails to throw any light upon the
 special phenomena which characterize Stromboli, viz. the quasi regular
 recurrence of its bursts forth.        The geysers of Iceland belch forth water
 and steam, and occasionally stones, and the order of recurrence is the same
 which characterizes those of Stromboli.       The latter does not send forth water
 en masse,   its ejecta being steam mixed with some gases, carrying up con
 siderable masses of solidified lava, chiefly in angular blocks, mixed occa
 sionally, but not always, with torn shreds and lumps of half-solidified
 lava, in a more or less plastic state, together with a preponderant volume
 of dusty pulverulent     matter.     It is highly probable that water, not in the
 state  of steam, but in that        of  solid drops, is frequently blown from
 Stromboli, and such may be felt falling to leeward after some of the bursts
 forth, though not after all.       It may be doubtful, however, whether or not
 these drops may arise from steam condensed in the air.
    We thus have, to the same succession of phenomena as those of the
 geyser, superadded in Stromboli some of those of a volcanic vent, of feeble
but long-continued      activity.

Iceland ; and although they are now known to exist elsewhere, their
characteristics are nowhere better observable than in Iceland.

                                                                  '

have been further described by Sir George Mackenzie in 1810.
   Henderson had ascertained that stones, or other obstacles, thrown into
the geyser-tube influenced the interval between two outbursts generally
by increasing    it,
                  and gave rise to augmented violence in the outburst when
it came, the stones being projected back along with the water, and rising
much higher than the latter, as might have been predicted from dynamic
considerations.    Sir John Herschel suggested an explanation of geyser-
phenomena, based upon modifications of the mechanism long previously
proposed to account for those of intermittent springs.         His explanation,
though  tenable, certainly  does not apply to all observed cases, and is scarcely
likely to be the true one, because   a  much simpler mechanism has been
since pointed out and  ;   it may be taken as certain that, in explaining all
natural phenomena, the simplest      is  the true one. This was discovered
by  Bunsen   and Des   Cloizeaux, who  in  1846 examined the geysers of Ice
land, and ascertained the fact that towards the bottom of the tube of the
Great Geyser, at depth of 78 feet from the lip of the basin, a thermo
                       a
meter immersed in the rising column of water rose to 266° Fahr., or to
more than 50° above the boiling-point of water, under atmospheric
pressure only and these authors conclude that, as the flow of water which
               ;
replenishes the tube after an outburst causes the aqueous column gradually
to rise to the lip of the basin, the temperature of the water at the lowest
part of the column continues to rise and whether

                no considerable volume of steam can be generated until
the boiling-point has been reached at the bottom of the column, as due
to its insistent pressure there, when    sudden and large outburst of

until that falls back to atmospheric pressure. The curious facts            ascer
tained   byProfessor Donny, of Ghent, that water absolutely free from
combined air may be heated to even 275° Fahr. before     boils, and then

violence of the outburst.

                            Mechanism     of Stromboli   .                    501
    Bunsen is of opinion that the above is simply the mechanism of the
  Great Geyser ; but that to account for some of the minor phenomena of
the second, or Strokur Geyser, some additional mechanism, not widely
differing from that suggested by Herschel, may be necessary. Some of
 the relations which subsist between geyser-phenomena, as thus explained,
and those which he supposes to occur at various depths in the tubes of
active volcanic vents, have been well discerned by Sir Charles Lyell, and
are described    in his ' Principles of Geology,' 10th edit. vol. ii.p. 220 ; but
he has not applied them in explanation of the rhythmic recurrence of the
 outbursts of Stromboli.      From Bunsen's explanation, as above sketched,
it follows that the interval between two outbursts depends mainly on
three conditions   — the   depth and capacity of the tube, the rate at which
the water that fills   it is supplied, and the rate at which heat, from what
 ever source, is transmitted    to the water.    Were these three all perfectly
constant, the interval between two successive outbursts would be always
 the same, but it must vary, more or less, as any one of these three conditions
may be altered.      Again, the duration of the outburst, or time occupied
 in the expulsion of the column of water, and the height to which it is
 sent, as well as the volume of the jet, depend upon the capacity of the
tube and the height to which the water rises within it before the blow-out
 commences, and must therefore vary in time with these conditions.           The
 depth and capacity of the tube may vary secularly or be deranged sud
denly ; the temperature of the infiltrated water may vary, and therefore
 the time of its boiling under given conditions may alter with the season ;
 and the temperature of the sides of the tube, and of the steam blown into
it from fissures, must vary with the intensity of neighbouring           volcanic
action whence these are drawn.
    Before proceeding to connect the circumstances presented by Strom
boli with the above facts in relation to geysers, it will be necessary to
adduce some facts in relation to the former, derived from personal obser
vation.
   In   the latter part of the year 1864   I examined the whole of the Lipari
Islands, with the exception of Felicudi and Alicuda, which the lateness
of the season rendered impossible.        Starting from Cape Mellazo (Sicily)
in  a "well-found" speronala, with      a crew  of eight men, which   I retained
throughout the voyage amongst the group of islands,         I had the pleasure
and advantage of being accompanied for some days, and as far as Lipari
Island, Panaria, and Stromboli, by my friend Colonel H. Tule, B.E., well
known for his embassy to Siam, and recently for his noble edition of
Marco Polo's travels, and by various other works.             Our landing at
Stromboli was difficult, from the high surf running in ; and after our
arrival   the weather     became   so much   more tempestuous as to detain
us there some time.         We enjoyed    the  hospitality of Padre Capellano
Giusseppe Eanza, whose house is situated not far from the central parts
of the island, and whence a steep but not difficult walk leads up to the
                                                               2q2

502                        Mr. R. Mallet     on tlie
crater and to the highest point of the island.         The statements which
have been made as to the relative heights of different points of this island
appear to be only derived from guess, and are greatly in error, as        I  am
enabled to show, although    I am not in a position to give heights  which   are
rigidly correct, my hypsometric      measurements      having been    made    by
means of a single aneroid.
                                Diagram No.   1.
   The pergola of Padre Ranza's house (marked A, Diagram No. 1) was
found to be 211 feet above the sea at St. Vincenzo, and the highest point
of the island (marked B) is 2843 feet thus measured.          Captain Smyth,
however, gives the height as only 2576 feet : this was probably taken
by him by the usual nautical methods of triangulation, and if so, may not
be more exact than my own rough barometric measurement.             The  height
of the ridge overhanging the crater, marked C, was in like manner found
to be 1200 feet. We were enabled to clamber down from this over crags
of lava, whose irregular terraces and ledges were capped, more or less
deeply, with black volcanic sand, containing immense quantities of crys
tals of augite, down to a point overhanging the landward wall of the
crater, and at no great distance from its verge, from whence we witnessed
the phenomena of eruption.                               I
                                This point, marked C", found to be 904 feet
above    the level of the sea.   Prom this point the great, irregular, and
somewhat oval funnel-shaped crater was before us ; and looking seaward
the highly irregular walls bounding its edges sloped towards the sea, and
were united transversely by the sharp irregular edge or summit of the
mass of broken and in great part wholly discontinuous and angular
ejected fragments, which form a slope down to the sea, between the oppo
site sides or jaws of the cove or reentrant angle in the coast-Kne called
the Schiarrazza. From the point where we stood this edge (D on Diagram)
was estimated by the eye and clinometer at about 300 feet below us ; and
the narrower width of the crater thus seen across at its brim     I estimated
at from 300 to 400 feet.      The form of the crater as described by Smyth
(' Sicily and its Islands,' p. 255) in 1824   w as stated to be circular,   and

its diameter about 510 feet. This statement can only be received as
approximate, as at that date the brim of the crater cannot have been
extremely different from what it was in 1864 ; and the bounding walls,
which are of material the greater part of which is as ancient as is the
island itself, can scarcely admit of its ever having been circular, or much
different from the irregular gulf it presented when        I
                                                         saw it. From our
position of observation, every thing around us was of the sable colouring
of black lava and volcanic sand. We could not see with any distinctness
the fundus or bottom of the crater, a cloud of vapour issuing from its
bottom, and in places from its sides, nearly filling the cavity, and obscur
ing the bottom even between the outbursts.     This vapour smelled strongly
of hydrosulphuric-acid gas.     At all the lower part, as well as     Icould
 discern, the steep and solid walls of the crater merged into a very steep
funnel-shaped talus of loose materials, at the centre and bottom of which
 was the aperture of the tube or " chimney
                                               "
                                                  of the volcano. This has
 been described by Hoffman as entering the funnel by three apertures.
 Judging from the form of the column of steam, dust, stones, &c, as seen
 at the first moment of ejection, the aperture appeared to me to be a single
 one, irregular inform, and with its longest dimension in the direction of
 the greatest width of the crater itself.  Looking down from our position
 over the foreshortened slope of black debris which plunged into the sea
 900 feet below us, the two jaws of the Schiarrazza are seen to be com
posed of huge broken-off      beds of lava, which   dip to seaward at various
depths below   the surface ; these, partly by superficial decomposition,
partly by being covered with serpulas and corallines, are of a nearly white
colour ; and as we stood with the sun at our backs, the sea above these
beds, at either side of the Schiarrazza, on which the sun was shining, pre
sented the most glorious   tints, varying with the depth of the water from
golden-yellow   to the purest emerald-green, while between these, and look
ing right down over the black slope of debris, the deeper sea was of an
intense indigo, passing off into blackness.   Nothing in the way of natural
colouring and wild outline combined could exceed the weird horror and
intense beauty of contrast when a burst from the volcano sent forth in
the  midst its volumes of white steam and dust, which, seen by the
reflected light of the sunbeams shining through      appeared of every tint
                                                     it,
of ruddy brown or blood-red.      From what precedes, and by referenced
Diagram No.    1,    will be seen that the bottom of the crater-funnel can
                    it
not be more than 300, or at most 400 feet above the level of the sea where
the tube or tubes enter     and that the statement made by Mr. Scrope
                           it,
('Volcanos,' p. 332,   2nd  edition), viz. " the lip of the orifice at the
bottom of the crater      some 2000 feet above the level of the sea,"
                         is                                                 is
largely in excess of the truth.   "Were that  afact, the brim of the crater,
which is300 to 400 feet above the bottom, would be situated within height
                                                                     a
of about 175 feet according to Smyth's measurement, or within about
300 to 400 feet according to my measurement of the highest point of the

504                      Mr. R. Mallet     on the
island, either of which is physically impossible.   While we remained ob
serving, the outbursts from the bottom of the crater were found to be
very irregular as to time, varying, as timed by the watch, from a minimum
of t wo minutes interval to a maximum of thirty minutes, and in one case,
after we had commenced our descent, to forty minutes.         I
                                                          could not trace
a very distinct correspondence between the largeness of this interval and
the violence and volume of the outbursts    following   it, although the ten
dency seemed to be to such   a    correspondence;    and the duration of the
outburst was certainly greater as the interval between two was so. At
each outburst a   huge volume of dust and small material, and with more
or less of large fragments of solidified lava, all angular or subangular, and
with a few fragments and shreds of different sizes of lava still hot enough
to be slightly plastic while falling, were ejected none of the fragments
                                                    ;
were of any great size, none appearing to exceed in weight about 500 or
600 pounds, and none of the pieces of plastic lava reaching half this
weight.    The light wind blew from us towards the sea, out over which
a portion of the finer dust was wafted after each outburst but the great
                                                              ;
mass of the dust and fragments, whether small or large, fell back into
the crater upon its bottom and steeply sloping funnel, a few only, and
generally of the largest fragments, being thrown out over the crest of the
crater at its sea side, and landing amidst the debris of the slope, down
which they clattered.  It was obvious that the orifice of the tube at the
bottom of the crater was greatly obstructed by the loose material forming
the funnel above   it,which seemed after each outburst to be continually
slipping, more or less en masse, and so blocking up the tube, along with
the mass of ejected material which dropped back upon the orifice       for
                                                                       ;
it was easily remarked that successive outbursts apparently took place
from different points, distant occasionally some yards from each other, in
the bottom of the crater — the main axis of the column, or its greatest
thickness, varying thus in position, and also more or less diverging
slightly from the vertical, sometimes one way and sometimes another, as
though the ajutage of discharge was through loose material of partly
large and entangled blocks, mixed with finer material, the positions
of which were more or less altered after each discharge.          None of
the large fragments which we saw thrown out rose higher than the posi
tion at which we stood, and few even so high — that is, they did not rise
more than 400 to 500 feet above the orifice at the bottom of the crater    ;
but occasionally the height of projection must  a good deal exceed this, as
I  found many angular fragments and large shreds of lava, which had
fallen in leathery or plastic state, to the landward and eastward sides of
        a
the brim of the crater, 150 feet or more above the level of our point of
observation.   The black sand and dust and crystals of augite are found
in large masses still higher and further from the crater on the land side  ;
but much of the latter are blown inland by the strong winds from the
northward that prevail in winter. The solid mural precipices which form

the walls of the crater above the funnel of loose material consist of beds
of solid lavas and agglomerated fragments, and appear to dip more or less
towards the sea, or away from the centre of the island, and were no
doubt formed by one of its great early and more central craters at a period
excessively remote. Suffioni of steam issue in some spots from between
these beds, and the percolation of water was seen in places not far below
the   brim of the crater.    Thereis a perennial spring of percolated water
much higher up upon the island, and under the steeps that mark the
position of an ancient crater, so that it is highly probable that rain-water,
in greater or less quantity, finds its way into the funnel, and even the
tube, of the volcano, although the percolation of sea-water is no doubt
the chief source of the supply, which is blown out as steam, and perhaps
in part as pulverized water.        Each outburst, while we continued to
observe them, was preceded by several distinct low detonations, with in
tervals between each of from 4 or 5 seconds to as much as 80 seconds :
these, though of a far deeper tone, greatly resembled the cracking
noises that are heard when steam is blown into the water of a locomotive
 tender for the purpose of heating it. These detonations sensibly shook
the rock beneath our feet.
    The outburst, when it comes, does not rush forth quite instantaneously
 or like that of exploded gunpowder.      It begins with a hollow growl and
 clattering sound of breaking or knocking together of fragments of hard
 material, which very rapidly increases to a roar at its maximum, continues at
 about the same tension for a period varying from a few seconds to a minute
 or two, and then rapidly declines, but less rapidly than the augmentation
 took place.   At the first instant of the outburst, the rock on which we
stood was very sensibly shaken, the vibrations being both vertical and
more or less horizontal ; at the end, and after the fragments have ceased
to fall and the dust has cleared away, all tension of vapour in the tube
seems  for the moment at an end, and the funnel is seen filled merely with
rolling clouds of vapour. The noise produced by the outburst is not very
loud, and more resembles that of the rush of a heavy railway-train over
an iron-girder bridge, when heard at some distance off, than any other
sound to which    Ican compare    but more fluffy and flat.

educated to the observation of extinct volcanic regions, that successive
craters have been formed, shifting their positions posterior to the pro
duction of that great and nearly central one from which the main mass
of the island was thrown up.     The existence of three such craters may
be traced  ;and the existing little crater    situated at the landward or
                                                    is
 south-eastern side of vastly larger crater, all the north-western or sea
                         a
side of which has been destroyed and buried in deep water, and of which
the heavy beds of lava seen under water at both sides of the Schiarrazza
are the only remains to seawards of the existing slope of debris.  This    is
represented by the Diagram No.       copied from my note-book, in which

Strotnboli, while the lines beyond indicate the probable outlines of the
island when the great crater was active, of which the Strotnboli of       to-day
may be viewed as little more than a fumarole.
                                Diagram   Xo. 2.
     I  may add here, in reference to the Lipari group generally, that all the
 islands present more or less distinctly these characteristics of craters
 whose axes have shifted and formed new ones at immensely ancient
 epochs, and with vast intervals of time intervening.
     The entire group presents, though in various degrees in the different
 islands,    the general character of great decadence of a once far more
 powerful volcanic activity ; and, in every case, as the cone, or rather mound,
 of each island increased in mass and height, the original vent thus in
  creasingly obstructed tended to move off and open new and easier vents
  in directions approaching the coast-lines, just as in the ea*e of very old
  and massive volcanoes on land, such as Etna, migrations have occurred of
  their most ancient great craters, and, in more recent times, new ones have
  opened low down upon their flanks, such as Monte Eosso &c. The epoch
  of primordial activity was far from contemporaneous in all the islands :
  and we find in them now the most varied stages of volcanic decadence.
  In   the island of Vulcano, we have an empty crater of enormous capacities
  and depth (1100 to 1200 feet), the bottom of which reaches to within a
  few feet of the sea-level, and is only separated from the shore-line at the
  north-east of the island by an extremely steep bank of compact tufa.
  The oldest craters having been situated much more centrally and          far to
  the south-west, while the little crater of Vulcanello was thrown         up to
   seaward of the ancient coast-line and between     it and the deep crater just
   spoken of, boiling springs and boiling streams of superheated vapours
  issue below the sea-water, and a thermometer sunk amongst the pebbles
   of the beach in many spots rises to above 300° Fahr. In the bottom of
  the deep crater the principal " bocca," which is several feet in diameter,
  and though only blowing out superheated steam and gases with a mea

sured sort    of rise and fall in its snorting, is red-hot to the lips, which
are of hard lava    ;  and the temperature at the mouth          I found, in 1864,
was sufficient to melt brass wire, but not sufficient to fuse a similar wire
of bronze (i. e. copper with about 5 per cent, of tin).
    The falling-in of any considerable proportion of the walls of this grand
crater, which, on the landward side, consist of nearly horizontal beds of
volcanic rock and conglomerate, forming at that side a vast mural preci
pice, though almost wholly of compacted tufa for the remainder of its
periphery, would easily give rise to a renewal of volcanic energy, such
as   nowhere exists now in the Lipari group.
    Stromboli is the next to this in existing energy ; but though the per
sistence and character of its activity excite much more attention, the
actual evolution of volcanic heat is greatly inferior to that constantly going
on from the unobstructed " bocca of Vulcano, which, if again obstructed,
                                       "
would produce very violent effects. In Lipari Island we have the traces
of several great craters of extreme antiquity, the most recent being that
which evolved      the mountainous      masses   of pumice and the enormous
stream of pumice and obsidian       which falls into the sea at the north-east
of the island ; but the greatest sign of present activity is found on the
 shore at the opposite side of the island, at II Stufi, where innumerable jets
 of hot water and superheated steam with sulphurous acid issue from the
 heavy beds of trachyte, which they       rapidly decompose and convert into-
 clays and hyalite.
     In others of the islands, such  as  Panaria and Saline, no sign of activity
 remains, and the most practised eye with difficulty seeks to recover the
 positions or outlines of the very ancient craters.           Lastly, in the small
 islands of Basiluzzo, in the low rocks of Liscanera and Liscabianca, and
 in the huge spire of Datola, formed of vertically parted and splintery
 trachyte of the most obdurate character, we have but the last shreds of
 one or more great volcanic islands which once occupied the shallow sea-
 spaces between     all these islands,   and probably connected them into a
 single vast cone. A hot spring        still rises in water of 4 or 5 fathoms
 deep between Liscanera and Liscabianca, which possibly mark the site of
 one of the most recent of the craters at this spot, the islands which they
  formed, at a period too distant for imagination, having here almost disap
 peared under the eroding influence of the comparatively tranquil and
  tideless waters of the Mediterranean, aided perhaps by local subsidence,
  but of which there is little or no evidence.      It will thus be seen that the
  change  in position   and decadence  in energy   ascribed  to the existing crater
  of Stromboli, although for 2000 years its energy has seemed to be constant
  or not greatly diminished, are circumstances in complete accordance with
  the facts presented generally by the volcanic islands of the whole group.
  The existing tube of Stromboli, like that which leads to the " bocca
                                                                               "
                                                                                 of
  Vulcano, has but a lateral and indirect and very much choked-up com

   the products of the great craters.     Lava from these, generally imper
   fectly melted, but occasionally in a complete state of fusion, still finds its
   way from these into the upper parts of the existing tube of Stromboli,
   but in comparatively very small quantity.
     On leaving St. Vincenzo we circumnavigated      the island of   Stromboli,
  and examined the slope of debris in Schiarrazza cove ; the actual average
  angle of slope is much overrated by Mr. Scrope at 50° ('Voleanos,'
  page 32).    By the clinometer it proved to be from 34° to 36° with the
   horizontal.    The slope consists almost wholly of angular fragments,
  averaging but a few hundredweight each, and of shreds and tails of lava
  that have fallen in a semifused condition!    Mixed with these, in a wholly
  irregular manner, are here and there sinuous and twisted flakes of lava.
  These have been often taken for dykes of lava forced out by hydrostatic
  pressure through the bank of debris, when the crater has been assumed
  brim-full of liquid lava ; but  I am not aware of any evidence whatever
  in support of the notion that this crater ever has been so filled. Its
  steep walls present no traces of the contact of liquid lava at any time
  since their formation ; and it can scarcely be doubted that had the crater
 ever been filled with liquid lava to the brim, the loose and incoherent
 slope of debris would have been utterly unable to sustain the pressure,
 and must have been forced bodily into the sea, into which the mass of
•liquid lava must have followed it. The base of the slope appears to con
 sist of solid and, no doubt, comparatively water-tight beds of lava, like
 those described, as seen from above, at both sides of the Schiarrazza ; and
                                                  '
 but for these the existing crater could have never been formed, or its
 activity preserved, for it must have been drowned out by the inroad of the
 sea, as so many other     and recent craters in the other islands     prove to
 have been.     The sinuous masses of lava seen at various parts of the slope
 of debris appeared to me no more than huge splashes of very liquid lava,
 which, in outbursts of greatly more than usual intensity (such as was one
 of those witnessed by Hoffman) and with a larger supply of lava than
 usual, were blown out over the crest of the slope and fell amongst the
 blocks of debris.    Fresh deposits of debris obscure the features of most
                         I
 of these plashes ; but observed, in some cases, that the lava had distinctly
 moulded itself, like a mantle, to the sinuosities between and the forms of
 the blocks upon which it fell.     Within a yard or two of the base, or
 water-line, of the slope were two blocks of lava of exceptional magnitude,
the larger having a volume of 8 or 10 cubic yards.         These blocks were
 confidently   affirmed to us to have been projected during some violent
burst forth and thrown clean over the crest of the slope, and to be in fact
blocs rejetes thrown from the bottom of the crater; examination proved
that they could be nothing of the sort.     They were sharply angular, and
all the surfaces had the crystalline texture of dark pyroxenic lava not
very long fractured, except in some places, where distinct signs of wea
thering were evident in the larger block.        Had they been bloes rtjetes

they would have presented on all their surfaces and edges the more or less
rounded outlines and extreme induration and closeness of grain due to
long-continued torrifaction, which are the invariable characteristics of such
blocks.  The true history of these great blocks                is,

the ancient crater-walls which overhang the crests of the slope, and had
thence rolled down to the position in which we found them at about     in           F

the slope, are slowly removed and carried out into deeper water by the
under tow of the heavy seas in winter, and are lost in the chinks and
crevices between the huge blocks at the bottom, which         I  found to be so
deep and tortuous as often to render the extraction of the sounding-lead
which had entered them difficult.       The lava ejected by Stromboli, whether
in the solidified  or half-melted   state, is extremely dark-coloured, almost
black.    It is highly pyroxenic and crystalline, and its fusibility is greatly
increased by an intimate intermixture of dark obsidianic glass, of which
particles as well as strings are met with everywhere.        It is still leathery
or plastic at a temperature considerably below a red heat, visible in day
light, and is probably in tolerably liquid fusion at a temperature not
much exceeding 1200° Fahr.         Its composition is by no means invariable,
as may be seen on the slope of debris ; and when the glassy material is
very abundant, as from time to time seems to be the case, or from
any of the causes which influence periodically the fluctuations of tempe
rature more or less observable at all volcanic vents, this lava would become
extremely liquid and be blown about by the outbursts in the way some
what obscurely described by Hoffman, as well as urged in liquid flakes
over the brim of the crater.      The crystals of augite which are deposited
in such abundance with the dust blown out may preexist in the lava, but
appear to me, more probably, to be mainly formed by the disintegration of
the hot lava by contact and churning up with water, under a considerable
pressure and therefore high boiling-point, and perhaps by separation and
recombination     from solution of its constituents.       The crystals, which
are often an inch or more in length and frequently macled or cuneiform,
have scarcely any lustre ; and when the surfaces are closely examined with
a lens, they are often seen to be minutely pitted with microscopic cavities.
We now     come to collect and correlate our facts and draw such conclusions
as they   warrant in explanation of the mechanism which produces the
phenomena of Stromboli.        The supply of water producing the immense
volumes of steam constantly blown off at the rate, on the average, of three
or four outbursts per hour may be derived in part from percolated fresh
water ; but this source alone, derived from the small gathering area of
the island, would be wholly insufficient; and, were that the sole source, it
would almost wholly fail towards the end of the dry season, so that a
marked annual change in the volcanic phenomena must result, and could
not fail to be observed.       The supply of water, however, is manifestly
regular, and very nearly constant at all times, and therefore is derived
from the sea, and thus must enter the tube of the volcano below the sea-
level — that is to say, more than 400 feet below the lip of the tube at the
bottom of the crater-funnel.      Whatever be the source of supply of the
lava,  therefore, it can never fill the tube as a solid column of melted mat
ter reaching up to its lip ; for in that case, whatever be the mechanism
of the volcano at each outburst, the whole of this immense column of
melted matter of more than 400 feet in height must be blowu completely

out of the tube, which actually is emptied, at the end of each outburst, of
everything but gases and vapours, and these at a tension not greatly ex
ceeding that of the atmosphere.    We do not know the average section
of the tube, and therefore cannot calculate the volume of lava that would
be propelled thus out of the tube, if previously filled by each outburst ;
but it is manifestly so great that it would wholly change the character of
the phenomena exhibited by the volcano, and must, during the last 2000
years, have produced a mass of ejected matter of enormous magnitude
instead of the insignificant amount of mixed lava and debris which alone
are to be seen.
    Liquid or semiliquid lava             does, however,    continually make its way into
the bottom of the crater-funnel and amongst the fragments collected there,
which it more or less solders together, and along with which it is blown
out at the outburst.  Some may ooze into the tube lower down, and may
more or less obstruct,  but can never completely fill it. The walls of the
tube, and those of all the fissures or cavities below the level at which the
more or less fused lava reaches them, can scarcely have a lower tempera
ture, and are most probably at a higher one than the lava itself. If the
tube of the volcano were the main, or only, ajutage through which the
liquid lava, as well as the steam to blow it out, were supplied — in fact,     if,
the tube were the main duct into the lowest depths of which both the
liquid and vaporous matters entered —then, at irregular intervals, the tube,
and even the crater, must become filled, and the whole phenomena of
eruption would not differ in character from the highly irregular paroxysmal
efforts of any common volcano of like energy.             The tube, then, here
plays    adifferent part from   what    usually
                                              it  does, and constitutes an addi
tional element in its machinery, upon whose action in producing expulsion
the rhythmical recurrence of the outburst depends.
   We can now discern the very simple mechanism                      by
                                                               which the actual
phenomena are produced,       a  description of   which  will  be rendered more
intelligible by reference to the ideal Diagram No.            in which A

about 400 feet below the upper lip of the tube.         D       duct communica

the tube, and to rise therein,             if   otherwise  unimpeded, to the sea-level.
E   is   either   a   lateral   duct or   a   continuation of the tube itself, through
which steam at   high temperature and tension enters the tube at some
                         a
point much below the level of the sea.  The lava- and steam-ducts,                        B
and E, may be supposed to come from the ancient great volcanic channels
still remaining          under the more central         parts of the island, and which
supplied      its great ancient       craters.      The duct D may consist of many

 mass of the island, and in which all three classes of ducts or channels,
 B, D, and E, are formed, most probably between the partings of super
 imposed beds ; or a single large duct may bring in the supply of sea-
 water, and have such a form, however irregular, as to preclude the
 steam in the tube from blowing out into the sea, although having •
 tension many times greater than the direct statical head of the sea-water
itself*.

debris shall   have some sort  of landing-place and support for the larger
portion of the mass, so as not all to drop into and permanently block the
tube. The lava oozing from the duct, or ducts, B, escaping amongst these
fragments, solders them more or less together ; and in proportion as its
rate of supply is greater or less, some of it may overflow and drop, in a
more or less liquid state, into the tube C and into whatever water it may
contain. The tube, however, is emptied at the outburst of nearly all
that it contains, and the tension therein being that of the atmosphere, or
little more, the sea-water again begins to fill it by the ducts D. This
water is already probably considerably warmed in the ducts D ; it receives
accessions of warmth from the sides of the tube and from the continual
blowing into it of superheated steam and vapours through the ducts E,
whose temperature is probably not far different from that of the lava at B.
The column of sea-water rises in the tube to a level, we will suppose S, by
which time the boiling-point has been reached at the lowest point of the
column, namely, that due to the statical head of water, and to all such
obstructions above the lip of the tube as tend to hinder the escape and
so increase the tension of the vapours and gases occupying the otherwise
empty upper part of the tube.         At such an instant, the whole column
may    be lifted through  a few inches or feet vertically  by the steam locally
generated at the bottom of the tube ;  and as this incipient evolution of steam
escapes upwards the whole column          of liquid will be suddenly dropped
 back upon the bottom of the tube, to be again similarly lifted, and so on
until every portion of the column of water has acquired the full boiling-
 point due to its depth, &c. This is the cause of the detonations heard
 before the outburst.    As soon as this has been reached, the whole mass
 of water below S is driven violently upwards, and partly by its impulse,
 but mainly by actual steam-tension, drives before it the mass of obstructing
matter filling the bottom of the funnel at A, and the whole is driven
forth together in a mingled cloud of dust, stones, shreds of half-melted
lava, steam, and pulverized water.        When the tube is left empty, and
after the fall back of the fragments, the whole apparatus is ready for a
repetition of the process. It is obvious that the depth of the tube below
the level of the sea, and the temperature of its sides and that of the
 steam entering at E, determine the force of the outburst, that the rate
 of supply of water and steam determine the intervals between the out
bursts, and that the proportion between the volume of steam and that
 of pulverized water, at each outburst, depends upon the capacity (that is,
 the greater or less section) of the tube C. If that be narrow in proportion
 to its total depth, as is probably the fact, then very little water will be
 ejected in any state but that of steam.          It is not necessary that the
 temperature of     the column   of water  in  any part of the tube C should
 ever reach the tension    due to a temperature equal to that of the lava
 escaping from B ; it only needs to be such as shall raise its own column
 to the lip of the tube and overcome the obstructions there encountered
 with a sufficient residual tension left to blow these a greater or less height

into the air. The augite crystals are probably formed -within the tube,
from small portions of lava dropping in a liquid state into the water it
contains.
   Reverting now to the remarks made at the beginning upon the relations
traditionally said to exist between the phenomena of this volcano and
the state of the weather.    It is obvious that the notions of nicely balanced
equilibrium   in a  tube always filled to the lip with liquid lava can no
more account for any such relation with the weather than it can explain
the rhythmical recurrence of the outbursts themselves ; and if supposed
relations with changes of weather, as alleged to be indicated by Stromboli,
could be thus explained, every constantly active volcano in the world
would be equally a " weather-glass."       Kilauia, for example, must present
upon an exaggerated scale         all the weather-prognostics    attributed to
Stromboli.     In examining the vague statements made upon this subject,
we should bear in mind the extreme incapacity of ignorant peoples to
observe phenomena with accuracy, their proneness to exaggeration, and
the readiness with which they accept traditional statements, however
improbable.     The statements made to me by several of the more intelli
gent people of Stromboli as to the height to which stones were alleged to
be thrown, viz. far above the highest point of the island, as to the tilling
of the crater brim-full with liquid lava (which, however, no one had actually
himself seen), and the forcing through the slope of debris of vertical dykes
thereof, as well as the projection of the huge blocks we saw at the bottom
of the slope, and such like, should be borne in mind before we attempt to
square theoretic views with statements of facts that probably have no
real existence.                                            I
                   The only intelligible statements that could gather from
the inhabitants of Stromboli as to relations between the weather and
their volcano resolved themselves really into two propositions : first, that
in fine weather the light reflected upwards from the crater was more
brilliant, and apparent at a greater distance, than in windy or uncertain
weather ; secondly, that in cold and broken weather the light was dimi
nished, and a heavy cloud of vapour hung more or less over the crater.
   These are intelligible facts, and admit easily of being accounted for on
well-known meteorological principles.        A tendency, though not a marked
one, to the production   of sea-  and  land-breezes in the morning and even
ing is observable in these islands, the sun-heat during the day being
often very great, as also the nocturnal radiation.        These, taken in con
nexion with the prevailing direction of the wind at a given time, viz.
whether it sweeps over the island and over the highest points from the
southward and eastward, or blows against its steep north-western face
and into the crater, will, by altering the state of the atmosphere above
the latter, tend to produce changes both in the light and in the vapour-
cloud of the volcano.     But that there is any real connexion, in the way
of direct cause and effect, between the energy or frequency of the out
bursts and the state of the weather, or fluctuations of barometric pressure,
or vice versd, seems devoid of any foundation whatever.

    I published   in the  '

                                   '
                                     of the 14th February of this year a paper
entitled " On the Lymphatic System of the Cornea," in which               I endea
voured to show that the canals in that structure in which the nerves lie
communicate with the lacume, that the straight canals and lacunar are
connected by means of a continuous layer of flat cells, the margins of
which are indicated by the well-known action of nitrate of silver, and
that these cells are not the anastomosing so-called cornea-corpuscles, but
that the flat cells line the lacuna, while the branched cells fill the cavity.
    I have lately undertaken a series of further investigations on the same
subject.
    In   order to corroborate the results yielded me by the nitrate of silver,
I  availed myself of the well-known property which hematoxylin pos
sesses of specially staining the nuclei of cells.            I allow the cornea to
remain in the solution until it is perfectly saturated. Subsequent mace
ration in acetic acid removes the hematoxylin from the fibrillary sub
stance before it bleaches the nuclei.       On comparing a cornea so treated
with successful preparations of the cornea-corpuscles as obtained by
chloride of gold, it is found that the number of cells demonstrated by
the hematoxylin exceeds by several times that found in the gold prepara
tion, affording direct proof of the existence of other cells in the cornea
than those known as the cornea-corpuscles.
    If a vertical section of the cornea is so treated by hematoxylin and
acetic acid, in many of the clefts in the fibrillary substance, in which, as
is well known, the cornea-corpuscles are situated, several nuclei are seen,
 proving in another way the existence of a greater number of cells than
 those hitherto accepted by anatomists.
    But in addition to the proof afforded by staining the nuclei of the
 cells,  I have, by the application of a new method, been able to isolate
 (and thus demonstrate beyond all further possibility of doubt their exist
 ence    in the cornea)   a large number    of cellular elements, the varied size
 and shape of which distinguish       them  not only from the cornea-corpuscles,
 but from any anatomical structures that have been as yet described.
     If  a cornea is placed in a saturated solution of caustic potash, at a
 temperature between 105° and 115° Fahrenheit, it is reduced, in a few
 minutes, to a white granulated mass of about a fourth of its previous
 bulk. In a small piece of the diminished cornea, broken down with a
 needle and examined under the microscope in the same fluid, it is found
  that the only visible elements are a great number of cells. If the con-

51G                    Dr. G. Thin    on the Anatomy     of
junctival epithelium of the cornea has not been previously removed, the
cells of that structure can be recognized amongst the others ; and if the
mass under examination has not been too much broken up in manipu
lating, groups of them may be seen in direct anatomical continuity with
long narrow flat cells, which belong to the elements that have been for
the first time brought to light by the potash solution.
    But the cells of the anterior or surface-epithelium form a very small
proportion of the number.       The smallest piece that can be removed by
the needle from a cornea which, before being put into the solution, has
 had this epithelium scraped off and Descemet's membrane removed, shows
 under the microscope a multitude of cells.       Of the branched corpuscles,
 the fibrillary substance, and nerves, not a trace is visible.
    The form of these cells is so various that it would be difficult to con
 struct a series of types under which every individual cell could be
 brought.     They seem in their development to have assumed any modifi
 cation of form that is necessary to enable them to fit accurately the
 cavities and fibrillary bundles to which they are applied.
    Those whose outlines do not permit their being accurately described as
 belonging to a strictly defined type, are many of them somewhat qua
 drangular or triangular in form, or club-shaped, with a short or long
 projecting process. Of fixed and definite types are long narrow rods,
 ending obliquely at the point, and oblong cells intersected at one end by
 a notch, which receives the extremities of two of the long cells that lie
 parallel to each other.
     I do not attempt to give an exhaustive account of the various forms
 assumed by these cells.      A better idea than can be given by any de
 scription will be got by an examination of figs. 1, 2, 3, Plate Vlli., in
 which many of them       are represented ; but an examination of the first
 prepared cornea will show that there are many forms and modifications
  which have not been drawn.
     The cells are granular in appearance, with sharp clear outlines. The
 terminal surfaces of the long cells can often be seen to be finely serrated ;
 and so closely do they fit each other at these points, that sometimes a
 high magnifying-power is necessary to discover the suture-like line by
  which the junction is indicated.
     The nuclei of all the cells have nearly the same length, but in the
 narrower cells the nucleus is often much compressed transversely.
     The long cells are many of them 0-09 millim. long and from 0-006-
 0-003 millim. broad ; the shorter cells are broader.       Those 0-06 millim.
  long are generally about 0-009 millim. broad. A length of 036 millim.,
 with a breadth of about 0*015 millim. is common ; others are 0-03 millim.
 long and 0-012 millim. broad.
     I have chiefly examined the cells in the cornea of the ox, sheep, and frog,
 and have found no important differences either in
                                                        shape or arrangement.
     In examining portions of the cornea which have been as little dis

 turbed as is consistent with the maintenance of transparency, groups of
  cells are found massed together in situ, as they have been left by the dis
  solving out of the fibrillary substance by the potash : these are found
 chiefly in two forms. Transverse masses of the anterior epithelium are
 found sutured to long narrow cells, which sometimes seem to join them
 at an angle.
     Further, flat quadrangular masses of a single layer of cells are found
 formed in the following manner : — Of two opposite sides the external
 rows are formed of more or less rounded and angular cells, to which are
joined long narrow cells that lie parallel to each other. Those from each
 side respectively meet in the centre, where they join. The remaining
 sides of the quadrangle are formed by a side view of these various cells,
where they have been detached from the adjoining ones in the breaking
down of the cornea mass.
     The coincidence bet%veen the breadth of the long narrow cells and the
 fibrillary bundles of the cornea-substance, as seen when prepared by the
ordinary methods, is evident, the continuous planes formed by their junc
tion indicating that they form layers between which it is enclosed.
 According to this view, the ground-substance is everywhere encased in
a sheath of cellular elements.
     Bowman's corneal tubes      I believe to include both the straight canals
 described in the paper above referred to and the spaces between the
long cells widened by injection, chiefly the latter.
     Although    I have nothing to add to the description of the mode of pre
paration which      I have already given,  I must state that there are conditions
                                          I
of success, as to the nature of which have not yet come to a definite con
clusion. Sometimes the same solution, applied at the same temperature
to different cornea?, succeeds in one and fails in another, and sometimes
a solution prepared with every precaution has failed to afford me any
result. The two essential conditions to success are complete saturation
and temperature.         I have never succeeded with a temperature above
120°, nor with one below 102° ; and so sensitive is the solution to mois
ture, that preparations sealed in it with asphalt seldom keep longer than
one or two days, except in very dry weather.           On a damp day      I  have
known a successful preparation left on the object-glass disappear in six
hours. The corneal mass may be kept unaltered for at least some weeks
in the solution by running sealing-wax round the stopper of the bottle.
    A   perfectly successful preparation shows nothing but the cells.         Un
successful preparations, especially those prepared with too hot solution,
show globular masses unlike any anatomical element ; others, especially
those prepared at too low a temperature or with imperfect saturation,
show masses of hexagonal crystals like those of cystin.
    To sum up, I believe that there exists in the cornea : —

    II. ,  flat colls, which everywhere cover the fibrillary bundles of              the
former and line the entire system of the latter ;
    III.   , the cornea-corpuscles     of Toynbee and Virchow ; and,
    IV. ,    the nerve-structures    of the tissue.
    The cornea-corpuscles and the nerves lie free in the canals and cavities,
and between them and the epithelium there is a fluid-filled space which
permits the passage of lymph-corpuscles.
    It    is    therefore   proper   to regard     the    canals, cavities, and   inter-
fibrillary      spaces as  forming a continuous and integral part of the            lym
phatic        system, the latter having to the former the same relation              that
blood-capillaries       have to the veins.
    The junction of the flat cells of the fibrillary substance with the
epithelium of the surface justifies the inference that the intercellular
 spaces in the anterior epithelium of the cornea communicate with the
 lymph-spaces in the ground-substance, and that the position of nerve-
JibrilliB between the epithelium is a continuation of the similar relation
that has been demonstrated in the substance of the structure.
    It is a reasonable hypothesis that what can be definitely established
 for the cornea holds good for the other forms of connective tissue.
    I  have accordingly submitted tendon to an examination by different
methods, with the view of obtaining evidence of the existence in that
structure of cells other than those arranged longitudinally between the
bundles, the nature of which has lately been carefully investigated by
Boll, Spina, Eanvier, and others.
    If the tendo Achillis of a frog, or the tendons of a mouse's tail, fixed
according to the ingenious method described by Eanvier in his first
paper*, are treated by nitrate of silver, care being taken to avoid friction
of any kind, it is found that every part of the free surface of the bundles
is covered by a continuous epithelium.              In the tendo Achillis of the frog
I   have seen lymphatic capillaries distributed over this surface ; and the
epithelial markings can be traced from the cells covering the bundles
 into those of the vessels. A preparation from the tail of the mouse,
 showing this epithelium, is represented in fig. 4, Plate IX.
    If    sections of tendon are placed for several hours in a strong solution
 of  extract     of logwood and alum, and the dye then washed out by concen
 trated acetic acid,      it is found that while the fibrillary substance      becomes
 clear and transparent, the nuclei retain their colour.              This is best   done
under a cover-glass and under the microscope, as the effect of the                  acid,
if   kept too long in contact with the preparation, is to discolour                   the
nuclei also ; the weight of the covering-glass is sufficient to prevent               the
 otherwise invariable distortion of the preparation by the acid.                 If   the
preparation is intended to be permanent, all traces of the acid must                   be
removed by a current of distilled water.
    The effect of this treatment is to show that there exists in              tendon    a

  far greater number of cells than can be seen in the most successful gold
  preparations.     The figures illustrating the structure of tendon usually
  given by investigators account for only a portion of the cells whose exist
  ence is thus proved — that portion, namely, which consists of the rows of
 cells occupying the stellate spaces, and which colour easily in gold and
 carmine. In longitudinal sections, prepared by the method         I have above
 described, not only are the nuclei much crowded together, but two are
 frequently seen on the same level, and applied to the opposing surfaces
 of contiguous bundles.        In transverse sections a similar arrangement
 is found.     The nuclei between the bundles are very numerous ; two are
 often found together on opposite bundles ; and in one stellate space three
 and four nuclei can often be found at the same level.
     This is clearly a condition to which the so-called division of the
 nucleus is not applicable.
     If we believe that each of these nuclei represents a cell, the
 conclusion is inevitable that, in addition to the cells hitherto de
 scribed and occupying the centre of the stellate spaces, there exists
 another and very numerous class of cells applied to the surface of the
 bundles.
     This effect of haematoxylin and subsequent action of acetic acid on
 sections of tendon is perfectly analogous to that similarly produced in
 sections of cornea.
     The treatment of tendon by the potash solution has seldom yielded me
                                                     I
satisfactory results ; but when it has succeeded, have found confirmation
 of the inferences     I  draw from the effect of the saturated solution of
hoDmatoxylin. A reference to figure 7 (Plate IX.) shows that while many
 of the cells isolated by the potash correspond to those found on the sur
face, others are similar to the long narrow cells that cover the fasciculi
of fibrillary tissue in the cornea, and do not resemble in shape, even
approximately, the superficial elements defined by nitrate of silver.      Al
though     I have not succeeded, as in the case of the cornea, in reducing
tendon to a mass of these cells,       I consider it a fair inference that the
long narrow cells     I  have seen are samples of cells that invest the fas
ciculi of fibrillary tissue.
    The comparative difficulty in successfully treating tendon by potash
is probably clue to the denseness of its structure.
                                                   I
    It is in regard to the branched cells, which hold to be the analogues
of the branched cornea-cells (corpuscles), that the important fact demon
strated by Spina, that it is on the surface of the cells that the fibres of
elastic tissue are formed, specially applies.
    In the centrum teudineum of the rabbit        the continuity of the flat
cells, which in silver     preparations are considered to indicate lymphatic
vessels,   with cells covering the fibrillary substance can be shown to a
greater or less extent, according to the success which has attended this
difficult manipulation.      That it often succeeds in patches, is shown by

520                    Dr. G. Thin      on the Anatomy      of
the plates that illustrate works on this subject, although the influence
 of Von Becklinghausen's doctrine (namely, that wherever an epithelium
 is found a lymphatic capillary must be supposed to exist) has led to what
I believe to be their true    nature being overlooked.
    From a similar cause to that encountered in tendon, the complete re
duction of the dense corium of mammals by potash is very difficult ; but
 by treating   thin sections of fresh cutis, isolated flat cells are found.
    In the cutis of the frog, the bundles of fibrillary tissue are arranged in
 parallel layers, and the corium being thin, the demonstration of flat cells
 is easier. And here the continuity of these cells with those of the rete
 Malpighi is evident, in the same way as the cells of the anterior epithe
lium of the cornea are continuous with the flat cells of the interior of
 the structure.
    Figures   11 and 12,  Plate X., represent flat cells from the skin of       the
 ox and frog.
    1 make     the same   inference   in regard to the communication         of the
 spaces   between the cells of the re to Malpighi with the lymph-spaces of
the corium, that    I make in regard to the similar arrangement in the cornea,
both as regards anatomical       continuity and in regard to the position of
the nerves in the spaces.         Langerhans has described the network of
nerve-fibres in the rete Malpighi, and, in that of the cutis of the rabbit,
the rich network in the spaces between the cells is not very difficult to
demonstrate. In the skin of the finger,       I  have traced a medullated nerve
as high as the third layer.
    Banvier, in that part of his essay which treats of the elements ceUv*-
 laires da tmu conjonctif Mche, describes an entirely different anatomical
element from that on which the authorities with whom he is in contro
versy had fixed their attention.        The cells figured by him* are the same
as those isolated by potash when very thin pieces of skin or areolar tissue
are operated on. As described by him, they are applied closely to the
bundles.     But when he attempts to show that the connective-tissue cor
puscle of Virchow does not exist, and that the appearances by which it is
distinguished depend on an optical delusion,        I believe him to be mistaken.
In skin    and subcutaneous tissue the chloride of gold brings out in the
clearest manner the existence of nucleated cells with long projecting pro
cesses   stretching between and around the bundles, the whole of the
cells being connected by the anastomoses of their processes.             So com
plete is the analogy between skin and tendon, that it would be easy to
find parts of a successful gold preparation          of skin where the diagnosis
between skin and tendon might be difficult.
    Figures 13 and 14, Plate     X., illustrate the appearances     presented  by
the branched cells in skin.

 this paper and my acquaintance with the literature of the subject. It
 is, however, well known that while twenty years ago the so-called con
 nective-tissue corpuscles w-ere believed to be concerned in the formation
 of elastic tissue, with the development of Virchow's doctrine of cel
 lular pathology, this opinion seems to have been gradually abandoned,
 even by those who, like Virchow himself, had origiually maintained it.
 Ranvier, whose investigations seem to have been conducted in singular
 independence of contemporary theories, holds that the first step in the
 appearance of elastic tissue is the formation of "granulations refringentes"
 traceable in the fully developed fibres.
    In the spring of 1873, while investigating the structure of the touch-
 corpuscles of the finger,        I found that the much-discussed cellular ele
 ments of these bodies, which colour in gold and carmine, anastomose with
 each other by means of fibres that resist prolonged maceration in con
 centrated acetic and dilute mineral acids, and           I described them, in the
          I
account gave        of the  results of my investigation, as
                                                             " elastic tissue fibres."
                        I
At the same time found that similar cells and fibres form a thick net
work in the corium. Simultaneously, Spina made his exhaustive study
of the connexion of the elastic fibres in tendon with the walls of the
cell, to which     I have already referred.
    Since that time,     I have continued to subject the skin and subcutaneous
tissue to treatment by different methods, and the results have been con
firmative of those       I  obtained in Vienna.      Shortly expressed, the con
         I
clusion have come to is, that, in skin, all the branched cells form elastic
tissue on their surface and on their processes, and that there is no elastic
tissue anywhere that is not so formed.
                                                                 I
    The cells found in connective tissue are divisible, as believe, into two
distinct classes. There are, first, the flat cells which never branch, and
which, when treated by nitrate of silver, present appearances identical
with those produced when the flat cells of serous membranes are simi
larly treated ; secondly, there is the system of branched cells in its va
rious forms. As contrasted with each other, they may be described simply
as the flat and branched cells of connective tissue*.                Between these
two classes of cells there is no transition and no anatomical continuity.
The forms of the branched cells embrace all the gradations between the
fine network of a lymphatic gland and the anastomosing network of the
strong fibres in skin and tendon.          They are distinguished by their pro
cesses, their capacity to form a substance that resists acetic acid — the
power, namely, of forming the resisting element specially characteristic
of elastic tissue. That they do not all exercise this latter power to.
the same     degree, does not constitute a sufficient difference to make
it necessary to regard them as separable into classes essentially distinct.
    The ligamentum nucha? may be taken as the type of the stronger forms
   * To flat  cells the term placoids has been applied by  Dr. Burdon Sanderson,   the
equivalent of the German platten.

522                      Dr. G. Thin on the Anatomy of
                            I
of elastic tissue ; and select it for this reason to prove the cellular origin
of its fibres.
     If a thin piece of the ligamentum nuchse is strongly coloured by chloride
 of gold and gently teased in glycerine, there will be found a number of
 oval nuclei lying loose amongst the fibres.          But careful examination
 shows similar nuclei still adhering to many of the latter ; and in some
 instances the remains of the protoplasm of the cell can be seen around
 the nucleus and adherent to the fibre.        The nucleus and cell-remains are
 often found at the point of the division of a fibre into two, and indicate
 the original processes of the cell in the embryonic state.
      If a portion of the same gold-stained ligament is further placed in a
 very strong solution of hematoxylin and alum for twelve hours, and
 then carefully spread out for examination, the appearances will be found
 to have considerably changed.        If the preparation has not been roughly
 handled, the astringent effect of the latter solution has caused the clear
 outlines of the individual fibres to disappear, and, in their stead, there are
  flat bluish bands in which fine dark lines connecting oval swellings are
 seen.      The latter are the nuclei, and the lines are permeable canals in
 the elastic fibres, which have become filled with the hematoxylin solution.
  Both these conditions are depicted in figures 15, 16, and 17, Plate X.
      The formation of the elastic substance on the surface of the cell, as
  described by Spina in tendon, applies universally, and also holds good for
  the cell-processes.     But the part of the cell-body that does not enter into
  the formation of this resisting substance, so far from sharing the strength
  of the new tissue, becomes more easily disintegrated than at an earlier
  period of its development, and can be found only when the tissue is
  cautiously    manipulated.     But sufficient staining with gold, and care in
  operating, will demonstrate the cellular origin of elastic fibres in whatever
  tissue they occur.
       Virchow,   as is well known, vindicates for his connective-tissue corpus
  cles the character of a connected chain of plasmatic canals, and I have re
   marked above regarding the tubular nature of the fibres of the ligamentum
   nucha:.    That every elastic fibre is permeable to fluid, is highly probable,
  though not yet proven.        This tubular nature of the larger fibres has pro
  duced one of the difficulties of the recognition of the connexion of the
   fibre with the cell.    The chloride of gold colours the protoplasm of seell,
   with which a fully developed fibre is continuous, a faint purple ; and when
   the tinting is continued into the process, it is the contents of the tubular
   space that are coloured.     The elastic fibre, unless carefully examined in
_
   a good light, is apt either to escape observation, or seems to run past the
   cell without being in continuity with it.
       This difficulty has been increased by a chemical difference between the
   coll and the elastic tissue to which it gives origin, so that many reagents
   and modes of treatment, that by potash-lye for instance, dissolve the cell
   but leave the fibre untouched.      Hence the methods that have been most

                        Connective   Tissue, Nerve, and Muscle.                    523
used for establishing the individual characters of elastic tissue have been,
instrumental in producing erroneous notions as to its origin.
     Thus we have in skin, as in tendon, bundles of fibrillary tissue every
where covered with flat cells, and, in the interstices of the bundles, the
analogues of the branched cells of the cornea, producing a ramifying net
work of elastic tissue.
     In   gold preparations of the skin, the blood-vessels and nerves can be
followed between the larger fasciculi, analogously to the position of the
nerves in the cornea.
     Fascia differs from skin and tendon only in so far as its flatness permits
and necessitates a change of form in the flat cells, and the easy study of
their arrangement and nature by nitrate of silver.                  If a half per cent,
solution is injected under the skin of a mouse's back and the animal killed
in from five to ten minutes afterwards, and the skin of the back dissected
 off, the fascia which has been in contact with the silver is recognized by
its milky whiteness and           cedematous   condition.      If spread out carefully
 on the object-glass in glycerine and exposed to sunlight, it is seen to be
 plated over with oblong or slightly rounded cells with large nuclei.
 Figure 8, Plate IX., is a sketch from a part of a preparation so obtained.
 The cells separated from the same structure by potash are represented
 in figure 9, Plate IX. ; it will be observed that they are identical in
 appearance.          Figure 10, Plate IX., illustrates the very large flat cells,
 with their nuclei, that cover the fascia of the muscles of the thigh of the
 frog.
      Frequently, but not        so constantly, the branched cells are also stained
  by   the   silver,  and  they are  generally found at a different focus.
      lianvier ('Archives de Physiologie ') has described flat cells on the
  sheaths of nerve-fasciculi and the investing membrane of nerve-bundles
  as   constituting     a lymphatic   sheath.
      By means of the saturated potash solution            I   have been able to satisfy
  myself that, not only are the nerve-bundles                surrounded   by lymphatic
  sheaths, but that each medullated nerve-fibre               is invested with a layer
  of    flat   cells.    This layer is closely     applied to the medulla, and is
  internal to the sheath of Schwann.               It is composed of extremely fine
  and delicate cells, and their demonstration             by potash succeeds less fre
   quently than does that of the cornea-cells ; they are (as far as              I have
   seen)   without     exception long  and  narrow,   often  tapering to an exceedingly
   fine point.       In the finest forms their cellular nature is only to be distinctly
   made out by a magnifying-power of 700 or 800 diameters.                   Figure 18,
   Plate X., represents varieties of these cells and their relation to the
   medulla. Their length varies from 0-075 to 0'036 millim. ; many of them
   are   not more than 0-0015 millim. broad. Appearances are sometimes seen
   that would seem to indicate that the sheath of Schwann (tubular mem
   brane) is lined by a layer of flat cells, distinct from that covering the
   medulla (white substance). The medulla, when treated by potash, presents

  521                    Dr. G. Thin on the Anatomy of
 a series   of bulgings, so that its lateral (optical) borders are designated bv
 irregularly waving lines.       One set of delicate cells can- be seen closely
 following the sinuosities of the substance, while another set, more external,
  lie in a straight direction parallel to the longitudinal axis of the fibre.
  Where the medulla is constricted, there is a clear space between these
 two sets of cells, which are in contact at the convexities formed by the
 bulgings.
     By adhering to the broad principle that wherever there is          a nucleus
 there is a cell, the existence    of a great  number of cells surrounding the
 medulla of a nerve-fibre can be demonstrated in another way. If a nerve
 is placed in absolute alcohol for twenty-four hours and then very gently
 disentangled from the sheath in glycerine, a cover-glass put on and solution
 of hematoxylin drawn through the field by filter-paper, the nuclei of the
 fibres stain first, and their number soon becomes very striking.           If the
 field is allowed to become saturated and obscure with the dye, and then
 subsequently cleared up by acetic acid, those fibres which have not
 suffered by the manipulation are literally dotted over with nuclei. The
 number is so great as at once to dispel the idea that they can be accounted
 for by the sheath of Schwann.          The nuclei of the sheath can often be
 distinguished from the others by their more external position relative to
 the nerve and a deeper tint. Figure 19, Plate X., is drawn from a pre
 paration made in this way.
     The ring which, as Eanvier was the first to show, snares the medullated
 fibre is well seen when the nerve is treated by absolute alcohol or the
saturated potash solution, both of which leave the medulla untouched.
As at the seat of this constriction the medulla is deficient, and as the
nerve-fibre is bathed in lymph, it is evident that there must be at these
points a very intimate connexion between the lymph-fluid and the axis-
 cylinder of the nerve.      This has beeu already indicated by Eanvier in his
essay on the lymphatic nature of the nerve-sheaths, and receives greater
force now that we know that flat cells, indicative of lymphatic structures,
are situated on the fibres themselves.
     The  use  of haomatoxylin is as advantageous in demonstrating      the large
nuclei of the flat cells of the nerve-sheaths as it is in showing        those of
tendon.
     Eanvier has observed that in transverse sections of nerves the sheaths
and connective tissue surrounding the fibres stain more deeply with car
mine than the surrounding tissue does.        I have made a similar observation
in the nerves of the skin in gold preparations which had been macerated
in acetic acid.     In  this case the concentrically arranged connective tissue
of the nerves is conspicuous by its pearly whiteness.           But as we know
that the surrounding corium is equally rich with the nerve in lymphatic
structures, the cause of the difference in colour must be sought elsewhere,
and will probably be found in relative differences in
                                                              regard to the ar
rangement of the elastic tissue.

    By combining several methods of investigation, I believe have suc
ceeded in clearing up some points in the anatomy of muscular fibre,
by which it will be seen that, as regards the lymphatic system, muscle
occupies a position almost identical with tendon and connective            tissue
generally.
    If freshcnuscle   is deeply stained with hasmatoxylin and then treated
by acetic acid  and  gently teased, the perimysium of the bundles and its very
fine continuation around each fibre are seen to be studded with large round
nuclei, which are far more numerous than those of the branched cells,
which are also seen. The round nuclei belong to the flat cells of the
perimysium.
    I  have been able to demonstrate the character of the cells by teasing
the living muscle of the frog in aqueous humour, and thence transferring
the separated fibres to the nitrate-of-silver solution.       The usual sinuous
lines are then seen both on the general and special perimysium.           This is
represented in figures 5 and 6, Plate IX.
    When muscle is treated by the saturated solution of potash, as above
described, the fibres are found unaltered, the striated appearance being
well marked. There is no vestige left of the perimysium.           On the naked
surface of the sarcolemma, a number of round distinct nuclei are seen ; and
when they happen to be on the edge of the fractured fibre, it is seen that
they are situated on its outer surface.
    If   the saturated potash solution in which the muscle is placed is kept
 for  about an hour at a temperature of 110° Fahrenheit, and then allowed
to   cool gradually, we find a further effect has been produced.
     On breaking down     a piece of the muscle    into its individual fibres, we
 find that although some of these are unaltered, others have lost all their
 nuclei, and present the appearance of a coarse granular cylinder.             But
there is sometimes a transition stage seen of peculiar interest.          On the
 surface of the fibre the outlines of a series of quadrangular cells make
 themselves visible, each cell having a distinct nucleus ; and it is easy to
 satisfy one's self that the nuclei of the cells are identical with the nuclei
 seen previously distributed over the surface of the sarcolemma.            These
 cells are sometimes also seen free in the solution, in which case they are
 generally more or less broken up, but sometimes they are seen isolated
 in perfect condition. Figure 21, Plate XL, shows the cells becoming de
 marcated on the fibre, and figure 22, Plate XI., their appearance when
 isolated entire.    The sarcolemma is sometimes seen freed both from the
  cells and their contents ; and in this case the striped cylinder which may be
  seen near it is beset with small perforations.
    The sarcolemmaof muscle is thus covered with flat cells, regular inappear-
 ance and outline, which resist the action of a saturated solution of potash.
     But the action of the potash teaches us something more. A fibre is
 sometimes found apparently unaltered, smooth in its contour, and still
  showing something of the striated appearance, but showing no nuclei.

 One or more round holes are, however, seen on the pieces of broken niuscle-
 eylinder, the more conspicuous because the nuclei are absent; they ire
 about the size of the blood-corpuscle of the frog. By changing the focus,
 it is seen that each hole is only on one side of the fibre. The sharp
 clearness of their outline shows they are not artefacts, but spaces in which
 the sarcolemma is wanting (figure 23, Plate XI.).           A further action of
potash is seen when a muscular fibre is found channelled with one or more
 canals parallel to the long axis of the fibre.        The canals thus seen ire
 uniform in breadth ; they are formed by rows of vacuoles, which corre
 spond in shape and size to the nuclei of cells. (I had observed in study
ing the cornea that the first stage of the destruction of the flat cells, in the
potash solution, is a vacuole taking the place of the nucleus.) By changing
the focus, it is seen that these channels are in the substance of the fibre.
Smaller channels and single vacuoles are seen in different planes.
    A more extended degree of the action of potash on a fibre is when           the
central canal has no longer sharp outlines and is seen to contain        granular
 debris.
    Treatment      of muscular fibre by hematoxylin gives, as regards nuclei,
results confirmatory of those got by potash, in so far as a still greater
number of nuclei are seen internal to the sarcolemma than is indicated
even by that method.          To obtain the best results from hematoxylin, the
fibres should be isolated before being dyed.          The excess of colour being
 removed by acetic acid, the nuclei become distinct ; they are seen to be
arranged in long rows, those of one row being in the same plane. Isolated
nuclei are seen in different planes.        An idea of their number is best
formed from the appearance presented by the broken end of a fibre when
it is turned upwards* giving a view equivalent to a transverse section.
The whole thickness of the fibre is then seen to contain nuclei, in the ar
rangement of which something of a concentric disposition can generally
be observed.         The nuclei are large and oval, and contain one or two
distinct nucleoli.       If the substance of the fibre has been teased, it is seen
that   the fibrillse  are arranged in bundles which have "an equal thickness,
and isolated nuclei are seen adhering to their surface.
    The inferences that are irresistible from these appearances prepare the
way to readily understanding the more decided effects of an appropriate
treatment by chloride of gold.         The conditions of a successful examina
tion of a muscular fibre by gold include the detachment of the perimysium
from the fibre without injuring the latter, the obtaining good transverse
 views in the preparation, and the requisite degree of colouring. As it is im
possible to ensure beforehand a combination of these favourable condi
tions, it is evident that, with equal care, success is not uniform. The
results which      I  now give were obtained by teasing the muscles of the
thigh   of the   frog in aqueous humour before staining with gold.
   In the most perfect preparations thus obtained, the structure of a mus
cular fibre is seen to be almost identical with that of a fasciculus of

                    Connective     Tissue, Nerve, and Muscle.                   527
tendon.       Longitudinally the fibre is seen to consist of parallel bundles
of uniform width, separated by spaces that are indicated by distinct lines ;
and, distributed at intervals in the lines, are oblong nuclei, the long axis
of which is parallel to that of the fibre.         The breadth of the bundles is
about the same as that of a secondary bundle in tendon ; their surface
is smooth and homogeneous (figure 25, Plate XI;).
    A transverse view, corresponding to that of a cross section of tendon,
shows the muscular substance intersected           by stellate spaces, in some of
which nuclei are seen, and, branching out from the spaces, a rich anasto
mosing network of fine dark lines divides the substance of the fibre into
a   number of compartments. Between the appearance             I have just described
and that of a cross section of tendon similarly prepared, the only difference
is that,   in muscle, the fields enclosed by the dark lines are dotted over by
 minute points, which may indicate the fibrillse.
     Nuclei are always seen in fibres successfully          stained with gold, and
 especially    when   the fibre   is  separated  by  teasing   into the bundles of
 fibrillar ; but their number is much less than that seen when hajmatoxylin
 is used. We have seen how, in the cornea, gold when it has deeply stained
 the nucleus of the branched cells leaves that of the flat cell invisible,
 while hematoxylin colours them both.              So it is generally in the capil
 laries of blood-vessels.     I  have found that, in the capillaries of the muscles
  of the frog, these invariably consist of two layers — an internal epithelial
 layer, the outlines of whose cells are defined by nitrate of silver, and an
  external layer, into which a fine system of branched cells enters. Hsema-
  toxylin brings out the nuclei of the cells of both layers.         The deep stain
  ing with gold, while it differentiates the layers by staining the internal
  (epithelial) more intensely than it does the outer (adventitious) layer, shows
  no nuclei in the epithelium, while the nuclei in the outer layer are well
  marked.
      In applying    to muscular     fibre the experience thus acquired, we are
  warranted in concluding that the nuclei coloured in gold are those of cells
  that belong to the branched system, and which are the characteristic
   nuclei seen in the transverse view of a gold-stained muscle, while the
   great majority of those stained by hematoxylin belong to the flat cells of
   the lymphatic   system.
      The isolation of these cells is surrounded by difficulties, which are, how
   ever, surmountable.                                           I
                           In fibres deeply stained by gold have isolated long
   thin flat cells, lying amongst the fibrill®, which are identical in shape
   with similar cells  in the cornea.      They were coloured uniformly deep
   purple, and a distinct nucleus was not visible.         They are represented in
   figure 27, Plate XI.
       Immediately investing the bundles composing a muscular fibre is the
   sarcolemma, which is externally, as       I have shown, covered with flat cells.
   The property possessed by this membrane of resisting acetic acid is the
   cause of a characteristic    appearance presented by a muscular fibre under

 528                   Dr. G. Thin on the Anatomy of
 its influence.   From the broken end a large uneven mass protrudes with
  thick everted lips, bending back over the membrane which forms a stran
 gulating band round the neck of the protrusion. When this sheath is
 ruptured at different parts, the gelatinous substance, which forms a large
proportion of the contents of the fibre, bulges out in masses as it swells.
The fibrillas, which do not swell under the acid, and which are im
bedded in this mass, can be often seen, in teased gold or haematoxylin
preparations, lying unaltered at one part of the field, while displaced
masses of gelatinous substance are seen at another.       (It is the disposition
of this gelatinous substance in parallel bundles which is the cause of the
peculiar effect of chloride of gold, represented in figure 25, Plate XI.)
    The astringent effect of chloride of gold on the sarcolemma produces a
very characteristic appearance. In manipulating a fibre, as a preliminary to
its being hardened by gold, it sometimes happens that the membrane and
the layer of muscle-substance adhering to it is rent longitudinally from
the surface to the centre.       In   the gold solution it loses its cylindrical
form, and spreads itself out as a broad band.        This perfectly flat band is
marked longitudinally with parallel lines, which are straight and equi
distant from each other.      The prolonged action of acetic acid does not
alter the appearance of these lines or their mutual relations, but it makes
visible a not very thick layer of gelatinous substance, which protrudes
from under the edges of the band.
    Without comparing this peculiar appearance in its most exquisite forms
with the transition stages sometimes seen, in which one end of a fibre
still retains its cylindrical form while the other end is flattened out, the
observer might certainly doubt that he was looking at a muscular fibre.
 Interstices between the lines, and, in them, occasional oblong nuclei are
sometimes visible.
    The longitudinal lines are the optical expression of the septa between
 the bundles, which are seen through the transparent sheath ; and that
the fibres in these septa are formed by elastic tissue, is shown by their
 persistence when treated by acetic acid.
    They differ in no respect from the septa and their contained nuclei,
which are seen in muscular fibres that have retained their cylindrical form
 when the chloride of gold has produced that appearance.
    Another occasional effect of the astringent action of gold is an exag
geration of the dimensions of the central canal.        The upturned end of a
fibre is sometimes seen in which there is the appearance of a wide central
cavity, around which the contents of the sarcolemma form a thick rim.
The mechanism of this appearance is explicable by the assumption that
the sarcolemma becomes sufficiently unyielding to form an immovable
surface, towards which the more yielding substance is drawn as the
shrinking caused by the gold proceeds.
    The sarcolemma is probably in very intimate connexion with the elastic
network, the more superficial     cells of which, with their prolongations,  are

                          Connective      Tissue, Nerve, and Muscle.                                529
situated directly under and apparently in contact with it ; and the nu
merous foramina seen in the cylindrical rod left by the potash solution,
when the membrane has been loosened from                             it,
                                                 are probably the points
where the elastic fibres penetrate.
  A muscular fibre thus composed of
                             is                           a number of bundles resembling
those of tendon,            arranged       parallel    to each other, each bundle giving
shelter to number of fibrillae, and separated from the neighbouring bundles
                   a
by   space lined with flat cells.
     a                               In the larger spaces lie branched cells,
and in the smaller the projecting processes of the elastic fibres given out
by the latter.
  The large holes         I have described in the elastic sheath afford passage to
the nerves.            When these have been traced,       reasonable to infer that,
                                                                it   is
here as well as elsewhere, they will be found to follow the lymph-channels.
These holes not only permit the passage of nerves, but allow free com
munication between the lymphatic                       spaces     within the fibre and those
between the perimysium and the sarcolemma.
  The abundance of gelatinous substance in                           a     muscular     fibre accounts
for the phenomenon known as transverse cleavage, which      produced
                                                                                      it is
                                                                                                      by
the action of very diluted hydrochloric acid.    regard    as essentially
                                                                     I
equivalent to the effect produced in tendon when    similar treatment           by                       a
bundle divides transversely into the flat plates known as the " Donde-
rische Bander," after the distinguished histologist who first described
them.
     To sum up these views regarding the structure                               of muscle in   a   few
words,         it   might be said that    a         fasciculus of tendon in
                                                 muscular fibre   is   a
the bundles of which the primitive fibrillfo are imbedded longitudinally.
  The small spaces at the points of junction of flat cells which colour
deeply in silver, and to which allusion has been made by histologists, are
seen in all tissues. They are always present when the colouring has been
intense, and should,   believe, be regarded as playing an important part in
                            I
the mechanism of the lymphatic system.                     They are especially well defined
in the rete Malpighi of the frog, where                   itwould be impossible to regard
them as artefacts.
     It   is   evident from the various anatomical facts above detailed, that the
tissues may be said to be in an almost                 continuity with the
                                                                unbroken

is manifestly no obstacle to the passage of the contents of the lymph-
channel into the blood other than that formed       the wall of the capil  by
laries, which alone separates the fluids of the lymphatic and vascular
systems.    We know that white blood-corpuscles can make their way

     We have        seen that there is a rich          supply of lymphatic channels in the
interior of a muscular fibre, and that the axis-cylinder of a nerve is pro
bably in free communication with the lymph.                         The term " invagination,''
as applied to the relation of the nerves and blood-vessels of particular
                                                                                            as it only
 organs to the lymphatics, has no special physiological meaning,
implies that at certain parts a condition that is universal can, by special
modes of procedure, be made capable of more easy demonstration. Every
nerve-fibre and every blood-vessel is invaginated in lymphatics.
     That there is a plasmatic circulation infinitely more comprehensive
 than that expounded by Yirchow, is, as has been already remarked by
 Kanvier, a fact, which anatomy has placed on an incontrovertible basi?.

 " On     the Refraction          of Sound by the Atmosphere."                         By Prof.

    My object in this paper is to offer explanations of some of the more
 common phenomena of the transmission of sound, and to describe the
 results of experiments in support of these explanations.                       The first part
 of the paper is devoted to the action of           wind    upon sound.       In   this part of
 the subject     I  find that    I  have been preceded by Professor Stokes, who
 in 1857 gave precisely the same explanation as that which occurred to
 me.    I  have, however, succeeded in placing the truth of this explanation
 upon an experimental basis ; and this, together with the fact that my
  work upon this part of the subject is the cause and foundation of what

I have to say on the s3Cond part, must be my excuse for introducing it
here. Iu the second part of the subject                      I
                                           have dealt with the effect of
the atmosphere to refract sound upwards, an effect which is due to the
variation of temperature, and which                      I
                                         believe has not hitherto been
noticed.     I                  show that this refraction explains the
                 have been able to
well-known difference which exists in the distinctness of sounds by day
and by night, as well as other differences in the transmission of sound
arising out of circumstances such as temperature ; and         have applied  I
it in particular to explain the very definite results obtained by Professor
Tyndall in his experiments off the South Foreland.
                              The Effect of Wind upon            Sound-
is a matter of common observation.                      Cases have been    known in which,
against a high wind, guns could not be heard at a distance of 550 yard**,
although on a quiet day the same guns might be heard from ten to
twenty miles. And it is not only with high winds that the effect upon
sound is apparent ; every sportsman knows how important it is to enter
the field on the lee side even when the wind is very light.        In light
winds, however, the effect is not so certain as in high winds ; and (at any
rate so far as our ears are concerned) sounds from a small distance
seem at times to be rather intensified than diminished against very light
winds.   On all occasions the effect of wind seems to be rather against
distance than against distinctness. Sounds heard to windward are for
the most part heard with their full distinctness; and there is only a
comparatively small margin between that point at which the sound is
perceptibly diminished and that at which it ceases to be audible.
    That sound should be blown back by a high wind does not at first
 sight appear to be unreasonable.     Sound is known to travel forward
 through or on the air ; and if the air is itself in motion, moving back
 wards,    it will carry the sound with           and so retard its forward motion —
                                                  it,
just   as the    current of     a   river retards the motion of ships moving up the
 stream.     A little       consideration,    however, serves        to show that the effect
 of wind on sound cannot be explained in this way. The velocity of
 sound (1100 feet per second)  so great compared with that of the
                                             is
 highest wind (50 to 100 feet per second), that the mere retardation of the
 velocity,   that were all, would not be apparent.
            if                                          The sound would
 proceed against the wind with a slightly diminished velocity, at least
1000 feet per second, and with a but very slightly diminished intensity.
   Neither can the effect of wind be solely due to its effect on our hear
ing. There can be no doubt that during         high wind our power
                                                                 a                        of

right angles to the wind are but little affected by it ; and in moderate
winds sounds can be heard further with the wind than when there is
none.
   The same may be said against theories which would explain the effect
of wind as causing a heterogeneous nature in the air so that it might
reflect the sound. All such effects must apply with equal force with and
against the wind.
   This question has baffled investigators for so long a time, because they
have looked for the cause in some direct effect of the motion of the air,
whereas it seems to be but incidentally due to this. The effect appears,
after all, not to be due simply to the wind, but to the difference in the
velocity with which the air travels at the surface of the ground and at a
height above it; that is to say, if we could have a perfectly smooth
surface which would not retard the wind at all, then the wind would not
obstruct sound in the way it does, for it would all be moving with an
equal velocity ; but, owing to the roughfiess of the surface and the ob
structions upon      thereit,    gradual diminution in the velocity of the
                                       is   a
wind as     it
             approaches    the surface.  The rate of this diminution will
depend on the nature of the surface       for instance, in
                                                      ;       meadow the a
velocity at    foot above   the surface    only half what
                                                      is         at an ele
                                                                        it itis is
             1
vation of   8feet, and smaller still compared with what         at greater
heights.
     To understand the way in which this variation in the velocity affects
the sound,   it  necessary to consider that the velocity of the waves of
                     is
sound does depend on the velocity of the wind, although not in great                  a
degree.   To find the velocity of the sound with the wind we must add
that of the wind to the normal velocity of sound, and against the wind
we must subtract the velocity of the wind from the 1100 feet per second
(or whatever may                be the normal of the sound) to find the
                                                  velocity
actual velocity.    Now     the wind  if  moving at 10 feet per second
                                                      is
at the   surface of   meadow,
                            a  and at  20 feet per second at   height of         a
8  feet, the velocity of the sound against the wind will be 1090 feet
per second at the surface and 1080 feet per second at        feet above      8
the surface so that in
                 ;           second the same wave of sound will have
                                       a
travelled   10 feet       further at the surface than at      a  height of 8feet. This
difference of velocity would                cause the wave to tip up and proceed in an
upward direction instead of horizontally. For                 if    we imagine       the front
of wave cf sound to be vertical to start with,
     a                                                will, after proceeding

for one second against the wind,  be inclined at an  angle of more than 45°,
or half a right angle and since sound-waves always move in direction
                                ;                                                a
perpendicular to the direction of the front (that       to say,    the waves
                                                                  is         if
are  vertical they will move  horizontally  and  not  otherwise),   after one
second the wave would be moving upwards at an angle of 45° or more.

by an inclination of the front backwards, and by an upward motion of
the wave.   A similar effect would be produced in a direction opposite to
that of the wind, only as the top of the wave would then be moving
faster than the bottom, the waves would incline forwards and move
downwards.       In this way the effect of the wind is to lift the waves
which proceeded to windward, and to bring those down which move
with it.
    Thus the effect of wind is not to destroy the sound, but to raise the
ends of the wave, which would otherwise move along the ground, to such
a height that they pass over our heads.
    When the ends of the waves are raised from the ground they will
tend to diverge down to it, and throw off secondary waves, or, as          shall  I
call them, diverging waves, so as to reconstitute the gap that is thus
made. These secondary waves will be heard as a continuation of the
sound, more or less faint, after the primary waves are altogether above
our heads. [This phenomenon of divergence presents many difficulties,
and has only as yet been dealt with for particular cases.          It may, how
ever, be assumed, from what is known respecting                it,
                                                            that in the case of
 sound being lifted up from the ground by refraction, or, what is nearly
the same thing, passing directly over the crest of             hill so that the
                                                                    a
 ground falls away from the rays of sound, diverging waves would be
 thrown off very rapidly at first and for considerable distance, depending
                                               a
 on the wave-length of the sound       but as the sound proceeds further the
                                       ;
 diverging rays would gradually become fainter and more nearly parallel
 to the direct rays, until at a sufficient distance they would practically
 cease to exist, or, at any rate, be no greater than those which cause the
 diffraction-bands in     pencil of light*.
                           a                  The divergence would introduce
 bands of diffraction or interference within the direct or geometrical path
 of the sound, as in the case of light. These effects would also be com
  plicated by the reflection of the diverging waves from the ground, which,
 crossing the others at       small angle, would also cause bands of inter
                                a
  ference.   The results of all these causes would be very complicated, but
  their general effect would be to cause        rapid weakening of the sound
                                                   a
  at the ground from the point at which           was first lifted and as the
                                                   it                    ;

  after which the diverging rays, as well as the direct rays, would be lifted,
  and at the ground nothing would be heard. — September 1874.]
      If we leave out of consideration the divergence, then we may form
   some idea as to the path which the bottom of the sound, or the rays                  of
   sound (considered as the rays of light), would follow. If the variation
   in the speed of the wind were uniform from the surface upwards, then
   *   Taking sound of     1   foot wave-length, and comparing it   with light whose ware-
 length is   the flO.OOOth part of on inch, then the divergence of the sound at

  the point at which  it  left the ground would be comparatively tie same as that of the
 light at x\, of an inch from the aperture at which the
                                                           pencil was formed.

                  Refraction      of Sound    by the Atmosphere        .             535
the rays of sound would at first move upwards, very nearly in circles.
The radii of these circles may           be  shown    to   be  1100    x —- — ,    where
v, and v% are the velocities of the wind         in feet per second at elevations
differing by h feet. In fact, however,           the variation is greatest at the
ground, and diminishes as we proceed            upwards, so that the actual path
would be more that of a parabola.
     Also, owing to this unequal variation       in the velocity, those parts of the
waves immediately adjacent to the ground will rise more rapidly than
the part immediately above them ; hence there will be a crowding of the
 waves at a few feet from the ground, and this will lead to an intensifying
 of the sound at this point. Hence, notwithstanding the divergence, we
 might expect the waves to windward to preserve their full intensity so
 long as they were low enough to be heard. And this is in accordance
 with the fact, often observed, that sounds at short distances are not
 diminished but rather intensified when proceeding against the wind.
     It will at once be perceived that by this action of the wind the dis
 tance to which sounds can be heard to windward must depend on the
 elevation of the observer and the sound-producing body.                  This does not
 appear to be a fact of general observation.         It is difficult to concnive how
 it can have been overlooked, except that, in nine cases out of ten, sounds
 are not continuous, and thus do not afford an opportunity of comparing
 their distinctness at different places. It has often astonished me, how
 ever, when shooting, that a wind which did not appear to me to make
                                                         I
the least difference to the direction in which could hear small sounds
 most distinctly, should yet be sufficient to cover one's approach to par
 tridges, and more particularly to rabbits, even until one was within a few
 feet of them — a fact which shows how much more effectively the wind
 obstructs sound near the ground than even a few feet above it.
     Elevation, however, clearly offered a crucial test whether such an action
 as that   I have described was the cause of the effect of wind upon sound.
 Having once entertained the idea, it was clearly possible to put it to
 the test in this way.       Also, if the principles hold in sound, something
 analogous must hold in the case of waves on the surface of a running
 stream of water — for instance, waves made near the bank of a river.
    I  had just reached the point of making such tests when                I  discovered
that the same views       had   been   propounded by      Professor     Stokes so long
ago    as 1857*.    Of  course,    after  such a  discovery,   it seemed     almost un
necessary for me to pursue the matter further ; but as there were one
or two points about which          I  was not then quite certain, and as Prof.
 Stokes's paper does not appear to be so well known as it might be (I
 do not know of one writer on sound who has adopted this explanation),
it still seemed that it might be well, if possible, to put the subject
on an experimental basis.            I  therefore made the experiments             I  am

about to describe ; and   I am glad that    I did not rest content without
them, for they led me to what      I believe to be the discovery of refrac
tion of sound by the atmosphere.

    The results of my first observation are shown in fig. 1. This repre
 sents the shape of the waves as they proceeded outwards from a point
 near the bank of a stream about 12 feet wide.       Had the water been at
 rest there would have been semicircular rings ; as it was, the front
 of the waves up the stream made an obtuse angle with the wall, which
 they gradually left. The ends of the waves, it will be observed, gradually
 died out, showing the effect of divergence.    The waves proceeding down
 the stream were, on the other hand, inclined to the wall, which they
 approached.
    I was able to make a somewhat better observation in the Medlock,
 near the Oxford Road Bridge, Manchester.         A pipe sent a succession
 of drops  into  the water at a few inches from the wall, which, falling
 from a considerable height, made very definite waves. Fig. 2 represents

as the effect of wind on sound.
    In  the next place     I endeavoured to ascertain the effect which eleva
tion   has on the distance to which sound can be heard against a wind.
In    making   these experiments       I  discovered some facts relating to the
transmission of sound over a rough surface, which, although somewhat
obvious, appear hitherto to have escaped attention.
    My apparatus consisted of an electrical bell, mounted on              a case con
taining    a battery.      The bell was placed horizontally on the top of the
fcase, so that it could be heard equally well in all directions ; and when
 standing on the ground the bell was 1 foot above the surface.                  I also
 used an anemometer.
    These experiments were made on four different days, the 6th, 9th,
 10th, and 11th of March.          On the first of these the wind was very light,
 on the others      it was moderately strong, strongest on the second and
 fourth ; on all four the direction was the same, viz. north. On the two
 last days the ground was covered with snow, which gave additional in
 terest to the experiments, inasmuch as it enabled me to compare the
 effect of different surfaces.                                    I
                                     On the first two days was alone, but on
 the last two    I had the assistance of Mr. J. B. Millar, of Owens College,
 whose ears were rather better than mine, although                I  am not aware of
 any deficiency     in  this respect.     The  experiments     were   all made in the
 same place, a flat meadow of considerable extent.
                       The General Results of    the  Experiments.
     De La Roche*, in his experiment, found that the wind produced least
 effect on the sound at right angles to its direction, t. e. sounds could be
 heard furthest in this direction.         His method of experimenting, however,
  was not the same as mine.           He compared the sounds from two equal
 bells, and in all cases placed the bells at such distances that the sounds
  were equally distinct. I, on the other hand, measured the extreme
  distance at which the sounds could be heard, the test being whether or
  not the observer noticed a break in the continuity of sound, a stoppage
  of the bell.    The difference in our method of experimenting accounts for
  the difference in our results.      I  found in every case that the sound could
  be heard   further with the wind than at right angles to its direction ; and
  when the wind was at all strong, the range with the wind was more than
  double that at right angles.         It does not follow, however, nor was the
  fact observed, that at comparatively short distances the sound with the
  wind was more intense than at right angles.
     The explanation of this fact, which was fully borne out by all the ex
  periments, is that the sound which comes in immediate contact with the
  ground is continually destroyed by the rough surface, and the sound from
  above is continually diverging down to replace that which has been
                         * Annales de Chimie, vol. i. p. 177
                                                             (1816).

538                       Prof. O. Reynolds on the
destroyed.      These diverging waves are in their turn destroyed ; so that
 there is a gradual weakening of the intensity of the waves near the
 ground,   and this weakening extends upwards as the waves proceed.
 Therefore, under ordinary circumstances, when there is no wind the
 distant sounds which pass above us are more intense than those which
 we hear.                  I
             Of this fact have abundant evidence. On the 6th, when the
 wind was light, at all distances greater than 20 yards from the bell the
 sound was much less at the ground than a few feet above it ; and       I  was
 able to recover the sound after it had been lost in every direction by
 mounting on to a tree, and even more definitely by raising the bell on to
 a post 4 feet high, which     had the effect of doubling the range of the
 sound in every direction except with the wind, although even in this the
 range was materially increased.
    It is obvious that the rate at which the sound is destroyed by the
 ground    will depend on the roughness of its surface.       Over grass we
 might expect the sound at the ground to be annihilated, whereas over
 water it would hardly be affected.    This was shown to be the case by
 the difference in the range at right angles to the wind over grass, and
 over the same      ground when completely covered with snow.          In the
 latter case  I  could hear the sound at 200 yards, whereas      I could only
 hear it at 70 or 80 in the former.
    Now, owing to the fact that the sound is greater over our heads than
 at the ground, any thing which slowly brings down the sound will
 increase the range.     Hence, assuming {hat the action of the wind is to
 bring down the sound in the direction in which it is blowing, we see
 that it must increase its range in this direction.     And it must also be
 seen that in this direction there will be less difference in the intensity of
 the sound from the ground upwards than in other directions.              This
 was observed to be the case on all occasions.        In the direction of the
 wind, when it was strong, the sound could be heard as well with the head
 on the ground as when raised, even when in a hollow with the bell hidden
 from view by the slope of the ground ; and no advantage whatever was
 gained either by ascending to an elevation or raising the bell.        Thus,
 with the wind over the grass the sound could be heard 140 yards, and
 over snow 360 yards, either with the head lifted or on the ground;
 whereas at right angles to the wind on all occasions the Tange was
 extended by raising either the observer or the bell.
    It has been necessary to notice these points ; for, as will be seen, they
 bear directly on the question of the effect of elevation on the range of
 sound against the wind.
    Elevation was found to affect the range of sound against the wind in
a much more marked manner than at right angles.
    Over the grass no sound could be heard with the head on the ground
at 20 yards from the bell, and at 30 yards it was lost with the head 3 feet
from the ground, and its full intensity was lost when standing erect at

                   Refraction of Sound by the Atmosphere.                     539
30 yards. At 70 yards, when standing erect, the sound was lost at long
intervals, and was only faintly heard even then ; but it became continuous
again when the ear was raised 9 feet from the ground, and it reached its
full intensity at an elevation of 12 feet.
     Over the snow similar effects were observed at very nearly equal
distances.       There was this difference, however, the sound was not
entirely lost when the head was lowered or even on the ground.               Thus
at 30 yards    I  could still hear a faint sound.     Mr. Millar could hear this
better than      I  could ; he, however, experienced the same increase on
raising   his head.    At 90 yards    I lost the sound entirely when standing
on the ground, but recovered it again when the ear was 9 feet from the
ground. Mr. Millar, however, could hear the sound very faintly, and at
intervals, at 160 yards ; but not with his head on the ground.            At this
        I
point was utterly unable        to hear it ; and  even  at an elevation of 25 feet
I   gave it up as hopeless.      However, as Mr. Millar by mounting 10 feet
higher seemed to hear it very much better,         I again ascended ; and at an
elevation of 33 feet from the ground          I  could hear it as distinctly as  I
had previously heard it when standing at 90 yards from the bell.                 I
could not hear it 5 feet lower down ; so that it was the last 5 feet which
 had brought me into the foot of the wave.           Mr. Millar experienced the
 same change in this 5 feet.       As the sound could now be heard as strong
 as at a corresponding distance with the wind, we thought we had reached
 the full intensity of the waves.       This, however, was not the case ; for
 the least raising of the bell was followed by a considerable intensifying
 of the sound ; and when it was raised 6 feet      I  could hear each blow of the
 hammer distinctly, although just at that time a brass band was playing
 in the distance. It seemed to me that        I could hear it as distinctly as at
 30 yards to leeward of the bell.          All these results were repeated on
 both days with great uniformity.
     When more than 30 yards to the windward of the bell, the raising of
 the bell was always accompanied by a marked intensifying of the sound,
 and particularly over the grass.       I  could only hear the bell at 70 yards
  when on the ground ; yet when set on a post 5 feet high              I  heard it
  160 yards, or more than twice the distance.         This is a proof of what    I
  previously pointed out, that the waves rise faster at the ground than they
  do high up, and crowding together they intensify. In all cases there was
  an unmistakable greater distinctness of the sound from short distances to
  windward than to leeward or at right angles.
     Except when the sound was heard with full force it was not uniform.
  The bell gave two sounds (the beats of the hammer and the ring) which
  could be easily distinguished ; and at times we could hear only the ring,
  and at others the beats. The ring seemed to preserve itself the longest ;
  whereas near the ground at short distances the ring was lost first.         This
  is explained    by the fact that the rate at which sound-waves diverge
  depends upon their note : the lower the note the more will they diverge.

540                        Prof. O. Reynolds on the
Thus the   beats diverge more     rapidly than the ring, and consequently die
out sooner   ;  whereas when the head is on the ground near the bell it is
only the diverging waves that are heard, and here the beats have the
best chance. The intensity of the sound invariably seemed to waver ;
and as one approached the bell from the windward side, the sound did
not intensify uniformly or gradually, but by fits or jerks ; this was the
result of crossing the rays' interference, such as those shown in fig. 2.
   During the observations the velocity of the wind was observed from
time to time at points 1 foot and 8 feet above the surface.
   On the 9th, that is over grass, it varied from 4 feet per second at
1 foot and 8 feet per second at 8 feet, to 10 feet at 1 foot and 20 feet at
8 feet, always having     about twice the velocity at 8 feet that            it had    at
1 foot above the ground.
   Over the snow there was not quite so much variation above and below.
On the 1 Oth the wind varied from 3 feet at 1 foot to 4 feet at 8 feet *. On
the 11th the variation was from 12 at       1  foot and 19 at 8 feet to 6 at       1 foot
and 10 at 8 feet. Thus over snow the variation in the velocity was only
about one third instead of half.
                                                      I
   Since the foregoing account was written, have had an opportunity of
experimenting on a strong west wind (on the 14th of March) ; and the
results of these experiments are, if any thing, more definite than those of
the previous ones. The wind on this occasion had a velocity of 37 feet
per second at an elevation of 12 feet and of 33 at 8 feet and 17 at 1 foot.
The experiments were made in the same meadows as before, the snow
having melted, so that the grass was bare.
                     I
   With the wind could hear the bell at 120 yards, either with the bell
on the ground or raised 4 feet above it. At right angles to the direction
of the wind    it ranged about 60 yards with the bell on the ground, and
80 yards when the bell was elevated.
   To windward, with the bell standing on the ground (which, it must be
remembered, means that the bell was actually             1  foot above the surface),
the sound was heard as follows : — ¦

   These results entirely confirm those of the previous experiments ; and
the intensifying of the sounds to windward by the raising of the bell was
      * The wind fell rapidly towards the close of the observations on this day.

even more marked than before ; for at 90 yards to windward, with the
                  I
bell raised, could hear it much more distinctly than at a corresponding
distance to leeward. This fact calls for a word of special explanation ; it is
clearly due to the fact that the variation in the velocity of the air is much
greater near the ground than at a few feet above it. When the bell is
on the ground all the sound must pass near the ground, and will all be
turned up to a nearly equal extent ; but when the bell is raised, the rays
of sound which proceed horizontally will be much less bent or turned up
than those which go down to the ground ; and consequently, after pro
ceeding some distance, these rays will meet or cross, and if the head bj
at this point they will both fall on the ear together, causing a sound of
double intensity. It is this crossing of the rays also which for the most
part causes the interference seen in fig. 2.
     These experiments establish three things with regard to the transmis
 sion of sound : —
     1 . That when there is no wind, sound proceeding over a rough surface
 is more intense above than below.
     2. That as long as the velocity of the wind is greater above than
 below, sound is lifted up to windward and is not destroyed.
     3. That under the same circumstances it is brought down to leeward,
 and hence its range extended at the surface of the ground.
     These experiments also show that there is less variation in the velocity
 of the wind over a smooth surface than over a rough one.
     It seems to me that these facts fully confirm the hypotheses propounded
 by Prof. Stokes, that they place the action of wind beyond question, and
 that they afford explanations of many of the anomalous cases that have been
 observed      ; for instance, that sounds can be heard much further over water
 than over land, and also that a light wind at sea does not appear to affect
  sound at all, the fact being that the smooth water does not destroy either
  the sound or the motion of the air in contact with it. When the wind
  and sea are rough the case is different.
                         The Effect of Variations of Temperature.
     Having observed how the wind acts to lift the waves of sound by
  diminishing their velocity above compared with what is below, it was
  evident     to me that any other atmospheric cause which would diminish
  the velocity above or increase that below would produce the same effect,
  viz. would cause the waves to rise.
     Such a cause must at certain times exist in the variation in the condi
  tion of the air as we proceed upwards from the surface.
     Although barometric pressure does not affect the velocity of sound,
  yet, as is well known, the velocity of sound depends on the temperature*,
     *  It varies  as the square root of       an<^ consequently as the square root of the
  absolute temperature.

542                         Prof. O. Reynolds on the
and every degree of temperature between 32° and 70° adds approximately
 1 foot per second to the velocity of sound.            This velocity also increases
with the quantity of moisture       in the   air ;  but the quantity is at all times
too small to produce an appreciable result.               This vapour nevertheless
plays an important part in the phenomena under consideration ; for it
gives to the air a much greater power of radiating and absorbing heat,
and thus renders it much more susceptible of changes in the action of
the sun.
    If, then, the air we're all at the same temperature and equally saturated
with moisture, the velocity of sound would be the same at all elevations ;
but   if the temperature is greater, or     if it contains more water below than
above, then the wave of sound          will proceed quicker below than above,
and will be     turned up in the same way as against a wind.              This action
of the atmosphere is, strictly speaking, analogous to the refraction of
light. In light, however, it is density which retards motion ; temperature
and pressure have little or nothing to do with it ; and since the density
increases downwards, the rays of h'ght move slower below than they do
above, and are therefore bent downwards, and thus the distance at which
we can see objects is increased.        With sound, however, since it is tempe
rature which affects the velocity, the reverse is the case ; the rays are
bent upwards, and the distance from which we can hear is reduced.
    It is a well-known fact that the temperature of the air diminishes as
we proceed upwards, and that it also contains less vapour.                  Hence it
follows that, as a rule, the waves      of  sound    must   travel faster below than
they    do  above,  and thus  be refracted   or   turned   upward.
    The variation of temperature is, however, by no means constant, and a
little consideration serves to show that it will be greatest in a quiet
atmosphere when the sun is shining.                  The sun's rays, acting most
powerfully     on  that air which  contains    the   most  vapour, warms the lower
strata more than those above them ; and besides this, they warm the sur
face of the earth, and this warmth is taken up by the air in contact with
it.    It is not, however, only on such considerations as these that we are
in  a position to assert the law of variation of atmospheric temperature.
Mr. Glaisher has furnished us with information on the subject which
places it beyond the region of surmise.
    I                                     "
      extract the following from his lieport on Eight Balloon Ascents in

                From 2900 to 5000          „      0°-3  for every 100 feet.
      " The   decline of temperature near the earth with a partially clear sky
is    nearly double that with a cloudy sky.
      " In  some cases, as on  July  30th, the decline of temperature in the first
100 feet was       as large as
      We may say, therefore, that when the sky is clear the variation of
 temperature as.we proceed upwards from 1 to 3000 feet will be more
 than double what it is when the sky is cloudy.            And since for such small
 variations th6 variation in the velocity of sound, that is the refraction, is
 proportional to the temperature, this refraction will be twice as great with
 a clear sky as when the sky is cloudy.
      This is the mean difference, and there are doubtless exceptional cases
 in which the variations are both greater and less than those given; during
 the night the variations are less than during the day, and again in winter
 than in summer.
       This reasoning at once suggested an explanation of the well-known
  fact that sounds are less intense during the day than at night.           This is a
  matter of common observation, and has been the subject of scientific
  inquiry. F. De La Roche discusses the subject, and exposes the fal
  lacies of several theories advanced to account for it. Amongst others
   there are some remarks by Humboldt, in which he says that the dif
   ference is not due to the quietness of the night, for he had observed
   the same thing near the torrid zone, where the day seemed quieter than
  the night, which was rendered noisy with insects.
       It is, however, by the experiments of Prof. Tyndall that this fact has
   been fully brought to light ; and from their definite character they afford
   an opportunity of applying the explanation, and furnish a test of its
   soundness.
       Neglecting the divergence of the bottom of the waves, a difference of
    1 degree in the 100 feet would cause       the rays of sound, otherwise hori
    zontal, to move on a circle, the radius of which by the previous rule
    = 1100   . -44=110,000 feet.       A  variation    of one half this would cause
    them to move on a circle of 220,000 feet radius.         From the radii of these
    circles we can calculate the range     of the sound from different elevations.
       With a clear sky, i. «.  with  a radius  110,000 feet from an elevation of
    235 feet, the sound would be audible with full force to 1-36 mile ; the
    direct sound would then be lifted above the surface, and only the di
    verging sound would be audible.        From an elevation of 15 feet, however,
    the direct sound might be heard to a distance of -36, or \ mile further,
    so that in all it could be heard 1-72 (1|) mile.
       With a cloudy sky, i. e. with a radius 220,000 feet, the direct sound

 544                         Prof. O. Reynolds on the
 would be heard to 2-4 miles from an elevation of 15 feet, or 1*4 times what
it is with the clear sky. These results have been obtained by taking the
extreme variations        of temperature at the surface of the earth.                At
certain times, however, in the evening, or when it was raining, the variation
would be much less than this, in which             case the  direct  sound would     be
heard to much greater distances.
   [So far     I have only spoken of the direct or geometrical rays of sound,
that is,   I  have supposed the edge of the sound to be definite, and not
fringed with diverging         rays ; but, as has been already explained, the
sound would diverge downwards, and from this cause would be heard to
a considerable distance beyond the point at which                the .direct rays first
left the ground.        From this point, however, the sound would become
rapidly fainter until it was lost. The extension which divergence would
thus add to the range of the sound would obviously depend on the re
fraction — that is to say, when the direct rays were last refracted upwards,
the extension of the range due to divergence would be greatest.                   It is
difficult to say what the precise effect of this divergence would be : but we
may assume that it would be similar to that which was found in the case
of wind, only the refraction being so much smaller the extension of the
range by divergence would be greater.              On the whole the results calcu
lated from the data furnished by Mr. Glaisher agree in a remarkable
manner with those observed ; for if we add | mile for the extension of
the range by divergence, the calculated distance with a clear sky would
be two miles from a cliff 235 feet high. —September 1874.]
   Now Prof. Tyndall found that from the cliffs at the South Foreland,
235 feet high, the minimum range of sound was a little more than
2 miles, and that this occurred on a quiet July day with hot sunshine.
The ordinary range seemed to be from 3 to 5 miles when the weather
was dull, although sometimes, particularly in the evening, the sounds
 were heard as far as 15 miles.          This was, however, only under very ex
 ceptional circumstances.         Prof. Tyndall also found that the interposition
of a cloud was followed by an almost immediate extension of the range
of the sound.         I extract the following passages from Prof. TyndaU's
Ecport — :
   " On June       2 the maximum range, at        first only 3 miles, afterwards ran
up to about 6 miles.
   " Optically, June 3 was not at all           a promising day ; the     clouds were
dark   and    threatening,  and   the  air filled  with a faint haze ;    nevertheless
the horns were fairly audible at 9 miles.               An exceedingly     heavy rain-
shower approached        us at  a galloping speed. The sound was          not sensibly
impaired during the continuance of the rain.
   "July     3 was a lovely morning : the sky was of a stainless          blue, the air
calm, and the sea smooth.           I thought we should be able to        hear a long
way   off.     We   steamed   beyond the pier end and listened.            The steam-
clouds were there, showing the whistles to be active ; the                smoke-puffs

                   Refraction of Sound by the Atmosphere.                     515
were there, attesting the activity of the guns. Nothing was heard. We
went nearer ; but at two miles horns and whistles and guns were equally
inaudible. This, however, being near the limit of the sound-shadow,              I
thought that might have something to do with the effect, so we steamed
right in front of the station, and halted at 3| miles from it. Not a
ripple nor a breath of air disturbed the stillness on board, but we heard
nothing.      There were the steam-puffs from the whistles, and we knew
that    between every two pufls the horn-sounds were embraced, but we
heard nothing. We signalled for the guns ; there were the smoke-puffs
apparently close at hand, but not the slightest sound. It was mere
dumb-show on the Foreland. We steamed in to 3 miles, halted, and
listened with all attention.      Neither the horns nor the whistles sent us
 the slightest hint of a sound. The guns were again signalled for ; five
 of them were fired, some elevated, some fired point-blank at us. Not one
 of them was heard. We steamed in to two miles, and had the guns
 again fired : the howitzer and mortar with 3-lb. charges yielded the
 faintest thud, and the 18-pounder was quite unheard.
                                          I
     " In the presence of these facts stood amazed and confounded ; for it
 had been assumed and affirmed by distinguished men who had given spe
 cial attention to this subject, that a clear, calm atmosphere was the best
 vehicle of sound : optical clearness and acoustic clearness were supposed
 to go hand in hand        *    *      *.
           I
     "As stood upon the deck of the 'Irene' pondering this question,             I
 became conscious of the exceeding power of the sun beating against my
 back and heating the objects near me. Beams of equal power were
  falling on the sea, and must have produced copious evaporation.            That
  the vapour generated should so rise and mingle with the air as to form
  an absolutely homogeneous mixture          I considered in the highest degree
  improbable.     It would   bo  sure,    I thought, to streak and mottle the
  atmosphere with spaces, in which the air would be in different degrees
  saturated, or it might be displaced by the vapour.        At the limiting sur
  faces of these spaces, though invisible, we should have the conditions
  necessary to the production of partial echoes, and the consequent waste
  of sound.
      " Curiously enough, the conditions necessary for the
                                                               testing of this ex
  planation immediately set in. At 3.15 p.m. a cloud threw itself athwart
  the sun, and shaded the entire space between us and the South Fore
  land. The production of vapour was checked by the interposition of this
  screen, that already in the air being at the same time allowed to mix
  with it more perfectly ; hence the probability of improved transmission.
  To test this inference    the steamer was turned       and urged back to our
                                                      I
  last position of inaudibility. The sounds, as expected, were distinctly
   though faintly heard. This was at 3 miles distance.           At 3| miles we
   had the guns fired, both point-blank and elevated.         The faintest thud
   was all that we heard ; but we did hear a thud, whereas we had previously

54G                              Prof. O. Reynolds on the
heard nothing, either here or three quarters of a mile nearer. "We
steamed out to 4% miles, when the sounds were for a moment faintly-
heard, but they fell away as we waited ; and though the greatest quiet
ness reigned on board, and though the sea was without a ripple, we could
hear nothing.   We could plainly see the steam-puffs which announced
the beginning and the end of a series of trumpet-blasts, but the blasts
themselves were quite inaudible.
   " It was now 4 p.m., and my intention at first was to halt at this dis
tance, which was beyond the sound-range, but not far beyond      and see       it,
whether the lowering of the sun would not restore the power of the
atmosphere to transmit the sound.    But after waiting   little, the an    a
choring of   boat was suggested and though loth to lose the anticipated
                  a                       ;
revival of the sounds myself,   agreed to this arrangement.
                                         I                       Two men
were placed in the boat, and requested to give all attention, so as to hear
the sound         if
              possible.  With perfect stillness around them, they heard
nothing.   They were then instructed to hoist a signal   they should hear
                                                                     if
the sounds, and to keep    hoisted as long as the sounds continued.
                                    it
   " At 4.45 we quitted them and steamed towards the South Sand Head
light-ship.  Precisely fifteen minutes after we had separated from them
the flag was hoisted.   The sound, as anticipated, had at length succeeded
in piercing the body of air between the boat and the shore.
     " On returning to our anchored boat, we learned that when the flag was
hoisted the horn-sounds were heard, that they were succeeded after a
little time by the whistle-sounds, and that both increased in intensity as
the evening advanced.               On our arrival of course we heard the sounds
ourselves.
     " The conjectured explanation of the stoppage of the sounds appeared
to be thus reduced to demonstration                 ;    but we pushed the proof still
further by steaming further out.               At   J5   miles we halted   and heard the
sounds.   At miles we heard them distinctly, but so feebly that we
                       6
thought we had reached the limit of the sound-range; but while we
waited the sound rose in power.     We steamed to the Varne buoy, which
is    miles from the signal-station, aud heard the sounds there better
     7|
than at       6   miles distance.
   " Steaming on to the Varne light-ship, which    situated at the other end
                                                               is
of the Varne shoal, we hailed the master, and were informed by him that
up to    p.m. nothing had been heard.
          5                               At that hour the sounds began to
be audible.    He described one of them as very gross, resembling the
                                                           '
bellowing  of   bull,' which very accurately characterizes the sound of the
                      a
large American steam-whistle.      At the Varne lightship, therefore, the
sounds had been heard towards                 the close of the day, though     it    is
                                                                                          12|
miles from the signal-station."
     Here we       see that the very conditions which actually diminished the range
of the sound were precisely those which would cause the greatest lifting
of the waves.  And    may be noticed that these facts were observed and
                            it

                       Refraction of Sound by the Atmosphere.                             547
recorded by Prof. Tyndall with his mind altogether unbiased with any
thought of establishing this hypothesis.                 He was looking for an expla
nation in quite another direction.                 Had it not been so he would probably
have ascended the mast, and thus found whether or not the sound was
all the time passing over his head. On the worst day an ascent of
 30 feet should have extended the range nearly | mile.
      The height of the sound-producing instruments is apparently treated
 as ^subordinate question by Prof. Tyndall.                     At the commencement of
 his lecture, he stated that the instruments were mounted on the top and
 at the bottom of the cliff ; and he subsequently speaks of their being
 235 feet above him. He does not, however, take any notice of the com
 parative range of those on the top and those at the bottom of the cliff ;
 but wherever he mentions them he speaks of them as on the cliff, lead
 ing me to suppose that for some reason those at the bottom of the cliff
 had been abandoned, or that they were less efficient than those above.
 If I     am right in this surmise, if the sounds from balow did not range so
 far as those from above, it is a fact in accordance with refraction, but of
 which,       I think, Prof. Tyndall has offered no explanation.
       [Besides the results of Prof. Tyndall's experiments there are many
  other phenomena which are explained by this refraction.                         Humboldt
  could hear the falls of Orinoco three times as loud by night as by day
  at a distance of one league ; and he states that the same phenomenon has
  been observed near every waterfall in Europe. And although Humboldt
  gave another        explanation*, which was very reasonable when applied to
  the particular case at Orinoco t, yet it must be admitted that the circum
  stances were such as would cause great upward refraction ; and hence
  there can be but little doubt that refraction had a good deal to do with
  the diminution of the sound by day.
       In fact if this refraction of sound               exists, then, according      to   Mr.
   Glaisher's     observations,       it must    be seldom that      we can hear       distant
   sounds with any thing like their full distinctness, particularly by day ;
   and any elevation in the observer or the source of the sound above the
       * '* That the sun acts upon the                                of sound by the obstacles
                                          propagation and intensity
   met in currents    of air of different density, and by the partial undulations of the atmo
   sphere arising from unequal heating of different parts of the soil               During the
   day there is a sudden interruption of density wherever small streamlets of air of a high
   temperature    rise over parts of the soil unequally heated.   The sonorous undulations are
   divided, as the rays of light are refracted wherever strata of air of unequal density are
   contiguous.     The propagation of sound is altered when a stratum of hydrogen gas is
   made to rise over a stratum       of atmospheric air in a tube closed at one end ; and M.
   Biot has well explained, by the interposition of bubbles of carbonic acid gas, why a glass
   filled with champagne is not sonorous so long as that gas is evolved and passing through
   the Btrata of the liquid." — Humboldfs Travels, Bonn's Series, vol. ii. p. 264.
       t The sounds proceeded over a plane covered with rank vegetation interspersed with
   black rocks.    These latter attained a very considerable elevation of temperature under
   the effects of the tropical sun, as much as 48" C, while the air was only 28°; and hence
   over each rock there would be a column of hot air ascending.

a gentle   wind, which brings the sound down and so counteracts the
effect of refraction. And hence we have an explanation of the surprising
distances to which sounds can sometimes be heard, particularly the ei-
plosion of meteors, as well as a reason for the custom of elevating chureli-
bells and sounds to be heard at great distances.  — September 1874.]
