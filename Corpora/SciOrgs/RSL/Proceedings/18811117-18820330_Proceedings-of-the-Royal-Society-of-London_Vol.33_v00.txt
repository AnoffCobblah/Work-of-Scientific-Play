  withdrawn from the other half, and the instrument then directed
   to Arcturus for fifteen minutes.
       After development, the plate presented a very distinct spectrum of
  the comet, together with the spectrum of the star, which               I have
  already     described   in  the  paper referred to above.
       The spectrum of the comet consists of a pair of bright lines in the
  ultra-violet region, and a continuous spectrum which can be traced
  from about F to some distance beyond H.
      The bright lines, a little distance beyond H, with an approximate
  wave-length from 3870 to 3890, appear to belong to the spectrum of
  carbon (in some form, possibly in combination with hydrogen), which
  I observed in the spectra of the telescopic comets of ] 866 and 1868.
      In the continuous spectrum shown in the photograph, the dark
 lines of Fraunhofer can be seen.
      This photographic evidence supports the results of my previous
 observations in the visible spectra of some telescopic comets.         Part of
 the light from comets is reflected solar light, and another part is light
 of their own.        The spectrum of this light shows the presence in the
 comet of carbon, possibly in combination with hydrogen.
      On the next night, June 25, a second photograph was obtained with
 an exposure of an hour and a half. This photograph, notwithstanding
 the longer exposure, is fainter, but shows distinctly the two bright
 lines and the continuous spectrum, which is too faint to allow the
 Fraunhofer lines to be seen.
                             (Postscript, July 9, 1881.)
     I  have since measured         the photographs of the comet's spectrum,
 and    I find  for  the two    strong bright lines the wave-lengths 3883 and
 3870.      The less refrangible line is much stronger, and a faint lumi
 nosity can be traced from it to a little beyond the second line 3870.
 There can be, therefore, no doubt that these lines represent the
brightest end of the ultra-violet group which appears under certain
circumstances       in the spectra of the compounds of carbon.      Professors
Liveing and Dewar have found for the strong line at the beginning of
this group the wave-length 3882'7, and for the second line 3&70-5.
     I am also able to see upon the continuous solar spectrum, a
distinct impression of the group of lines between G and h, which is
usually associated with the group described above. My measures for
the less refrangible end of this group give a wave-length of 4230,
which arrets as well as can be expected with Professors Liveing and
Dewar's measure 4220.
    In their paper " On the Spectra of the Compounds of Carbon,"
"Proc. Roy. Soc," vol. 30, p. 494, Professors Liveing and Dewar
show that these two groups indicate the presence of cyanogen, and

Proa Roy. Soc. Vol8 3

 are not to be seen    in the absence of nitrogen.    If this be the case, the
 photograph gives nndonbted evidence of the presence of nitrogen in
 the comet, in addition to the carbon and hydrogen shown to be there
 by the bright groups in the visible part of the spectrum.             On this
 hypothesis we must further suppose a high temperaturo in the comet
 unless the cyanogen is present ready formed.
    I should state that Mr. Lockyer regards tho two groups in the pho
 tograph, and the groups in the visible spectrum, to be due to the
 vapour of carbon at different heat-levels (" Proc. Roy. Soc." vol. 30,
 p. 461).
    It is of importance to mention the strong intensity in the photo
graph of the lines 3883 and 3870, as compared with the continuous
spectrum, and the faint bright group beginning at 4230.               At this
part of the spectrum, therefore, the light emitted by the cometary
matter exceeded by many times the reflected solar light.             I reserve
for the present the theoretical suggestions which arise from the new

II. " Note     on the Reversal of the Spectrum         of Cyanogen." By
       G. D. Liveing, M.A., F.R.S., Professor of Chemistry, and J.
       Dewar, M.A., F.R.S., Jacksonian Professor, University of
       Cambridge.       Received    July  4, 1881.
     In the course of many observations         on the reversal of lines     of
metallic spectra, we have frequently noticed dark shaded bands which
appeared to be the reversals of bands ascribed to the oxides or
chlorides of snndry metals ; more particularly we have seen them when
experimenting with compounds of the alkaline earths, and we have
repeatedly obtained a reversal of the green magnesium-hydrogen
series ; but, until recently, we have never seen any reversal of the shaded
bands of the spectrum of cyanogen, though our attention lias been
constantly directed to this spectrum.        Quite lately, however, we have
obtained photographs which show the reversal of the violet and
altra-violet bands of this spectrum ; and the fact is perhaps of suffi
cient interest, especially in connexion with the question of the occur
                                                                   B  2

 4       Mr. C. W. Merrifield.             Sums   of the  Series  of  the   [Nov.    17,
 rence of these bands amongst the Fraunhofer lines, to warrant the
 publication of this note. We have not yet succeeded in determining
 precisely the conditions under which the reversal can be produced at
 will. The most complete reversals of these bands were obtained by
 the use of the arc of a Siemens'          machine, in a crucible of magnesia, fed
 with a considerable quantity of cyanide of titanium.                      The photo
 graphs    in  this  case  show   a  very    complete   reversal   of  the  five bands
 near L, and of the two strong bands near N, and a less complete
 reversal of the six bands, beginning at about wave-length 4215. No
 other metallic cyanides have given, when introduced into the crucible,
 any such reversal ; nor does a stream of cyanogen led in through a
 perforated carbon produce the effect.                 Various other nitrogenous
 compounds      have  been   tried,  but   the  only one   which has given us any
 thing like the effect of the titanic cyanide is borate of ammonia.
 Some photographs taken immediately after the introduction of borate
 of ammonia show distinctly the reversal of the group of bands near
 L. In one case when metallic magnesium had been put into the
crucible, the photograph shows a reversal of only that part of the
series which is nearest to the magnesium group, indicating that the
reversal is due to the bright background supplied by the expanded
magnesium lines.          There can be little doubt that the greater stability
of titanic cyanide and boron nitride than of other nitrogenous com
pounds, has some influence upon the result ; and the difficulty in pro
ducing the reversal at will is in securing an absorbent stratum of suffi
ciently high temperature und at the same time a sufficiently luminons
background. The circumstances which secure the former condition
almost always produce in the arc a still more intense radiation of just
those rays which are absorbed, without that expansion of the lines
which shows out the absorption in the case of so many metallic
spectra.     The photographs are, however, conclusive evidence that it is
possible   to secure both conditions.

       F.R.S. Received August 8, 1881.
    Enler has shown* that it is possible to sum the series of reciprocals
of powers of the prime numbers, and he has calculated the values of
these sums for the even powers.               I thought it of some interest to
calculate the sums for the odd powers, and to evaluate a peculiar con
stant (somewhat analogous to the Eulerian constant, —8

 which presents itself, in the series of simple reciprocals of primes, as
 the difference between the sum of the series and the double loga
 rithmic infinity to the Napierian base e.
    The summation of these series was shown by Euler to depend upon
 the Napierian logarithms of the sums of the reciprocals of the powers
 of the natural numbers.    Euler's reason for taking even powers only
 was doubtless    that these latter summations could be expressed in
 terms of Bernoulli's numbers, and of the powers of ir, and could
therefore be computed directly, without any actual summation.        A
table given by Legendre,* and reprinted by De Morgan,f however,
contains the whole series of the sums of the reciprocals of the powers
of the natural numbers, even as well as odd, and I have made use
of this table as the basis of my own work, being satisfied with the
verifications of Legendre.
    The first step was to find the Napierian logarithms of all the
numbers given in Legendre's table.         These were then combined, so
as to give the summations of primes, by means of a theorem of Mobius J
used by Mr. J. W. L. Glaisher,§ in calculating a corrected table of
Euler's values. Instead of giving my own results only,             have                                  I
thought it would be convenient to bring together the complete set ||

 For the multiplication of the progressions brings together once, and
 once only, all the factors which make up each term of the harmonic
 series.   Moreover, this is true, not only of the simple numbers, but of
 »ny powers, so that generally —

    If n has any positive integral value except unity, the second side of
this equation is always finite.     When n=l, it may be transformed (as
is well known) into    —

 This would enable us to obtain the value of IS, if we knew the
series 2.     The theorem of Mobius, mentioned above, enables us to
 effect the reversal of this, and to obtain 2 in terms of IS.                       This
theorem, which is easily established inductively by indeterminate co
efficients, is as follows : let —
               foo =/(*)    + if (J) + i/V) + if(x*) +
then
f(x)=F(x)-i¥(x*)                               +iF(z*)-tF(J)              +1VF(*i°)

the law of the last series being that every term whose index contains
a square factor disappears, the others being positive or negative ac
cordingly    as the index contains an even or odd number of prime
factors.    Thus F(x*), F(»9), F(z9), F(*ls) all take the coefficient
zero, while F(j;6) and F(x10) are positive ; but all the prime terms,
and such terms as Y(xv>), F(a;42), &c, are negative.                        This at once

and by myself in the calculation of 2„.

There appears no reason why it should be commensurable                          with any
simple function of 7. The following results may be useful for the
purpose of this or analogous comparisons : —

tables are     not  continued      to   very high values of n, because, for such

on whether the assumption which       it involves is justifiable, namely —

      Ciliated epithelial cells are found in the thymns of the dog : this is
  not the case in quite young animals, but ciliated epithelium can
  always be demonstrated in the thymus of a dog over thirty months
  old, and often in those of much younger animals.          In the older dogs
  the ciliated cells are found lining cysts, and the cysts appear to
 increase in size with the ago of the animal.         The ciliated epithelial
 cells take origin from connective tissue corpuscles.         The connective
 tissue corpuscles forming the network in the medullary portion are in
 places massed together, forming concentric corpuscles of small size ;
in these masses small cavities are formed, and the lining cells are trans-
 formed into ciliated cells.
     In the thymus of the tortoise small cavities are found lined by
columnar epithelium. The epithelial cells arise from connective tissue
corpuscles, the process being essentially the same as that just described
in the dog.
     The flnid in the lymphatic vessels leading from the thymus can be
obtained      by tying the vessels immediately after death.       The lymph
thus obtained contains considerably more colourless corpuscles than
the lymph of the large lymphatic vessels of the neck.            The blood in
the veins passing from the thymus does not appear to differ from the
blood of the jugular vein.

        in Harvard University.          Communicated by Dr. BKOWN-

                                   (Abstract.)
     The experiments (over 900 in number) were made on the skull and
long bones of sheep, the ribs of oxen, and on the brain and skin of
sheep.      Thermo-electric apparatus was employed in the work.
     The different tissues were thus prepared : — In the case of bone, a fresh
piece was ground smooth on one side, and the face of the thermopile
accurately fitted to it ; then a thin coating of shellac varnish was
applied to the surface of the bone and to the face of the pile, and firm
pressure was maintained until the varnish was dry and permanent

12            Dr.  J. S. Lombard.           On  the  Propagation    of   [Nov. 17,
adhesion between the bone and the pile had taken place.                  The whole
pile, and the bone, to within a couple of millimetres of its free surface,
was then     wrapped in thick layers of cotton wool soaked in melted
paraffine, those layers extending beyond the upper end of the pile and
along the conducting wires for a little distance.            In the cases of brain-
tissue and skin, a pasteboard box was taken and filled with melted
paraffine.    When the latter had solidified, a hole was cut through the
centre of the paraffine of the size of the piece of brain or skin, and
the   pasteboard    bottom corresponding to the hole removed, and its
place  supplied    by a thin copper plate.         The piece of tissue was then
inserted in the hole in the paraffine, until it rested on the copper
plate ; the pile was then passed into the hole and pressed firmly upon
the piece of brain or skin, being kept in place by wedges of cotton
wool thrust between the sides of the pile and the paraffine walls sur
rounding it.
    The free end of the bone, or the copper plate of the box,* was
brought in contact with water of the desired temperature, this tem
perature being tested by both thermo-electric apparatus and thermo
meters.
    The differences of temperature to which the tissues were subjected
ranged from 0°81136 C. to 0°-1645 C.
    We have to consider, first, the time required for the first sign of the
change of temperature to show itself through the pieces of bone, brain,
and skin. The following figures show the times required for 0°'l C.
to show itself through 7'5 millims. of sheep's skull, 7'5 millims. of
upper surface of sheep's cerebrum, and 3 millims. of sheep's scalp
respectively.

   We have next to consider the degree of change of temperature pro
duced    by conduction, at certain measured           intervals of time, through
the same thicknesses       of tissues     as above, and    calculated for 08l° C.,
with    the   galvanometer showing,          as   before, 0°'0006742       C.     The
averages alone are given.
   * It was found, by many experiments, that the presence of the copper plate could
be disregarded.   The same is true of the dura mator in the case of brain-tissue.

   It will   be seen that at the above periods the bone is the best con
ductor, the brain coming next, and the skin last, although the latter
is 2'5 times thinner than the two former.
   We have, in the third place, to see what is the transmission of heat
through the three tissues, when the permanent thermal condition is
reached. The following figures show the amounts of this transmission
at the period in question.

Here again the bone shows the highest, and the skin the lowest, con
ductivity.
    Suppose, now, that we have a change of temperature of 0°'l C. at
the surface of the brain of a sheep. As a matter of simple conduction,
what would be the change of temperature at the outer surface, after
the passage through the thicknesses of skull and scalp given ? We
will give the averages for two minutes and for the permanent thermal
state only.

    Lastly, we will calculate what effect a change of temperature of
 0°'l C., at one point of the cerebral surface, would have on a point of
 the outer surface       of the scalp situated over another point of brain

                                         (Abstract.)
I    have endeavoured in this abstract to summarise the results of my
recent researches into the minute structure of the brain in the smaller
Rodents.    The pig and sheep, which were the subjects of my former
memoir, possess a highly developed olfactory apparatus conjoined to
a well convoluted cortical surface    but in the smaller animals now
                                             ;
under consideration the surface of the hemispheres          almost per    is
fectly smooth, while the olfactory organ, from its comparative size
and complex relationship, has an important part to play in the archi
tecture of the brain.
   Animals possessing the latter type of cerebrum have been classed
together as the Osmatic Lissencephales, in contradistinction to those
which were the subject of my former enquiries, the Osmatic Gyren-
eephales.   My researches into the structure of the brain of prominent
members of the former group, viz., the rabbit and rat, may be con
sidered under two heads —       :

                                                                  [Nov. 17,
    (6.) The central projections of the olfactory organ.
    The cortex of the cerebrum of the rabbit and rat is naturally divi
sible into two distinct segments, which (to follow the nomenclature
advocated by Broca) may be termed the great limbic lobe and extra-
limbic mass or parietal segment.       The great limbic lobe is further
divisible into —
    (a.) An upper limbic arc (gyrus fornicatus).
    (6.) A lower limbic are (gyrus hippocampi).
    (c.) An anterior limbic arc (olfactory lobe).
   Minnte examinations of these regions reveal the presence of eight
diverse types of cortex, which are distinguished from each other by the
number or kind of the constituent layers.       Meynert enumerates only
five types as distinguishable in the cortex of human brain ; and since
his Sylvian type differs in degree rather than in kind, and should
be therefore eliminated, we find in the small brain of the Rodent
where frontal, temporal, and occipital lobes are absent, a greater variety
of cortical constitution than what Meynert assigns to man. Meynert's
enumeration, however, falls far short of the truth, since all the types
found in the hemispheres of these lower animals prevail also in human
brain, which therefore would embrace, at the very least, ten distinct
types of cortical lamination.
   The eight formations occurring in the rabbit and rat are as
follows : —
   1. Type of upper limbic arc.
   2. Modified upper limbic type.
   3. Outer olfactory type.
   4. Inner olfactory type.
   5. Modified lower limbic type.
   6. Extra-limbic type.
   7. Type of cornu ammonis.
   8. Type of olfactory bulb.
   The first six may be best summarised by noting the area covered by
each, and the special feature bestowing upon each its typical character.
   1. Type of Upper Limbic Arc. — Area.       This cortex covers the whole
anterior two-thirds of the upper limbic arc, reaching from frontal pole
to near the posterior border of the corpus callosum.       In front of the
corpus   callosum it  spreads outwards  over the exposed  vertex,  spanning
the frontal end of the hemisphere here. — Type. A four laminated
cortex, as follows: — 1. A peripheral cortical zone. 2. Layer of small
pyramidal cells.     3. Ganglionic cell layer.   4. Layer of spindle cells.
The angular cells forming      the second  layer in human brain are here
absent.    The ganglionic formation is clearly identified with that of
higher animals.       Like the latter, they are arranged in clustered
groups or solitary file, and are subject to the interposition betwixt
them and the small pyramids of a layer of angular or granule cells in

  1881.]      Comparative Structure     of  the Brain in Rodents.             1 7
 certain regions.     These cells are largest and most richly grouped
 along the upper limbic arc and the sagittal border, the layer here
 attaining a depth equal to that of the similar formation in the pig.
 These confluent groups are so rich in cells as to exhibit from eighty to
 one hundred in the quarter-inch field of the microscope, whilst the
 solitary arrangement will not show more than six or eight such cells
 in the same area.      These cells are of elongate pyramidal form, the
 largest measuring 32/* x 18/t, but they maintain great uniformity             in
 size.
    2. Modified  Upper Limbic Type. — Area.        Commencing near the pos
terior border    of the  callosal commissure,    this  cortex spreads over the
median aspect of the hemisphere as far as the occipital pole and the
junction betwixt upper and lower limbic arcs, and also outwards over
the exposed aspect of the hemisphere, ending abruptly at the primary
parietal sulcus. — Type.       It is four-laminated, the small pyramidal
cells of the former type gradually thinning off and disappearing
ultimately to be replaced by a deep belt of granule cells disposed in
horizontal layers separated by alternate bands of arcuate medulla.
    3. Outer Olfactory Type. — Area.        Spreads over the anterior limbic
arc betwixt the limbic sulcus       and  the superficial olfactory fasciculus.
Thence it covers the whole of the gyrus hippocampi, except a limited
area at the occipital end of the lower limbic arc. — Type.              This is a
three- laminated cortex, possessing only two layers of nerve-cells.             It
is constituted of   — 1. A peripheral cortical zone.       2. A belt of densely
compressed irregular       small  pyramidal     cells.   3.   A layer of large
pyramids.
    4.  Inner Olfactory Type. — Area. This cortex covers the " olfactory
field
       " of Gratiolet, i.e., the anterior perforated               It is limited
                                                            space.
externally by     the  "outer   root"   of  the olfactory lobe, and extends
inwards to the median aspect of the hemisphere. — Type. A three-
laminated cortex, consisting of— 1. A peripheral cortical zone. 2. A
peculiar wavy layer of granule cells.         3. Large spindle cells, with an
arcuate    medulla apparently connected with the claustral formation
externally.     The spindle cells attain unusual magnitude.
    5. Modified Lower Limbic Type. — Area. Covers the extreme terminal
portion of the limbic arc, and is bounded externally by the limbic sulcus
and internally by the vanishing granule formation of the upper limbic
cortex. — Type.      A five-laminated cortex especially distinguished by
its second layer of nerve-cells which are remarkably large, swollen,
and irregular, and in fact the largest elements in the whole hemi
sphere.     They strongly suggest in their form and branching an un-
usnally rich development of the angular cell of the second layer in
human brain, the elements of which, if greatly increased in size,
would closely resemble these cells. This cortex also includes two
notable arcuate bands of medulla.

   6. Extra-Umbic Type. — Area. This cortex covers the whole of the
extra-limbic or parietal mass, except that portion already referred to
as possessing the upper and modified limbic types. — Type.            It is
                                 —
distinctly five laminated, viz. : 1. A peripheral zone ; 2. Layer of
small pyramids ; 3. Belt of granule cells ; 4. Ganglionic cells ;
5. Spindle cells.     It differs from the upper limbic type in the
possession of a belt of granule cells, and in the peculiar disposition of
its ganglionic cells which lose the clustered and assume a solitary
arrangement.
   The ganglionic cells become more and more numerous and thickly
grouped towards the frontal pole, diminishing in numbers rapidly
backwards, the granule cells being a more notable feature towards
the occipital pole.
   Significance of Sulci and Fissures. — In my former memoir I stated
that certain sulci and fissures accurately mapped out structurally
differentiated realms of the cortex.      My further examination of the
brain of the rat and rabbit enables me to state that at least seven sulci
and fissures may now be accepted as the undoubted boundaries of
adjacent realms which wholly differ from each other in structure.    These
are as follows : —
   1. The limbic fissure.
   2. The infra-parietal sulcus.
   3. The primary parietal sulcus.
   4. The inter-parietal sulcus.
   5. The crucial sulcus.
   G. The olfactory sulcus.
   7. Fissure of Rolando.
   Distribution of Ganglionic Formation. — The cortex, which is specially
characterised by a rich deep belt of ganglionic cells in close confluent
groups, spreads over that portion of the upper limbic arc immediately
in front of the corpus callosum.     Still richer in constituent elements,
towards the marginal or sagittal border ot the hemisphere it covers
the exposed aspect here, being well developed over the three areas
mapped out by Ferrier as the centres for the movements of the mouth
and jaws (7) ; of the tongue (9) ; and of the shoulder and
foreleg (5).
   Along the sagittal border of the hemisphere at the vertex these
rich cell groupings tend to spread backwards, but thin ont rapidly as
they approach the granule formation internal to the primary parietal
sulcus.
   The same tendency to extension of these ganglionic groups back
wards is also seen along the Sylvian border of the hemisphere, i.e.,
along the limbic sulcus.
   I have therefore termed these groupings the Sagittal and Sylvian
groups of the ganglionic formation.

  1881.]     Comparative Structure       of the Brain in Rodents.         19
    In my former memoir       I  particularised the same features as notice
 able in the brain of the sheep and pig, viz., the existence of an
 extensive area of the five-laminated rich ganglionic cortex in the
 anterior regions of the hemisphere with two projecting arms of a
 similar formation extending backwards.           These latter — the Sagittal
 and Sylvian groups — embrace betwixt them an intermediate region
 of the parietal lobe characterised          by a six-laminated cortex with
 solitary arrangement     of the  ganglionic cells which are few and poorly
 developed.

    Central Projections   of Olfactory Medulla. The medullary connexions
 between the olfactory bulb and lobe and the cortex of the rest of the
 cerebrum consist of the following series : —
    1. A central decussating and commissural fasciculus.
   2. Medullated connexion with striate body.
   3. Arciform medulla to limbic lobe and occipital pole.
   4. Superficial olfactory fasciculus, the so-called " outer olfactory
root."
    1. Central Olfactory Fasciculus. — Of the various medullated         con
nexions of the olfactory organ this exhibits the most interesting and
novel features.       After passing back from the olfactory bulb to its
decussation     in   the anterior commissure,       its posterior projections
traverse the substance of the corpus striatum, and in this course its
strands are widely separated by the passage through them of numerous
fasciculi of medullated fibres which, arising behind run forwards,
some blending with the other fibres of the olfactory fasciculus, but
most traversing its structure at right angles so as to emerge in front
of it as a delicate fibrous dissepiment betwixt the corpus striatum
proper and that portion lying in the olfactory area. The posterior
projection of the ceutral fasciculus upon reaching the outer boundary
of the striate body takes a different course in the rat and the rabbit.
In the former it divides here into numerous secondary branches which
are directed backwards towards the occipital pole of the hemi
sphere to be distributed to the cortex described here as of the modified
lower limbic type.      A limited number of fibres pass outside the striate
body.     In the   rabbit,'on  the other hand, this fasciculus turns upwards
upon the outer surface of the corpus striatum, and reaching the upper
pole of this ganglion suddenly divides into a brush-like head of fibres,
which decussating and interweaving with the callosal and projection
systems here eventually terminate in the cortex of the vertex at its
marginal angle (along the great longitudinal fissure).
   2. Connexions with Striate Body. — Medullated bundles pass from
the medulla of the olfactory lobe and the granule layer of the bulb
backwards into the basal portion of the caudate nucleus separated
from each other in this region by oblong grey masses which enclose
nerve-corpuscles.       The nuclear masses are traversed throughout by
                                                                  c 2

the fine non-fasciculated nerve fibrils which originate       in the granule
 layers of the bulb.    A small medullated band for this olfactory area
 is also derived from the inner margin of the superficial olfactory
fasciculus.    An important connexion is established with the motor
 columns of the cord by fibres passing through this region.              This
 double connexion of the olfactory organ with the cord and cerebrum
 is the more frequent occurrence in Mammalia.          In this olfactory area
 is an extensive system of arciform medulla, which runs parallel with
 the cortex at the base destined to reach the under aspect of the
callosal commissnre through the structure of the septum lucidum.
    3. Arciform Medulla. — The more important fasciculi, after piercing
 the callosal commissure, run as a longitudinal band upon the upper
 surface of that commi ./»ure, just before the latter spreads outwards
 to the cortex of the vertex.     Its destination is to the formation of the
 modified upper  limbic type, internal  to the primary parietal sulcus.
    At the occipital extremity of the hemisphere, therefore, there are
 two important regions characterised as follows : —
    a. Modified upper limbic coitex containing a deep belt of granule         .
cells ; two well-defined intracortical arciform stripes connected with
the cornu ammonis, and the terminal expansions              of the olfactory
arcuate system.
    6. Modified lower limbic type presenting the large inflated cell-forma
tion ; two similarly connected arcuate stripes ; and lastly the terminal
expansion (in the rat) of the central olfactory fasciculus after its
decussation in the anterior commissure.
    4. Superficial Olfactory   Fasciculus. — Otherwise termed the outer
olfactory root, becomes rapidly attenuated by the termination of its
fibres all along its course in the cortex of the anterior and inferior
limbic arcs. It has also been stated above that a large fasciculus from
its inner margin is distributed to the deep olfactory medulla.
    5. Tarnia Semicircularis. — This arciform band, arising in the cortex
of the gyrus hippocampi, and closely following the curved inner
surface of the caudate nucleus, is stated by many authorities to
terminate in the descending pillar of the fornix.          This fact  I have
been unable to confirm as regards the rabbit ahd rat, but there are
certainly two clearly defined fasciculi which descend from the taenia
semicircularis, one to arch round into the anterior commissure, pro
bably decussating here ; the other or deeper set of fibres enters the
olfactory area. Hence this arcuate band brings the cortex of the
gyrus fornicatus into relationship with the olfactory area of its own
side and into crossed relationship with the olfactory bulbs, unless the
fibres of the taenia entering the anterior commissure are purely com
missural in their character.
    The Corpus Striatum and Us Cortical Connexions. — The following
conclusions have been arrived at after a careful study of micro

  scopic   sections, and teasing   and dissection of the brain.      The true
  striate  ganglion   is mapped    off  from   the  olfactory  area and  deep
  medulla by the peculiar formation which         I have termed from its con
  figuration the olfactory lyre.     In front of the thalamus opticus the
  coronal connexions betwixt the striate ganglion, capsule, and cerebral
  cortex arise, par excellence,       from that marginal aspect of the
  hemisphere at the vertex, which has been stated to be characterised
  by an extremely rich ganglionic formation
                                                  — a region entering largely
 into the composition of Ferrier's motor realm.         As the motor ganglia,
 however, retire outwards before the intervening thalami, their coronal
 connexions arise chiefly from the upper and outer aspect of the hemi
 sphere, and still further back from the occipital cortex at their own
 level.    Lastly, the median cortex of the upper limbic arc has through
 out its course no connexion whatever with the striate ganglion or
 internal capsule.

    An iron or steel wire subjected to longitudinal magnetisation by a
surrounding solenoid gave when twisted a current along itself, which
was observed by means of a ballistic mirror galvanometer in circuit
with the wire.       When the twist was that of a common screw the
transient current flowed along the wire from the nominal N. to the
nominal S. end.          An opposite twist gave an oppositely directed
current.
    Reversal of the longitudinal magnetisation of the wire, when it was
held twisted, gave a strong transient current, but mere interruption
or reapplication of the magnetising current gave effects so relatively
feeble as not to admit of measurement by the same appliances.           When
there was no torsion on the wire, reversal of the magnetising force
gave no current.       The first application of the magnetising force after
the wire was twisted gave a current.
    A permanently magnetised wire gave when twisted a transient
current of the same sign as that described above (from N. to S. if the
twist was that of a common screw).

22        On Production     of Transient Electric Currents.         [Nov. 17.
   The transient currents produced by twisting a magnetised wire had
been noticed by Matteucci as early as 1858 (Wiedemann's " Galva-
nifimus,"  ii, 484), but the signs of the effects as observed by him
               §
were opposite to those observed by the author, and he did not observe
any current when a twisted wire was magnetised. These discrepancies,
as   well as the evident connexion between the effects under considera
 tion and the remarkable experiments recently described by Professor
  Hughes  ("  Proc. Roy. Soc.," vol. 31, p. 525), led the author to examine
  the subject at length.    The results are described fully in the paper.
    The statement of the numerical effects, which are at first sight very
  involved,  is mnch facilitated by the conception that the combined
 effect of torsion and longitudinal magnetisation    is  to produce a state,
 provisionally called
                        " polarisation," in the wire, which persists almost
  unchanged when the magnetising force      is  removed.    This polarisation
is   measured by the transient currents which accompany its produc
 tion.   The normal polarisation for a given angle of twist and a given
 magnetising force is measured by half the ballistic deflection due to
 the transient current which appeared in the wire when the magnetising
 force was reversed at that angle of twist. In this way, curves con
 necting normal polarisation with angle of twist (within the elastic
 limit) are given for iron and steel.          When the wire, after being
 normally polarised at +6°,     is   twisted over to —0", the polarisation
 does not change to the full normal value for — 0", but to something less,
 and this difference becomes still more apparent after several twistings
 from one side to the other.       By dividing the full twist across into
 several steps, cyclical curves have been obtained, showing the relation
 of polarisation to torsion when the same magnetising force          kept up
                                                                    is
 without interruption or reversal.        These curves exhibit, in a striking
 manner, a   persistence of previous state, such as might be caused by
 molecular friction.      The curves for the back and forth twists are
 irreversible, and include a wide area between them.          The change of
 polarisation lags behind the change of torsion.       To this action, which
is  like that formerly described by the author as characteristic of the

from vaveptu, to be behind). The modifying influence of "hysteresis "
in the whole action    is  minutely described, and   it   isshown that the
effects of hysteresis may be wiped out by subjecting the wire to
mechanical vibration, and still more effectually by changing its mag
netisation, which may bo done either by breaking and re-making the
magnetising current in the solenoid, or by reversing it.

             is

 netising force when that force is about 15 c.g.s. units.     It is probable
 that by increasing the magnetising force sufficiently the signs of the
 effects would be reversed.
     When torsion is carried beyond the elastic limit the effects become
 somewhat diminished, and when a permanent twist has been given,
 and the wire allowed to come back to its new zero of stress, reversals
 of the magnetising force then give feeble transient currents whose
 signs are opposite to those of the currents given when the wire is still
 under torsion.
     In steel the general effect is less than in iron, but steel exhibits
 hysteresis more strongly.       With copper, silver, brass, german-silver,
and platinum,     no  effects whatever could be observed.      In all proba
bility the effects are peculiar to the strongly magnetic metals.
    Having described the experimental results, the author proceeds to
 point out their relation to the discoveries of Thomson, Villari, Wiede
 mann, and Hughes, and attempts to explain the production of transient
eurrents by the setting up of a state of circular magnetisation in the
wire.     Sir W. Thomson's discovery that aelotropic stress developes an
aelotropic difference of magnetic susceptibility in iron may be used to
account for circular magnetisation by the combined effects of longi
tudinal magnetisation and torsion. In order that the effects should
have the signs which they actually had, this explanation would require
that the magnetising force must have been, in all cases, below the
Villari critical value at which the effects of push and pull on magneti
sation are reversed.      It is shown that this may possibly have been the
case, and that the same assumption would explain away some of the
contradictions between the author's results and the earlier ones of
Matteucci.
   The paper concludes with some general considerations regarding
the phenomenon to which the name

VIII. "The        Prehensores of Male Butterflies of the Genera
       Ornithoptera and Papilio." By PHILIP HENKY GOSSE, F.R.S.
       Received October 12, 1881.
                                  (Abstract.)
   Anatomists have long ago recognised, in insects, the existence of
certain organs, intimately connected with the function of generation,
yet perfectly distinct from the organs which perform the proper
generative act.    They are found only in the male sex ; and are con
sidered to have, as their sole use, the office of seizing and holding the
female, during the act of coition.
    In the detailed examination and comparison of these auxiliary

  24           Mr. P. H. Gosse.      The Prehensores   of Male      [Nov. 17,
  organs, in the Lepidoptera, little seems to have been yet done, except
  the memoir of Dr. F. Bnchanan White, " On the Male Genital Arma
  ture in the European Rhopalocera," published in the " Trans. of the
  Linn. Soc." for December 21, 1876. His investigations prove that
  the variety which marks these organs — in form, position, and curious
  armature — is almost endless ; and they have opened a quite new field
 of study in Comparative Entomology,          eminently worthy of being
 further cultivated.
     The researches of Dr. White were limited to European forms.          The
 fine butterflies of the vast genus Papilio, being trans- European almost
 exclusively, are scarcely touched by him ; and, for obvious reasons,
 these have been little submitted to destructive dissection and exhaus
 tive examination.
    The prehensile auxiliaries to generation, in the restricted genus
 Papilio (including Ornithoptera), I have been for some time examin
 ing ; and I find the variety and singularity of the contrivances dis
 played therein certainly not less conspicuous than Dr. White's researches
 would lead us to expect.       The results are emobdied in the present
 memoir, which comprises detailed descriptions of the male prehensile
 apparatus in sixty-nine species (viz., Ornithoptera, 11 ; Papilio, 58) ;
illustrated by 196 drawings (viz., Orn. 29 ; Pap. 167) of the parts,
magnified.
    The organs which constitute the special       subjects   of examination
are five in number, viz. : —
                      1. The  Valve.
                      2. The  Harpe.
                      3. The  Uncus.
                      4. The  Scaphium.
                      5. The  Penis.
    1. The Valve. — Every    entomologist knows that the male sex of a
swallowtail butterfly is distinguished by its abdomen terminating in
two broad ovate plates, called the anal valves, articulated to the
eighth segment ; convex outwardly, concave inwardly ; whose edges
are in mutual contact during rest, inclosing and concealing an ample
cavity.
    2. The Marpe. — If we remove one of the valves, and examine its
 concave inner side, we find a peculiar appendage, to which I give the
name of Harpe (aprnf), lodged within the hollow.         It takes an infinite
variety of forms, being never (so far as I have observed) the same in
two species, however nearly they may be affined.        It is, in general, a
weapon of hard, horny chitine, usually glittering like glass, articulated
in part to the base of the inclosing valve, in part to a projecting knob
of chitine within the bottom of the eighth segment.           It lies in the
valve-cavity,   to whose lining membrane it is affixed, to a certain extent ;

   1881.]       Butterflies   of the   Genera   Ornithoptera and Papilio.             25
   bat its distal       moiety is free, projected, and antagonised to that of its
   opposite    fellow.
     It is in this free portion that the wondrous variety mainly resides ;
  and the equally wondrous perfection of elaborate                       armature.     It
  simulates,       with cnrious precision, our knives, swords, sickles, axes,
  saws,  and pikes, straight, angled, or curved            ; now furnished with one
  or more acute needle-points,            now bearing a keen cutting edge, now
  cat into spinous teeth, now with each tooth notched into secondary
  minuter teeth ; sometimes it is a broad disk, beset with conical
  prickles, sometimes a long elastic wire ; besides many other forms,
  simple and compound,             for which our human implements afford no
  comparisons.
     That the proper specific office of these elaborate contrivances is the
 prehension of the female during the copulative act, is not left to bo
 conjectured       ;  for thev often carry documentary evidence that they have
 been    so employed.          Very often, when a valve is exposed, the arma
 ture is quite invisible, becanse the cavity is wholly filled with a brown
 deposit, caked into a solid mass.              This, when put on a slip of glass
 with a drop of water, under the microscope, is presently resolved into
 a multitude of body              clothing-scales, clogged together with dried
 remains of what had been the anal fluid (meconium) of some female
 butterfly ; that brown fluid which is always discharged soon after
evolution from pupa.             In such a case, conjunction had been effected
with a female just evolved ; the serrate harpe-claws of the male had
scraped off a crowd of scales in the efforts to obtain prehension ;
while the excitement had caused the female to discharge the meco
nium at the same moment.                     And here remained the stereotyped
record    !
    3. The Uncus.        — The dorsal arch of the eighth abdominal segment
terminates, generally, in a slender spine of polished, elastic chitine,
which, continuing the medial line, projects backward, and arches down,
so as to form a (more or less) semicircular hook.                     To this I appro
priate the term Uncus.            Its  office seems    to be to  secure a vertical grasp
of the female organs, which are simultaneously grasped, laterally, by
the right and left harpes.                 But the shape, direction, curvature,
texture, and adjuncts of this organ vary exceedingly ; and sometimes
it is altogether lacking.
    4. The Scaphium. — This is an organ to which                  I have not been able
to find distinct allusion in any author.                   In the other families of
Rhopalocera,         it  seems  altogether wanting.*         Yet, in the Papilionidce
proper,     it is generally large, conspicuous, and complicate.                   If we
remove       the valve of Ornithoptera Haliphron, or Papilio Panynwn, the
    • Save    in the Pie2da.      In the South     American Gonepteryges, Clorinde, and
Leachiana,      it  is well formed, but minute   :  in the Oriental Hebomoia Qlaurippe,
moderately      large, but peculiar : it becomes evanescent in Teriat.

eye is arrested    at once by a great mass of firm flesh, white like
polished ivory, projecting from the abdomen immediately under the
uncus : this is the organ which, from a prevailing resemblance in shape
to a boat, I call Scaphium.      Of its function I remain ignorant : yet,
since, in some species,  it  is most elaborately and formidably armed —
as in P. Macedon, Mayo, Thoas, and, most of all, Merope — with teeth,
and spines, and saws, I conclude that it must serve for prehension ;
                           " How ? " is
though the question,                      very difficult to answer ; and
though it very probably has other offices.
   There is a manifest organic connexion between the scaphium and
the uncus ; like that organ it is occasionally wanting ; but sometimes
the uncus is present when the scaphium is absent, and sometimes
the case is reversed.
     5. ThePenis. — This organ should strictly form no part of my
subject, which is not the function of generation, nor the organs that
perform       it,
             but certain prehensile apparatus that are ancillary to the
performance.     The penis     a principal, not an auxiliary
                                 is                             yet, as
                                                                      ;        it  is
essentially the centre, around which the whole armature waits and
serves, and as      forms so conspicuous an object in the grouping of
                        it
the whole,    could scarcely avoid representing
               I                                       in the drawings, or
                                                         it
giving  some  account,  at least of its varying form and  position.
   Some curious phenomena, moreover, have occurred in the organ,
which seemed to me worthy of being detailed and figured. Particu
larly the occasional development of a white pulpy tissue filling the
chitinous tube, and evidently very distinct from             and, in some
                                                              it  ;
instances, the extrusion of this tissue from the orifice, as a columnar
or globular mass, which bears curious evidences of its having been
forcibly extruded, in      condition at least semi-solid, and by succes
                             a
sive spasms.
   In some species, as the Oriental        P. Coon and its allies, this organ       is
excessively attenuated, and as excessively lengthened, so as protrude
far beyond the limits of the valves, when these are normally closed                 ;
and so as to be quite apparent in the cabinet, like a projecting fine wire,
with which one may readily take up and handle the specimen, as if                  it
were an inserted pin.
  All of these organs may be studied together, and with unusual
facility, in Ornithoptera Phadamanthus and in Papilio Merope; Plates
I   andIV of this memoir.
   As the harpe appears to be the leading organ in the prehensile
apparatus, the most fully elaborated and the most varied,          have    I
employed   its  variations  of  form  to  cast into groups  the  species
treated.  This grouping        not proposed, in any sense, as
                                  is                            natural   a
arrangement but as  ;    help to reference, and as

son of the varying conditions of the organ.
   One of the results, not the least curious, of this grouping,      the      is

 wide   separation    of    species  apparently very closely allied.     Thus
 Ornith. Haliphron and 0. Amphrysiis, Cram., are radically different in
 the forms of their respective harpes.          P. Demoleus and P. Erithonius,
 so very consimilar in the shape, colours, and patterns of their wings,
 are quite unlike in their harpes. P. Bromins, P. Nireus, and P. Phorcan
 have the harpe of a quite different type and plan in each !           On the
 other hand, P. Machaon and P. Arcturus are consimilar in armature ;
 while P. Agavtis and P. Elector are as wide as the poles apart !
    It must not be forgotten that the armature of not more than a sixth
 part of the 400 and upward described Papiliones is here represented.
 A further prosecution of the inquiry will certainly bridge-over many
gaps, and supply other characteristic forms.
IX.     "On    the   Propagation of Inhibitory Excitation in the
       Medulla Oblongata."            By Dr. H. Kronecker and Mr. S.
       Meltzer, Candidate in Medicine, Berlin.                 Communicated
       by Dr. Burdon Sanderson, F.R.S. Received October 18,
       1881.
   In the Royal Academy of Science of Berlin, on the 24th January,
1881, a  communication from us, " On the Mechanism of Deglutition
and its Inhibitory Nerves," was read by Professor E. du Bois-
Reymond.       The experiments described were performed by means of
a slightly inflated caoutchouc         ball, fastened to the blind end of an
oesophageal    tube, the other end of which was connected with a
Marey's    tambour,      whose lever recorded         the movements    on the
blackened surface of a rotating cylinder.            The ball was introduced,
for varying      distances,    into   the oesophagus, and the movements
recorded resulting from the swallowing of small quantities of fluid.
   It has previously been shown (Falk and Kronecker) that, in man
and in the dog, the act of deglutition proper is accomplished           by the
quick contraction of the striated muscles, and that the draught reaches
the stomach even before the oesophageal contraction can make itself
effective.   In one of our former investigations, Mr. Meltzer, by ex
periments performed on himself, showed that a mouthful of water
reaches the stomach in less than O'l second after being swallowed, but
that the peristaltic action does not appear in the uppermost part of
the (esophagus sooner than about 1*0 second after the beginning of
the act of deglutition, and does not reach the stomach till 5 — 6 seconds
later. In the communication mentioned above, the results of still
more recent investigations were given.              It was found that in the
uppermost portion        of  the  oesophagus    of man,  extending about 6 — 8

28                 Dr. H. Kronecker and Mr. S. Meltzer.                      [Nov. 17,
centims. from the lower border of the pharynx, the contraction lasted
2 — 3 seconds, and in the deep portion, about 12 centims. in extent
from the cardia, 8 — 9 seconds, and that the transition from the region
of shorter to that of longer contraction occurred in a short portion,
about 4 centims. long, about the level of the manubrium sterni.        It is
a physiological characteristic of this region that in it the transition
from the striated to the smooth muscles occurs (E. Weber).
   In determining the period of latent stimulation for the purpose of
measuring the speed of propagation of the peristaltic waves, it was
found that the period increased not gradually but by bounds.         Thus,
in the upper portion of the oesophagus, 8 centims. long, measuring
from the beginning, the period of latent stimulation amounts to from
1 to l o seconds ; in the following portion, 8 centims. long, from 3 to
3'5 seconds, and in the undermost portion, from about 5"5 to 7
seconds.    From these researches it appeared highly probable that the
reflex ganglia of deglutition are arranged in three groups connected
with one another.      But the experiments seemed also to show that
there must be a fonrth group, placed near to the other three, through
which the first reflex of the act of swallowing occurs.       This upper
most group is more closely related with the lower three than these
with one another, since we have found that the three regions of the
oesophagus can contract, from above downwards in orderly sequence,
 without a first act of swallowing having occurred.       This happens in
 consequence of
                  " eructation," which effects a separate irritation on
 the three lower ganglion groups of deglutition.
   When one makes a series of acts of swallowing quickly one after
the other, as in drinking a glass of water, the registering ball shows
that one oesophageal contraction follows, and that only after the last of
the series; and its occurrence is timed, in reference to the last draught,
as if it had been produced by a single act of swallowing.      It therefore
appeared : —
   I. That the beginning of every                act    of swallowing  not only excites
the assopliageal contraction related        to    it,   but, at the tame time, restrains
the contraction,    excited     shortly before,        but   has not yet occurred.
                                                             which
This inhibition    is   capable   of   preventing the contraction even immediately
prior     to its
            appearance.
   It    therefore to be concluded that the restraining
          is                                                                 excitation,
traversing the direct motor tracts, outruns the motor                        excitation,
advancing through the ganglion groups.
     If
      a second act of swallowing occurs when the oesophageal con
traction, following the first, has already begun, this contraction can no
longer be restrained.       In such a case, however, the contraction
corresponding to the second act begins as late as         this second act
                                                                        if
had not been performed till after the completion of the first contrac
tion.   In other words —    :

  1881.]      On Inhibitory Excitation in       the  Medulla Oblongata.             29
     II. The second     motor irritation    is effective only when the contraction
following    the first has passed.
     The anatomical     tracts, along which this inhibition is conducted, we
 have found to be the       ramifications of the ninth pair of cranial nerves,
 the   Nn. Glossopharyngei.
    III.   If  the trunk of the glossopharyngeus is irritated, no movement of
 deglutition results, in spite of the strongest excitation to deglutition, pro
 duced by filling of the pharynx with fluid, or by stimulation of the Nn.
 laryngei superiores.        Both the first reflex act of swallowing and the
 oesophageal    contraction   are for thn time in abeyance.
    IV.   If  the pharyngeal branches only are irritated, then the inhibitory
phenomenon        appears   in  the  cervical  or -in   the  thoracic portion   of  the
oesophagus.
    The pharyngeal         branches of the N. Glossopharyngeus are not un-
frequently       distributed in company with the pharyngeal branches of
the N. vagus, so that as a complete anatomical separation of the ninth
and tenth nerve pairs cannot be effected ; neither can a physiological.
   V.    If  the N. glossopharyngeus be cut through, the oesophagus falls into
tonic spasm, which may last longer than one day.
    It was in continuation of          these researches, that the following new
and    noteworthy observations        were made.
   The excitations, which reach their centre in the medulla oblongata
through the N. glossopharyngeus, exert an inhibitory influence, not
only on the origins of those vagus fibres which supply the oesophagus,
but also on the ends of the vagus fibres which excite the movements
of respiration and restrain those of the heart.                Lastly, the inhibitory
influences extend also to the centre in the medulla regulating the
blood- vessels.       This can be shown in normal living man. One can,
by swallowing, easily observe the following : —
   I. During       each act  of swallowing the pulse frequency increases.
    II. During      a series of acts the need of respiration decreases.
    III.  During each act of swallowing the blood pressure falls                in   the
aortic system.
    This    remarkable       proposition, therefore       follows  : that  excitations,
which     are conveyed to the centre along the tracts of the inhibitory nerves,
extend in the character of inhibitions to neighbouring centres.
    Continued researches on the operation of these newly discovered
inhibitory nerves promise specially interesting disclosures, for this
reason, that they can be set into activity through normal excitations,
voluntarily produced, while the observations on the working of the
 N. vagus, the chief representative of the inhibitory nerves, can be
 performed only by means of artificial irritation, whose correspondence
 with natural irritation has by no means been admitted by all.

       of a Uniaxal Crystal." By R. T. Glazebrook, M.A., Fellow
       and Assistant Lecturer of Trinity College, Demonstrator in
       the Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge.               Communicated by

                                    (Abstract.)
    The paper, of which the following is an abstract, contains an
experimental     investigation of the relation between the plane of
polarisation of light falling on the surface of a crystal of Iceland spar
and the angles of incidence and refraction in the cases in which only
one refracted wave traverses the crystal. A prism was cut from a
piece of spar, one face of the prism coinciding almost exactly with a
rhombic face, and plane polarised light allowed to fall on it at a known
angle of incidence.      The deviation of light of a definite wave-length
in both the ordinary and extraordinary spectrum is observed, and from
that and the angle of incidence 0 we can calculate 0' and 0", the
two angles of refraction.       The polariser being then turn2d until the
ray in question disappears from the extraordinary spectrum its
position is noted. A known small rotation is then given to the plane
of polarisation of the incident light either by turning the polariser
through a known angle, or introducing into the path of the light a
 cell containing a solution of sugar. This causes the reappearance of
 the ray in question in the extraordinary spectrum, and the spar prism
 is then moved, thus varying the angle of incidence until it again dis
 appears.     The angle of incidence and the deviation of the same ray in
 the ordinary spectrum being measured, we get a second pair of values
 of 0 and 0' under the condition that the ordinary ray only traverses
 the crystal.    Now if /3 be the angle which the optic axis makes with
 the edge of the prism, X the angle between the face of incidence and
 a plane through the optic axis and the edge of the prism, and 0 the
 iingle between the direction of vibration of the incident light and this
 same edge, it follows, either from the electro-magnetic theory of light
  (Lorentz,

  1835), MacCullagh ("Trans. Roy. Irish Acad." 1839), and Kirchhoff
  ("Abhand. Akad. Berlin," 1876), that if the ordinary ray only
 traverses the crystal —

 We are thus able to obtain a series of theoretical values of 0. The
 difference between two consecutive values should, if the theory be
 true, give us the angle through which the plane of polarisation has

 been turned.     There is some difficulty in determining with certainty
 the angle between     the edge of the prism, from which 0 is measured,
 and the principal plane of the polarising prism in any given position.
 We, therefore, cannot compare a series of observed and calculated
 values of 6 with accuracy ; we can, however, compare the differences
 between consecutive values of 0 given by theory with those differences
 as produced by the known rotation of the polarising Nicol, or that
 due to the  sugar cell.
    Similar observations were made for the case in which only the
 extraordinary ray traverses the crystal ; in this case, if a and b be the
 principal refractive indices, we have, according to the same theories, —

    Two series of observations are recorded in the paper, the one made
in November,      1880, the other with new and improved apparatus in
August, 1881.
    The two series lead to practically identical results. Taking first
the case in which the ordinary wave only is transmitted ; for high
angles of incidence the rate of change in the values of 0 as given by
theory is considerably greater than that given by experiment.          When
tp lies between 40° and 55° (about), the two agree closely, and as the
angle of incidence decreases still further, there is a tendency for the
experimental value of the difference to become the greater.
    The differences between theory and experiment amount to 6 per
cent, of the quantity measured when the ordinary wave is transmitted,
and to 15 per cent, when the extraordinary wave only passes through
the prism.
    When only the extraordinary wave is transmitted the reverse is the
case,   the theoretical value is for large values of 0 too small ; for
angles between 40° and 55° the two agree fairly, and for smaller
angles the experimental value becomes too small.              Other series of
experiments     lead to the same conclusions.        For details as to the
arrangements of the apparatus, the method           of   determining exactly
when one ray is quenched, the probable accuracy of the results, and
the effects of small errors in the constants of the formula? or the
adjustment of the apparatus, reference must be made to the paper.
    The experiments were conducted by Lord Rayleigh's kind per
mission in one of the rooms of the Cavendish Laboratory, at
 Cambridge.

 The     Bakerian Lecture — " Action of Free Molecules on Ra
        diant Heat, and its Conversion thereby into Sound," was
       delivered by J. Tyndall, F.R.S.
   The following is an abstract     : —
   The lecture opens with a brief reference to the researches of Leslie,
Rnmford, and Melloni.         The labours of Tyndall and Magnus, as far
as  thej bear upon the present subject, are then succinctly sketched,
their points of difference        being signalised and briefly discussed.
This preliminary sketch is wound up by a reference to a recently
published paper by Lecher and Pernter, who, while supporting the
lecturer in the matter of gases, dissent from him in the matter of
vapours.       These investigators are especially emphatic in affirming the
neutrality of aqueous vapour to radiant heat. Following Magnus,
                                                            "
they refer Tyndall's results to what Magnus calls             vapour-hesion,"
that is to say, to the condensation of the vapours on the surfaces of the
plates of rock-salt used to close the experimental tube, and on the
interior surface of the tube itself.
   In November, 1880, the lecturer's investigations in this field were
resumed.        Former experiments were repeated and verified with divers
sources of heat, and with various experimental tubes — some polished
within, and others coated inside with lampblack. The results obtained
with the one class of tubes are substantially the same as those obtained
with the other.
   But even a coating of lampblack may be supposed to reflect a certain
amount of heat, hence the desirability of an arrangement whereby
internal reflection should be entirely abolished.           This was accom
plished     in  the following   manner:  — A   spiral of platinum wire, ren
dered incandescent by a voltaic current of measured strength, was
cbosen as source of heat.        An experimental tube 38 inches long and
6 inches in diameter        had two circular apertures at its ends, closed
by transparent plates of rock-salt, 3 inches in diameter.           The tube
was furnished with three cocks — one connected with a large Bianchi's
air-pump ; another with a purifying apparatus ; while through the
third vapours and gases could be admitted. Prior to entering the
tube, the calorific rays were sent through a> very perfect rock-salt
lens, by means of which an image of the spiral was formed on the
    VOL. XXXI II.                                                  D

most    distant plate of rock-salt. To obtain the image with clearness,
the spiral was first rendered highly luminous, and afterwards reduced,
by the introduction of resistance, to the required temperature.              In
this way a calorific beam was sent along the axis of the experimental
tube without at all impinging upon its interior surface.          No reflection
came into play; no absorption by hypothetical liquid            films,  coating
the internal surface, could occur      ;  and yet experiments made with this
arrangement entirely confirmed           the preceding ones, wherein by far
the greater quantity of heat which          reached  the pile had undergone
reflection.
    When     the  source   of  heat   was   changed to a carefully worked
cylinder of lime, a portion of which was rendered incandescent by an
ignited stream of coal-gas and oxygen, the results were confirmatory
of those obtained with the spiral.           Tho order of absorption in bot
cases was the same,      the only difference being that the fractional part of
the total radiation absorbed in the case of the lime-light was less
than that absorbed in the case of the spiral.
    To condense the radiation from the lime-light, concave mirrors were
sometimes employed, and sometimes rock-salt lenses.              The results in
both cases were identical.
    An experimental      tube of the dimensions here given was employed
by   the  lecturer   to  check  his results more than ten years ago. Its
interior surface was rough and tarnished, and when warmed dynami
cally by    the  entrance   of a gas its power as a radiator enabled it to
disturb,    to some slight extent, the purity of the results. To obviate
 this, the   experimental tube recently employed was provided with an
internal    silver surface, deposited electrolytically and highly polished.
 By this    arrangement the radiation of the tube itself, as well as its
 absorption, was rendered quite insensible.
    The rock-salt plates used to close the experimental tube, and on
 which liquid films are alleged to be deposited, remain to be ex
 amined.      In this case also an experiment urn cruris is possible. If the
 observed absorptions be due to such liquid films, then the separation of
 the salts more widely from each other, the space between them being
 copiously supplied with vapour, ought to produce no effect ; but if the
 absorption, as alleged by the lecturer, be the act of the vapour mole
 cules, then the deepening of the absorbing stratum ought to produce an
  augmented effect.      For many gases and some vapours this problem was
 solved as far back     ps 1863. By means of an apparatus then described,
  polished plates of rock-salt could be brought into contact with each
  other, and then gradually separated,      until the gaseous stratum between
  them was some inches in depth.            With sulphuric ether vapour the
  distance between the plates being              of an inch, an absorption of
  2 per cent. was observed.         With a thinner stratum, or a weaker
  vapour, even this 6mall      absorption vanished    ; while in passing from

^   of an inch to 2 inches the absorption rose from 2 per cent. to 35
per cent. of the total radiation.       Such experiments, recently verified,
entirely dispose  of  the  hypothesis that liquid films were the cause of
the observed absorption.
                         "
   The " vapour-hesion     hypothesis involves the assumption that liquids
rxert on radiant heat an absorbent power which is denied to their
vapours. It assumes, in other words, that the seat of absorption is the
molecule considered as a who'e, and not the constituent atoms of the
molecule.    For were the absorption intra-molecular, the passage from
the liquid to the vaporous condition, which leaves the molecules intact,
could not abolish the absorption.         So far back as 18t>4 the lecturer
had proved that when vapours, in quantities proportional to tie
densities of their liquids, were examined in the experimental tube, the
order of their absorptions was precisely that of the liquids from which
they were derived.      This result has been recently tested and verified
in the most ample manner by means of the apparatus in which in
ternal reflection never comes into play. It furnishes, therefore, the
strongest presumptive evidence that the seat of absorption in liquids
and in vapours is the same.
   As a problem of molecular physics it was, however, in the highest
degree desirable to compare together equal quantities, instead of
proportional quantities, of liquids and vapours.             Highly volatile
liquids  alone lend   themselves  to   this experiment,  for only from such
liquids can vapours be obtained sufficient, when caused to assume the
liquid form, to produce layers of practicable thickness. Two cases,
however, have been very fully worked out, the substances employed
being the hydride of amyl and sulphuric ether.           Careful and exact
experiments,   many   times  repeated,   lead to  the result  that when the
number of molecules traversed by the calorific rays in the vapour is
the same as that traversed in the liquid, the absorptions are identical.
In the silvered experimental tube, which, as stated, is 38 inches long,
hydride of amyl vapour, at a mercury pressure of 6'6 inches, is equi
valent to a liquid layer 1 millim. in thickness, while a vapour column
of sulphuric ether, of the same length, and 7'2 inches pressure, would
also produce a liquid layer 1 millim. thick.       The experiment has been
made with the utmost care, both with the lime8light and the incan
descent platinum, with the result that it ic impossible to say that
there is any difference between the vapour absorption and the liquid

absorption. In the face of such facts the vapour-hesion hypothesis,
as an explanation of the results published by the lecturer, cannot be
sustained.
   On the 29th of November, 1880, ho had the pleasure of witnessing.

various solid substances, and to produce mnsical sounds.             Mr. Bell's
previous experiments upon selenium naturally led him to conclude that
the effect was produced by the luminous rays of the spectrum. The
contemplation of these experiments produced in the lecturer the con
viction that the results were due to the intermittent absorption of
radiant heat. He was experimenting on vapours B.t this time. Substi
tuting in idea gaseous for solid matter, he clearly pictured the sudden
expansion of an absorbent gas or vapour at every stroke of the calorific8
beam, and its contraction when the beam was intercepted.             Pulses far
stronger than those obtainable from solid matter would probably be
thus produced, which, when rapid enough, would generate musical
sounds.     The intensity of the sound would, of course, be determined
by the absorptive power of the gas or vapour.
    This idea was tested on the spot. Placing sulphuric ether in a test-
tube, and connecting the tube with the ear, the intermittent beam was
caused to fall upon the vapour above the liquid.              A feeble musical
sound was distinctly heard.       Formic ether was tried in the same way,
and with the same result.       Bisulphide of carbon was then tried, but
the vapour of this liquid proved incompetent to generate a musical
sound.     These results, which were in perfect accordance with those
previously enunciated by the lecturer, were first made public during a
discussion at the Society of Telegraph Engineers on the 8th of
 December, 1880*
    It was obvious, however, that the arrangement of Mr. Bell — a truly
beautiful one — was not suited to bring out the maximum effect. He
 had employed a series of lenses to concentrate his beam, and these,
 however pure, would, in the case of transparent gases, absorb a large
 portion of the rays most influential in producing the sound.              The
 lecturer, therefore, resorted to lenses of rock-salt and to concave
 mirrors silvered in front. He employed various sources of heat, in
 cluding that of the electric lamp.     The lime-light he found very con
 venient. With the lime-light and concave mirror, sounds of surprising
 intensity were produced by all the highly absorbent gases and vapours.
 Among gases chloride of methyl was loudest.             Conveyed directly to
 the ear by a tube of india-rubber, the sound of this gas seemed
 as loud as the peal of an organ.          Abandoning the ear-tube, and
  choosing a suitable recipient for the gas, the sounds were heard at a
  distance of 20 feet from their origin.    As regards intensity, the order
  of the sounds, in gases, corresponds exactly with the order of their
  absorptions of radiant heat.
     Among vapours sulphuric ether stands highest, this result being in
  part due to the great volatility of the liquid.    But the intensity of the
  sound is by no means wholly dependent on volatility.              The specific

1881.]      Radiant Heat, and its Conversion thereby intd Sound.         37
action    of the molecules on radiant heat is   as    clearly shown in these
experiments as in those previously conducted          with the experimental
tube   and thermopile. Upwards of eighty vapours have been tested
in regard to their sound-producing power.
   With regard to aqueous vapour, whose action upon radiant heat
even the latest publications on this subject describe as nil, it was
especially interesting to be able to question the vapour itself as to its
absorbent power, and to receive from it an answer which did not
admit of doubt.     A number of bulbs about an inch in diameter were
placed under the receiver of an air-pump, with a vessel containing
sulphuric acid beside them.    When thoroughly dry they were exposed
to an intermittent beam. The well-dried air within the bulbs proved
silent, while the slightest admixture of humid air sufficed to endow it
with sounding power. Placing a little water in a thin glass bulb, and
heating it nearly to its boiling point, the sounds produced by the
developed vapour are exceedingly loud.      The bulbs employed in theso
experiments are usually about a cubic inch in volume. They may, how
ever, be reduced to one-fiftieth or even one one-hundredth of a cubic
inch. When a minute drop of water is vaporised within such little
bulbs, on their exposure to the intermittent beam loud musical sounds
are produced.
   It is to be borne  in mind, that the heat employed in these experi
ments, coming as it did from a highly luminous source, was absorbed
in a far smaller degree than would be the heat from bodies under the
temperature of incandescence.
    To render the correlation of sound-producing power and adiather-
mancy complete, all the gases and vapours which had been exposed to
the intermittent beam were examined as to the augmentation of their
elastic force through the absorption of radiant heat.            A glass
cylinder, 4 inches long and 3 inches in diameter, had its ends
closed with transparent plates of rock-salt.       Connected with this
cylinder was a narrow JJ^tuhe, containing a coloured liquid which
stood at the same level in the two arms of the [J.          The cylinder
could be exhausted at pleasure or filled with a gas or vapour.     When
filled, the sudden removal of a double silvered screen permitted the
beam from the lime-light to pass through             it,
                                                   the augmentation of
elastic force being immediately declared by the depression of the
liquid in one of the arms of the  \J-tube and its elevation in the other.
The difference of level in the two arms gave, in terms of water-
pressure, a measure of the heat absorbed.  With the stronger vapours
it would be easy with this instrument to produce an augmentation of
elastic force corresponding to a water-pressure of a thousand milli
metres.  As might be expected, the intensity of the sounds corre

    In conclusion, the lecture draws attention to the bearing of its
results upon the phenomena of meteorology.         The views of Magnus
regarding the part played by mist or haze, are referred to and atten
tion is directed to various observations by Wells which are in opposi
tion to these views.        The observations of Wilson, Six, Leslie,
Denham,     Hooker,   Livingstone, Mitchell, Strachey, and others are
referred to and connected with the action of aqueous vapour upon
solar and terrestrial radiation.   Many years ago the lecturer sought to
imitate the action of aqueous vapour on the solar rays by sending a
beam from the electric hght through a layer of water, and afterwards
examining its spectrum.       The curve representing the distribution of
heat resembled that obtained from the spectrum of the sun, the
invisible calorific radiation being reduced by the water from nearly
eight times to about twice the visible. Could we get above the screen
of atmospheric vapour, a large amount of the ultra-red rays would
assuredly be restored to the solar spectrum.        This conclusion has
been recently established on the grandest scale by Professor Langley,
who on the 10th of September wrote to the lecturer from an elevation
of 1'2,000 feet on Mount Whitney, " where the air is perhaps drier than
at any other equal altitude ever used for scientific investigation." An
extract from Professor Langley's letter will fitly close this summary:
— "You may," he says, "be interested in knowing that the result
indicates a great difference in the distribution of the solar energy here
from that to which we are accustomed in regions of ordinary humidity,
and that while the evidence of the effect of water vapour on the
more refrangible rays is feeble, there is, on the other hand, a
systematic effect, due to its absence, which shows, by contrast, its
power on the red and ultra-red in a striking light.         These experi
 ments also indicate an enormous extension of the ultra-red rays
 beyond the point to which they have been followed below, and being
made on a scale different from that of the laboratory — on one indeed
as grand as nature can lurnish — and by means wholly independent of
those usually applied to the research, must, I think, when published,
put an end to any doubt as to the accuracy of the statements so long
since made by you, as to the absorbent power of water-vapour over
the greater part of the spectrum, and as to its predominant importance
in modifying to us the solar energy."

                   THE PRESIDENT           in the Chair.
   The Repoit of the Auditors of tho Treasurer's Accounts on the
part of the Society was presented, by which it appears that the total
receipts during the past year, including a balance of £1,195 5s. Id.
carried from the preceding year, amount to £8,020 'is. 8d. ; and that
the total expenditure in the same period, including purchase of stock,
amounts to £5,760 19s. 1</., leaving a balance at the Bankers' of
£2,241 lis. 8d., and £17 12s. lid. in the hands of the Treasurer.
   The thanks of the Society were voted to the Treasurer and Auditors.
   The Secretary read the following Lists    : —

     The President then addressed the Society     as  follows : —
     On the occasions of onr anniversary our first glance is usually retro
 spective, in memory of those once among our numbers, but now
 surviving only in their works. On our home list we have this year
 lost more than a score of Fellows. On the foreign list we have lost but
 one ; that loss will however be severely, if not so widely, felt.
     In Michael Chasles mathematicians recognise a geometer of unusual
 powers, who, having devoted a long life to his favourite study, has left
 an extensive and characteristic train of researches behind him.         But a
 larger circle of friends recognised in him a great and good man,
 beloved by all who knew him, and respected beyond the range of his
 personal acquaintance.      As a pure geometer he belonged to a class of
 mathematicians for which the Academy of Sciences of Paris has long
 been justly celebrated ; but whose numbers appear liable to a percep
 tible fluctuation, perhaps partly owing to the brilliant opportunities
 and the varied fascinations which modern algebra offers to the student.
  Eminent in a nation which has always been intolerant of obscurity
  in Science, he showed in a remarkable degree how much might be
  elicited through precision of thought and by clearness of exposition
  from a few well-selected and fertile ideas. Such, for instance, proved
  to be the consideration of Anharmonic Ratios, the principle of Corre
  spondence, and the method of Characteristics.         Whether in the latter
  he had struck a vein so completely out of the range of the analyst, as he
  himself supposed, may perhaps be still claimed as an open question ;

  1881.]                      Presidetit's Address.                          41
  but certain   it is that  he showed     the fertility of the method by con-
  tinning to deduce from it an apparently inexhaustible flow of theorems,
 even   after the more serious part of his mathematical work had been
 done.    And there is little doubt that long after the time when many
 subsequent works have fulfilled their pnrpose, and have fallen into
 a natural oblivion, his
                             "
                               Apercu Historique," his
                                                            " Geometrie Supe-
 rienre," and the fragment of his " Traite des Sections Coniques," will
 be regarded as classics in the library of the mathematician.
     Turning to the home list, the remark made in my last address, viz.,
 that our losses had been mainly among our older Fellows, might be
 repeated    with even more emphasis on the present occasion.           Of the
 twenty-two who have died during the intervening period nine had
 reached the age of three score and ten, eight that of four score, and one,
 Dr. Billing, had attained his ninety-first year.
    In Lord Beaconsfield     and  Sir James Colvile     we have lost two distin
guished     members, elected under the statute which gave a new definition
of the   privileged class a few years ago. Lord Hatherley will be recol
lected as    having served on our Council within recent years, and as
having     often   given us very useful advice on subjects requiring the
sound judgment of an experienced mind.               Although Lord Hatherley
would doubtless have been elected, as a member of the Privy Council,
under the statute above mentioned, it is perhaps worth remark that
he was elected under statute previously existing, and that his fellow
ship dated from the year 1833.
    The late Dean of Westminster furnishes another instance of the
wise exercise of a power which the Royal Society has always reserved
to itself, notwithstanding the changes made in 1847, of electing from
time to time men of eminent distinction in other avocations of life
than those of strict science.       Of Dr. Stanley's attainments and merits
in those other directions it is not my province to speak ; and, indeed,
it is the less necessary that I should do so, for they were so many and
so varied that in one way or other they were known to all.              But he
was conspicuous, both among the members of his own profession and
among many others who have neither predilection nor training for
actual science, for his genuine and honest sympathy with its principles
and its objects, and with tho labours of those who cultivate it.
    In Dr. Lloyd, whose age was coeval with the century, and who was
a   fellow-worker with Herschel, Whewell, Peacock, and Sir W. R.
Hamilton, we seem to have lost one of the links which connected us
with a past generation.       While himself no mean mathematician, he was
distinguished especially in the sciences of optics and of magnetism.
In the subject of optics he had the rare opportunity of supplying
the experimental verification of Sir W. R. Hamilton's brilliant
geometrical       conclusions on the configuration of the wave-surface ;
and it was largely due to his patience, his delicacy of touch, and

  42                       A nniversary Meeting.                 [Nov. 30,
 his almost   instinctive sagacity, that the phenomena of conical refrac
 tion were first made visible to human eye.     In magnetism he assisted
 in the formation of the great survey of the globe, initiated by Sir
 E. Sabine, and as director of a magnetic observatory in Dublin he
 made valuable contributions to the subject.        His scientific remains,
 brought together in one volume, have been a welcome addition to the
 library both of the mathematician and of the experimentalist. His
 interest in science and in its promoters was active throughout his long
 life ; and those on whom the honorary degree of LL.D. was conferred
 at the late meeting of the British Association in Dublin, will always
 cherish as a pleasant reminiscence the fact of having received it at his
 hands.
    Dr. Bigsby was one of the earlier cultivator of Geology.       Some of
 his first studies were made at a time when the subject was hardly a
 science; but in attaining the advanced age of eighty-nine he lived to
 see it what it has since become. He founded a medal at the Geological
 Society, of which he was for many years a member.
    We are again reminded of the progress which has been made in
 science, and in the cultivation of it during the present generation by
 the fact that until the last day of last year we could reckon among our
 Fellows Dr. John Stenhouse, one of the surviving founders of the
 Chemical Society.
    On the subject of our property there is little change to report.
 Further investments have been made in due course on account of the
 Fees Reduction Fund.      The sale of the Acton estate has not yet been
completed, but a deposit is in. hand, and a half-year's interest on the
 balance has been received.
    The Charitable Trusts Bill, which was introduced into Parliament
last session, and which would have affected our interests had it not been
for a clause introduced by our Fellow the Marquis of Salisbury, specially
exempting the Royal Society from its operation, was withdrawn.
    The collection of portraits in the possession of the Society has been
enriched by the addition of a portrait of Sir Joseph Dalton Hooker.
painted by Johu Collier, Esq., at the expense of a considerable number
of our Fellows, who were desirous of expressing their sense of the im
portant services rendered by Sir Joseph to the Society, and at the
same time of securing a permanent memorial of their late President.
It is to be hoped that advantage may be taken of any suitable occa
sions that may arise from time to time of adding to our gallery of
historical records of the great men whom we have reckoned among
our Fellows.
     The Fellows will learn with satisfaction that the first part of the
new edition of our library catalogue is published. This part, consist
ing of 232 pages, contains the Transactions, Proceedings, and Journals
published by Societies and Institutions in nearly all parts of the world ;

  and also the observations,   reports, and accounts    of surveys which are
  to be   found   in our library.   As our Library Committee has always
  devoted    great attention to securing by exchange or by purchase
 publications of this class, and as the main strength of our library
 consequently lies in our collection of them, the part in question will
  form the most important section of the entire catalogue.
     Progress has also been made in the more voluminous portion of the
 catalogue, viz., that of the general collection of scientific books, of
 which thirteen sheets, extending to the letter C, are printed off, or are
 in type.     It may fairly be hoped that before our next anniversary the
 whole    will be published.
    The last    part of the Philosophical Transactions for 1880 was pub
lished in     March of the present year, completing a volume of nearly
 1,100   pages, with upwards of fifty plates.         Of the Transactions for
 1881,   Parts   I  and  II have  already appeared ; from which an early
 publication of     Part III may  be anticipated.
    Of the Proceedings,      vol. 31 was published in June, and vol. 32
at the   end   of October.
    Although, as      I remarked last year, we are more concerned with
the quality than with the quantity of the communications made to
the Society, it may still be interesting to carry on the table of the
number of papers presented per annum to a tenth year.            It stands as
follows    : —
                   1872                    99 papers received.

     These     127 papers include one from Mr. Brooks of Baltimore,
two    from Professor Helmholtz, and one from Captain Mannheim,
of the Ecole       Polytechnique, Paris.    On reference to the papers them
selves it will be noticed that several prominent men are carrying on
with vigour the series of researches on which they hava been, in some
cases for years, engaged.       Among them there may be mentioned, in
physics, those of Professors Liveing and Dewar, and of Mr. Lockyer,
on the Spectra of Terrestrial Substances and of the Sun; those of Pro
fessor Hughes on minute Interactions of Electric Currents and Mag
netism; those of Mr. Crookes on High Vacua; and those of Mr. H.
Tomlinson on the effect of Stress and Strain on the action of Physical

44                        Anniversary Meeting.                    [Nov. 30,
Forces.    Mr. G. H. Darwin continues his already classical memoirs
on the mechanical history of the solar system; and Captain Abuey
has opened ont to view, by photographic means of his own invention,
a part of the spectrum of the sun and of other bodies, beyond the red,
hitherto invisible ; and last, but not least, Professor Tyndall in his
Bakerian Lecture has given an account of his researches on the
action of free Molecules on Radiant Heat, and its Conversion thereby
into Sound.       In Biology, I may mention the investigations of
Mr. Romanes      on  nerve systems ; those of Professor Ferrier on the
connexion between special portions of the brain and special motor
organs of the animal system ; those of Mr. Parker on the Skull of the
Batrachia, and of Professor W. C. Williamson on the fossil plants of
the Coal-measures.      Among the newer subjects, the experiments of
Dr. Young and Professor George Forbes on the velocity of light of
different colours have naturally arrested considerable attention, for
several reasons and especially because the conclusions thence deduced,
if ultimately established, would fundamentally modify our views of
the constitution of the luminiferous ether.
    For several years past I have been able with much satisfaction to
report that there had been no change in the staff of officers of the
 Society.    I much wish that I could have done so again.           But the
longer a capable man lives and is available, the more will work accu
mulate on his hands ; and the time at last comes when something
 must be given up, lest, in the multiplication of avocations, powers
 which might otherwise       have been devoted        to some great and
 good purpose, and on operations not within the grasp of everyone,
 should become dissipated among a variety of objects.         A feeling that
 life must not be spent merely in running hither and thither, and a
 desire that it should be something better than a mere feat of mental
 agility exhibited in passing rapidly from one occupation to another,
 doubtless operated in leading Sir Joseph Hooker to resign the Presi
 dentship ; and a similar feeling has recently led to the resignation of
 the Secretaryship by Professor Huxley.       That this loss is great will be
 felt by every Fellow of the Society ; it will be more keenly felt by his
 brother Secretaries and the Treasurer, but most of all by your President.
 Connected as I have been with him through a series of years by ties
 of office in the Society, by bonds of friendship and trust as thorough
 as can exist between man and man, I cannot but miss for a long time
 to come his ever willing support, his sound counsel and advice, and
 the cheery manfulness with which he would always address himself to
 any business however difficult, uninviting, or heavy.
     The post is one which it is not easy to fill. Many qualifications go to
                                                               "
 make up a good Secretary ; and although none of us so           despaired of
               " as to doubt that a
 the republic                         good successor would be found, we
  stdl felt some anxiety until we were in a position confidently to

recommend a name      for your consideration. Professor Michael Foster's
great scientific attainments, his administrative powers as shown in
founding the great School of Biology at Cambridge, the confidence
with which he inspires all around him, alike point him out as a man
eminently fitted for the post.     It would indeed have been agreeable to
your   President  to have  had  one   of the principal Secretaries resident
in London ; but the means of communication are now so different from
what they formerly were, that questions of distance almost disappear ;
and it is certainly not without its advantages that the two principal
Secretaries, if not resident in London, should reside in the same city.
   In the course of the spring of the present year, Sir Joseph Copley,
the present representative of the Founder of the Copley Memorial,
explained in a visit to the President his wish to
                                                          " provide in per
petuity a yearly bonus of £50, to be given to the recipient of the
Copley Medal."       As the donor's views on the terms of the gift
were completely made up, and were not offered for discussion by the
Society, or otherwise open to modification, the Council decided to
accept the offer in the spirit in which it was made, and on the terms
prescribed.    In accordance with this, Sir Joseph transferred a sum in
Consols sufficient to provide for the bonus proposed.       This acceptance
will not in any way affect the adjudication of the Medal, nor, it is to
he hoped, the high estimation in which that award          has always been
held.
   The period of five years during which the experiment of the
Government Fund of £4,000 per annum was to be tried, has now
expired.    In   a former address    I  have  expressed opinions gathered
from many of the Fellows of the Society, and have indicated my own.
The President and Council have now, at the request of the Department
of Science    and Art, through which the vote is made, drawn up a
report   on  the  question, based upon the experience gained up to the
present time, and have made suggestions with a view to a modified
arrangement for the future.         The Society will be duly informed of
the  result of those oommunications. In the mean time it may not be
oat   of place to remind the Fellows that a statement of all grants
made within the year is published in the report of our anniversary
proceedings.
   The Report of the Challenger Expedition, of which mention was
made last year, is in the course of publication ; and three volumes
have   now appeared.       Copies of these have been presented by the
Treasury to our library.        Volumes    II and  III refer to the curious
forms of life found in what Sir Wyville Thomson has called the
 "
   Abysmal Region," and are copiously illustrated with lithographs.
 The interest which attaches to this publication is evinced by the fact
 that the first edition of the second volume is already exhausted.        A
 second edition of it is in the course of printing.       The Fellows will

doubtless have observed, that the printing of the text and the execu
tion of the plates are maintained at the same high standard as that
exhibited at the outset.
   Among other scientific publications of the year,        I  may mention the
third volume of Roscoe and Schorlemmer's work on Chemistry.
Mr. Balfour's work on Comparative Embryology, and Mr. Darwin's on
Vegetable Mould.
   In December last the Council author;sed the loan of the " Philo
                          " from one of our
sophical Transactions                             complete sets, five volumes
at a   time,  to  the Delegates   of  the  Oxford    University Press, for the
preparation of a Philological English Dictionary, under the editor
ship of Dr. Murray.       It is hoped that this loan will contribute to the
completeness of the work in respect of scientific terms.             Forty-one
volumes have been already       utilised  in this way.
   Towards the close of last session a communication was received
from the India Office enclosing a copy of a report and memorandum,
on Pendulum Observations, by Major Heischel, and asking the advice
of the President and Council thereon.            Subsequently there followed
another communication from the same office, enclosing a copy of a
letter from the same officer, with an extract from a letter to him from
Mr. Peirce of the United States Coast Survey.                These documents
were referred       to a Committee consisting of Sir George               Airy,
Professor    J.  C. Adams,  and  Professor   Stokes.
   The Report of that Committee was forwarded to the India Office j
the following extracts from it contain those parts which refer to the
main scientific questions raised : — -
    "The object in referring these documents to the Royal Society was
to assist the India Department in coming to a conclusion as to what,
if anything, might yet be required in order to render the pendulum
operations which have been carried out in connexion with the great
trigonometrical survey of India reasonably complete as an important
 contribution towards the determination of gravity all over the earth.
    " At present the stations which have been directly connected with
the Indian stations are confined to Aden, Ismailia in Egypt, and
 Kew ; and no one of these has been differentially connected with any
 of the chains of stations that have hitherto been used in the deter
 mination in this way of the figure of the earth, though Kew is now a
 station at which an absolute determination has been made. We think
 it would be a reasonable expectation on the part of the scientific
 public that the Indian group of stations, which have already been
 connected with Kew, should be differentially connected with at least
 one chain of stations which are so connected with one another, and
 which have been employed in the determination of the figure of the
 earth.
    -'
       We approve accordingly of the suggestion          that gravity  at Kew

  1881]                     President's Address.                         47
  should be compared,   by means of invariable pendulums, with gravity
 at another  station belonging to another group. Greenwich has been
 named as such a station.
    " In connexion with this subject, we would refer to the
                                                               suggestion,
 which has been brought before ns, made by Mr. Peirce, of the United
 States Coast Survey, that Major Hersehel should swing the same
 two pendulums that were used in India, first at Kew and then at
 Washington.
    " As
          Washington is, or shortly will be, connected differentially with
 a large chain of stations widely distributed       in America and else
where, we think that the value of the            Indian series would be
decidedly increased by being connected with one of the American
stations,  such as Washington.         We think, however, that its con
nexion through Kew with one of the older series should not on that
account be omitted.
    " The observations
                        required for the purpose of these connexions are
such as certainly can be made, and have been made, by existing
methods; and the labour of making them, which will be approximately
in proportion to the number of stations at which the pendulums will
have to be swung, is only a fraction of that already incurred on the
Indian stations, and the three which have been included in the same
group with them."
   In October last a letter was received from the Treasury asking the
opinion of the President and Council respecting arrangements            for
observing the Transit of Venus in 1882.       Under the advice of a Com
mittee appointed for the purpose, it was recommended         that a special
Committee of the Royal Society should be appointed to decide upon the
observations considered essential, and to advise Her Majesty's Govern
ment as to the best method of carrying them out.           In conformity
with this advice, and at the request of the Treasury, a Committee was
appointed to draw out a scheme of stations, and of the constitution,
strength, and equipment of the observing parties, and to frame an
estimate of the total cost.   The Committee reported recommending the
adoption of certain stations in South Africa, the West Indies, Australia,
and New Zealand, and the Falkland Islands ; and they at the same time
added other particulars, and furnished an estimate of the whole, adopt
ing in the main the recommendations of that Committee ; the Treasury
then requested the President and Council to nominate an Executive
Committee, by which (accounting to the Treasury) any vote of Parlia
ment for the purpose of these observations might be administered ; and
under whose advice the observers and assistants might be selected
and appointed.     In compliance with this request the following Fellows
were nominated       as an Executive Committee, viz., the President,
Professor J. C. Adams, Sir G. Airy, Mr. Hind, Sir G. Richards,
Professor H. J. Smith, and Mr. Stone.       That Committee is now con

tinning its labours, and has appointed its member, Mr. Stone, of the
Radclifie Observatory, Oxford, directing astronomer of the expedi
tions ; and nnder him the selection of instruments, as well as the
training of the observers, will be made.
    With a view of making the observations ultimately as comparable as
possible, the Committee, at an early stage, put itself, through the Foreign
Office, into communication with the corresponding Commissions in
foreign countries, on the subjects of the instructions to be given to
the various observers ; and a draft set of instructions, drawn up for
this purpose, was circulated for comment and suggestion.
     Moved perhaps in some degree by this action, the Government of
 France took advantage of the assemblage of scientific men collected in
 Faris for the Electrical Congress and Exhibition, to summon a Con
 gress of Astronomers, having especially in view a consensus of arrange
 ments for the observation of the Transit.       This Congress met in Paris
 on the 5th of October, nnder the auspices of the Minister of Public
 Instruction.      M. Dumas was appointed President; MM. Foerster
 and Weisse, Vice-Presidents ; MM. Tisserand and Hirsch, Secretaries.
 The various countries of Europe were represented ; but it was a
 matter of much regret that no representative from the United States
 of America was present.          Mr. Stone attended on behalf of the
 British Committee.        I must here express my regret at having been
 unable     to attend in person to support our Directing Astronomer, who
 made the journey at much inconvenience to himself; but          I  should at
 the same time add that my absence in no way diminished the effective
 ness of Mr. Stone's counsels, which proved of great service in pro
 moting a unanimity in the views finally adopted by the Congress.
     Two Committees were appointed (1) for the selection of stations ;
  (2) for a discussion of methods of observation.
     As the British stations had been already chosen and did not admit
  of material alteration, the first of these Committees did not directly
  concern us.       But, judging from the number of observations con
  templated to be made in South America by foreign expeditions, it
  seems not impossible that the party which we had proposed for the
  Falkland Islands might be advantageously transferred to some other
  locality, so as to strengthen the parties requiring support, for example,
  in Australia.
     As regards the discussion of methods, the draft instructions drawn
  up by the British Committee, and especially the definition of contact
  to be observed, strongly insisted upon by Mr. Stone, were in the main
  adopted.      The following are the principal points agreed upon : —
      With a view to uniformity of method of observation, it is
  necessary that instruments of nearly the same aperture, 6 inches,
   should be used, also that the observations of contact should be made
   in a field of just sufficient brightness to allow of the clear separation

  of two threads at one second of arc apart when seen projected ou the
  sun with a power of 150.         The times corresponding to the internal
  contacts should be denned as follows      : —
    At Ingress. — " The time of the last appearance of any well-marked
 and persistent discontinuity in the illumination of the apparent limb
 of the sun near the point of contact."
    At Egress. — " The time corresponding to the first appearance of any
 well-marked and persistent discontinuity in the illumination of the
 apparent limb of the sun near the point of contact."
    It is a point of primary importance that all the observers shall, as
 far as possible, observe the same kind of contact ; and it is therefore
 desirable that the times recorded for contacts should refer to some
 marked discontinuity in the illumination of the sun's limb about which
 there cannot be a doubt, and which may be supposed to be recognisable
 by all the observers.        If a pure geometrical contact is alone seen,
 there can be no doubt about the time which should be given ; but, if
 haze is noted,   it should be haze nearly      as dark as the outer edge .of
the   planet ;  and  if a ligament is seen, it should be nearly as dark as
the outer edge of the plMiet.
    A further proposal was made to establish a Central Bureau in Paris
to receive and discuss the observations,        and to enter upon other work
more or less directly connected           with the determination of solar
parallax.      But, as this question was not contemplated in the instruc
tions given to our representative, and indeed exceeded the powers of
the British Committee,          no definitive resolution was passed on the
subject.
    On the subject of the longitude of a point in Australia, to which       I
made allusion in my address last year, as important for the observa
tions of the Transit of Venus,         I  have lately received a letter from
Mr. Todd, of the Observatory, Adelaide, from which the following is
an extract : " With regard to the determination of Australian longi
tudes : as it is understood that Lieut.-Coinmander            Green, U.S.N.,
will call at Port Darwin to determine its longitude by signals from
Singapore on the one side, and with the Adelaide Observatory on the
other, I have tnken no further steps for going to Port Darwin as
previously arranged.        I shall take all the necessary observations here,
and exchange signals with Lient. -Commander Green over my over
land telegraph ; and, in conjunction with Messrs. Ellery and Russell,
make fresh determinations of the difference            of longitude between
Adelaide, Melbourne, and Sydney."
    Since our last anniversary, Sir George Airy, the late Astronomer
Royal, having completed his eightieth year, and nearly half a century
of office, has retired.    Of his services to science, and to this Society as
President, and in other ways, the time to speak has happily not yet
arrived.    His great intellectual powers are in fact in no way impaired,

and so far from having brought his period of activity to a close, he
hopes to employ his well-earned leisure in completing a favourite
work, the Numerical Lunar Theory.
    His successor, Mr. Christie, from his lone experience in the Royal
Observatory, will combine a thorough training in the remarkable
organisation and methodical administration for which his predecessor
was so conspicuous, with the full vigour of life, and an active interest
in the more modern developments of astronomy, in which he is already
distinguished.
    The future of the Royal Observatory is a subject on which the
mind of Sir George Airy often exercised itself, and to which he
alluded more than once in his Reports to the Board of Visitors. With
his fundamental proposition that, observational astronomy, in its
bearing on the improvement of navigation, must always be its main
line of work. every one must apree.         Over and above this, the
expressed wish of the Board of Visitors, and the practice of the last
few years, have already sanctioned the addition to the ancient duties
of the Observatory of some of those long and systematic series of
observations, such as that of the solar protuberances, and the motion
of the fixed stars in the line of sight as shown by the spectroscope,
which are beyond the scope of an amateur, and above the power
of any individual astronomer,        however devoted to his work, to
permanently maintain. How far it may be desirable to continue
magnetic and meteorological observations beyond the necessities of an
astronomical observatory, are questions which will doubtless engage
the attention of the present director.     The main question must be,
what distribution of these branches of study among Greenwich,
Kew, and other establishments, will in the end best condnce to the
progress of science.      And with a view of giving full scope to the
judgment and skill of the present and future holders of the office
the Board of Admiralty have, as I understand, decided to consider a
revision of the terms of the Royal Warrant under which the appoint
ment is made.
    This year has been signalised by the meeting of a most important
scientific congress — the International Congress of Electricians, held
at Paris.     The recent developments of the practical applications of
electricity rendered the occasion favourable both for organising a
special exhibition devoted solely to this branch of science, and also
for assembling the electricians of all countries.
    The general purpose of this Congress was to discuss, and, if pos
 sible, to settle, some of the numerous difficulties which perplex both
the physicist in his studies and the constructor in his work.
    But chief among the subjects proposed to, and undertaken by, the
 Congress was that of fixing a system of electrical measures for inter
national adoption.

     Perhaps    in no subject is the necessity of uniform system of standards
  so  striking as in electricity.   This science, both in its practical appli
  cations, such as   telegraphy, and in the great natural problems of terres
  trial magnetism and atmospheric electricity, refuses to recognise any
  artificial divisions of the surface of the globe, whether ethnological
  or political.    It rarely happens, in operations undertaken on so large
  a scale as the study of electricity and its industrial applications, that
  an opportunity presents itself of arranging for concerted and har
 monious action through a period extending to a distant future. Before
 a branch of industry has attained sufficient importance to claim
 international recognition, it has usually gone through the process of
 considerable development in different countries ; and in each of these
 developments it has often received a stamp of local character which
 makes it difficult to reduce the whole to one uniform system.         But in
 the case of electricity there were fortunately present special circum
 stances which facilitated the adoption of uniform standards. Foremost
 among these was the fact that the development of its practical appli
 cations, in other departments than telegraphy, were so recent that it
 was not too late to legislate for it as though it were but just about to
 begin.      Secondly, the international character of telegraphy, and the
fact that the manufacture of its apparatus had always been confined to
the great centres of civilisation,          had both tended to limit the
number of. existing systems of measurement,              and prevented that
multiplicity of standards which would certainly have arisen had such
 manufacture been carried on in numerous and in isolated localities.
 But by far the most important influencing circumstance was the
happy idea due to the British Association of adopting standards
based on absolute measures.            The Association did not allow the
idea to remain barren ; but, through the instrumentality of its Com
mittee on Electrical Standards, it gave to the world the admirable
units of the Ohm, the Volt, and the now re-christened Weber ; and the
eminent men who formed that Committee may now point with honour
able satisfaction to the fact that the Electrical           Congress decided
unanimously to recommend for universal acceptance those units which
that Committee so early adopted.
    With the single exception of the nnit of current which, in order
to avoid an ambiguity in the signification of Weber, receives the title
of Ampere, the names are left substantially without change.
    The adoption of these units for international use is to be preceded
by a new and more careful redetermination of the ohm at the hands
of the great physicists of all nations.         And it is intended that this
redetermination shall result in a standard for general adoption.         Thus
electricity will be the first of the practical sciences to be freed from
all difficulties due to local standards ; and it is to be hoped that this
example may be followed in other sciences concerned with practical life.
                                                                 e 2

    The following are the actual resolutions adopted by the Inter
 national Congress of Electricians at the sitting of September 22nd,
 1881 :—
    1. For electrical measurements, the fundamental units, the centi
 metre (for length), the gramme (for mass), and the second (for time),
are adopted.
    2. The Ohm and the Volt (for practical measures of resistance and
 of electromotive force or potential) are to keep their existing defini
 tions, 109 for the Ohm, and 108 for the Volt.
    3. The Ohm is to be represented         by a column of mercury of a
 square millimetre section at the temperature of zero Centigrade.
    4. An international commission is to be appointed to determine, for
practical purposes, by fresh experiments, the length of a column of
mercury of a square millimetre section which is to represent the Ohm.
    5. The current produced by a Volt through an Ohm is to be called
an Ampere.
    G. The quantity of electricity given by an Ampere in a second is to
 be called a Coulomb.
    7. The capacity defined by the condition that a Coulomb charges
it to the potential of a Volt is to be called a Farad.
    The remainder of the work of the Congress consisted mainly of the
discussion of various interesting questions bearing upon electricity ;
and although these did not in many cases issue in precise recommend
ations, yet they were not altogether devoid of practical results.       The
 questions    which  chiefly  attracted its attention were those  of terres
 trial magnetism and earth -currents, atmospheric electricity, and the
 more practical but perplexing question of lightning conductors.          In
all these matters the need of close and continuous intercourse between
 the observers of different nations was strongly felt; and the Congress
 passed resolutions recommending combined action both in the way of
 observations carried on simultaneously and with like apparatus, and
 also of frequent if not continuous telegraphic communication of the
 results of these observations.      The organisation of so extensive and
 perhaps   so costly a system of combined observations must depend to
 a great extent on the various Governments, and also on the goodwill
 and generosity of the great telegraphic companies ; but it is much to
 be wished for the sake of science, that some progress in that direction
 may soon be effected.        The present state aud prospects of electro-
 physiology also received careful discussion, but the difficulties of the
 subject precluded any definite conclusions. The same was the case
 with the question of photometry as applied to the intense light with
 which electricity furnishes us.      Resolutions recommending the adop
 tion of certain provisional photometric standards were passed ; but
 these only evidenced the strong feeling that prevailed in the Congress,
 that some new departure must be made, and that a new standard

of illumination    (such as perhaps the glow of platinum on the point
 of fusion) must eventually be adopted for electric lights.
    I have described the more important of the results of the delibera
 tions of the Congress.      Perhaps, however, the most important of all
 (with the exception of the choice of electrical units) will prove to
 have been the impetus given to electrical science by the inter
 change of ideas that took place among the leading physicists of all
 nations, and the light that was thrown on the various problems which
 came under discussion in the meetings of the Congress.
    I cannot conclude this imperfect sketch of this important Congress
 better than by quoting the eloquent words of M. Dumas at the con
 clusion of its sittings : — " Greek mythology, in its happy personifica
tion of the forces of nature, placed the winds and the waves nnder
the direction of divinities of the second rank ; it made the celestial
representative of light its god of poetry and of the arts ; and by an
admirable forethought, it reserved lightning for Jupiter.             Science
and industry have long since laid their hands on the forces which air
and water have placed at the disposition of man.             Steam, animated
by fire, has enabled him to overcome many obstacles and to rule the
waves.     Light has no longer any secrets from science, and the arts are
daily multiplying its marvellous applications.          But there remained
one labour to accomplish ; namely, to wrest lightning itself from the
hands of the ruler of the gods, and to bend it to the needs of humanity.
This is the feat which the nineteenth century has now accomplished,
and of which this Congress       is the evidence and the witness.        This
feat will mark an epoch ever memorable in history ; and, amid the
turmoil of politics and of questions which agitate the human mind, it
will be recognised as the characteristic feature of our era.              The
nineteenth century will     be the century  of electricity."
    After the Congress, one of the most remarkable events during the
present year has undoubtedly been the Electrical Exhibition in
Paris.   I    do not of course        purpose   to describe   it,   as many
of our Fellows visited    it;    and full descriptions have reached us
through various channels.         One point, however, must have struck
those who examined any con»iderable number of the objects               ; and
this
  I     mention, not as in any way disparaging them, but rather as
illustrating the stage to which electrical science has attained namely,
                                                                    ;
that while the assemblage of instruments and appliances was in every
way remarkable, and while very great ingenuity and skill had been
expended on their contrivance and construction, yet the amount of
novelty in the principles involved was comparatively small.           Of ne.v
combinations, improved       methods,  and adaptations in detail there was
abundance.      Some of them even removed former inventions from the
category of curiosities to that of instruments for practical employ
 ment;    or enlarged their sphere of ntility from that of the laboratory

54                        Anniversary Meeting.                 [Nov. 30,
to that of everyday use.       Bnt such is the mass of fruitful matter
which science has furnished to the mechanician and constructor,
that we might almost wish, from the point of view of the latter, that
they may have time to work out more fully than has yet been done,
the results of science, before they are called upon to elaborate any
 fresh materials.
    It is now proposed to repeat as far as may be, this Exhibition, at
the Crystal Palace ; and the energy with which the proposal has been
 taken up, and the response with which it has met in many quarters,
appear to justify sanguine expectations of its success, at all events
from a practical and popular point of view.          From the side of
science,    it would  doubtless  have been  far more interesting to look
forward to a fresh Exhibition, either here or elsewhere, of the pro
gress of electricity after an interval of two or three years.        But
there is nothing in the present undertaking to interfere with the more
advanced project, if, after some such period as that indicated, circum
stances should      prove favourable.    In the meantime, it must be
remembered that there are very many persons to whom the Paris
Exhibition would have proved both interesting and instructive, but
who, from one cause or another, were prevented visiting it. Be
sides this, there are not a few commercial, and even municipal, bodies
desirous of adopting some of the modern applications of electricity,
but who would be more ready to avail themselves of them after a
personal inspection of the instruments and of their mode of action.
From this point of view the Exhibition may fairly be expected to give
considerable impulse to the adoption of electrical appliances in fresh
quarters.
    But even over and above this practical aspect of the undertaking,
there may still have been at the epoch of the Paris Exhibition, some
results on the eve of achievement, some remedies for defects, sufficient
to transform a doubtful into a certain issue, or even a failure into a
success ; some steps which may open out new questions, or serve as
a departure for new investigations in the subject of electricity.      If
such should be the case, even science may derive substantial benefit
from the proposed undertaking.
    But the present year has been rendered        generally  remarkable,
amongst other things, by the multiplicity of its Congresses.       Apart
from those which are concerned with subjects not coming under the
head of     "Natural   Knowledge," there have been held the annual
meetings of the British Association, and of the Iron and Steel
Institute; the International Medical Congress, in London; the special
Congresses on Electricity and on the Transit of Venus, in Paris
(mentioned above) ; that on Geography in Venice ; that on Geology
in Bologna, and others.
   Among all these, the International Medical Congress which this

  1881.1                     President's Address.                              55
 year met   in London, stands conspicuous.         The work of that meeting
 showed that the study of medicine by the real workers is, in every
 part, even the most practical, pursued in a thoroughly scientific spirit ;
 that facts are industriously collected, and patiently grouped and com
 pared ; and that conclusions are, if sometimes hastily drawn, yet very
 cautiously accepted.      And there was ample evidence that help, whether
 in apparatus or in knowledge, is eagerly accepted from all the other
 sciences whether their range be far from, or near to, the biological. In
 short, in the opinion of those best qualified to form a judgment, it is
 not too much to say that the whole tone of the proceedings of the
 Congress,   though chiefly concerned with practical questions, was, in
the best   sense, even in the sense which the Royal Society would give
to the   term, scientific.
    Several of the societies meeting annually, or at longer periods, have
organisations which, during the intervals between two successive
meetings,     do useful work. But in all cases the meetings form the
most prominent, if not the most important feature of their life ; and,
speaking particularly of the meetings themselves, the question has
more than once been raised whether          they continue   to justify the efforts
necessary to bring them about.         It has been argued that, so many are
the scientific periodicals in every civilised country, that all the papers
of importance communicated          to the meetings would under any cir
cumstances be published in some place or other.               Again, it has been
urged that, so numerous are the centres         of  science, so many the means
of communication both between places and between persons, that the
necessity for these gatherings has, in the natural course of events,
become superseded.         The time which such meetings and the prepara
tion tor them involve, and the trouble which they entail on men already
burdened with much work, have also been pleaded on the same side,
and objections have been taken on the ground of the useless and
irrelevant matter which is too apt to crop up on these occasions.
These arguments are certainly not without weight ; but there is still
another side to the question.       It is, indeed, quite probable that all the
more important papers would be published even if the meetings never
took place at all.      But at these meetings there are usually a number
of communications, many, but not all, of local origin, the production of
which has been stimulated by the meeting itself ; and a fair number
of these may be reckoned on the side of gain. Again, it is true that
the original idea of a parade or march past of science, valuable enough
when the provinces heard or saw little of science, has become less
important now that provincial centres are to be found in almost every
large town in the country.        Nevertheless, the mere presence of some
of the leading men stimulates durmant powers and encourages rising
aspirations; and this perhaps all the more the case for the very
 reason that science and scientific names are no longer unknown.              That

56                        Anniversary Meeting.                   [Nov. 30.
most of the leading men have opportunities of meeting from time to
time, and for scientific purposes, is certainly true ; bat that they should
meet also on occasions when science is not too formal, is a thing which
has its uses.   And a concurrence     of minds more numerous and more
diversified than usual is sure to be fruitful of results. The whole
advantage    of these meetings, however, depends ultimately and funda
mentally on the presence of a strong scientific element, which, from
its own mere dignity and character, will repress all that is unworthy
and will leaven the whole lump.          Acting on this principle as a
scientific duty, many good men have attended these meetings ; and
although they may have approached them with some degree of
reluctance, few who during their attendance have taken their fair
share in the proceedings, have come away without having derived a
 more favourable impression than that with which tliey entered.
    Of such gatherings, the late meeting of the British Association at
York was, if I may be permitted to express an opinion, a pattern and
exemplar.     And although it cannot be expected that in every year
there will be so strong a muster as on the occasion of the fiftieth
anniversary, yet all well-wishers of the Association must feel that it
has entered upon its second half century with vigour and with
dignity, and that it now remains only for its future supporters to
maintain the high standard with which it has been handed down by
those who have gone before.
    It may be a matter of regret, althongh doubtless inevitable, that
the same causes which have affected the social, the intellectual, the
industrial, and the political life of our generation, and have made them
other than what they were, should affect also our scientific life ; but, as
a matter of fact, if science is pursued more generally and more
ardently than in former times, its pursuit is attended with more haste,
more bustle, and more display than was wont to be the case.           Apart
from other reasons, the difficulty, already great and always rapidly
increasing, of ascertaining what is new in natural science ; the liability
at any moment of being anticipated by others, constantly present to
the miuds of those to whom priority is of serious importance ; the
desire to achieve something striking, either in principle or in mere
illustration ; all tend to disturb the even flow of scientific research.
And it is perhaps not too much to say that an eagerness to outstrip
others rather than to advance knowledge, and a struggle for relative
rather than for absolute progress, are among the dangerous tendencies
peculiar to the period in which we live. I do not, of course, for one
moment mean to imply that this tendency universally prevails ; for in
Science, as well as in other pursuits, I believe that the best of the
present would well stand comparison with the best of the past, and
that there are nowadays men in the mid-stream of life who are as
little affected by the eddies and back-waters with which they are sur

rounded   as were the giants of former days.   Nevertheless the danger
is a real one and is to be met with at every tarn.
   But the part of Cassandra is neither agreeable to the player nor
welcome to the audience      ;    nor is it indeed necessary that I should play
 it ; for, even although what I have said be true, it is still, I trust, not
 the whole truth.        I have already spoken of noble exceptions ; but,
 although noble exceptions may go far to redeem the character of a
 nation or of a period, and example may have influences of which we
 hardly dream, yet for a general remedy         I    am more inclined to look to
 the natural course of events, and to what is often loosely spoken of as
 "things curing themselves."             Such a cure may perhaps come about
somehow on this wise.            So multitudinous are the workers in every
science, so numerous are the channels through which their discoveries
are chronicled, that it is becoming every year more difficult for even
the learned and the well read to say what is and what is not new, or
what has not been published before.                    Claims for novelty must,
therefore, as time goes on, be put forward with greater and greater
diffidence.     The only originality that can be safely claimed will be
originality on the part of the investigator ; and the question of absolute
priority must be left to the verdict of time and of that sifting process
by which ultimately all discoveries will find their proper places in the
Temple of Science.
    When this stage is reached, and we are even now approaching                   it,
the fever of to-day may in a great measure subside and give place to
a   more tempered, although still fervent, glow of aspiration.                    The
eagerness    and   haste  to  which    we have  become    almost   accustomed     may
be chastened by the reflection that questions               of priority are not to
be settled by a mere stroke of the pen, and that in the comparison of
rival claims the question of the quality of work will undoubtedly arise
and become interwoven with that of priority.                 And so, in the end,  it
may come to pass that a half-understood experiment                      or a hastily
drawn conclusion may           avail  less than ever    for  establishing a reputa
tion, and that, even for the purpose of winning the race,               it    may be
worth while to spend sufficient time in laying sure foundations and in
building a superstructure commensurate with that on which                  it  stands
and well proportioned in all its parts.
    The transference of the Natural History Collections of the British
Museum to the new building at South Kensington                is   still in progress.
It   ishoped that the building for the specimens preserved in spirits, as
well as the fittings for the zoological department, will be so far com
pleted as to allow of the moving of that department during the
autumn of 1882.           The lighting of the reading room by Siemens'
lamps     isso far  satisfactory, thatit    has been decided to keep that room
open in future until   8     p.m., instead of
                                            7    p.m.    This change, it   is  hoped,
will prove to be of substantial service to      a     large class of readers.

58                       A nniversary Meeting.                 [Nov. 30,
  - The Institution founded in 1851, under the title of the Government
School of Mines and Metropolitan School of Science applied to
Mining and the Arts, for the instruction of students in those branches
of Science which are indispensable to the Miner, the Metallurgist,
the Geologist, and the Industrial Chemist, has this year been organised
afresh, and, under its new title of the Normal School of Science and
Royal School of Mines, adds to its former functions the training of
teachers for the Elementary Science Classes under the Science and
Art Department, the multiplication of which, in recent years, is a
significant indication of the rapid spread of scientific instruction
throughout the country.
    The accommodation requisite for practical teaching being inadequate
in all cases and totally wanting in respect of many of the classes, in
the Museum of Practical Geology in Jermyn Street, and in the Royal
College of Chemistry in Oxford Street, all the instruction, except that
in Mining, has been transferred to the Science Schools at South
Kensington.      The staff of Professors and Lecturers has been in
creased, and provision has been made for the teaching of various
important subjects, such as Mathematics, Drawing, Botany, and the
Principles of Agriculture, which were either omitted, or insufficiently
represented, in the original programme of the school.
    Under its new organisation, the Normal School of Science and
Royal School of Mines will not merely supply from among its
associates persons highly qualified to apply the principles of science
to the Mining, Metallurgical, Chemical, and Agricultural industries of
the country, and properly trained science teachers ; but, through the
exhibitions attached to the yearly examinations of the Science and
Art Department, it will place within reach of promising young
students in all parts of the country, whose means do not enable them
to obtain the benefits of a University education, such a training as will
enable them to ti- n their natural abilities to account for the advance
ment of science and the improvement of its applications to industry.
 Under the latter point of view, the instruction given in the Normal
 School of Science will lead up to the special technical training of the
 Central Institute of the Guilds of the City of London.
    Under the auspices of the City and Guilds of London Institute,
further progrebs has been made during the past year in the promotion
of Technical Education. It will be remembered that the work at pre
 sent undertaken by the Institute embraces the establishment of a
 Technical Science School in Finsbury, a Technical Art School in
 Kenuiugton, a Central Institution or Higher Technical College in
 Kensington, the subsidising of existing institutions, affording facilities
 for Technical Instruction and the encouragement of existing classes
 in the manufacturing centres by the grants paid to teachers on the
 results of the Technological Examinations.

  1881.]                    President's Address.                         59
    In May last the foundation stone of the Finsbury College was laid
 by H.R.H. Prince Leopold, and the new building, which will afford
 accommodation for the teaching of applied Chemistry, Physics, and
 Mechanics, will be finished early in next year.      Notwithstanding the
 inadequacy of the present temporary accommodation, large numbers
 of students have availed themselves of the instruction afforded.      The
 principles of Electric Lighting and Transmission of Power, the making
 of Electrical Instruments, Coal Tar, and Spirit Distilling have been
 the snbjects that have been chiefly studied during the past session.
    Since October the classes that were previously conducted by the
Artizans' Institute have been transferred to the Finsbury College.
     The Institute has under its consideration the establishment of a
School for Applied Art in connexion with the Finsbury College.
Acting on the general principle that every Technical School of this
kind ought to provide, in addition to the general course of instruction,
as applicable to different industries, special courses applicable to the
staple industry of the district, the Council of the Institute are con
templating the establishment of classes in the Finsbury College
adapted to the educational requirements of those engaged in Cabinet-
making.      With this object it will be necessary to attach a School of
Design to   tho  College.
   The influx of pupils to the studios in Kennington have induced the
Council to vote a sum of money for the extension of the building in
which the Art School of this district is conducted.      These new build
ings are nearly completed, and will aflbrd accommodation        for classes
in Modelling, Design, and Wood Engraving.
   The building of the central institution, which is to be in the first
place a school for the training of technical teachers, has been com
menced.     The first stone was set in July last by H.R.H. the Prince of
Wales, who is now the President of the Institute.       The plans of this
building show accommodation for the teaching of the different branches
of Physics in their application to various industries, of Chemistry as
applied to trade purposes, and of Mathematics and Mechanics in their
application to Engineering.        A good engineering school, containing
workshops, well supplied with machinery and collections of mechanical
instruments and models, such as exist in numerous Continental cities,
seems likely to be obtained       for London on the completion of this
building.
   This Institute has done much towards       the encouragement of tech
nical  instruction in provincial    towns, where it is most needed, by its
system of   annual examinations.      In the examination held in May last
l,o63 candidates presented themselves, in 28 subjects, from 115 centres,
and of these 895 passed.         A close connexion is being established
between the several     technical schools which are being now opened in
 Lancashire   and    Yorkshire, and the City and Guilds of London

Institute.       The demands made upon the Institute by Chambers of
Commerce        in different parts of England satisfactorily indicate the
usefulness of this part of the Institute's work.
    The programme of Technological Examinations for 1881-82, just
issued, shows 32 subjects in which examinations may be held, some of
which are divided into four or five branches, so that they may be
better adapted to individual industries.           Whilst attention has in this
way been given to the details of different trades, the attempt has been
made to secure from candidates passing the Institute's examinations a
general knowledge of the principles of their subject and of the relation
of closely connected industries with one another.
    In order to secure in future efficient teachers, the Council of the
Institute have determined after March next not to register as teachers
any persons except those who have passed the Institute's Honours
Examination, or such as already possess special or distinct qualifica
tions.
    The interest which the subject of technical education is beginning
to arouse has led to the appointment by the Crown of a Commission
to inquire into the education of the industrial classes in England and
in other countries ; and the City and Guilds of London Institute is
represented on this Commission by Professor Roscoe, who, as Presi
dent of the Chemical Society, occupies a seat on the Executive Com
mittee, and also by Mr. Philip Magnus, its director and secretary.
The Commissioners are at present engaged in making a tour of inspec
tion in France, a section of them having already visited some of the
principal technical schools and factories in the north of Italy.
    In Meteorological Science the present year has been marked by the
publication of an important work,* by Professor Wild, of St. Peters
burg, on the Temperature of the Russian Empire, embodying, in
charts and tables, a great amount of information, hitherto either
inaccessible or existing only in scattered memoirs, relating to the
meteorology of the vast tracts of Northern Asia.               As an interesting
particular    result  it may   be  mentioned    that   Professor  Wild has trans
              "
ferred the Siberian pole of cold in winter           "  from the neighbourhood
of .Takutsk to a point somewhat further north, lying on the Arctic
Circle in (about) E. longitude 125°. At this centre of maximum cold,
round which the isotherms lie in fairly regular ovals, the mean tem
perature in January sinks as low as —54° Fahrenheit, the mean tem
perature at Jakutsk being 11° higher.                In close relation to the
phenomena exhibited by these charts, Professor Wild, in St. Peters
burg, has been led to study the connexion between areas of permanent
high or low mean pressure on the one hand, and areas of permanent
high or low mean temperature on the other; and he has found this

  connexion    to be of the same kind as that known to exist in the case
 of the  shifting areas of high or low pressure, and high or low tempera
 ture,  which determine the changes of weather.              M. Leon Teisserenc
 de   Bort, in  Paris,  has also   investigated   the same  subject.
     The Meteorological Office has completed during the year two works
of some interest, which are now ready for immediate publication. The
 first consists of tables of the Rainfall of the British Isles, prepared at
the request of the Council of the Office by Mr. G. J. Symons, F.R.S.
 These tables     include the monthly results recorded at 367 stations in
the United Kingdom, being all those for which it was possible to
obtain series of observations          maintained continuously during the last
fifteen years.       The second is a volume of charts (with an intro
duction and explanations) illustrating the meteorology of an ocean
district specially important to seamen — that adjacent to the Cape ot
Good Hope.          Some points of novelty are presented by the charts.
For example, anew form of " wind-rose," invented by Mr. F. Gallon,
F.R.S., has been employed, which offers some theoretical advantages
over those previously in use, being intended to represent, with geome
trical precision, the probability (deduced from the observations) that,
in a particular place and at a particular season, a wind blowing
between      any two given points of the compass will be experienced.
Again, for the first time in marine meteorology, the wind observa
tions have        been " weighted
                                       " with the view of neutralising the
tendency to over-estimate the frequency of adverse winds, which has
been found       to affect meteorological        charts injuriously.     The work
brings into clear relief the most interesting physical feature of the
district — one indeed already well known — the intermingling of hot
and cold water, brought by the Agulhas and the South Polar currents
respectively, and supplies strong evidence for the belief that this inter
mingling has a large share in producing the atmospheric disturbances
so common in the region in which it occurs.
    In my Address to the Society in 1879, I stated that an Inter
national Conference of a semi-official character had been held, with
the view of establishing for one complete year a circle of meteoro
logical observations round the Arctic regions of the globe.               Notwith
standing the lamented death of Lieutenant Weyprecht, the gallant
young discoverer of Franz Josef's Land, by whom the proposal had
l>een originated, it would seem that the efforts          of the Conference are
likely to be crowned with success.                 The following stations have
already     been    undertaken     by  different   Governments:      Point Barrow
and Lady Franklin's Bay in Smith's Sound, by the United States ;
 West Greenland, by Denmark ; Jan Mayen, by Austria; Mosxel Bay
 and Spitzbergen, by Sweden ; Bossekop, by Norway ; Nova Zembla,
 by Holland; the Mouths of the Lena,               by Russia. The Conference
 has also been led to hope that the Canadian Government may re

62                         Anniversary Meeting.                  [Nov.  30,
institute observations at Fort Simpson, and that the Government of
France may organise a simultaneous meteorological             expedition to
Terra del Fuego. It is arranged that the observations should begin
as soon as possible      after August 1, 1881, and should continue to
September    1, 1883.
   In astronomy, Mr. Gill has completed his discussion of the exten
sive series of heliometer measures of the parallax of Mars, which be
made at Ascension in 1877, and has deduced          the value 8"'78 for the
solar parallax, corresponding to a mean distance of 93,080,000 miles
from the earth to the sun. A value of the solar parallax has also
been   derived by Mr. D. P. Todd, from the American photographs of
the transit of Venus, 18~4.        The result for the parallax is 8"8883,
corresponding to a    mean   distance of 92,028,000 miles.
   A valuable contribution towards the determination of the moon's
physical libration has been made by Dr. Hartwig. From a series of
42 measures made with the Strassburg heliometer he derives values
for the physical libration and for the inclination of the moon's axis,
substantially confirming the results found by Wichmann, and recently
by Professor Pritchard.
   An addition to the small list of stars which have been found to have
a measurable parallax, has been made by Dr. Ball.         He finds that the
star Groombridge 1H18, which is remarkable for its large proper
motion, has a parallax of about one-third of a second, so that it is to be
considered one of the sun's nearest neighbours.        Dr. Ball has also re
determined the parallax of the double star 61 Cygni, his result being
0"8468, which agrees more nearly with Struve's value than with
BesseFs.
   The Cape    catalogue    of upwards of 12,000 stars is the outcome of
Mr. Stone's labours during nine years,       as Her Majesty's Astronomer
at the Cape, and is the most important catalogue of stars which has
yet been formed in the southern hemisphere.         Another important con
tribution to stellar astronomy has been made by Professor Ncwcomb,
who has recently prepared a catalogue of the places of nearly 1,100
standard stars compiled from the best authorities.
   In connexion with his photometric researches, Professor Pickering
has discussed the onuses of the variability of stars of short period.
Taking the various hypotheses which have been proposed, he finds that
for Algol and stars of that type the hypothesis of an eclipsing satellite
or cloud of meteors revolving round the star is the only one which
satisfies the observed phenomena.       In the case of /3 Lyrae and similar
variables  the fluctuations  of light would  be explained as due to rota
tion round the axis, the two hemispheres being of unequal brightness
and the form more or less elongated.          Professor Pickering has very
carefully investigated the conditions in each individual case, and has
brought together the most important facts bearing on the subject. It

  1881.]                    Presidents  Address.                          63
  maybe mentioned     that on Professor Pickering's initiative a committee
  of American astronomers has been formed to co-operate with European
  astronomers in selecting a series of stars to serve as standards        of
  stellar magnitude.
     The present   year has been remarkable for the appearance of two
  bright comets simultaneously visible to the naked eye. The first comet
  was first seen in the southern hemisphere before its perihelion passage,
  and buret upon our view in its full splendour soon after perihelion.
  The most important point in connexion with this comet was that
  photographs    of its spectrum were obtained by Dr. Hnggins and
  Dr. Draper.      The former found on his photographs two strong
  bright lines in the ultra8violet corresponding to a group in the
 spectra of compounds of carbon, and also a group of lines between G
 and h agreeing in position with another carbon-band.             The photo
 graphs also showed a continuous spectrum extending from F to some
 distance beyond H, on which the dark Fraunhofer lines were seen —
 an indication    that part of the light from comets is reflected solar
 light.
    In the visible portion, the continuous spectrum was so bright when
 the comet    was first seen after perihelion that it almost obliterated the
ordinary cometary bands.        These, however, became afterwards very
 conspicuous, and five bands were noted, which were found to coincide
sensibly with the carbon-bands as given by the flame of the Bunsen
burner. On the brightest band, three bright lines corresponding to three
Hues in the carbon-band were seen by several observers at Princeton,
U.S.      These observations show conclusively that the spectrum of
this comet is identical with the first spectrum of carbon, and not with
the second.
    In the telescope this comet showed striking changes from day to
day, and even, according to some observers, from hour to hour, and the
head was remarkable for its unsymmetrical appearance.         Another point
of interest is that the orbit presents a remarkable resemblance to that of
the great comet of 1807.        As, however, the period of this latter was
found by Bessel to be 1540 years, the question arises again, as in the
case of the comets of 1843 and 1880, whether there are not two
comets    travelling along the same path.
    The second bright comet was first discovered with the telescope, and
gradually increased in brightness till it became visible to the naked
eye, though     by no means so interesting an object as the preceding
comet.      Besides these two bright comets, several telescopic comets
have been discovered, raising the total for this year to eight.          The
last but one of these has proved to be a periodic comet, revolving in the
short period of about eight years.       It was discovered by an English
man, Mr. Denning, being the first instance of such a discovery in this
 country    for many years.

 04                       Anniversary Meeting.                  [Nov. 30,
    The work of the Royal Commission on Accidents in Mines during
the past year has been of such great interest, both from a scientific
and from a practical point of view, that    I venture to note at length
some notes upon it, furnished to me by our Fellow, Mr. Warington
 Smyth, the Chairman.
    A preliminary report was presented before the end of the Session
1881, drawing attention, under the chief heads of the subject, to the
facts and opinions elicited from the examination of a large number of
competent witnesses.
    Experimental inquiries, which will be the subject of a fnrther
report, have been instituted for the purposes of testing the various
safety-lamps in use, as well as the numerous modifications recently
proposed, and of determining the effect of coal-dust in causing or
aggravating explosions.      From time to time, also, experiments have
been made with a view to substitute, in the breaking down of coal,
some other means for the gunpowder-shots which have so often, by
their flame, caused the ignition of fire-damp.
                                               "
    The presence of a powerful " blower           of natural gas at the
Garswood Hall Colliery, near Wigan, with the facilities offered by the
proprietors, induced the Commission to erect suitable apparatus for a
long series of these trials, and now that it appears desirable to com
pare the results with what may be obtained in another district, and
with a differently constituted fire-damp, the whole of the apparatus is
in course of erection at a colliery in the Rhondda Valley, where a very
permanent "blower" offers similar advantages.
    In the course of the lamp experiments it came out very clearly, in
confirmation of statements before made, that the greatly augmented
ventilation in our larger modern collieries has put an end to the
fancied security of the simple Davy and Clanny lamps.           Their use
in fact, unless they be protected by some farther contrivance, is
attended with the most imminent risk when the velocity of a current
liable to be rendered explosive, exceeds six feet a second.       A high
degree of importance thus attaches to the comparative trials of lamps
in which the flame is sufficiently shielded against the impinging stream
of air, and those which have the property when immersed in an ex
plosive mixture, of rapidly quenching both the flame of the wick
and of the burning fire-damp.
    The terrible disaster which occurred in September, 1880, at the
Seaham Colliery, drew more anxious attention than ever to the
question of the part played by coal-dust, and a special reference
having been made by the Secretary of State for the Home Depart
ment to Professor Abel, C.B., the experiments at Garswood Hall
were largely extended.      Some of the results were very remarkable ;
the proportion of fire-damp present with the air may be so small
as to elude detection by the ordinary test of the carefully watched

                              President's Address.                         65
  flame in the safety-lamp, and yet the presence of dust in suspension
  will cause rapid ignition, or even explosion, in a degree varying with
  the proportion of gas and the velocity        of the current. Dust was
  employed    from different parts of the works of several collieries where
  it was suspected that this agent had borne a serious part in intensi
  fying and spreading explosions ; and it was found that some of the
  varieties were far more sensitive than others.      Certain kinds of dust,
 in themselves perfectly non-combustible,        were similarly tested, and
  proved to have an analogous effect in promoting explosion, even when
 the percentage of gas was exceedingly small.
     It is obvious from these facts that under certain conditions it is
 very important that a satisfactory indicator of minute proportions of
 fire-damp should be employed ; and the further experiments proposed
 to be carried out by the Commission will include a particular inquiry
 into this subject.
     The question of the feasibility of the introduction of the electric
 light into the workings of a colliery has been partially solved.        The
 Stanton Coal and       Iron Company were induced by the Commission to
make a trial of Mr. Swan's lamps in their Pleasley Colliery near
 Mansfield.      Not only the inset and main road, but some of the " long-
        "                                                                   A
wall       faces of work, were brilliantly lighted in this manner.
second experiment of the same kind has been carried out at the
Earnoch Colliery near Hamilton.
     The use and abuse of explosives in mining operations has in the
last few years formed a subject of much inquiry, especially with
 reference to the firing of shots in coal-seams liable to be invaded by
fire-damp.        A return to mere wedging in all cases, as proposed by
some     officials, would  be to ignore the advance of science as well as the
necessities caused by competition ; and the Commission hopes by
further examination, and especially by practical trials, to contribute
useful information to the solution of a difficult but important question.
    Among the applications of scientific apparatus, the employment of
the ingenious protected lime-light lamp, and of the portable breathing
arrangement of Mr. Fleuss, during the operations for re-opening of
parts of the Seabam Colliery, deserves especial notice.
    On the motion of Sir Frederick Bramwell, seconded by Dr. Allman,
it was resolved : — " That the thanks of the Society be returned to the
President for his Address, and that he be requested to allow it to be
printed."
    The President then proceeded to the presentation of the Medals : —

been one of the most distinguished leaders of the progress of chemistry,
and is now the most eminent of active French chemists.     The younger
generation of French chemists were, for the most part, his pupils.
TTia writings have been the medium by which most of the knowledge
of the more modern theories of chemistry has been disseminated in
France. His discoveries have been fruitful of the greatest results,
not merely in the way of enriching the science with a knowledge of
many previously unknown compounds and classes of compounds, but
more especially in extending and improving our knowledge of the
laws of chemical combination.
   It was he who first discovered compound ammonias containing
alcohol-radicals in the place of hydrogen — a family of compounds
which has since acquired enormous development.          It was he who
first made those remarkable alcohols called glycols, and thus gave the
key to the explanation of glycerine, erythrite, mannite, and the sugars.
Many other discoveries of his might be quoted ; but those who know
the influence which these two have exercised on the progress of
chemistry can feel no doubt that the author of them is deserving of
the highest scientific honour.
   A   Royal Medal has been awarded to Mr. Francis Maitland
Balfour, F.R.S. Mr. F. M. Balfour's investigations in embryology
and comparative anatomy have placed him, thus early in life, in the
front rank of original workers in these branches of science.         His
" Monograph upon the Development of Elasmobranch Fishes,"
published in 1878, embodies the results of several years' labour, by
which quite a new light has been thrown upon the development of
several important organs in the Vertebrata, and notably of the genito
urinary and nervous systems.     More recently Mr. Balfour has pub
lished a most important work on
                                    " Comparative Embryology " in two
large and fully illustrated volumes, which stands alone in biological
literature, not only as an admirable and exhaustive summary of the
present state of knowledge respecting the development of animals in
general, but by reason of the vast amount and the varied character of
the original researches which are incorporated in its pages.
    A Royal Medal has been awarded to the Rev. John Hewitt Jellett,
 F.R.S., Provost of Trinity College, Dublin.         Dr. Jellett is the
author of various papers on pure and applied      mathematics   ; but the
award is more directly connected with his invention of the analyser,
 known by his name, and for the elaborate optico-chemical researches
which he has made with it.
    This analyser was introduced by its inventor into the instrument by
which he has carried on his researches on the state of combination of
 mixed solutions, as evidenced by the changes in their power of rotating

the plane   of polarisation consequent upon a change in the propor
tion of the active ingredients which enter into the solution.           This
is a problem      towards the solution of which ordinary chemical
methods can contribute but little.       A single instance will suffice to
give an idea of the nature of the results.        It is known that quinine
forms with many acids two series of salts, one having twice the
quantity of acid of the other for the same quantity of base, while
with other acids only the less acid salt has been obtained ; so that the
ordinary chemical methods fail to give evidence of the existence of
the more acid salt.       Now, by examining the rotatory power of a
solution of a given quantity of base with different doses of acid,
Dr. Jellett was able to obtain evidence of the existence of two, and
but two, salts of the base, no matter whether the acid were or were
not one which yields two crystallisable salts.         A slight deviation in
the amount of rotation when the more acid salt began to be formed
in tolerable quantity, from what it ought to have been, on the supposi
tion that the whole of the acid introduced was combined with the
quinine, was naturally attributed to a slight partition of the acid
between the base and the solvent, regarded as a feeble base ; but the
smallness of the deviation indicated that a solution of the more acid
salt mainly existed as such, and that it was not, as some had supposed,
decomposed into free acid and the less acid salt.
    The Davy Medal has been awarded to Professor Adolf Baeyer,
who was already known as the anthor of many masterly researches
in organic chemistry, among which those on uric acid and on
mellitic   acid deserve    special  mention, before his latest and most
remarkable discovery.       The process for the artificial formation and
manufacture of indigo is the result of long-continued efforts, directed
by singularly clear and accurate views of the order and mode of
combination of its constituent elements, and of the conditions requisite
for obtaining reactions indicated by theory.
    The Statutes relating to the election of Council and Officers were
 then read, and Mr. Kempe and Mr. McLachlan having been, with
 the consent    of the Society, nominated Scrutators, the votes of the

      Report of the Kew Committee          for  the  Year ending
                          October 81, 1881.
   The operations of the Kew Observatory, in the Old Deer Park,
Richmond, Surrey, are controlled by the Kew Committee, which is
constituted as follows :
                General Sir E. Sabine, K.C.B., Chairman.
  Mr. De La Rue, Vice-Chairman. I Vice-Adm. Sir G. H. Richards,
  Capt. W. de "W. Abney, R.B.             C.B.

   Prof. G. C. Foster.                 Lieut.-General W. J. Smythe.
  Mr. F. Galton.                       Lieut.-Gen. R. Strachey, C.S.I.
                             Mr. E. Walker.
   Lieut.-Gen. Sir J. H. Lefroy, K.C.M.G., having been appointed
Deputy-Governor of Tasmania, withdrew from the Committee in
December, and Capt. Abney was elected to fill the vacancy.
   The work at the      Observatory may be considered      under seven
heads : —
   1st. Magnetic observations.
   2nd. Meteorological observations.
   3rd. Solar observations.
   4th. Experimental, in connexion with any of the above        depart
           ments.
   5th. Verification of instruments.
   6th.  Aid to other Observatories.
   7th. Miscellaneous.
                       I. Magnetic Observations.
   On January 10 the magnetograph needles were dismounted and
re-magnetized, having become weakened by age. Since then work has
continued as usual.
   The scale values of all the instruments were re-determined in
January, in accordance with the practice of previous years, both
before and after the re-magnetization of the needles.

   Two magnetic storms, or periods of considerable disturbance of the
needles, have      been registered during the year    ; one on the night    of
January 31st, and a second on September 12th and 13th, both being
accompanied by brilliant auroral displays.
   The monthly observations with the absolute instruments have been
made regularly, and the results are given in the tables forming
Appendix I of this Report.
   Professor W. Grylls Adams has during the year continued his in
vestigations on the comparison of magnetic disturbances in various
localities.    In addition    to the curves mentioned   in last year's Report,
he   has   received     through    the Committee several   supplies of copies
of selected traces from Mauritius, Toronto, and Zi-Ka-Wei, near
Shanghai, as well as from those Observatories already enumerated
in the last report.
   Professor Adams has embodied the results of his researches in two
papers read before the British Association, and in a Friday evening
lecture delivered at the Royal Institution.
   The discussion of the great magnetic storm of January 31st, 1881,
having been undertaken by Dr. H. Wild, of the Central Physical
Observatory, St. Petersburg, such particulars respecting that occur
rence as the Committee possessed were transmitted to that gentleman.
   The magnetic instruments have been studied, and a knowledge of
their manipulation obtained by Lieutenant Moore, R.N., Dr. Brauner,
and Dr. Monckman.
  Information on matters relating to terrestrial magnetism and various
data have been supplied to Professor W. G. Adams, Dr. Atkinson,
Dr. Buys Ballot, Mr. Gee, Mr. J. E. H. Gordon, Rev. F. Howlett,
M. Mascart, Dr. Miiller, Professor Balfour Stewart, and Dr. Wild.

                     II.   Meteorological Obsebvationb.
   The several self-recording instruments for the continuous registra
tion respectively of, atmospheric pressure, temperature, and humidity,
of wind (direction and velocity), sunshine, and rain have been main
tained in regular operation throughout the year.
   The standard eye observations made five times daily, for the con
trol of the automatic records, have been duly registered through the
year, together with the additional daily observation at 0 h. 8 m. p.m.
in connexion with the Washington synchronous system.                    The
6 h. 45 m. p.m. observation,          for the second synchronous system
organized by M. Mascart, Djrecteur dn Bureau Central Meteorologique,
Paris, was discontinued on December 31st.
   The tabulation of the meteorological         traces has been regularly
carried on, and copies of these, as well as of the eye observations,
with notes of weather, cloud, and sunshine have been transmitted
weekly to the Meteorological Office.

    In compliance with a request made by the Meteorological Council
 to the Kew Committee, the Observatories            at Aberdeen, Armagh,
 Falmouth, Glasgow, Oxford (Radcliffe), Stonyhurst, and Valencia,
 have been visited as on former occasions, and their instruments
 inspected by Mr. Whipple during his vacation.
    With the concurrence of the Meteorological Council, weekly abstracts
 of the meteorological results have been regularly forwarded to, and
 published by
                   " The Times," " The Illustrated London News," and
 " The Torquay Directory," and meteorological data have been
                                                                     supplied
 to the editor of " Symons's Monthly Meteorological Magazine," the
  Secretary of the Institute of Mining Engineers, Messrs. Buchan,
  Eaton, Greaves, Gwilliam, McDonald, Rowland, and others.

                         Report   of the Kew Committee.                   83
      Electrograph. — This instrument has been in continuous action
   through the year, with the exception of a few occasions during the
   severe  frost of last winter.
     In July the instrument was dismounted, and a fresh supply of acid
  placed in the jar, the charge-keeping properties of which had become
  slightly deteriorated.
     The tabulation of the curves given by this instrument has at last
  been commenced, and a suitable glass scale, arranged on a plan
  devised    by Mr. Whipple, having been constructed by Mr. Baker, the
  average hourly tension of atmospheric electricity at the collector of
  the Electrograph has been determined for every hour in 1880, except
 in those cases where registration failed either from disturbance or
 instrumental     defect.
     From these values the daily, monthly, and annual means have been
 deduced, together with other facts bearing on the relations existing
 between atmospheric electricity and different meteorological           phe
 nomena.       Some results of this investigation were by permission of
 the Meteorological Council submitted by the Superintendent to the
 Meeting of the British Association at York, in a paper which has
since been ordered by the General Committee to be printed in extenso
 among their Reports. The expense of the tabulation was defrayed by
a special grant from the Meteorological Council.
                            III.  Solar Observations.
    The only solar work done at        Kew during the past year has been the
regular     maintenance of the eye observations of the sun, after the
method of Hofrath Schwabe, as described in the Report for 1872.
These have been made on 187 days, in order to preserve the continuity
of the Kew records of sun-spots.           The sun's surface was observed to
be free from spots on three of those days.
    A small portable 2J in. refracting telescope, with a magnifying
power of 42 diameters, is used by the observer.
    Transit Observations. — Ninety-four observations have been made of
sun-transits, for the purpose of obtaining correct local time at the
Observatory : 126 clock and chronometer comparisons have also been
made.
    In addition to these a considerable number of star transits have
been observed in connexion with the pendulum operations in progress
during the autumn of 1881.
                           IV.   Experimental   Work.
     Winstanley's   Recording    Radiograph. — This instrument, designed for
the purpose     of registering continuously the amount of radiation from
the   sky, by mechanical means, upon a sheet of blackened paper, still
                                                                  G 2

remains at the Observatory, but having been accidentally deranged, it
has not been at work for some months.       The inventor being abroad it
has not been possible to place it in re-adjustment.
   Nephoscopes.
                 — Experiments have been made with several forms of
nephoscope designed by Mr. F. Galton, and also with a new cloud-
camera, designed by the Superintendent.
                                  — Experiments have been continued
   Exposure     of Thermometers.
throughout the year at the Observatory, with the view of determining
the relative merits of different patterns of thermometer screens.    For
this purpose there were erected in 1879 on the lawn a Stevenson's
 screen, of the ordinary pattern, and a large wooden cage, containing
 a Wild's screen, of the pattern employed in Russia.       Each of these
screens contains a dry and a wet bulb thermometer, and a maximum
 and minimum, all of which are read daily at 9 a.m. and 9 p.m., their
 indications being compared with those of the thermograph at the same
 hours. A third portable metal screen, designed by Mr. De La Rue
 for use on board Light-ships, which contains a dry bulb thermometer
 only, is also carried into the open air by the observer, and read at the
same time as the fixed instruments.
    The cost of these experiments is borne by the Meteorological
 Council.
    Glycerine Barometer. — This instrument, devised      and erected by
Mr. Jordan, has remained in successful operation throughout the year.
In compliance with the request of the inventor, it has been con
tinuously observed five times daily, in conjunction with the mercurial
 barometer.
    Mr. Jordan has been supplied with copies of the observations,     but
the Committee have not yet, however, been informed of the results
of these comparisons.
   Pendulum Experiments. — In March, the Committee received a
 communication from the Council of the Royal Society, calling their
 attention to the fact that the invariable pendulums deposited in the
 Loan Collection of scientific instruments at South Kensington, could
 not be considered as in the custody of the Committee, and in conse
 quence the Science and Art Department was requested to return the
 instruments to the Observatory. They were accordingly received on
 the 15th of June.
    Subsequently an application was received from Major Herschel,
 R.E., F.R.S., by authority of the India Office, for permission to make
 certain experiments with the pendulums, and for the loan of the
 instruments, with their accompanying appliances, with facilities for
 prosecuting the experiments at the Observatory.
    These requests were granted, and since the beginning of September
 operations have been continuously carried on, both in the Pendulum
 Room and in the Experimental House at Kew.

                        Beport of   the  Kew Committee.                   85
   The Indian Government will defray all expenses that may            be  in
curred in the prosecntion of the experiments.
                      V. Verification of Instruments.
   The following magnetic instruments have been verified,          and their
constants have been determined : —
        A  set of Self-recording   Magnetographs for the Nice Observa
             tory.
        A Unifilar    Magnetometer for Casella.
        Three Dip Circles for Casella.
        A pair of Dipping Needles for Elliott Brothers.
   There have also been purchased on commission and verified : —
        A Unifilar    Magnetometer and Dip Circle for Professor Tacchini,
             Rome.
        A Unifilar    Magnetometer and Dip Circle for Professor Perard,
             Liege.
        A Dip Circle for Capt. Hoffmeyer, Copenhagen.
        A Dip Circle for Professor Malmberg, Stockholm.
        A Pair of Dipping Needles for the Colaba Observatory.
        A Dip   Needle for Senhor Capello, Lisbon.
   The number of meteorological       instruments verified continues still to
increase, having been in the past year as follows : —
          Barometers,    Standard                               59
                 „       Marine and Station                    109

                                        Total                6085
  Besides these, 36 Deep-sea Thermometers have been tested, 17 of
which were subjected in the hydraulic press, without injury, to
pressures exceeding three and a half tons on the square inch, and 18
Thermometers have been compared at the freezing-point of mercury,
making a total of 6139 for the year.
   Duplicate copies of corrections have been supplied in 20 cases.

 86                   Report of the Kew   Committee.
   Ten Standard Thermometers have also been calibrated and divided,
 and supplied to societies and individuals during the year.
   The following miscellaneous instruments have also been verified : —
           Hydrometers                                       47
           Anemometers                                        3

   There are at present in the Observatory undergoing verification,
8 Barometers, 395 Thermometers, and 7 Hydrometers.
   A considerable increase having taken place in the number of
 Sextants submitted for verification, the Committee, after due con
sideration, have withdrawn the old form of certificate of examination,
and substituted a more general statement of the efficiency of the in
strument, recognising in future two classes of sextant; Class A in
which the total error of the instrument, from any cause, nowhere
exceeds thirty seconds ; and Class B where the limit is a maximum
error of three minutes of arc.
   The schedule of fees payable for the verification of instruments
has been revised, and copies of the new scale, together with par
ticulars as to the transmission, &c., of instruments to and from the
Observatory for the purpose of comparison, have been widely dis
tributed amongst opticians and instrument makers.
   Standard Barometers. — From time to time comparisons have been
made between the two Welsh Standard Barometers, the old Royal
Society Standard, and Newman No. 34, the working Standard of the
Observatory. The Portable Standards of the Observatory have also
been employed in making comparisons of the Standard Barometers at
the Hydrographic Office, Admiralty, the University Museum, Oxford,
and the Boyal Engineering College, Cooper's Hill.
   A metal plate, engraved with an inscription stating the history of
the old Royal Society Standard Barometer, and giving details of the
method employed in filling it on the occasion of its recent repair, has
now been affixed to the instrument.
   The large difference formerly observed in the heights of the mer
curial column in the flint and crown glass tubes of this barometer, has
not been found to exist in the refilled tubes, and the mean difference
between their indications is now less than O'OOl inch.
   Standard Thermometers. — The Committee has exchanged Standard
Thermometers with the Johns Hopkins University, U.S.A., Professor
Rowland having on the occasion of his recent visit to this country

                      Report of the Kew    Committee.                  87
 presented  the Observatory  with a Standard — Baudin 7835 — which he
 has compared   very closely with his other standard instruments.
    The Committee has received very gratifying testimony as to the
 accuracy of the Standard Thermometers constructed at the Obser
 vatory. In a paper contributed to the
                                          " American Journal of Science,"
 Dr. Leonard Waldo, of the Winchester Observatory, Yale College,
 U.S.A., remarks that after a critical examination of three Kew
 Standard Thermometers, in which every degree was separately mea
 sured, entailing no less than 2,300 micrometer readings, he came to
 the conclusion that their errors are practically insensible     and too
 small to be detected with certainty.
    Professors Thorpe and Riicker have also been engaged in testing
very minutely three similar instruments made for them at Kew.           In
a paper read at York before the British Association, Professor Riicker
stated " they had subjected the, Kew Thermometers to the most
rigorous test possible, and they were able to announce that in one in
strument the errors left, after the application of Welsh's method of
calibration and graduation, were not greater than four thousandths of
a degree Centigrade, and in no case did they much exceed one-
hundredth of a degree. As it is impossible to read on these thermo
meters less than a hundredth of a degree with certainty, Welsh's
method as applied at Kew is almost perfect."
                        VI. Aid to   Observatories.
    Waxed Papers, fyc, supplied. — Waxed paper has been supplied to the
following Observatories : —
   Aberdeen, Adelaide, Armagh, Bengal (Meteorological Department),
Colaba,    Falmouth, Glasgow, Mauritius, Paris (Montsouris), Oxford
(Radcliffe), Utrecht, Stony hurst, St. Petersburgh.
   Anemograph Sheets have been sent to the Mauritius Observatory,
and
   Blank Magnetic Observation Forms have been supplied to
         Professor Reinold, Royal Naval College ;
         Professor Louis Perard, l'Universite de Li^ge ;
         Professor Poynting, Mason's Science College, Birmingham     ;
and   to Mr. Casella.
                            VII.  Miscellaneous.
   Loan Exhibition. — The instruments specified in the Report for 1876
still remain in charge of the Science and Art Department, South
Kensington, with the exception of the Invariable Pendulum Appa
ratus recently withdrawn, as already stated, and the few articles
mentioned in previous reports.
    Fog Prevalence. — At the request of the Meteorological Council the

 88                    Report of the Kew  Committee.
 Meteorological Registers of the Observatory were searched from       1843
to the end of 1880, and an enumeration made of all the observations
of fog and mist recorded in them.       The cost of the examination was
defrayed by     the Council.
    Lost Journals. — On going through the books of the Observatory for
the purpose of compiling the above-mentioned         tables, it was found
that the volumes containing observations made between January and
June 1845, and August 1848, and December 1853, were missing.
On making inquiry it was discovered that the volumes containing the
MSS. results for 1845 and 1849 to 1851 were in the library bequeathed
by the late Sir F. Ronalds to the Society of Telegraph Engineers and
Electricians, and the Council of that Society most courteously directed
these records to be restored to the custody of the Kew Committee,
which has been done.
   Further search has failed to bring to light any regular records of
observations made between April 1851, and January 1854 ; and it is
believed    that none were made during the interval which elapsed
between the discontinuance of the system of observations        organised
under the superintendence of Sir F. Ronalds and that established by
Mr. J. Welsh, after his own appointment as Superintendent.
   Complete specimen sets of curves from the various photographic
and autographic instruments in use at the Observatory have been
prepared and forwarded to the exhibitions of the
         Leeds Philosophical and Literary Society,
         Yorkshire Fine Art and Industrial Institution,
         Richmond Industrial and Fine Art Loan Exhibition, and the
         International Photographic Exhibition at Vienna.
   At   the latter exhibition  a silver medal was awarded to the Com
mittee for their exhibit.
   The Superintendent has, with the consent of the Committee, read
the following papers before the Meteorological     Society, all of which
have been published in the
                              " Quarterly Journal " of the Society : —
   1. " On the Variations of Relative Humidity and Thermometric
Dryness of the Air, with Changes of Barometric Pressure at the Kew
Observatory," vol. vii, p. 49.
   2.
       " On the Relative Frequency of given Heights of the Barometer
Readings at the Kew Observatory during the ten years 1870-79,"

   Workshop. — The several pieces of Mechanical Apparatus, such as
the Whitworth Lathe and Planing Machine, procured by Grants from

                       Report   of the Kew    Committee.                  89
  either  the Government Grant Funds           or the Donation Fund, for the
  nse  of the  Kew Observatory, have been kept in thorongh order, and
  many   of them are in constant, and others in occasional, use at the
  Observatory,    but the funds of the Committee do not allow of the
 employment of a mechanical assistant, although one is much needed.
     Library. — During the year the Library has received, as presents, the
 publications of
     13 English Scientific Societies and Institutions, and
     72 Foreign and Colonial Scientific Societies and Institutions.
     Ventilation Experiments. — The experiments on the ventilating power
 of cowls of different form by the Sub- Committee of the Sanitary
 Institute of Great Britain are still in progress in the wooden hut
 erected by the Institute near the Observatory, the experimental house
 lent by the Committee having been required for the testing of Mag-
 netographs and other purposes.
     Observatory and Grounds. — The buildings and grounds have been
kept in repair throughout the year, and the exterior woodwork has
been painted by the Board of Works.
     The basement of the building having been again flooded, a drain
has been laid across the park to the riverside to allow of flood-waters
flowing directly into the river instead of requiring to be pumped out
as has hitherto been necessary.
    The roofs of the Verification House and Magnetic Observatory have
been entirely re-covered with felt, and new gutters fitted, &c.
    No action having been taken by the Commissioners of Woods and
Forests with respect to the footpath across the park, its temporary
repair has, however, been carried on at the expense of the Committee.
                           Personal Establishment.
    The staff employed is     as follows : —
              G. M. Whipple, B.Sc, Superintendent.
             T. W. Baker, First Assistant.
             J. Foster, Verification Department.

              J. Dawson, Messenger and Care-taker.
    J.  W. Hawkesworth, H. Clements,          and  A. Dawson have resigned
their appointments during the year.

90                  Report  of the Kew   Committee.
   In  consequence of a case of illness of a contagions nature having
occurred in the care-taker's family, work was almost suspended in the
Observatory for some days in May, but the self -registering instruments
were maintained in action, so that no loss of records took place during
the time.
   Visitors. — The Observatory has been honoured by the presence
during the year of numerous visi tors, many of whom were foreigners.

Report of tlie Kew Committee. 91
92                    Report  of the Kew    Committee.
                             APPENDIX I.
Magnetic Observations made at the Kew Observatory, Lat. 51° 28' 6" N.,
    Long. 0" lm 15M W., for the year October 1880 to September 1881.
    The observations of Deflection and Vibration given in the annexed
Tables were all made with the Collimator Magnet marked K C 1, and
the Kew 9-inch Unifilar Magnetometer by Jones.
    The Declination observations have also been made with the same
Magnetometer, Collimator Magnets N D and N E being employed for
the purpose.
    The Dip observations were made with Dip-circle Barrow No. 33, the
needles 1 and 2 only being used ; these are 3| inches in length.
    The results of the observations of Deflection and Vibration give the
values of the Horizontal Force, which, being combined with the Dip
observations, furnish the Vertical and Total Forces.
    These are expressed in both English and metrical scales — the unit in
the first being one foot, one second of mean solar time, and one grain ;
and in the other one millimetre, one second of time, and one milligramme,
the factor for reducing the English to metric values being 0'46108.
    By request, the corresponding values in C.G.S. measure aro also given.
    The value of log tt2K employed in the reduction is 1*64365 at tem
perature 60° F.
    The induction-coefficient /* is 08000194.
    The correction of the magnetic power for temperature           t2 to an
adopted standard temperature of 35° F. is
                o8oooim^-3sHO8ooo.ooo^i3Oo-3s)'.
    The true distances between the centres of the deflecting and deflected
magnets, whem the former is placed at the divisions of the deflection-
bar marked 1-0 foot and 18 feet, are 18000075 feet and 18300097 feet
respectively.
    The times of vibration given in the Table are each derived fcom the
mean of 12 or 14 observations of the time occupied by the magnet in
making 100 vibrations, corrections being applied for the torsion-force
of the suspension-thread subsequently.
    No corrections have been made for rate of chronometer or arc of
vibration, these being always very small.
    The value of the constant P, employed in the formula of reduction
 ™=m'( 1-—

                 \
              r„V'
                   is -0800109.
    In each observation of absolute Declination the instrumental read
ings have been referred to marks made upon the stone obelisk erected
 1,250 feet north of the Observatory as a meridian mark, the orientation
 of which, with respect to the Magnetometer, was determined by the
 late Mr. Welsh, and has since been carefully verified.
    The observations have all been made and reduced by Mr. F. G. Figg.

      OBITUARY NOTICES OF FELLOWS DECEASED.
    James  Clebk Maxwell was born in Edinburgh, on the 13th of June,
 1831.    His father, who was brother to Sir George Clerk, of
 Pennicuiek, was at first known as John Clerk, but adopted the name
of   Maxwell on succeeding to an estate called Nether Corsock, which
had come into the Clerk family through the marriage of a Miss
Maxwell.      To this estate he added, by purchase, that of Glenlair, the
name of which became afterwards closely associated with that of his
son.
    James  Clerk Maxwell's boyhood did not at first give much promise
of distinction.     He was a quiet and not very sprightly child, though
much given to reading, drawing pictures chiefly of animals, and
constructing geometrical models.         At the Edinburgh Academy to
which he was       sent, he took no leading position among his school
fellows   till about the age of thirteen, when his mental faculties
began to develop rapidly, so that he was soon in every department
among the foremost of his contemporaries.         At this school he made
the acquaintance     of Professor Tait, the present occupant of the Chair
of Natural     Philosophy in Edinburgh University; an acquaintance
which, cemented as it was by kindred pursuits and interests, ripened
into a close and lasting friendship.
   From the Academy he passed to the University of Edinburgh,
where,   in 1847, he attended the lectures of Kelland and Forbes. For
the next two or three years he had the privilege, to him invaluable, of
using the class apparatus in private experiments.         What was the
nature of some of those experiments           we may conjecture from a
perusal of his paper on Elastic Solids, written during this time, in
which he describes some experiments made with the view of verifying
the deductions of his theory in its applications to optics.
   This paper was read to the Royal Society of Edinburgh on Feb
ruary 18, 1850, and cannot but be regarded as a wonderful pro
duction when we consider the age of its author. This was the third
paper which Maxwell had addressed to the same Society : the first,
" On
       the Description of Oval Curves and those having a Plurality of
Foci," was read for him by Forbes in 1846 ; the second, under the
title "The Theory of Rolling Curves," was presented by Kelland in
1849.     All these papers, therefore, were written before he came into
residence as an undergraduate at Cambridge in October, 1850.
    While an undergraduate at Cambridge, Maxwell carried on his
                                                                  6

                                        ii
studies in a leisurely manner without producing, or at least without
publishing, any original work. He became in due course a scholar of
the College.      He was also elected member of a literary club, coming
thereby in contact with some of the most accomplished of his con
temporaries.
     In January,     1854, he took the degree of B.A., being Second
Wrangler,      but  equal with the Senior Wrangler in the subsequent
examination for the Smith's Prizes.
     Shortly after taking his degree, he produced a memoir
                                                                     " On the
Transformation of Surfaces by Bending."             By bending a surface is
meant
           "  a continuous change of the form of the surface without
extension or contraction of any part of it," and the problem Maxwell
 set himself was to discover some method at once simple and general
 in its application for the measurement of the change in question.
 Besides its main purpose, which was to develop clearer ideas of the
 theory of bending, there are incidentally scattered through it good
 expositions of many points in the geometry of surfaces, as, for
 instance, the discussions on curvature and the deduction of Gauss's
 and other expressions for specific curvature.
      Up to this point we have directed attention to Maxwell's papers in
 the order in which they were published, there being a special interest
  attaching to them on account of the very early period of life at which
  they were written.       It will be convenient, however, to consider his
  published papers under some sort of classification, and this we pro
  pose to do further on ; in the meantime the leading events of his life
  subsequent to 1854 may now be briefly recorded.
      In 1855 he was elected to a fellowship at Trinity, which he retained
  until his marriage in 1858. He was, however, subsequently elected
   to an honorary fellowship, a distinction which the College confers only
   upon the most gifted of her sons.          The latter honour was shared
   on the same occasion by     Dr. Lightfoot, the present Bishop of Durham,
   the late Mr. Spedding, editor of Bacon's works, and Professor Cayley.
       In 1856 he was appointed Professor of Natural Philosophy in
   Marischal College, Aberdeen, where he continued till that College was
   united to her rival, King's College, and formed into what is now known
   as the University of Aberdeen.
       In 1858, he married Katherine Dewar, daughter of the Principal
    of Marischal College.
       During his tenure of the Aberdeen Professorship the subjects which
    appear to have engaged most of his attention were the Theory of
    Colours and the Stability of Saturn's Rings, his essay on the latter
    subject obtaining for him the Adams Prize.          He also continued his
    study  of Electricity, and  in 1859    we have the  first evidence that he
    was working at the Kinetic Theory of Gases.
       In 1860, after the union of the Colleges        in Aberdeen, Maxwell

                                      iii
obtained the    Professorship of Natural Philosophy and Astronomy
in King's College, London.
   While holding this office he produced some of his most valuable
electrical papers,     as well as two others on Elasticity.            During
the same period he took a very prominent part            in  the  experiments
organised  by  a  Committee   of the  British  Association   for the  determi
nation of electrical resistance in absolute measure, and for placing the
units of electrical measurements on a satisfactory basis.          The experi
ments were conducted in the Laboratory of King's College upon a
plan due to Sir W. Thomson.            On this occasion Maxwell worked in
conjunction with Professors Balfour Stewart and Fleeming .Tenkin,
and the results were contained in a report to the British Association
in 1863.
   Maxwell continued in London until his father's death in 1865, when
he determined to reside on the Scotch estates to which he had suc
ceeded, and resigned his professorship.
   For some years after this he led a quiet life at Glenlair, devoting
himself chiefly, we may conjecture, to the composition of his Treatises
on Heat and on Electricity and Magnetism.              The most important
memoirs from his pen about this period were on the Dynamical Theory
of Gases, read to the Royal Society in 1866.
   In 1871 he was elected to the newly-created chair of Experimental
Physics in the University of Cambridge.             His first duties were to
plan and superintend the building of the Cavendish Laboratory, which,
with appropriate apparatus, was a gift to the University from the
Chancellor, the Duke of Devonshire.           The admirable arrangements of
this building were designed and carried out by Maxwell.            In October,
1871, he delivered an introductory lecture, in which he made some
very valuable observations on scientific education and the advantages
afforded by the study of experimental physics, especially to that class
of students in Cambridge which has produced so many distinguished
mathematicians.       Addressing such students in particular, he warned
them of the preliminary         difficulties they would have to face in
attempting   to combine   experimental practice with theory, but suggested
at the same time motives which should encourage them to persevere
in their efforts.
   Besides the duties directly incumbent on a Professor of Physics, the
preparation of treatises on the subjects of his chair now engaged
Maxwell' s attention. " The Theory of Heat," the first edition of
which appeared in 1871, was at once hailed as a beautiful exposition
of a comparatively new and interesting subject.           This work is indeed
 a model of scientific style, almost unique in the freshness                and
 simplicity of   its expositions,  and    possessing altogether    a charm for
 the student of physical science, such as few other works of the
 kind are capable of imparting.            The Treatise on Electricity and
                                                                     b 2

                                      iv
 Magnetism was published in 1873 ; an original and splendid work,
 destined, it is not rash to predict, to give colour and direction to our
 speculations on these subjects for many years to come.
    Nor must we omit another species of work always performed by
 Maxwell kindly and conscientiously, professorial work, surely, of the
 very highest kind, that, viz., of reading and reporting on papers
 contributed to learned societies by young aspirants to scientific fame.
 This kind of work, of which much fell to Maxwell's share, is but little
 known to the outside world, but involves when carefully performed a
 vast expenditure of time and trouble even on the part of the most
 accomplished specialist.
    Besides performing these various duties,       Maxwell took an active
part in conducting the general business of the University, serving on
the University Council, and otherwise, but especially in effecting
those changes in the mathematical studies of Cambridge, which may
be said to have amounted at this time almost to a revolution.           In
accomplishing    this, his published treatises already referred to bore  in
themselves a most important part, but the active share he took in
drafting the scheme of the new examination, and the admirable ques
tions he constructed in his capacity of examiner, no less contributed
to the desired changes which were thus, thanks in a great measure to
his sagacity, gradually and skilfully effected.
    The direct influence of Maxwell on Cambridge studies began to be
felt in 1866, when he filled the office of Moderator in the Mathematical
 Tripos. Maxwell's questions infused fresh life into the Cambridge
Tripos, and, therefore, into the University studies, by the number of
original ideas and new lines of thought opened up by them, thus pre
paring for the change of system in 1873, when so many interesting
subjects were added to the examination.
    From 1871 to 1879, Maxwell's pen was incessantly busy.              He
wrote numerous more or less important mathematical papers, as well
as a great many essays and reviews, to be found in the pages of
" Nature." He also contributed several interesting articles to the
"
   Encyclopaedia Britannica."
    Of his papers published during this period, those which probably
rank highest in point of importance are the two memoirs connected
with the Kinetic Theory of Gases. Another undertaking in which
he was long engaged, and which, though it proved to be exceedingly
interesting, entailed a great deal of labour, was the editing of the
" Electrical Researches " of the Hon. Henry Cavendish. This work,
published in 1879, has had the effect of increasing the reputation of
Cavendish, disclosing as it does the unsuspected advances which that
acute physicist had made in the theory of Electricity, especially in
the measurement of electrical resistance.      The work is enriched by a
variety of valuable notes, in which the editor has sought to examine

 Javendish's   views   and results by the light of modern theory and
 methods.    Especially valuable are the methods applied to the deter
mination of the electrical capacities of conductors and condensers, a
subject in which Cavendish himself showed considerable skill, both of
a mathematical and experimental kind.
   During the later months of 1878, and the beginning of 1879,
Maxwell's health was not good, but no apprehensions of anything
serious were felt by his friends.         In the month of May of the latter
year   he looked  very  ill.    Hopes   were   entertained, however, that when
he returned to the bracing air of his country home he would soon
recover.    But it was not to be. He lingered through the summer
months at Glenlair, with no signs of improvement,                     his spirits
gradually sinking.      As    a  last resource   he   was brought  back  to Cam
bridge in October that he might be under the charge of his favourite
physician, Dr. Paget.           Nothing, however, could be done for his
malady, and, after a painful illness, he died on the 5th of November,
1879, in his 49th year.
   It is difficult to convey a correct impression of the variety and
extent of Maxwell's information on all sorts of subjects.            Knowledge
of every kind was interesting to him, and there were few topics of
conversation to which he could not bring his own peculiar light. He
was almost as much at home with the students of philosophy and
theology as with those of physics. But if there was one subject more
than another in which his conversation was always interesting, it was
the literature of his own country, his acquaintance with which, and
especially with English poetry, was remarkable alike for its extent,
its exactness, and the wide range of his sympathies.                 His critical
taste, founded as it was on his native sagacity, and a keen appreciation
of literary beauty, was so true and discriminating that his judgment
was in such matters quite as valuable as on mathematical writings.
   He wrote often in verse, chiefly poetical epistles to intimate friends,
and occasional epigrams, but none of these have been published.              The
published pieces   are few   in number,   all dealing  with some scientific move
ment, speculation or incident of the hour, and all conceived in a spirit
of happy good-hnmoured banter. With the exception of "Notes on the
President's Address," British Association 1874, when Dr. Tyndall was
                                       " Blackwood," these
President, which appeared in                                   pieces are to be
found    in the pages of " Nature," under the signature                   The in
vention of this signature is due to Professor Tait, in whose work on
Thermodynamics, one of the equations of the subject is written in the
      dp
fornv|j= JCM, the right hand side of the equation              being Maxwell's
initials.
   The list of Maxwell's published memoirs and writings of every kind,

                                      vi
exclusive of treatises, is a long one, numbering over 100 papers, many
of which contain speculations of a profound character, worked out
with elaborate     details  of calculation.  They treat of a variety of
subjects, the most important of which are — (1.)      Electricity and Mag.
netism ; (2.) The Kinetic Theory of Gases; (3.) Colour Perception ;
(4.) Dynamics, including Astronomical Physics ; (5.) Elasticity ;
(6.) Optics. The two first named attracted more of his attention than
the others, and his writings on them form a sort of continuous series
in which we can follow the history of his ideas so as almost to trace
their gradual development.
   Thus, his first memoir on Electricity, entitled " On Faraday's Lines
of Force," possesses an interest apart from its intrinsic value, contain
ing as it does the germs of the theories and methods which reached
their full growth in his great treatise on Electricity and Magnetism.
This memoir is in two parts, differing in object and treatment. Whilst
the first half aims at a vivid representation of Faraday's conception
of lines of electric and magnetic force, the second is a mathematical
exposition of what Faraday calls the electrotonic state of bodies, and
an analytical investigation, based on Faraday's laws, of the electro
motive forces acting on a conductor due to the motion of magnets or
currents of electricity outside of it.
   Faraday's doctrine that electric and magnetic effects are conveyed
by a medium and not by action at a distance, found in Maxwell an
ardent believer, who set himself the task of searching out by what
kind of mechanism this is accomplished.          His first attempt at an
explanation is contained in a series of papers in the
                                                            " Philosophical
Magazine," 1861-62.        Beginning with magnetic phenomena, he points
out that a medium transmitting magnetic action must be under a
stress in which there is excess of pressure in all directions perpen
dicular to the lines of force, in other words, a stress consisting of a
tension in the direction of the line of force combined with a hydro
static pressure.     A stress of this character would be produced by a
system of molecular vortices, the axes of which are in the direction
 of the lines of force. A similar representation may be made of the
stress due to the magnetic action of electric currents.
    Taking, then a system of such vortices, he finds that the most general
 form of the expressions for the force components, due to the vortices at
 any point of the medium, is identical with that which would arise from
 magnets and electric currents. In the course of the work the magnetic
 force is identified with the velocity of the vortex, and the coefficient of
 magnetic induction is ir times the density of the medium, or n=vp.
 The chief difficulty is in the geometrical conception of the motion of
 the vortices, two parallel vortices moving in opposite directions in
 those parts where they are contiguous.          Maxwell gets over this
 difficulty by supposing that the vortices are separated by layers of

                                        vii
                            "                      "
                                          in mechanism,
particles revolving, like   idle wheels                                   each on its
own axis, in directions opposed to those of the vortices.                  The motion
of those particles he identifies  with electric currents in the medium,
and the   description  of  how, by this mechanism, induced currents are
originated, forms an interesting part of the theory.         The electro
motive forces, that is, the forces on the particles from the vortices, are
then found in the most general case of a medium in motion, the
                                                         " Electricity and
expressions being identical with those given in the

   Turning next to Statical Electricity,        we consider a dielectric
                                                       if
under inductive action, we may conceive the electricity in each of the
particles described above to be displaced, so that one side of the
particle is positive and the other negative, the total quantity remain
ing the same.     The general effect on the dielectric will, therefore, be
a  displacement     of the electricity, which will disappear when the
exciting cause disappears.      We have here, then, something analogous
to the phenomena exhibited by an elastic body under a state of stress,
but recovering its form when the stress       removed.
                                                   is
   If we denote the displacement by on this analogy the force will be
                                              h,
given by an equation of the form R=— 4nrE2          where   h,  a constant

depending on the dielectric. In addition to the properties already de
scribed of the cells constituting the vortices, we must now suppose the
substance of which they consist possessed of certain elastic resilience,
                                                        a
affecting by its tangential action the velocities of the particles, and in
its turn affected by them, being distorted and thrown into a state of
stress.   If, for simplicity, we omit the magnetic effects and suppose
the cell to be spherical in form, and that its coefficients of cubic
elasticity and rigidity are m and m, such being the relative values of

theory of Navier and Poisson,then          can be shown that E2 = mn.

Kohlrausch was 310,740,000 metres.           On comparing this with
Fizeau's value of the velocity of light in air, viz., 314,858,000 metres
per second, Maxwell drew the inference, that
                                                   " light consists in the
transverse undulations of the same medium, which          the cause of tho

electric and magnetic phenomena."      He also proved that the specific
inductive capacity of a dielectric varies as the square of the index of
refraction, and inversely as the coefficient of magnetic induction.

discovery    of the rotation of the plane of polarisation of polarised
light transmitted along the lines of magnetic forcei To the question,
how will the vibrations be affected by passing through a medium in a
state of rotation, Maxwell's results, as deduced from the theory, are
in close accordance with the experimental laws given by Verdet.
    Tho deductions drawn by Maxwell from his theory of Molecular
Vortices were of so striking a character that it was impossible his mind
could rest till he had still further examined their truth.        Accordingly
we find that in less than three years after their publication he presented
to the Royal Society a memoir, entitled " A Dynamical Theory of the
Electromagnetic Field/' This, the most splendid of all his papers,
places the theory of action through a medium on broader dynamical
principles, and traces the connexions between the various charac
teristic quantities of the subject, twenty in all, more simply and more
directly than he had formerly done. No adequate idea of this memoir
can be given in a short notice, for it contains matter enough, and on so
many different branches of the subject, to furnish the texts of many
ordinary papers.      The electromagnetic field is treated as a dynamical
system possessed of different kinds of energy and under the action of
various forces, the connexions between which are laid down with
 admirable clearness.     General mechanical principles are employed to
illustrate the significance of the laws discovered by Faraday, and from
 this aspect and without the hypothesis of any particular mechanism,
 the equations of the electromagnetic field are simply deduced.            But
 besides this there are many interesting side issues and expositions.
 Among these may be mentioned an experimental method of deter
 mining coefficients of induction by the electric balance, a theory of
 condensers, and the calculation of the self-induction and mutual induc
 tion of circular coils of wire. The part of the memoir, however, which
 excites the liveliest interest, is the investigation of the electromagnetic
 theory of light.    The two grand results previously established by the
 theory of vortices are again proved, but without the aid of somewhat
 doubtful hypotheses, while in addition a very substantial confirmation
 of Maxwell's views is obtained by the deduction of an equation for the
 velocity of wave propagation of electromagnetic disturbance in crystal
 lised media identical with that found by Fresnel for light.          Maxwell
 published a few years later the results of some experiments he had
 made to determine the ratio of the electric units.            His number is
 288,000,000.    Sir William Thomson found 282,000,000.              When we
 compare   these numbers    with   that  of  Weber   and Kohlrausch, it cannot
 be said that this quantity has yet been definitely determined.            The
 same is true of the velocity of light, the lowest value of which is
 298,000,000 metres per second.           We cannot, therefore, affirm with
 certainty  that  Maxwell's    inference     is correct, but there is a strong
primd facie presumption in its favour.

                                     iz
    The papers to which. we have    called attention by no means exhaust
 the list of Maxwell's contributions to electrical science, but they are
 the most important.       Most of what he wrote fonnd its proper
 place in the treatise on Electricity and Magnetism, which is in a
 great measure the outcome and product of his study of Faraday's
 researches and of his own speculations and labours;
    The theory that the properties of a gas are dne to the action of
 invisible molecules in rapid motion was propounded by several writers
 before Maxwell, and an explanation had been given of Boyle's law
 that the product of the pressure and volume of a gas is constant for
the same    temperature.
   Herapath had also given an explanation of diffusion, and Joule had
calculated the mean velocity of the molecules of various gases.       The
most important advance was, however, made by Claasius, whose first
          " On the kind of motion which we call heat " contains a
memoir                                                               very
clear exposition of the theory, and establishes that the vis viva of the
translatory motion of the gas does not represent the whole of the
heat in it.    His second memoir treats of the mean length of path
described by a molecule, and an expression is obtained for it in terms
of the average distance of the particles, and the distance between their
centres at collision.    The paper is valuable not so much on account
of this result, which in fact is different from that subsequently obtained
when the subject was more fully developed, but because it led the
way in bringing the kinetic theory fairly under the domain of mathe
matics.
   Maxwell perceived the importance of Clausius' work, and his first
paper contains an attempt to complete the investigation of the mean
path.    This paper, entitled " Illustrations of the Dynamical Theory
of Gases," was read before the British Association in 1859, and pub
lished in the
                   " Philosophical Magazine " of the following yuar.
Theories, mathematically developed, are here given of the internal
friction of gases, the conduction of heat through a gas, and the
diffusion of one gas through another.          One or other of these phe
nomena,     he thought, ought    to  yield an  accurate expression for the
length of the mean path.
   He supposes the molecules to be hard perfectly clastic spheres, and
investigates the laws of motion of a system of such molecules acting
on one another, only during impact.           His method is first of all to
discuss the motion of two molecules under their mutual action, and
having discovered the changes in their velocities and directions due
to an encounter, to apply what he has happily termed the statistical
method to determine the mutual action of two systems.         The methods
he employs for      this purpose, founded   on  the mathematical  theory of
probabilities, are remarkable for their elegance and for greater
generality than had been attempted by previous writers.

                                      X
   Maxwell's next contribution to the Kinetic Theory of Gases was the
Bakerian Lecture to the Royal Society in 1866, " On the Viscosity or
Internal Friction of Air and other Gases."         This is an account of
experiments      to determine the coefficient of gaseous friction.     He
employed     for  this purpose the oscillations of three disks placed be
tween fixed disks, and capable of motion about a common axis, the
quantity observed being the successive times of oscillation of the
movable disks. The chief results of this paper are, that the coefficient
of friction is (1) independent of the density of" the gas, (2) propor
tional to its absolute temperature.
    The second of these laws involves the rejection of the hypothesis
of the impact of hard elastic particles, leading as it does to propor
tionality of the square root of the temperature.        Accordingly, Max
well's next memoir " On the Dynamical Theory of Gases," following
 closely on the Bakerian Lecture, propounds a theory in closer agree
 ment with his experiments. Instead of hard elastic spheres, he now
 substitutes " small bodies or groups of smaller molecules, repelling one
 another with a force whose direction passes very nearly through the
 centres of gravity of the molecules, and whose magnitnde is repre
 sented very nearly by some function of the distance of the centres of
 gravity."     The necessity of supposing groups of molecules arises from
 the fact that, in a body of invariable form, the motions of its parts
 relatively to the centre of gravity consists entirely of rotations which
 the supposed force is incapable of generating, whereas a group of
 loosely-connected     bodies may have oscillations among themselves as
 well as rotations. That the energy of the system cannot be entirely
 translational had been previously pointed out by Clausius.
    In this memoir the statistical method is restated more fully, clearly,
 and systematically than before, but the only law of force between the
 molecules which leads to simple results is the inverse fifth power
 of the distance.      This law being adopted, the general equations re
 sulting  are  applied to a variety of problems : in (a), proving Dalton's
 law for the pressure of a mixture of gases; (5), explaining Graham's
 experiments on the diffusion of carbonic acid and air; (c), proving
  Graham's law for the interdiffusion of gases contained in different
 vessels connected by a very small hole; (d), finding the equilibrium
 condition as regards temperature for a mixture of gases, and again
  establishing Gay-Lussac's law ; (e), finding expressions for the specific
  heats of gases on Clausius' assumption that the whole energy bears a
  constant ratio to that of translation; (/), proving the laws of vis
  cosity, the same as those stated above; (<?), finding the viscosity of a
  mixture of gases, which, if not in close agreement with the results of
  Graham's experiments, at least exhibits the same general peculiarities ;
  (A), proving that in a column of air the temperature is independent
  of gravity ; (i), deducing an expression for the conductivity.

                                      xi
    It is impossible to read this comprehensive memoir without being
impressed by the boldness and sagacity of the author's genius, or
without admiring the simplicity of system he has introduced into a
subject, at first sight unapproachable from its difficulties.       At the
same time,     we must remember that        the hypothesis on which he
builds is a particular one, and could only be accepted on its being
found that the conclusions are borne out by facts.       Now the law that
the   viscosity varies as the absolute temperature has not been verified
by other experimenters on this subject.        It has been found that the
law of variation is a power of the temperature somewhat lower than
the first.    But though we cannot, therefore, accept the author's con
clusions without qualification, we must still regard his investigation
as a brilliant and determined effort to reach the true theory to which
it must form a close approximation.
   The methods employed by Maxwell were afterwards generalised by
Boltzmann, who succeeded in so modifying the proofs of many of the
theorems as to make them independent of any hypothesis as to the
nature of the encounter between the molecules.           Maxwell to some
extent adopted Boltzmann's more general treatment of the theory in
his next memoir (1878)
                            " On Stresses in Rarefied Gases arising from
Inequalities of Temperature ;" but he ultimately found himself com
pelled to fall back on his former special hypothesis.       In this memoir
he aims at an explanation of the forces producing motion in Crookes's
Radiometer.
   The statistical computation of the motion of a gas deprived of
that regularity which uniformity of temperature           permitted is by
no means easy, and accordingly the work forms an elaborate appli
cation of the principles developed in the paper of 1866.               It is
shown, however, that the effect of inequality of temperature is to
produce a stress in the gas whose components are comparable with
the forces necessary to produce the motion of the radiometer wheel.
If we take account only of the normal components of this stress it is
possible to frame an explanation of that motion by their agency.
When, however, the general equations of the motion of the gas are also
determined, it appears that so long as the flow of heat is steady the
equations are the same as when the temperature is uniform.
                                                                    " How,
then, are we to account for the fact that forces act between solid
bodies immersed in rarefied gases, and this apparently as long as in
equalities of temperature are maintained ?" The explanation, Maxwell
thinks, is to be found in the fact that the gas in contact with the
surface of a solid must slide over it with a finite velocity in order to
produce a finite tangential stress.     This he is not able to show, but in
 an appendix to the memoir added in May, 1879, the conditions which
 must be satisfied at the boundary between a solid and a gas are inves
 tigated in a very ingenious manner, the results showing that
                                                                     " a gas

                                     xii
may slide over the surface with a finite velocity, and that this velocity
and the corresponding tangential stress are affected by inequalities of
temperature at the surface of the solid, tending to make the gas slide
from colder to hotter places."          The latter result, as a deduction
from the Kinetic Theory, had been previously 6btained in another
way by Professor O. Reynolds. The stress which is the result of
this theory would help to account for the radiometer motion.
In this memoir are interpolated various notes dated May, 1879, in
which the application of Spherical Harmonics is briefly indicated as a
means of simplifying the mathematical parts of the work. The failure
of the author's health prevented him from afterwards following out
this interesting extension of the subject.
    Another important memoir was presented to the Cambridge Philo
sophical Society in May, 1878,
                                      " On Boltzmann's Theorem on the
Average Distribution of Energy in a System of Material Points."
This paper is remarkable alike for the comprehensive character of the
assumptions as regards the forces acting between the point-, the close
ness and condensation of the reasoning, and the generality of the
theorems proved. It is impossible, however, to describe them with
sufficient brevity in a short notice.    Passing to the particular problem
 of the equilibrium of temperatures of two gases, we find the author
once more examines          Gay-Lussac's law, and points out that the
 theorem   that  the  average kinetic energy of a single molecule is the
 same for molecules of different gasesj is not sufficient for the
 equilibrium of a mixture of gases, because we have no means of
 finding out the separate temperatures of the two ; the case would
 be different   if the gases were separated by a diaphragm. Another
 interesting application of the general results is made to the theory
 of Loschmidt's experiments on the diffusion of gases.            These ex
 periments    were   made   with a tube   into which  was  put  a  gas or a
 mixture of gases, and the tube was then whirled about one end ; and
 the ultimate distributions of the gases, with the times of attaining to
 them, formed the subject of investigation.
    From this review of Maxwell's chief contributions to the Kinetic
 Theory of Gases,' imperfect though it be, it will be seen that, if he
 was not the discoverer of this new region of inquiry, he yet explored
 it more thoroughly than any of his predecessors ; he bore a leading
 part in evolving the general laws to which it must be subject,
 reducing it to order, and pointing out in what directions it would be
 most  fruitful.
    Maxwell took up the theory of Colour Perception at the point where
 Young had left it. According to Young's theory, there are three
 distinct varieties of nerves, sensitive to red, green, and violet light
 respectively, and by the superposition of these sensations when
 aroused in the sensorium the colours of external objects are

                                      xiii
 represented.     Maxwell's   object was to submit this theory to the
 test   of measurement.  For this purpose he employed an apparatus
 now    well known as his Colour Top, in which a system of coloured
 disks could be  arranged round the axis of the top, so that a sector of
  any required angular magnitude of each colour might be exposed.
  When this system was spun rapidly it assumed the appearance of a
 single tint.  Young had himself employed an apparatus of a similar
 character, consisting of circles painted with different colours.       The
 merit of Maxwell's top is in the ease with whicb the proportions of
 the colours can be changed and definite measures taken of them.        His
 plan  of experimenting  was to obtain matches  between   various mixtures
 of colours from the coloured   disks, and these matches were expressed
 by  colour equations.   Having   selected three colours as standards of
 reference, the choice being guided by the variety of combinations
 producible from them, he was enabled, from the great number of
 colour equations   he obtained, to construct * colour diagram on the
 principle suggested by Newton.       The standard colours being at the
 angular points of an equilateral triangle, any other colour, with a
proper coefficient attached to  it,could be represented by a point in the
 diagram, so that from a knowledge of this coefficient and the position
of  the point,  it   possible to say how the colour in 8question may be
                     is
obtained from the standards or combined with one or two of them to
form a match with the remainder. Any colour which can be produced
      mixture of two of the standards will be represented by a point on
by
a
the side of the triangle joining them, and any colour from a mixture of
the three by a point inside the triangle.    Had the standards, instead
of  being arbitrary, been the three primary colours, any other colour
would be obtainable from them by their mixture. Maxwell shows how
one of the primary colours may be obtained.        Colour-blindness  is due
to the absence of one of the three primary sensations, and therefore
from the colour equations of the colour-blind    it   ispossible to localise
on the diagram the tint corresponding to the absent sensation.        From
experiments on two colour-blind subjects he found the tint was a red
approaching to crimson.
   The Odour Top was afterwards abandoned for another apparatus of
an ingenious character, known as the Colour Box, by means of which
the proportions of three colours forming white light of constant inten
sity could be accurately measured.      The main object of the measure
ments was to determine the positions of the colours of the spectrum on
the colour diagram. The standard colours in this case were red, green,
and blue of ascertained wave-lengths.      In all, sixteen definite points
of the spectrum were examined, these points being determined by a
contrivance in the apparatus for obtaining measures by which the
wave-lengths of all the colours admitted could be found. The results
of these elaborate experiments showed that from the red to the green

                                     xiv
the positions lie noarly in one straight line, and from the green to the
blue in another, the chief divergence being at the red and bine ends.
The conclusion is that there are three primary colours in the spectrum,
red, green, and blue, by mixture of which colours chromatically
identical with the other colours of the spectrum can be obtained. The
position of the green is one-fourth from the line E towards the line F,
but the red and blue cannot be satisfactorily placed. Young's theory
was examined by Helmholtz as well as by Maxwell, with the like result,
which was to confirm its truth.
     If we pass to other subjects we must regard the essay on Saturn's
Rings as a most valuable investigation on account of the important
results it contains. Some of these we will now mention. The author
first establishes that the stability of a uniform solid ring revolving
round the planet is impossible.          If we suppose the ring loaded at a
point     of its circumference    a possible case of stability is obtained, but
the load must be between '8158 and 88279 of the whole mass of the
ring.      So irregular a distribution of the mass is very improbable,
and would be found by observation.              When, in addition, we con
sider the immense size of the rings — an iron ring of such a size would
be exceedingly plastic under the forces it would experience, — when we
 consider also their comparative thinness, it is impossible to regard
them as rigid.          The stability of a ring of equal satellites is then
examined.         Disturbances perpendicular to the plane of such a ring
 cannot produce instability.         In the plane of the ring the greatest
 danger to stability      will exist when the number of undnlations of the
 circle of satellites supposed oscillating about their mean positions is
 the greatest possible, that  is,    when equal to half the number of satel
 lites.    In that case, for stability, the mass of the planet must be
 greater than "4352/12 times the mass of the ring, where             fi
                                                                      is     the
 number of satellites.       If this condition hold, four distinct oscillations
 of different periods and amplitudes will run round the circle of satel
 lites.    Results similar in their general outlines, though necessarily
 characterised       by greater complexity, hold in the case of a ring of
 unequal      satellites.   The next hypothesis examined      is    that of an
 annular cloud of meteoric stones revolving uniformly about the
 planet.     It shown that the average density of such a cloud must
              is
  be less than 300 times that of the planet, otherwise destructive
 oscillations will be set up in the ring.
      So low
          a      density has been shown by Laplace to be impossible in a
 ring revolving as whole, so that the outer and inner portions cannot
                    a
 have the same angular velocity.
     The final conclusion is that the rings of Saturn are composed
  of an indefinite number of free particles revolving round the planet
  with velocities depending on their distances from his centre. The
  particles may be arranged in a series of concentric rings, or they may

                                     XV
  form a  confused multitude revolving, but not arranged in rings, and
  constantly coming into collision.   In the first case the mutual pertur
  bations of  two rings may at length reach so great a magnitude as to
  cause their destruction.    In the second the destructive tendency is
  more rapid, though it may be retarded by the particles settling down
  into concentric rings.
     The most important contributions by Maxwell to the theory of
                                 " Reciprocal Frames and Diagrams of
  Elasticity are his paper on
  Forces," printed in the " Philosophical Magazine,"          1864, and a
  memoir under an almost identical title read to the Royal Society of
 Edinburgh in 1870.       These papers contain many beautiful theorems
 on the geometry and mechanics         of frameworks, interesting from a
 purely theoretical point of view, but also leading to important
 practical results.     The memoir of 1870 constitutes a substantial
 addition to the subject of elasticity, and some of the graphical methods
 have been adopted and extended           in works on engineering. The
 mathematical treatment of the graphical method of internal stress in
 this paper is remarkable for the beauty and symmetry of the expres
 sions and theorems obtained.
    In the foregoing sketch of Maxwell's writings we have grouped them
according to subjects rather than dates, thinking that in this way a
 clear view would be gained of what he actually did in each subject.
 We have thus been enabled to bring into prominence his greatest
memoirs and their connexions with one another.           But there is still a
large number      of mathematical papers,    struck off from time to time,
and more or less important, of which we must omit any detailed
account.     Among these are his papers on The Dynamical Top, on
Governors, on the General Laws of Optical Instruments, on Hamil
ton's Characteristic Function.       There is also a large class of miscel
laneous essays on scientific subjects, which, though not marked by the
same intellectual power as his great memoirs, are yet possessed of
distinctive excellences of their own. This class comprehends (a)
Articles in the " Encyclopaedia Britannica," to which may be added an
elementary manual on Matter and Motion ; (fc) his Addresses to the
British Association, to the London Mathematical Society, and the
Chemical Society, the Rede Lecture at Cambridge, and Lectures at the
Royal Institution; (c) Essays and Reviews contributed to "Nature."
    In some of these essays the author allowed himself a greater lati
tude in the use of mathematical symbols             and processes than in
others, the articles
                        " Atom," Capillary Attraction," " Constitution of
                                 "
Bodies,"     " Diffusion," in the " Encyclopaedia Britannica," being, in
fact, brief treatises on these subjects treated mathematically.          The
subjects of his lectures and addresses were, in the majority of cases,
one or other of those three departments         of physics he had done so
much to extend        — Colour Perception, Action through a Medium,

                                      xvi
Molecular Physics. The Reviews in "Nature" were criticisms of
important memoirs or treatises on subjects in which he was interested.
     In the whole series of these writings we find the same clear and
graceful delineation of principles, the same beauty in arrangement of
subject, the same force and precision in proofs and illustrations.    The
style is simple and singularly free from any kind of haze or obscurity,
rising to a strain of subdued eloquence whenever the emotional aspects
cf the subject overcome the purely speculative.       In the memoirs and
the treatises   we  find  a like clearness in the statement of principles
 combined with the use of an analysis at once direct and forcible,
 though perhaps unnecessarily condensed.          It is seldom that the
 faculties of invention and exposition, the attachment to physical
 science and capability of developing it mathematically, have been
 found existing in one mind to the same degree. It would, however,
 require powers somewhat akin to Maxwell's own to describe the more
 delicate features of the works resulting from this combination, every
 one of which is stamped with the subtle hut unmistakeable impress of
 genius.
      Db. John Jeremiah Bigsby was born at Nottingham on the 14th
 August, 1792. He was the eldest son of Dr. Bigsby, who practised
 for many years at Nottingham ; and, as he was destined for the medical
  profession, he was sent first to St. Andrew's and afterwards to Edin
  burgh University to pursue his medical studies.
      In 1814, he received the degree of Doctor in Medicine from the
  University of Edinburgh ; and, with the object of acquiring a practical
  knowledge of his profession, he obtained in the same year the appoint
  ment of resident physician (or physician's clerk as it was then named)
  in the Edinburgh Infirmary, the duties of which office he discharged
  with great assiduity, while from his amiable disposition, and the
  interest he took in his work, he won the esteem of everyone with
  whom he became associated.
      After the practical experience he had gained in the infirmary he
  entered the medical department of the army in 1816, and was em
  ployed for some years in various parts of Canada, which not only
   gave him the opportunity of improving his knowledge as a military
  practitioner but fostered a growing taste for geological pursuits, which
   latter was subsequently greatly strengthened by visiting various parts
   of the United States, including New York, Washington, and Phila
   delphia.   His reputation as a geologist led to his being appointed,
   in 1822, Secretary and Medical Officer to the Boundary Commission
   which had been in operation for a few years.
       Dr. Bigsby left the army in 1823, and settled in Newark-on-Trent,
   where he practised his profession as a consulting physician for a period
   of more than twenty years, and having acquired, partly by marriage,

                                     xvii
 a moderate   competence, lie finally settled in London as a retired
 physician,  where he resided during the rest of his long and well-
spent life.
   He had now leisure and opportunity for pursuing his favourite
                            and became a contributor to the
                                                                " Transac
geological investigations,
tions of the Geological Society," of which he had been for many years
one of the Fellows, as well as to those of American Societies.         But
the work by which Dr. Bigsby was chiefly known, and to which he
 had devoted almost exclusively the last twenty-five years of his life,
 was entitled " Thesaurus Siluricus," which comprised a list of such of
the Silurian fossils as had been described.      This work was published
in 1868, a grant having been made in aid of its publication from the
Government Grant. In the following year Dr. Bigsby was elected a
Fellow of this Society, and in the same year received the Murchison
medal from the Geological Society.
   To show his interest in geology, Dr. Bigsby presented, some years
ago, a sum of money to the Geological Society for the purpose of
founding a medal to be adjudicated biennially by the Council for the
promotion of geological science, the stipulations being that, preferen
tially, the recipient should have studied American geology, should not
be more than 45 years of age, and " thus probably not too old for
further work, and not too young to have done much."
   Dr. Bigsby's scientific attainments were not more remarkable than his
many estimable qualities in private life. For many years — indeed to
the end of his long life — he was noted for his unostentatious charity,
and for the unceasing interest he took in the education of the poor
children in his immediate neighbourhood. His well-stored mind and
his geniality rendered him a most agreeable companion, and endeared
him to a large circle of attached friends. He was, in every respect, the
type of a Christian gentleman.        His last illness was short, and he
passed   away  without suffering  at  his residence in Gloucester Place at
the advanced age of 89.

   John Gould,                                             as he preferred
to call himself, was born of humble parentage at Lyme Regis, in
Dorsetshire, in November, 1804. When the boy was about fourteen
years of age his father was appointed foreman of the gardeners at
Windsor Castle, and Gould became one of the staff. Under the care
of Mr. J. T. Aiton, the head gardener of the Royal Gardens, Gould
passed several years, and during this period seems first to have
exhibited the intense love of birds and bird-life which has rendered
his name so justly celebrated.
   About the year 1827, Mr. Vigors required a taxidermist for the
collection of the newly-formed Zoological Society of London, and
asked for an exhibition of the skill of the various applicants for the
                                                                o

                                        XV111
 post.    Gonld's artistic talent in bird-stuffing, which he had studiously
 cultivated for some years, rendered him facile princeps among the
 competitors, and obtained him the appointment.             While occupant of
 this post in 1830, Gould received a collection of bird skins from the
  Himalayas — a district at that time almost unexplored.            This oppor
 tunity Gould embraced with characteristic energy, and thus laid the
 foundation of his fame and fortune.               Mr. Vigors was naturally
 anxious to describe the novelties, and Gould employed his lately
 married wife, who had been educated as a governess, and had great
 artistic talent, to figure them.       Thus was produced Gould's first illus
 trated bird book   —  the so-called  "  Century of Birds from the Himalaya
 Mountains," by far the most accurately illustrated work on foreign
 ornithology that had been issued up to that period.               In size the
 "           "
    Century     rivalled the  folios of  Le  Vaillant, but far surpassed them
 in the excellence of the plates.
    The success of the " Century " was so great that in 1832 the " Birds
of Europe " was commenced on a similar scale, and completed in due
 course in five volumes, while during the progress of this work the
 first editions of the well-known "Monographs" of the Toucans and
 Trogons were also issued, and frequent contributions made to the
 Zoological Society's
                          " Proceedings " and " Transactions."
    We now come to the most important and striking episode of Gould's
career.    The birds of the great continent of Australia were at that
 time almost unknown, except from the scattered notices of older
 authors, and from an essay by Vigors and Horsfield on the specimens
 from that country contained in the Linnean Society's collection.
 Gould determined to make a special expedition to Australia for the
 purpose of investigating its ornithology.         In 1838 he left England for
this purpose, accompanied by his wife, and devoted two years to the
 exploration of Tasmania, South Australia, and New South Wales.                A
 large series of birds' skins as well as of their nests and eggs were
 collected, besides specimens of the mammals, while a mass of valuable
 and original observations were made upon their habits and distribu
 tion. On Gould's return to this country, the great folio work on the
 " Birds of Australia " was at once commenced, and completed in 1848,
 after seven years' unremitting labour. The companion work on the
 " Mammals of Australia,"
                                forming three volumes, with 182 plates, was
 completed    in  1860.
    After the " Birds of Australia," the most important work accom
plished by Gould was certainly his " Monograph of the Trochi-
lidse," or " Humming Birds," commenced in 1850, and finished in
1861.     For many years Gould had been an assiduous collector of
specimens of this lovely group, and in 1851 exhibited his collection
in the gardens of the Zoological Society. Very large additions, how
ever, were made to it after that period, and in fact, continued to be

                                           xix
 made   until within a short period of his death, so that in the collection
 recently acquired by the British Museum, there were upwards of five
 thousand examples of birds of this family.
                                                 "
    Shortly after the completion of the Humming Birds," Gould com
 menced his work on the
                                 " Birds of Great Britain," which he affirmed
 had never been properly illustrated.           Whatever may be other opinions
 upon  this  point,  it  is  certain  that   Gould's five volumes upon this sub
ject, which were completed in 1873, added vastly to our knowledge
 upon many points, besides giving us the most complete set of pictures
of our native birds yet issued.            Special pains were bestowed on the
plates  of  this  work,     which   may   in  some cases, perhaps, be said to be
slightly overcoloured, but the natural attitudes of the various species,
and the selection of appropriate surroundings, have never been sur
passed in any work of natural history.
   Besides the works already specially mentioned, Gould issued other
folio volumes, such as the " Monograph of the Odontophorinee," and
second editions of the
                                " Toucans " and " Trogons," the whole series
forming altogether forty-one folio volumes, illustrated by 2999 plates, a
performance quite unrivalled in any other branch of literaturs. Gould
was also the author of upwards of 300 memoirs and papers published
in the " Proceedings of the Zoological Society,"                   and in other
periodicals.     For the last five or six years of his life, Gould was in
failing health.      Though suffering from a tedious and painful malady,
he never ceased to work, and even within a few months of his death
had planned a new monograph, and issued the first part of it.                Gould
died on the 3rd of February, 1881, in his seventy-seventh              year, in his
house in Charlotte Street, near the British Museum, where he had
lived for the last twenty years of his life.         His collection of birds has
passed, to the great satisfaction of all naturalists, into the collection of
the British Museum.           Gould was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society
in 1843, and was for many years an active Member of Council and
Vice-President of the Society with which he had become originally
connected in the humble capacity of bird stuffer. — P. L. S.

    Robert Mallet was elected an honorary member of the Society of
 Arts of Scotland, 1840, of the Academy of Science, Arts, and Belles
 Lettres of Dijon (1853), a Fellow of the Royal Society (1854), an
 honorary member of the United Service Institution (1857), Fellow of
 the Geological Society of London (1859), and corresponding member
 of the Physical Class of the              Royal Philosophical        Society of
 Gottingen, 1869.
    In 1846, Robert Mallet read before the Royal Irish Academy, a
 remarkable paper on the " Dynamics of Earthquakes," which was the
 commencement        of a long series of contributions to a branch of
physical geology with which his name will always be associated.
 The chief of these contributions were (in addition to that just

 (1858).* 2. The Great Neapolitan Earthquake of 1857 (2 vols.,
1862).      3. Volcanic Energy (" Phil. Trans.," 1872).
    For these valuable contributions to physical geology he received
the Cunningham Medal of the Royal Irish Academy (1862), and the
Wollaston Medal of the Geological Society of London (1877).
    In 1855 he read before the Royal Irish Academy a paper on the
Construction of Artillery of a large Calibre, in consequence of which
he was elected a special honorary member of the Royal Artillery
Institution, Woolwich (1867).
   In 1859 he received the Telford Medal of the Institution of Civil
Engineers, for his paper on the Coefficients of Elasticity and Rupture
in Wrought Iron.
   In scientific thought, Robert Mallet was remarkable for the
originality of his ideas, and for the broad grasp he took of every
subject that engaged his attention ; in private and social life he was
beloved for the kindness, geniality, and humour of his disposition, for
his readiness in conversation and uniform good temper.

not be    allowed to pass away without      some record of his career    in
our obituary notices.
    Dean Stanley was born at Alderley in Cheshire, on December 13th,
1815.    His father, a brother of the first Lord Stanley of Alderley,
and then Rector of the parish, was afterwards better known as the
energetic, liberal, and enlightened Bishop of Norwich, who among
many other accomplishments,        was an enthusiastic ornithologist, the
author of a still favourite book, the " Familiar History of Birds," and
 for many years President of the Linnean Society. The future Dean,
though he did not inherit his father's taste for science, always took
interest in and welcomed its progress.        This spirit, which pervaded
all his writings and conduct, may be illustrated by the following
characteristic passage from his sermon on Sir Charles Lyell, preached
in Westminster Abbey in 1875, " The tranquil triumph of geology,"
           " once
he says,           thought so dangerous, now so quietly accepted by the
church,   no  less than by the world, is one more proof of the ground
lessness of theological panics in the face of the advances of scientific
discovery."      He was educated under Dr. Arnold, at Rugby, and com
menced a brilbant career at Oxford by obtaining a scholarship at
Balliol, and shortly after the Newdigate Prize for his Engbsh poem,

class in classics in 1837, gained the Chancellor's prize for the Latin
Essay in 1839, won the English Essay and the Ellerton Theological
Prizes, and was elected a Fellow of University College in 1840, where
for twelve years he was tutor. He did good service in the cause of
university reform, by acting as Secretary to the Oxford University
Commission of 1850-52, and was about the same time made a Canon
of Canterbury Cathedral.        In 1853, he returned to Oxford as Regius
Professor of Ecclesiastical History, and Canon of Christchurch, which
office he held until his appointment in 1863 to the Deanery of
Westminster, a position which he held up to the time of his death, and
which he filled in such a manner as to have given the Abbey a place in
the history of the religious thought and feeling of the nation, which it
 had never taken before.       His marriage about the same time with
 Lady  Augusta    Bruce, contributed  to make the Deanery from that time
 forth a centre of all that was intellectual, cultivated, and refined in
 English society, and at the same time a place where persons of any
 distinction, whatever their class, creed, or opinions, were equally
 welcome, and could meet on equal terms.        He was elected F.R.S. in
 1863, and in 1875 was chosen Lord Rector of the University              of
  St. Andrew's.    The first published work by which Dean Stanley was
                     was his " Life and Letters of Dr. Arnold — a work
             known,                                             "

numerous sermons and essays, " Historical Memorials of Canterbury
and of Westminster," and " Sinai and Palestine," which contains the
most vividly picturesque topographical, and historical descriptions of
those countries to be found in the language, based on observations
made in a journey to the East in 1852-53.           The series of sermon-
which he deemed it part of his duty to preach in the Abbey on all
occasions of national and historical interest, will, it is hoped, shortly
be published in a collected form.
   The wide-spread and enduring popularity of these numerous works
is due not only to the intrinsic interest of the subjects chosen,
and the brilliance, grace, and charm of the language in which they
are written, but also in great measure to the spirit with which they
are animated — a spirit which though it can be discerned through all
he wrote, could only be fully appreciated by those who knew him
personally, for his were, in the words of his successor to the Deanery,

       courage which never looked behind to see who followed as he
sprang forward in the defence of anyone whom he deemed unfairly
overborne   by intolerance     or injustice, the inexhaustible fund of

describable gifts and graces that defied analysis which won him not
only the undying love of those that knew him, but the hearts of
multitudes who never saw him, the imagination, the genius, and the
 knowledge that cast such a flood of light on the persons, the place-,
the events, the scenes of so many stages of human history, the ardour
that threw itself so keenly into all the interests of the present and all
the problems of the future, the purity of heart that made men feel that
they could not think of evil in his presence, the largeness of heart
that tried so earnestly ' to knit the knots of peace and love throughout

   The genus Culenlus has been formed for a series of six new species of
pedunculated Simple Ascidians, belonging to the family Cynthiidae,
and having several anatomical peculiarities distinguishing them from
all hitherto described genera.      The nearest ally of Culeolus is  Boltenia,
and these two genera have been placed together as a sub-family, the
Bolteninae, characterised as Cynthiidas which have the body peduncu
lated, the tentacles compound, and the branchial sac with more than
four folds on each side.
   Culeolus is distinguished from Boltenia by its remarkable branchial
sac (which will be described shortly), and by the external character
that its branchial aperture   is   triangular, and its atrial aperture bila
biate, while in Boltenia both apertures are four-lobed.
   One of the species, Culeolus murrayi, is" described in detail — anato
mical and histological — while the other five are not so fully treated,
but the different systems in each are compared with those of the type,
and the modifications are pointed out. The following are a few of
the more interesting peculiarities of the genus —  :
   As regards the test, the disposition of the blood-vessels    is  the most
important   feature.   In  Culeolus   murrayi, throughout  the  greater part
of the test, blood-vessels are few and feebly developed.       In the super
ficial layer, however, the terminal twigs open into an enormously
developed system of globular cavities, separated        by extremely thin
walls from the external medium, and in direct connexion with the
delicate hollow papilla; projecting from the outer surface of the test.
The globular cavities and their prolongations, the papillae, contain
masses of blood-corpuscles, and there can be little doubt that the
whole system acts, to a certain extent, as an accessory organ of
respiration.    In another species, G. tm/ville-thomsuni, the vessels are
much more developed throughout the thickness of the test, while the
number of globular cavities in the superficial layer    is very small. The
terminal twigs of the vessels, however, are prolonged beyond the
general surface in the form of a series of delicate and minute finger-
like processes, which, over some parts of the surface, are present in
•Treat numbers.   These are evidently modification of the large papillae of
                                        a
V. murrayi, and both are homologous with the long hair-like processes
iound on the outer surface of the test in most of the Molgulidas.
   The branchial sac   is the most characteristic organ of the genus, and

is of great morphological interest. As it belongs to the Cynthiad
type, it is necessarily so far complicated as to possess a certain number
of longitudinal folds on each side, but in all other respects it is the
simplest form of branchial sac known among Simple Ascidians.
    Neglecting for the moment the longitudinal folds, the organ may be
described as a simple network, formed by two series of vessels cross
ing at right angles and communicating at the points of intersection.
The two series are the horizontal or transverse vessels, which are some
times of two or more sizes occurring alternately, and the internal
longitudinal bars which run vertically and generally form the strongest
part of the network. This is the structure of the branchial sac
between two folds in the simplest form, Culeolus murrayi, and the
gTeat difference between it and the simplest form of branchial sac in
the genus Aseidia (e.g., A. cylindracea or A. venosa, where minute longi-
tadinal plication of the sac is not present) lies in the fact that in Culeolus
no fine longitudinal vessels are present, and consequently the meshes
are not broken up into stigmata.        In two of the species, however, here
and there over the branchial sac, a mesh was found divided more or
less irregularly by a delicate longitudinal vessel crossing from one
transverse vessel to the adjacent one. These cases were rare, and evi
dently abnormalities, but they indicate a tendency towards the division
of the mesh into stigmata through the development of fine longitu
dinal vessels.      In Culeolus perlucidus this process has taken place.
 Here each mesh is divided into two equal areas by a delicate longitu
dinal vessel running between the transverse vessels. In this species, con
sequently, one might correctly describe the branchial sac as having two
stigmata in each mesh. Along the free edges of the internal longitudi
 nal bars the epithelium is cubical or low columnar, but never ciliated.
    One peculiarity of the branchial sac throughout the genus remains
to be mentioned.      That is the presence in its vessels of an extensively
developed system of calcareous spicules.          These are of considerable
size, often much ramified, and have a very characteristic appearance
 from their gentle curves and blunt ends. They vary in size, abund
ance, and amount of branching according to the species ; and are chiefly
 developed in the internal longitudinal bars, and along the edges of
 the endostyle.
    The dorsal lamina throughout the genus is represented by a series
 of triangular languets.
    The alimentary canal from the oesophageal opening onwards,
 though differing somewhat in its details in the different species, has in
 all the same general course.      It lies on the left side of the branchial
 sac, in its posterior half, and nearer to the ventral than the dorsal edge.
 The oesophageal aperture (ce.a.) lies far back in the branchial sac, at
 the posterior end of the dorsal lamina (d.l.)      The oesophagus is short,
 and runs ventrally to open into the large stomach {s.1.) which lies
                                                                 i 2

 anteriorly from the stomach for a certain distance, and then, turning
 towards the dorsal region, returns parallel to its first part towards the
 posterior end, and finally terminates near the posteriorly placed atrial
 aperture (At).

   The annexed diagrams show the relation of the course of the intestine
in Culeolus to the arrangement found in Ancidia. The chief difference
is that in the latter genus the intestine, after running posteriorly for
a short distance, takes a final curve anteriorly, thus making a second loop
(2), open anteriorly, which is entirely wanting in Culeolus.      The canse
of the difference is obviously the position of the atrial aperture (At.)
This lies in Culeolus almost at the posterior end of the body, and con
sequently the last part of the intestine runs posteriorly. In Ascidia, on
the other hand, the atrial aperture is usually situated near the
anterior extremity, therefore the intestine is necessarily twisted for
wards again so that it may terminate near the common excretory
aperture.
   All the species of Culeolus are from upwards of 600 fathoms ; five
are from over 1,000 fathoms, four from over 1,500, and two from up
wards of 2,000 fathoms.       They all belong to the abyssal fauna.
   It is noteworthy that these six species, the only deep-water Bol-
teninse, all belong to one genus, notwithstanding their wide distribu
tion in space — one species being from the North Atlantic, two from
the Southern Ocean, one from the South Pacific, one from the North
Pacific, and one from the centre of the Pacific Ocean on the Equator.

  II. " On the Development of the Skull in Lepidosteus osseous."
       By W. K. Parker, F.R.S. Beceived November 3, 1881.
                                    (Abstract.)
     The materials for the present paper were kindly sent to me by
  Professor A. Agassiz ; they were for the use of Mr. Balfour and
  myself, and consisted of fifty-four small bottles of eggs and embryos
  in varions stages. These very valnable .materials were obtained from
  Black Lake by Mr. S. W. Garman and Professor Agassiz, and many
  of the embryos were described and figured by the latter in the
  " Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences,"
  October 8, 1878.
     Having received from my friend the author a copy of his im
  portant paper,     I  at once wrote to ask permission to work his
  materials out, thoroughly ; suggesting that Mr. Balfour would under
  take the embryological part of the work.
     On receipt of my letter Professor Agassiz kindly acceded to my
  wish, and the results of our investigations are now ready for publi
 cation.
     Mr. Balfour's part of the work has been done with the assistance of
 my son, Mr. W. N. Parker, and their joint labour will include the
 anatomy of various organs of the adult fish.
     We have had additional materials from Professor Burt G. Wilder ;
  these were larger young than those supplied by Professor Agassiz ;
 Mr. Balfour also has obtained several adult fishes in spirit; and I
 am indebted to Professor Flower for an adult in the dry state.
     Finding that we were in a condition to do somo useful research on
 this important Holostean Ganoid,        I  pressed Dr. Traquair to take up
 the skull of the adult ; this he consented to do ; and        I am daily ex
 pecting  that  his paper  will  be sent   to the Royal Society.
    My observations on the skull and visceral arches have been made
 on embryos and young, varying from one-third of an inch to 4| inches
 in length ;  I have (artificially) divided these into six stwjos. Cartilage
 was being formed in the smallest examined by me, but in my second
stage, embryos five-twelfths of an inch long, this tissue was quite
consistent, and I succeeded in dissecting out all the parts.       The large
notochord at this stage bends downwards under the swelling hind-
brain, and then turns up a little at its free end ; passing into the
lower part of the fissure between the mid- and hind-brain, it reaches
beyond the middle of the cranium, and just touches the infundibulum
and distinct pituitary body.
    The paired cartilages, " parachordals," that invest the notochord
only cleave to its hinder three-fifths ; these bands then diverge and

enclose a lanceolate space under the fore-brain ("tbalamencephalon ").
These somewhat flattened bands of cartilage become narrower up U>
the middle of this large primary
                                       "
                                         pituitary space," and then recover
their former width in front, where they come in contact, having no
notochord between them.         All the cartilage that lies in front of the-
notochord is called trabecular ; between the trabeculse, in front, there
is a small wedge of younger cartilage, the rudiment of the " inter-
trabecula."      The hinder, or parachordal , parts are somewhat scooped
and bevelled above, and on their edge the auditory capsules rest. Thesr
are quite distinct, and have a cartilaginous coat, which, however, ha»s
a large oval deficiency below.       As in the Batrachia, the fore part oi'
      "                    "
the     pal ato- quadrate    cartilages is continuous with the trabeculse in
front; but the "pedicle" is free behind. The free " articulo-
Meckelian
              " rod is
                       quite in front of the eye-balls, and is nearly as long
as the hind suspensorium,        or proper quadrate region ; this forward
position of the hinge of the mandible is not temporary as in the frog,
but is permanent.       The uppermost element of the hyoid arch is an
anvil-shaped cartilage from the first, and ossifies afterwards, as the
hyo-mandibular and symplectic bones.              As pointed out to me by
Mr. Balfour, its dorsal end is continuous, as cartilage, with the
skull (auditory capsule) above. The basi-hyal is not yet ossified, but
distinct inter-cerato- and hypo-hyal segments are already marked out.
Four larger and one small rods of cartilage are seen on each side,
articulating with a median band ; these are the branchial arches, which
chondrify before they undergo segmentation.           In this stage there are
no osseous laminae as yet formed.
   Here, in this stage, in connexion with a large jtre-nasal suctorial
disk, we have three important generalised characters, namely, the
continuity of the distal end of the mandibular pier and of the proximal
end of the hyoid pier with the skull, and the forward position of the
hinge of the jaw coupled with the horizontal direction of the suspen
sorium. The hyoid arch has its segments formed much earlier than
in the Teleostei, and the " pharyngo-branehials " are not independent
cartilages, as in the Skate.
   The third stage — embryos two-thirds of an inch long — show a con
siderable advance in the development            of the skull ; the cartilage,
generally, is more solid and more extensive, and new tracts have
appeared.      The apex of the notochord is now in the middle of the
basis cranii, for the prochordal tracts have grown faster than the
parachordals.        The large so-called pituitary space is now irregularly
pyriform, and not lanceolate : the fore margin of the broad para
chordal bands being now nearly transverse, whilst the prochordal
(traheculw) are wide and fenestrate at first, then narrow, and then
¦widening suddenly, they coalesce, forming a sharp anterior end to the
pituitary space.

   Behind, the parachordals have grown further along the thick noto-
chord, and on each side they are now confluent with the auditory
capsules, which have become irregularly ovoidal through the growth
of the large semicircular canals within ; their basal fenestra is still a
round space under the partially floored " sacculus."       The trabecula?
swell out where they are confluent, and then are narrower in front
again. At their fore end each band passes insensibly into the corre
sponding palato-quadrate bar outside, whilst inside they are separated
by a large pyriform wedge of cartilage, the intertrabecula.            The
thick, rounded, free fore end of this median cartilage is the rudiment
of the great " nasal rostrum," and the rounded fore ends of the
trabecules are the rudiments of their " cornua."
    There is only a floor in the occipital region, but the wall-plate of
the chondrocranium has begun as a styloid cartilage running forward
from the fore end of each auditory capsule into the superorbital region.
The palato- pterygoid band — continuous in front with the trabecular —
is now longer than the proximal part of thesuspensorium.the spatulate
quadrate region whose dorsal end is the free
                                                   " pedicle." The wide
proximal part of each trabecula is now already forming an oblong
facet, the " basi-pterygoid," for articulation with the facet of the
" pedicle."
   An oblong concavity is now seen under the outer edge of each
auditory capsule, for the oblong head of the hyomandibular whose
                             "           "
body is still solid, and the symplectic part merely a process growing
downwards and forwards to get inside the lower margin of the sus-
pensorium of the mandible. The epi-hyal region is still merely the
top of the cerato-hyal ; it is afterwards separate as a bony centre ; the
inter-hyal, hypo-hyal, and double basi-hyal are all now chondrified and
distinct, but the branchial arches are not yet segmented.           In this
stage the skull is a curious compromise between that of a Salmon at
the same stage and that of a Tadpole just beginning its transformation.
 The hind-skull is quite like that of a young Salmon, the fore-skull,
with its non-segmented palato-quadrate,       and its forwardly placed
 quadrate condyles and horizontal suspensorium,       is very much like
what is seen in the suctorial skull of the Anurous   larva;  a splint bone,
 the parasphenoid, as in the Tadpole, has now made its appearance.
    The largest embryos reared by Messrs. Agassiz and Garman, which
are about one inch in length, form my fourth stage ; these are rapidly
acquiring the characters of the adult.
    This is the stage in which the chondrocranium of this Holostean
type corresponds most closely with that of the Chondrostean Sturgeon,
whose adult skull is similar to that of Garpike just as the latter begins
to show its own special characters. This important difference is already
 evident, namely, that whilst in Acipenser the olfactory capsules remain
 in the antarbital position, those of Lepidosteus are already carried

the relatively hnge " cornua trabecul®."           Thus these regions are now
well grown in front of the ethmoidal territory, which, instead of being,
as in the last stage, in the front margin of the skull, is now fairly in
its middle, and this change has taken place whilst the embryo has only
become one-half larger— from two-thirds of an inch to an inch in
length. It is the hypertrophy of cartilage in the three trabecular tracts.

in the Garpike.
   Each " cornu

                        is now like a thick succulent lanceolate leaf, coiled
partly upon itself, downwards, at its outer edge ; the middle' bar, or
intertrabecula, is now half as long as the skull, and projects forwards
beyond the cornua, and between the distally- placed olfactory capsules.
The cranial cavity is now relatively very large, and is covered by a
cartilaginous
                  " tegmen," before and behind ; between these regions,
over the huge mid-brain, there is a sub-circular " fontanelle," narrower
in front than behind, and emarginate in front by some growth of
cartilage in the mid-line.
   The postorbital spike of cartilage has now grown into a narrowish
superorbital band, bounding the upper fontanelle and enclosing
between itself and the trabecula, below, a large " orbito-sphenoidal
                                                                                "
fenestra.    The floor is also still open, and this large pituitary space i-
spearhead-shaped, and is under-floored by the parasphenoid.
   The basipterygoid processes are now well formed ; the basal carti
lages (parachordals) now embrace the huge notochord below, the flaps
approaching, but not touching, each other. The notochord is now
being formed into a
                          " cephalostyle," but the bony sheath is
                                                                     imperfect.
Above, the sphenotic, epiotic, and opisthotic projections of the auditory
capsule are more evident, but are not ossified. Some slight bony deposit
has appeared in the/prootic region. The "cephalostyle" is the first
encio-cranial bone, and the parasphenoid the first ecfo-cranial centre ;
but the exoccipitals are just appearing also. The condyle of the
quadrate is now still further behind the middle of the palato-quadrate
arcade, the pterygopalatine part of which is now quite free in front,
and has grown forwards parallel with the rostrum, as a long style,
which reaches fnrther fomvards than the cornua trabecula;.                   The
"          "
  pedicle    of  the  suspensorium   has  a  facet by which it articulates with
the basipterygoid.        The mandibular cartilage has also grown equally
with the freed pterygopalatine rod, and has now a very large ear-shaped
coronoid part in front of and above the articular part.          The opercular
process   and   fenestra of the hyomandibular are now formed, bnt this
part is not ossified ; the cerato-hyal diaphysis is present.           It is the
only shaft-bone in the hyoid arch as yet ; the branchial arches are seg
menting. The superficial bones can now be seen as fine films in the

 transverse sections, and the parosteal palatine and pterygoid are large
 leaves of bone applied to the pterygopalatine bar ; the mesoptery-
 goid is only half as large as them, but is relatively much larger than
 in the adult.
     Whilst doubling its length, the young Lepidosteus gains a cranium
 much more like that of the adult ; this is my fifth stage.     The general
 form is now intensely modified by the foregrowth of the rostrum         :  the
 " intertrabecula " is now two-thirds the length of the entire skull.      The
 cornua trabecular now reach only two-fifths of the distance to the end
 of the beak, and the pterygopalatine arcade reaches but little further
 forwards. Owing to the " tegmen cranii

 diameter being lengthwise. The bony matter of the " cephalostyle

 now aggregated towards the hinder half of the notochord ; it is now
the basi-occipital bone.      The exoccipitals and prootics are growing
larger, and there are now both sphenotics and alisphenoids.              Also,

below, the quadrate, metapterygoid, and articular            centres      have
appeared ;    and  behind  the   jaw   there are the  hyomandibnlar, sym-
plectic, epi-hyal, cerato-hyal, and hypo-hyal centres ; and the epi-,
cerato-, and hypo-branchials have acquired a bony sheath.
    In a young Lepidosteus 4^ inches long (nearly), the approach to
the adult state of the skull has been very great; the superficial bones
can all be determined.      The most remarkable of these are the small
distal nasals and premaxillaries ; the long maxillary chain, ending in
an " os mystaceum and jugal ; the extremely long and slender
                                     "
" ethmo-nasals " and vomers ; the small pre-opercular ; and the huge
angulated inter-opercular, which carries the large opercular and sub-
opercular.     The five mandibular splints are all present (as in most
Sauropsida), the branchiostegals are only three in number, as in the
Carp tribe.
    The intertrabecula, which was merely a small tract of cells binding
the trabecule together, in front, is now three-fourths the length of the
entire skull ; to it is due the length of the beak.             The cornua
trabecule are now merely short lanceolate leafy growths on the sides
of the rostrum at its hind part.         In the last stage there was a fine
bridge of cells running across behind the pituitary body ; this is now a
small cartilaginous " post-clinoid " bar. The opisthotic and epiotic
form now a scarcely divided tract of bone, all the other centres are
developing, and a pair of additional bones have appeared in the
funnel-shaped fore-end of the chondrocranium ; these are the
                                                                     " lateral
ethmoids."     The bony matter of the basi-occipital has now retired to
the hinder third of the notochord, which has much shrunken.
    There are now two centres (as in Ainia calea) in the articular region
of the mandible ; the quadrate and metapterygoid centres are much
larger ; the hyo-mandibular and symplectic are together only half

researches   were made.
   The first section is devoted to the general development.        In this
section    an account is given of the structure of the ripe ovum,
of the segmentation, of the history of the germinal layers, of the first
development of the principal organs, and of the external features of the
embryo during embryonic and larval life.       The more important points
established in this section, are —
   (1.) The ovum when laid is invested by a double covering formed
of (a) a thick inner membrane, the outer zone of which is radially
striated, and (6) an outer layer made up of highly refractive pyriform
bodies which are probably metamorphosed follicular epithelial cells.
    (2.) The segmentation is complete, though very unequal ; the lower
pole being very slightly divided into segments, and its constituent
parts subsequently fusing together to form an unsegmented mass of
yolk, like the yolk-mass of Teleostei.
    (3.) The epiblast is divided into an epidermic and a nervous
stratum, as in Teleostei.
    (4.) The walls of the brain, of the spinal cord, and of the optic
vesicles are formed from a solid medullary keel, like that found in
 Teleostei.
    (5.) The lens, the auditory vesicle, and the olfactory pit, are wholly
developed from the nervous layer of the epidermis.
    (6.) The segmental or archinephric duct is developed, as in
 Teleostei, from a hollow ridge of the somatic mesoblast, which becomes
-constricted off, except in front ; thus forming a duct with an anterior
pore leading into the body cavity.

     The section on the general development is followed by a series          of
 sections on the adult anatomy and development of varions organs.
                                   The Brain.
    The authors give a fuller description of the adult brain than pre
 vious   anatomists. The new features in this description are (1) that
 the parts    identified by previous anatomists as the olfactory lobes,
 are  really parts of the cerebral hemispheres ; the true olfactory lobes
 being small prominences at the base of the olfactory nerves ; (2) that
there is attached to the roof of the thalamencephalon a peculiar vesicle,
which has not hitherto been noticed, bat which is similar to the vesicle
found by Wiedersheim on the roof of the thalamencephalon                     of
Protopterus.       They further show that the cerebrum is divided into
a posterior portion, with an unpaired ventricle, and an anterior portion
in which the ventricle is paired.          They consider the presence of a
portion of the cerebrum with an unpaired ventricle, to be an indication
that this part of the brain retains characters which are only found in
the embryonic brain of other groups.           They point to the presence of
lobi inferiores on the infundibulum, of tori semicirculares in the mid
brain, and of a large cerebellum as indications of an affinity between
the brain of Lepidosteus and that of Teleostei.           In the embryological
section full details are given as to the development of the thalamen
cephalon, the pineal gland, the cerebrum, and the olfactory lobes.
   At the end of the section the characters and affinities of the Ganoid
brain are dealt with at some length ; and the authors attempt to show
that brains of Ganoids are distinguished (1) by the large size of the
thalamencephalon, and (2) by the cerebrum being divided into an
unpaired portion behind and a paired portion in front.
                            Organs of Special Serine.
    Olfactory Sacs. — An account is given of the development of tho
olfactory sacs, in which these sacs are shown to originate as invagina
tions of the    nervous layer of the epiblast ; the communication between
the sacs    and the exterior being effected by the rupture or absorption
of the superficial epidermic layer of the epiblast.        The double opening
 of these sacs in the adult is described      as arising from the division of
 the primitive single opening.        The olfactory nerve arises as an ont-
growth of the brain prior to      the  first differentiation of the olfactory
 bulb as a special lobe of the brain.
    Eye. — In the adult eye a vascular membrane is described bounding
 the retinal aspect of the vitreous humour.        This membrane is supplied
 by an artery piercing the retina close to the optic nerve, and the veins
 from it fall into a circular vessel placed at the insertion of the iris.
 The membrane itself is composed of a hyaline ground substance with
 numerous     nuclei.

   In the developmental section devoted to the eye the main subject
dealt with is the nature of the mesoblastic structures entering the
cavity of the optic cup, through the choroid slit. It is shown that a.
large non-vascular mesoblastic process first enters the optic cup, and
that together with the folded edge of the choroid slit it forms a rudi
mentary and provisional processus falciformu.       At a later period an
artery, bound up in the same sheath as the optic nerve, enters the
optic cup, and the vascular membrane found in the adult then becomes8
developed.
                            The Suctorial Disk.
     The structure of a peculiar larval suctorial organ, placed at the
end of the snout, is described,   and the organ is shown to be formed
of papillae composed of elongated epidermic cells, which are probably
glandular (modified mucous cells), and pour out a viscid secretion.
                             Muscular System.
   The lateral muscles of Lepidosteus are shown to differ from those
of other fishes, except the Cyclostomata, in not being divided into
a dorso-lateral and ventro-lateral group, on each side of the body.
                       Vertebral Column and Ribs.
   This section of the paper commences with a description of the ver
tebral column and ribs of the adult. In this part special attention is
called to a series of cartilaginous elements, placed immediately below
the ligamentum longitudinale superius, which appear to have escaped the
notice of the anatomists who have previously worked at Lepidosteus.
These elements are shown to be intervertebral^ situated.
   With reference to the ribs the authors point out that for the greater
part of their length they course along the bases of the intermuscular
septa, immediately external to the peritoneal membrane, but that their
free extremities bend outwards and penetrate between the muscles
along the intermuscular septa till they nearly reach the skin.
   In the embryological part of this section a detailed account is given
of the development of the vertebral column, of which the following is
a summary : —
   There is early formed round the notochord a mesoblastic investment
which is produced into two dorsal and two ventral ridges, the former
uniting above the spinal cord.      Around the cuticular sheath of the
notochord, an elastic membrane, the membrana elastica externa, is
next developed.    The neural ridges become enlarged at each inter
muscular septum, and these enlargements soon become converted into
cartilage, thus forming a series of neural processes, riding on the
membrana elastica externa, and extending about two-thirds of the

                                                      '
  1881.]     On the Structure and Development of Lepidosteus.             115
  way np the     sides of the spinal cord.    Haemal processes arise simul
  taneously   with and in the same manner as the neural : they are
  small in  the trunk, hut at the front end of the anal fin they suddenly
 enlarge and extend ventralwards.        Behind this point each succeeding
  pair of  haemal   processes   hecomes larger than the one in front, each
  process finally meeting its fellow helow the caudal vein, thus forming
 a completely closed      haemal arch.   These arches are, moreover, pro
  duced  into long spines supporting the fin-rays of the caudal fin, which
 thus differs from the other unpaired fins in being supported by parts
 of the vertebral column, and not by separately formed skeletal
 elements.
    In the next stage which the authors have had the opportunity of study
 ing (a larva of h\ centims.), a series of well-marked vertebral constric
 tions are to be seen in the notochord. The sheath is now much thicker in
the vertebral than in the intervertebral regions : this being due to a
special differentiation      of a superficial part of the sheath, which
appears more granular than the remainder, and forms a cylinder in
each vertebral region.        Between it and the gelatinous tissue of the
notochord there remains a thin unmodified portion of the sheath,
which is continuous with the intervertebral parts of the sheath.
The nenral and haemal arches which are of course placed in the
vertebral regions are now continuous with a cartilaginous tube em
bracing the intervertebral regions of the notochord, and continuous
from one vertebra to the next.        A delicate layer of bone, developed in
the perichondium, invests the cartilaginous neural arches, and this
bone grows upwards so as to unite above with the osseous investment
of separately developed bars of cartilage, which are directed obliquely
backwards. These bars, or dorsal processes, may be reckoned as parts
of the neural arches. Between the dorsal processes of the two sides
are placed median rods of cartilage, which are developed separately
from the true neural arches, and which constitute the median spinous
elements of the adult.         Immediately below these rods is placed the
ligamentum longitudinale superius. There is now the commencement,
not only in the tail, but also in the trunk, of a separation between the
dorsal and ventral parts of the haemal arches where the latter pass
ventralwards, on each side of the body cavity, along the lines of inser
tion of the intermuscular septa.        They are obviously the ribs of the
adult, and there is no break of continuity of strncture between the
haemal arches of the tail and the ribs.    In the anterior part of the trunk,
the ribs pass outwards along the intermuscular septa till they reach
the epidermis.        Thus the ribs are originally continuous with the
hasmal processes.      Behind the region of the ventral caudal fin the two
haemal processes merge into one, which is not perforated by a canal.
    Each of the intervertebral rings of cartilage becomes eventually
divided into two parts, which are converted into the adjacent faces

116             Dr. F. M. Balfour and Mr. W. N. Parker.           [Dec. 8.
of contiguous vertebrae, the curved line where this will be effected
being plainly marked out at a very early stage. As these rings are
formed originally by the spreading of the cartilage from the primitive
neural and haemal processes, the intervertebral cartilages are clearly
derived from the neural and haemal arches.       The intervertebral carti
lages are thicker in the middle line than at their two ends.
   In the latest stage examined (11 centims. long) the vertebral con
strictions of the notochord are rendered much less conspicuous by the
intervertebral cartilages giving rise to marked intervertebral con-
strictions.    In the intervertebral regions the membrana elastica
externa has become aborted at the posterior border of each vertebra,
and the remaining part is considerably puckered transversely. The
inner sheath of the notochord is puckered longitudinally in the inter
vertebral regions.     The granular external layer of the sheath in the
vertebral regions is less thick than in the last stage, and exhibits a
faint radial striation.
   Two closely approximated cartilaginous elements now form a key
stone to each neural arch above ; these are directly differentiated from
the ligamentum longitudinale superius, into which they merge above.
An osseous plate is formed on the outer side of each of these carti
lages. These plates are continuous with the lateral osseous bars of the
neural arches, and give rise to the osseous part of the roof of the
spinal canal of the adult. Thus the greater part of the neural arches
is formed by membrane bone.
   The heeinal arches are invested by a thick layer of bone, and
there is also a continuous osseous investment round the vertebral
portions of the notochord. The intervertebral cartilages become pene
trated by branched processes of bone.
   The embryological part of this section is followed by a comparative
part treated under three headings.      In the first of these the vertebral
column of Lepidosteus is compared      with that of other forms ; and it is
pointed out that there are grave difficulties in the way of comparing
the vertebr® of Lepidosteus with those of the Urodela, in the fact
that in Lepidosteus the intervertebral cartilages originate from the
bases of the arches, while in the Urodela they are stated by Gotte
to be thickenings of a special cartilaginous investment of the noto
chord, which would seem to be homologous with that cartilaginous
sheath which is placed in Elasmobranchii          and Dipnoi within the
membrana elastica externa.        On the other hand, the development of
the  vertebrae  of Lepidosteus is shown to resemble in most features that
of Teleostei, from which it mainly differs in the presence of interver
tebral cartilaginous rings.
   In the second section, devoted to the homologies of the ribs of
Pisces, the conclusions arrived at are summed up as follows : —
   The results of the authors' researches appear to leave two alterna

           (hi  the Structure and Development     of Lepidostous.      117
 1881.]
 tives as to   the ribs of fishes.    One of these, which may be called
 Gotte's  view,   may  be  thus  stated: — The haemal arches are homolo
gous throughout the Pisces ; in Teleostei, Ganoidei, and Dipnoi the
ribs, placed on the inner face of the body wall, are serially homologous
 with the ventral parts of the haemal arches of the tail ; in Elasmo-
branchii, on the other hand, the ribs are neither serially homologous
with the haemal arches of the tail, nor homologous with the ribs of
 Teleostei and Ganoidei, but are outgrowths of the haemal processes
into the space between the dorso-lateral and ventrolateral        muscles,
and outgrowths which may perhaps have their homologies in Teleostei
and Ganoids in certain accessory processes of the vertebrae.
    The other view, which the authors are inclined to adopt, is a-
follows: — The Teleostei, Ganoidei, Dipnoi, and Elasmobranchii are
provided with homologous haemal arches, which are formed by the
coalescence    below the caudal vein of simple prolongations of the
primitive haemal processes of the embryo.       The canal enclosed by the
haemal arches     can be  demonstrated   embryologically to be the aborted
body   cavity.
    In the region of the trunk the haemal processes and their prolonga
tions behave somewhat differently in the different types.      In Ganoids
and Dipnoi, in which the most primitive arrangement is probably
retained, the ribs are attached to the haemal processes, and are placed
immediately without the peritoneal membrane, at the insertion of the
intermuscular septa. These ribs are in many instances (Lepidosteus,
Acipenser), and very probably in all, developed continuously with
the haemal processes, and become subsequently segmented from them.
They are serially homologous with the ventral parts of the haemal
arches of the tail, which, like them, are in many instances (Ceratodus,
Lepidosteus, Polypterus, and to some extent in Amia) segmented off
from the basal parts of the haemal arches.
    In Teleostei the ribs have the same position and relations as those
in Ganoids and Dipnoi, but their serial homology with the ventral
parts of the haemal processes of the tail is often (e.r/., the Salmon)
obscured by the anterior haemal arches (i.e., those in the posterior part
of the trunk) being completed, not by the ribs, but by independent
outgrowths of the basal parts of the haemal processes.
    In Elasmobranchii a still further divergence from the primitive
arrangement is present.       The ribs appear to have passed outwards,
along the intermuscular septa, into the muscles; and are placed between
the dorso8lateral and ventro-lateral muscles (a change of position of the
ribs of the same nature is observable in Lepidosteus).      This change of
position, combined probably with the secondary formation of a certain
 number of anterior haemal arches, similar to those in the Salmon,
 renders their serial homology with the ventral parts of the haemal pro
 cesses of the tail far less clear than in other types ; and further proof

  118     On the Structure and Development     of Lepidostcus.      [Dec. 8,
 is required before     such  homology can be considered        as definitely
 established.
    Under the third heading the skeletal elements supporting the fin-
 rays of the ventral lobe of the caudal fin of various types of fishes arc
 compared and the following conclusions are arrived at.
     (1.) The ventral lobe of the tail-fin of Pisces differs from the other
 unpaired fins in the fact that its fin-rays are directly supported by
 spinous processes of certain of the haemal arches, instead of by in-
 dently developed interspinous bones.
     (2.) The presence or absence in the tail-fin of fin-rays, supported by
 hivmal arches, may be used in deciding whether apparently diphycercal
 tail-fins are aborted or primitive.
                             Urogenital  Organs.
    With reference to the character of the adult urogenital organs, the
 authors show that for the female the descriptions of Miiller and Hyrtl
 are substantially accurate, but that HyrtFs description of the genera
 tive ducts of the male is wholly incorrect.
    They find that in the male the semen is transported from the testes
 by means of a series (40 — 50) of vasa efferentia, supported by the
 mesorchium. In the neighbourhood of the kidney these vasa unite
 into a longitudinal canal, from which transverse trunks are given off,
 which become continuous with the uriniferous tubuli.          The semen is
 thus transported through the kidney into the kidney-duct (segmental
 duct), and so to the exterior. No trace of a duct homologous with the
oviduct of the female was found in the male.
    With reference to the development of the excretory system, the
authors have established the following points : —
    (1.) That the segmental (archinephric) duct is developed as in
Teleostei.
    (2.) That a pronephros, resembling in the main that of Teleostei,
is developed from the anterior end of the segmental duct. But they
find that the pronephric chambers, each containing a glomerulus,
into which the coiled pronephric tubes open, are not, as in Teleostei,
completely shut off from the body cavity, but remain in communica
tion with it by two richly ciliated canals, one on each side of the
body.
    (3.) The pronephros eventually undergoes atrophy.
    (4.) Some of the mesonephric tubes have peritoneal funnels in the
larva.
    (5.) The ovarian sac continuous with the oviduct, is established
by a fold of the peritoneal membrane, near the attachment of the
mesovarium, uniting with the free edge of the ovarian ridge to form a
canal, the inner wall of which is constituted by the ovarian ridge
itself.

ovarian sac has become developed, and had not been developed in

ing.
                     The Alimentary Canal and its Appendages.
    In this section the authors give a detailed account of the topo
graphical anatomy of the alimentary tract in the adult.                    They have
detected a small pancreas close to the bile-duct, and call special atten
tion to a ventral mesentery passing from the posterior straight section
of the intestine to the ventral wall of the body.
    In the embryological part of the section a detailed account is given
of the development (1) of the pancreas, which is described as arising
as a   dorsal diverticulum of the duodenum on a level with the opening
of the bile-duct ; (2) of the yolk sac and vitelline duct ; (3) of the spiral
valve, which first appears as a hollow fold in the wall of the intestine,
taking a slightly spiral course, and eventually becoming converted into
a simple spiral ridge.
    The so-called hyoid gill, which the authors expected to find well
developed in the larva, is shown not to be found even in the oldest
larva the head of which was examined (26 millims.)
    The last section of the paper is devoted to the consideration of the
systematic position of Lepidosteus.                 The Teleostean affinities of
Lepidosteus arc brought into prominence, but it is shown that
Lepidosteus is nevertheless a true Ganoid.
    The arguments used in this portion of the paper do not admit of
being summarised.

         Paulus F. Reixsch (Erlangen). Communicated by Pro
         fessor Stokes, Sec. R.S.           Received November 3, 1881.
     In the western part of the Island of Cyprus I detected, during my
 journey in June this year, a peculiar mineral, very remarkable not only
 from its chemical composition but also from the large percentage of
 extremely well-preserved siliceous shells of microscopic Radiolaria.
  The locality       in this not much known part of Cyprus,* is situated
 between the village Chynussa and the mountains running in a north-

                                             1878) this part of the island, in which the
  locality lies, is marked as " wooded hill country, unexplored."   In all the reports of
  travellers through Cyprus before and after the British occupation I find no notice
  of this tract, which must have attracted the attention of parsing travellers.
      VOL. XXXIII.                                                          K

 120      On a New Mineral found in         the  Island of Cyprus.      [Dec. 8,
western direction, 38 miles N.W.W. in a straight line from the city
of Limassol, 4 miles from the nearest point of the shores of Chrysohu
 Bay. The mineral is found there in enormous quantities, it covers
the sides of the top of a hill about 150 meters over the lowest part of
the valley beneath. One side of the hill is covered with the pure mineral,
partly in a crumbled state, partly as solid rock. On some places are
found compact prominent rocks of the pure mineral from 1 to 2 meters
height. The locality is destitute of any vegetation.            The mineral is
soft and chalk-like ;    in   a compact state  it has   a yellowish colour, in a
powdered state an intense sulphur-like colour.            The principal part of
the mineral is composed of pure basic sulphate of oxide of iron,
making 73 per cent.
    The striking yellow coloration of the slope attracted my attention,
and I thought at first sight that I had before me a large layer of a
pure sort of common yellow ochre.           In ravines intersecting the slope
and running down to the valley, especially on the lower parts,                 I
observed the slopes covered all over with whitish and yellowish crusts
of salt from 1 to 2 inches thick. These crusts sometimes cover the
soil in the ground of the valley and excavations in the slope with
whitish efflorescences, 30 to oO meters below the yellow deposit.           The
substance must be partly soluble, it has a peculiar taste, giving the
taste of sulphate of protoxide.        On all those spots which are covered
with the crusts of this salt there grows no vegetation of herbs, only
shrubs cover the soil.      During the dry season, lasting in this part of
the island from June to August, the amount of salt, crystallizing and
developed from the surface of the slopes, must constantly be in
creasing. The upper parts of the soil more and more drying up are
filled np in the dry season with the efflorescence of salt, which is pre
viously in a dissolved state below the surface of the soil.                This
efflorescent salt in the lower parts of the ravines proves to be derived
from the higher parts of the yellow deposit itself.
    Through the influence of the rain water in the wet season (October
to December) quantities of the mineral being dissolved and carried
down, quantities of the solution are sucked in from the soil ; later in
the dry season the salt makes efflorescences on the surface if the soil
is drying up. The process of efflorescence of salt in the dry season
and carrying away in the wet season is repeated from year to year.
The salt seems to me to be a neutral combination, and is in small
amount soluble in water.
    The mineral contains 1*7 per cent, hygroscopic water, and in the
substance soluble iu hydrochloric acid a very small amount of sul
phate of alumina.        The hardness is nearly 2, equal gypsum, specific
gravity 17.
    Heated to redness the mineral* turns from yellow to dark-brown
   * I assign to this mineral   the name of the island, and to the many names of

  and at  last to red-brown, the colour of oxide ; it loses in average 8 to
  9 per cent. sulphuric acid with combined         water. When dissolved in
  boiling hydrochloric    acid   a  snow-white    residuum      is obtained, which,
  nnder the microscope,      proves to be composed of extremely well-pre
 served shells of microscopic Radiolaria, belonging to different genera.
 The size of those mostly regular globular bodies ranges between
 08045 millim. and 0"1135 millim.             The quantity of this residuum
 amounts in a mean of three trials to 25 per cent.                  The quantity of
 soluble substance is therefore 73 per cent., if we take away 2 per
 cent. hygroscopic water.       This soluble substance is pure sulphate of
 oxide of iron with a very small amount of sulphate of alumina.                     The
 quantity of    the  sulphuric  acid   in the  mineral  was    directly determined
 by precipitation of the hydrochloric solution of the mineral with
 chloride of barium.       2,000 mgrms. of the mineral gave 1,250 mgrms.
 sulphate of baryta, corresponding to 431 mgrms. sulphuric acid. , The
 amount of this acid in the mineral is therefore 2185 per cent.                     The
 quantity    of  the  oxide  with   a   small  amount   of   alumina     is  51'5    per
 cent., corresponding to 36 per cent. metallic iron.
    No traces of copper or any other metal have been found in the
mineral ; a trace of arsenic, however, is observed, as is shown by
means of the copper-arsenic         test, by boiling the hydrochloric solution
 with a clean copper slip, which becomes coated with a thin deposit of
metallic arsenic.

    An account of the structure of the kidney of Chiton has long been
a  want in morphology. Middendorff,* in 1848, described a branched
gland lying ventrally on each side of the body cavity which he identi
fied as kidney ; but he records no observation on the strncture of the
objects  belonging to natural history derived from Cyprus     I  add a new one    ;  the
mineral  would bear the name " Cyprusit."

gland, and expressly states that he was not able to make ont its
opening or relation to other organs. Schiff,* ten years later, was
nnable to find this gland in Chiton pieeus, and throws doubt on Mid
dendorff's interpretation of its function.
   Von Jehringf has comparatively recently recorded some observations
on the kidney of Chiton, and starts from the position that no kidney
is known in Chiton, Middendorff's view as to the nature of the
branched gland having been sufficiently refuted by Schiff's later
observations.   Vou Jehring states that in the species of Chiton observed
by   him, the kidney consists of a branched gland lying ventral to the
rectum in the hinder part of the body cavity, and that it opens by a
single median pore ventral to the anus.

opening.
    While staying at Herm this summer             I   found a fair number of a
good-sized species of Chiton — Chiton discrepans ; and the results which
 I have obtained from the study of the anatomy of this form, especially
those which concern the kidney, seem to me sufficiently important for
immediate publication.        In the first place, I may mention that haveI
 seen nothing in any of my dissections or sections which in the least
supports von .Tehring's statements as to the existence of a median renal
 duct and opening ; and that my observations are entirely opposed to
the conclusion arrived at by this investigator as to the unpaired nature
 of the kidney of Chiton. On the contrary, Middendorff's observations,
so far as they went, were perfectly correct. The paired lateral branched
 gland described by the latter observer is part of the kidney.
    The kidney of Chiton is a paired gland with paired openings into
 the pallial groove and into the pericardium, and is constructed on the
 type always found in molluscan renal organs (fig. 1). It opens in the
 species  I  have chiefly examined (Chiton discrepans) into the pallial
 groove (fig. 1, r.o.) internal to, but on a level with the last gill (16).
 The duct runs from the opening round the outside border of the
 pallial nerve (fig. 2, r.o.), and then passes inwards to open into a
 bladder-like structure placed in the body cavity (fig. 1, D, and fig. 2, D).
 This bladder-like structure lies close to the body wall immediately
 beneath the pericardium (fig. 2, p.c), and it does not seem to extend
 backwards beyond the last gill.
    On a closer examination by means of sections, it is seen to be
 beset by a number of branched glandular creca, lying in the hinder
 part of the body cavity (fig. 2, Jet.), which open into it, and into a
 backward prolongation from it (fig. 1, hJc.). These branched glandular
 ca?ca on opening the body cavity are seen as a mass of tubes apparently
 interlacing with those of the opposite side, and lying ventral to the

 hinder part of the kidney of Chiton, which prove most conclusively
 that these hinder ventrally placed tubules do open in the way                    I  have
 stated.
    On examining the anterior end of the bladder-like structure it is
 found that it is continued forwards as a duct (fig. 1, k.d.), which
 receives, all along its course, the ducts of bunches of branching
 glandular coxsa, lying at the side of the body cavity (fig. 1, k.t.). These
 branching glandular casca constitute the gland described by Midden-
 dorff. Their structure precisely resembles that of the first described

  1881.]        On certain Points in   the  Anatomy    of Chiton.         125
 posterior tubules, which, open into the dilated part of the duct and its
 backward prolongation. The duct can be traced forward to about the
 level of the 4th shell-plate (fig. 1, T), at which point it turns sharply
 round and runs back parallel with the first part of its course.       A con
 siderable part of the gland lies in front of this turning point of tho
 duct ; the secretion of this part is poured into a branch given off from
the main duct at the bend (fig. 1, T). The posteriorly directed part
of the renal duct lies close to the dorsal edge of the part running
forward, and, like the latter, receives the efferent ducts of bunches of
glandular caeca (fig. 1). From the level of the 5th shell-plate (fig. 1, 0)
to its posterior termination (fig. 1, p.o.), about to be described, it
receives no glandular casca, but runs backwards as a simple duct
distinguishable by its brown colour, which is due to a deposit of
colouring matter in its walls. On reaching the level of the bladder-like
dilatation of the kidney duct first described, it applies itself to the dorsal
inner wall of that structure as far back as the level of the last gill.
At this point, which marks the hind border and the external opening
of the bladder, it runs outwards and then forwards (fig. 2, p.k.d.) in
close contact with the dorsal side of the lateral nerve cord.          It runs
forward to about the level of the penultimate gill, where it suddenly
stops and opens by a small pore into the pericardium (fig. 1, p.o.)
beneath, i.e., ventral to the anterior part of the auricle.
    Comparing the arrangement of the kidney of Chiton with that of
Anodon, there is seen to be a close agreement.          In both the kidney is
paired    and   consists of a gland    bent  on  itself, opening at the one
extremity into the pallial cavity, and at the other into the pericardium.
In both the kidney is unsegmented (a fact to be remembered when
the nature of the shell and gills of Chiton is discussed).          There is a
further agreement between these two animals in the relation of the
openings of the generative ducts to those of the renal ducts ; in both
the latter are placed close behind the former.
    With regard to the minute structure of the kidney of Chiton,             I
have no exact observations.       It is necessary to study it in the fresh
state. The inner borders of the cells lining the glandular caeca are
stated by von Jehring to be ciliated.
    The most internal part of the kidney duct, i.e., that which receives
no glandular caeca (fig. 1, 0 to p.k.d.), is, with the exception of a small
portion adjoining the pericardial opening, lined by columnar cells con
taining a yellow colouring matter, which gives this portion of the duct
a yellow colour, easily visible to the naked eye. This yellow colouring
 matter, which seems to be part of the excretion of the cells lining the
 duct, is absent in the part of the duct which runs forwards from the
 level of the hinder edge of the bladder to the pericardial opening
  (p.k.d. to p.o.). Here are found large columnar cells provided with
 long cilia, which line also the pericardial opening.

    The cells of the glandular caeca seem to have the structure usually
seen   in molluscan renal organs, and have been correctly described by
von Jehring.
    To sum up, the kidney of Chiton consists of—
    (1.) A duct opening to the exterior in the pallial groove behind the
generative opening, and internally into the pericardium.
    (2.) Glandular cceca opening into this duct.
    The duct may be described as consisting of three parts : —
    (1.) The part into which the glandular caeca of the kidney open.
This part is open behind where it opens to the exterior (fig. 1, D).
In front it bends round (fig. 1, T), and runs backwards to about
the level of the 5th shell-plate, where it changes its character, and is
continuous with (2) a duct (fig. 1, 0) containing brown colouring
matter in the columnar cells lining        it,
                                            and receiving no glandular caeca.
This part extends back to the level of the last gill, where        turns out
                                                                      it
wards, and becomes continuous with (3) a part running forward for                  a
short distance close to the lateral nerve, and lined by large ciliated
columnar cells.     This part opens in front at the level of the penulti
mate gill into the pericardium (fig. \,p.o.).          Iexpected to find the
communication     between    the two  parts  of  the renal duct behind in the
region of the bladder, and for some time          Iwas puzzled at not finding
it.     On mentioning    the   arrangement    of  parts to Mr. Balfour, he
suggested that the communication might possibly be found in front,
reasoning from the analogy of the structure of the kidney in other
Mollusca.     On examining the anterior part of the gland more care
fully, I  at once fonnd that his suggestion was correct, the two parts             of
 the gland communicating as       I have described.     Ihave no observations
to add to those of previous observers, on the general arrangement                  of
 the nervous system.      I may mention that the lateral and pedal nerves
have a coating of ganglion cells, and a central core of fibres.
    The animals are dioecious. The generative gland             unpaired and
                                                                 is
dorsal. The generative ducts are paired, and are attached to the
 hinder border of the gland, and open in Chiton discrepans into the
 pallial groove between the 13th and 14th gill, in a line with the open
 ing of the renal duct. The duct passes dorsal to the anterior end                 of
 the dilated part of the renal duct (fig.        g.d.) and then curls round

   I hope to be able to give a fuller account of these and other points in
the anatomy of Chiton at some future period, for the preparation of
which it will be necessary to obtain some fresh specimens.
VI. " The Action of Cutting Tools." By A. Mallock. Com
    municated by Lord Rayleigh, F.R.S. Received Novem
    ber 4, 1881.
    The action of cutting tools has not often been treated from a theo
retical point of view ; in fact I    only know of two papers on the sub
ject,  one  by  Professor   Willis  and  the other by Mr. Babbage.       Of
these Professor Willis's paper is purely geometrical, showing what
angles the edges of tools may make with one another if the cutting
angles are to be such as experience          shows to answer best.      Mr.
Babbage,   on  the  other hand,  does  not  enter at all on the question of
the shape of the tool, but by making certain assumptions as to the
relation between the dimension of the shaving removed by a tool and
the work required to remove    it,   he deduces some results showing how
to remove   a  given amount of material most economically. His con
clusions cannot be considered correct, nor do they agree with experi
ence (see Note 1).  I     do not attempt in the following paper to give
any dynamical     investigation  of the action of tools, in fact
                                                              it  would be
almost impossible to do so without a more extended knowledge of the
laws which govern the strains in bodies subjected to large forces,
 but merely to classify the various actions which observation shows to
 be caused by the progress of the tool, and to quantify approximately
 the work expended in each.        For this purpose, shavings from great
                                                                   a
 variety of substances were examined both in the course of their forma
 tion (by  a microscope attached to the toolholder) and after they were
removed.
  Among the substances examined may be mentioned four or five
samples of wrought iron, and as many of steel, cast iron, gun metal,
brass, copper, lead, zinc, hard paraffin, soap, and clay.
   This last-mentioned substance was found extremely useful in
examining the formation of the shavings, for by altering the amount
of water   itcontained its behaviour under the tool could be made to

resemble    almost any of the others, and at the same time the forces
required  to  take large cuts were not greater than could be conveniently
applied by hand.
   Sections   were  made    of many    of the metallic shavings, and the
polished surfaces of these when washed with dilute nitric acid showed,
their internal structure very well.

    It will be seen that there is little difference in any of these, though
 the   materials are of all degrees of hardness, and vary in thickness
 from three- eighths of an inch, the thickest iron shaving examined, to
 •003.
    Indeed the action at the edge of the tool seems identical in all
 cases, such differences as there are being due to the action of the face
of the tool on the shaving, while the latter is being pushed out of the
 way ; and this action depends on some of the physical constants of the
 substance operated on, chiefly its coefficients of friction on the metal
of the tool and on itself, but in part also on its ductility, and in some
cases, as in lead, on the property which freshly formed surfaces have
of reuniting under pressure.
    The tools do not act, properly speaking, by cutting but by shearing,
and the shaving removed by them may be accurately described as a
metallic slate.
    This remark does not apply to acute-edged tools, such as razors and
penknives.
   The difference between cutting and shearing may be defined thus :
Conceive the substance to be cut to be divided into an infinite number
of cubic elements by parallel planes at right angles to one another ; if
in a portion of this removed by a tool the elements remain cubes, the
removal has been effected by pure cutting.           If, however, they are
only distorted but are all unaltered in volume, the removal has been
effected by pure shearing ; if they are both deformed and altered in
volume, both cutting and shearing have been called into play.
                                     Fig. 9.
   Let ABCD be a section of the substance under the action of the
tool, GEP the tool, H the shaving, CD the undisturbed surface of the
substance, and    AB  the direction of the cut.

132                           Mr. A. Mallock.                      [Dec. 8.
    The advance of the tool violently distorts the material in its neigh
bourhood, and presently along the line ec the distortion becomes too
great for the substance to preserve its continuity (Note 2), the lamina
ECec then begins to slide on ec, and its base Ee to move up the
face of the tool, while the point of the tool is repeating the distortion
and separation on fresh material ahead.
    This in all the cases I have examined is the manner in which all
tools, except those with very acute angles, act.
    The curvature of shavings appears to be due to the crushing of the
base of the laminae while passing over the face of the tool, thus
making them thicker at that end than at the outer surface.
    The effect of the friction between the laminae and the tool has the
opposite tendency of thinning out the ends of the laminae and preventing
the curvature, so that when from want of lubrication or the nature
of the material the friction becomes excessive, the shavings are
nearly straight.
    The shaving is generally shorter than the path of the tool, which
shows that BED is less than 45°.
    I  will now attempt to take account of the forces which are brought
into play by the action of the tool.
    These are due to (1) elastic distortion, (2) elastic bending, (3) per
manent distortion, (4) permanent bending, (5) internal friction, i.e.,
the friction of the laminae sliding over one another, (6) the friction of
the material on the tool, and (7) if the tool is not considered as being
perfectly sharp, the radius of curvature of the edge will appear in a
term giving the limit to the rate of distortion in its neighbourhood.
    If the tool is perfectly sharp the rate of distortion at the edge is in
 finite, and the material at the edge can offer no resistance to its pro
gress unless capable of infinite distortion without rupture.
    This is easily seen to be the case by the following considerations : —
                                    Fio. 10.
    Let ABCD (fig. 10) be the section of a parallelopiped of any mate
 rial, and let it be distorted as shown by the dotted lines until rupture
 takes place.    The work expended in bringing it to its distorted state
 depends on B&, i.e., the distance AD must be moved before the limit of
 distortion is reached, and this is simply proportional to BD, the

 thickness   of the parallelopiped ; hence when BD is nothing the work
 is also nothing.    The rate of distortion, i.e., the distortion produced
 by  a definite motion    of AD, is inversely as BD, and is therefore in
finite when    BD=0.
    Thus, when the rate of distortion is infinite and the    limit of distor
tion is finite, no work is required to effect the rupture.
    In the case of the tool it is, of course, only actually at the edge that
the rate of distortion is infinite ; but if it were possible to apply suit
able forces simultaneously at every point of a solid through which a
surface of separation was desired to pass, that separation          could be
effected with no expenditure of work whatever.

    Considering these terms in order : —
    The first ought always to be small if the tool is sharp.
    Q in the second term is proportional to t, and is probably a function
 also of 0 and 0, but as observation shows that 0 is independent of 0,
 that is to say, that for a given material any form of tool that can be
 employed causes sliding to begin in the same plane, it seems likely
 that the reaction due to distortion should not vary much with 0, and
 that for the present purpose Q may be regarded as t X constant.
    The internal friction vanishes when
                             cos 0 + 0=— /»jsin0+0                              (A),
 that is, when the resultant force through the face of the tool is parallel
 to  EC.
    When this is the case, however, there is a large component tending
 to make the tool dig into the substance, so that the form indicated by
 A is not one which can be used in practice without certain precautions.

 1881. J               The Action   of  Cutting Tools.                       135
The same objection applies to making the fourth term a minimum by
 putting
                                0 + 0=90°                           !   .   (B).
    Perhaps as good a value as any for 0 is that which makes the
resultant force through the face of the tool parallel to the direction of
motion.    This value is given by the equation
                              cot0=«i      .   .    .   .                   (C).
   The values obtained for 0 for this expression agree fairly with those
in common use, or at least are quite compatible with them, considering
the uncertainty of the values of /»j for high pressures.       The elastic and
permanent bending is small for such values of 0 as can be used in
tools for metals, the transverse     strength of the shaving (which is
some hundred times less than that of a piece of the substance of the
same dimensions in its natural state) not permitting it to transmit
large bending forces.
   In true cutting tools, where 0 is very small, nearly the whole force
acting on the blade arises from friction under the pressure on the
sides of the tool caused by the bending.
   It is evident, therefore, that as 0 passes from large values to small,
the importance of the term in t2 will continually increase.
   All the sources of resistance above mentioned, except the first and
last, which should be small, are proportional to the thickness of the
shaving and, of course, also to its breadth.
   Thus to remove a given volume of material will require the same
expenditure of work, whether it be effected by one thick cut or several
thinner ones.
   In practice, however, the constant friction of the machinery em
ployed always make thick cuts the most economical.           The construction
of machines, and the character of work generally, confines within
rather narrow limits the thickness of the cut which it is possible to
take, for the force required must not be large enough to sensibly bend
or distort the substance as a whole.
   It would be a great advantage if tools could be so held or shaped
that their accidental vibrations should not be sustained but extinguished
by the reactions which they call into play ; bnt to make this possible
the phase of the vibration of the tool must precede that of the reaction
which it causes by some time less than half the period of the tool, or, in
other words, the resistance experienced by the tool must increase with
its velocity. Now friction between solids being rather greater at low
than at high velocities, the sliding of the shaving on the tool tends to
keep up a vibration once started, and the same may be said of the
 forces due to the distortion of the substance, which are at a maximum
just before a fresh lamina (such as e    ....    c, fig. 9) begins to slide, and

  then suddenly drop to a minimum.          It is plain also that a tool with a
  tendency to dig will call into play forces of a like character.
     Vibrations are in some degree neutralised, and digging entirely
  avoided, by so shaping the shanks of tools that the centre about
  which they vibrate is in advance of the normal to the direction of
  motion through the cutting edge.

     Let p be the distance   of the centre of flexure (-•) from the cutting8
 edge ( P), a the angle which the line joining the centre of flexure and
 edge makes with the normal, and c« the angular distance of the tool
 from its mean position, the thickness of the shaving removed is t+pJa
 tan a, and if t be the period of the vibration of the tool, cx is propor
 tional to sincv, or ca—K sin ct, say, k and c being constants; and since
 the pressure exerted by the shaving on the tool is proportional to its
 thickness, px sin ct tan « also expresses the variable part of the reaction.
 The effect of this variable pressure is neither to sustain nor extinguish
 the vibration, but to increase in effect the rigidity of the tool by a
 quantity proportional to tan a.
    In tools designed for rough work a is usually small, but when the
quality of the surface left by the tool is of more importance than the
thickness of the shavings which it can remove, it may be largely
increased with advantage.

    acquainted.       The  general    conclusion     to  which  the  foregoing   remarks
    point are —  :
       (1.) Work has to be expended in dividing substances merely because
     the necessary forces cannot he applied locally enough              ;the more local
     the application of the       force, the    lessis   the travel, and therefore the
     work required to effect the separation.
        (2.) All ordinary tools act by shearing the substance on which they
    operate in a plane inclined at an angle of less than 45° to the plane
    or surface swept out by the edge of the tool.
        (3.) To remove a given volume of material requires nearly the same
    amount of work, as far as the tool itself            is   concerned, whether       beit
    removed      in   few  cuts    or  many     ; but   the  constant   friction  of  the
    machinery always makes the thicker cuts more economical in practice.
        (4.) Tools for heavy work should be so shaped that the resultant
    force on them may lie nearly in the direction of motion. In order that
    this may be the case,         must be determined by equation (C).
                            0 0
         Ifa less value for      than this be adopted, less work will be required
    to effect the same cut, but the tool will have a tendency to dig.
       (5.) In tools which are merely required to leave good surface and
                                                                    a
    not to take cats of any appreciable depth, the angles are unimportant.
       One curious point connected with the subject of cutting tools                 the is
    manner in which their action           isfacilitated by lubricants.       Lubricants
    seem to act by lessening the friction            between  the  face of the tool and
    the shaving, and the difficulty        isto see how the lubricant can get there,
    since the only apparent way       is   round the edge of the tool, and there               it
    might be expected that the contact between the tool and the substance
    would be too close to admit of its passage. Somehow or other, how
    ever, some of the lubricant does find its way between the shaving and
    the tool, and perhaps also into the substance of the shaving.
       Some metals, copper for instance, when unlubricated, actually refuse
    to slide over the face of the tool, and the metal         is    then driven before
    the   tool  in  a  growing lump,      as   stiff  mud   would    be before     board
                                                                                     a
f   pushed through     it  (fig. 6). The separation in these cases does not take
    place at the edge of the tool, but some distance beneath it.

                                 (Abstract.)
    This paper is an account of a series of experiments made at the
Akabane Engineering Works, Tokio, for the purpose of investigating
some points connected with earthquake motion.         The mode of experi
ment    consisted in creating a disturbance at a point on the earth's
surface by allowing a heavy block of iron (1,710 lbs.) to fall from a
height (35 feet), and observing the resulting motion produced in the
earth at points variously situated relatively to the centre of disturbance.
The centre of disturbance was situated near to one corner of a
pond about 10 feet deep, and close to the foot of a small steep hill, the
remaining gronnd being very nearly level, and composed of hardened
mud, which extended to a depth of from 20 to 30 feet.          The configu
ration of the gronnd here briefly described is clearly shown by means
of a map accompanying the complete paper.           In the earlier experi
ments a number of similar vessels of mercury were placed at the
different points, and the vibrations produced on the surface taken as a
rough indication of the intensity of the disturbance at the point.
This method of observation showed with considerable definiteness
where the motion became insensible.        These preliminary experiments
showed that the disturbance could be distinctly propagated to a dis
tance of 650 feet (which was the greatest distance available) ; that
the pond cut off the disturbance from points beyond its distant side if
these points were sufficiently removed from the corner, but that the
hill did not cut off the vibrations.
'
    In subsequent experiments more definite observations were made
by using seismographic apparatus, and by this means the following
 conclusions were reached.
    A disturbance    emanating from a centre as above described, pro
 duced   at least two distinct sets of vibrations.   One of these sets has

the direction of motion in the line      joining the centre of disturbance
and the point of observation, while the other set has the direction of
motion at right angles to that line.      The first of these is denominated
the direct wave,     and the second    the transverse     wave.    The direct
wave has a greater amplitude and a slightly shorter period of motioD
at the sonrce, but seems to die out more rapidly than the transverse
wave.     The amplitude of the direct vibrations seems never to have
exceeded 0'5 millim. at 50 feet, and Ol millim. at 250 feet from
the centre.     The amplitude of vibration was very nearly inversely
as the distance from the source.         The direct wave was completely
cut off by the pond and nearly, if not completely, by the hill,
but the transverse wave extended along the distant side of the pond
to a considerable distance, and was little affected by the hill.        When
the motion of a point on the earth's surface was registered by
means of a seismograph, it was found to be such as would result from
the composition of two harmonic motions of different period, and in
different directions. One of the most important points attended to in
these experiments was the determination of the velocity of propaga
tion for the different waves. The method finally adopted for this
purpose was to mark by means of a telegraphic arrangement, simul
taneously, and at definite intervals, on two smoked glass plates, placed
at different distances along the same line from the source, the same
instant of time. These plates were moved by clockwork, and were
used for the reception of the seismograph record.
   It is evident that the time-marks on the plate give the means of
comparing the times of arrival of the direct, or the transverse wave,
according to circumstances at the two stations, and hence, knowing
tho time-interval between the marks on the plates, the velocity of
propagation could readily be calculated.
   As the result of these observations the surprisingly low velocity of
438 feet per second for the direct, and 357 feet per second for the
transverse wave, was obtained.         The soft nature of the material
through which the disturbance was propagated is given as the
probable reason for this result.
   The results of similar experiments by Mr. Robert Mallet, at the
 Hellgate explosions, in New York Harbour, are referred to. At the
conclusion of the paper an example of the records obtained in actual
 earthquakes is given and briefly described.

            On the Electrolytic Diffusion of Liquids." By G. Gore,
              LL.D., F.R.S. Received November 8, 1881.

 of phenomena resulting from the passage of an electric current verti-
8cally  through the boundary surfaces of mutual contact of two
 electrolytes lying upon each other.    As it was not possible by means
 of the apparatus employed in that research to definitely ascertain
 whether the mass of liquid expanded or moved as a whole in the line
of the current, I devised the following arrangement for the purpose
of more conclusively testing that question, and to obtain additional
-data to assist in explaining the phenomena previously observed.
   A is a glass vessel containing the heavier liquid, B is a glass tube
about 15 centims. long and 2 centims. diameter, containing the lighter
solution, and capable of being raised and lowered by means of the
rack C and a pinion (not shown in the sketch), attached to a fixed
upright support. The tube B is closed at the lower end by an
india-rubber bung, in a hole in the centre of which is fixed the open
 glass meniscus tube D, about 16 millims. long, and having a bore of
about 6 millims. ; it is also closed at the top by a perforated bung,
 through which proceeds an open glass tube E, of somewhat smaller

142            On the Electrolytic Diffusion    of Liquids.        [Dec. 8.
diameter than the meniscus tube, and about 15 centims. long. To the
upper end of E is attached an india-rubber tube F, provided -with a
pinch-tap G. H and       I are two sheet platinum electrodes, each about
7 centims. long, and 18 millims. wide, for connexion with a voltaic
battery. The connecting wire of H is hermetically sealed in a glass
tube, which fits air-tight into the bung.
   In using this apparatus, the vessel A is shifted from its place, and
the heavier liquid poured into it.     The tube B is then filled by means
of suction at J  with the lighter liquid up to a level in E, a little above
the bung.    The tube F is then closed by means of the pinch-tap G,
the vessel A replaced, and B, &c, lowered by means of the rack and
pinion until the pressure of liquid in A just balances that in B, the
difference of level being approximately determined beforehand,           by
taking the specific gravities of the two liquids. A definite meniscus is
then easily formed in the tube D, by opening the pinch-tap and
raising B until a drop of liquid issues below, and then lowering it a
minute distance.     It is particular that no air bubble exists in B, and
in order to facilitate the escape of any, the interior of the upper bung
is made of a funnel shape, and coated very smoothly with sealing
wax.
   In an experiment I made with this apparatus, the heavier liquid
was a solution of nitrate of mercury of specific gravity 1*30, and the
lighter one a solution of cupric nitrate, specific gravity 1"22.       With
an upward current from 18 Grove's elements in single series, a colour
less horizontal line soon appeared below the meniscus in D, advanced
downward, and underflowed the end of the meniscus tube. Neither
the meniscus in the lower tube D, nor that in the upper one E, shifted
 in position during the passage of the current. These results were
repeatedly verified with the meniscus at different distances, varying
from one-sixteenth to one-eighth of an inch above the bottom of the
tube.
    Remarks. — These results show first, and most conclusively, that
liquid diffused downwards continuously through the meniscus during
 the passage of the upward current ; and second, that during the con
tinuance of the current, either no manifest expansion occurred in the
bulk of the liquid in B, and that equal volumes of liquid diffused in
two opposite directions through the lower meniscus ; or, that any
expansion of the bulk of liquid in tube B was compensated for by
downward diffusion of an equal bulk of liquid. Another possibility is
that the united volumes of the metallic deposited copper, and of the
 acid element from which it had been separated by electrolysis, was
greater than before such separation, and that this was compensated for
 by the volume of liquid diffused downwards through the meniscus.

    The physical properties of these bodies are described,                and their
 coefficients   of  contraction    and expansion are determined, and the
 volumes between 0° C. and the melting point are deduced therefrom.
    A general discussion of the results is afterwards given, in which
 these alloys are compared with the five chlorobromiodides of silver
 previously described (" Proc. Roy. Soc," vol. 25, p. 303), and with
 the lead-silver iodide alloy, the properties of which were described in
 the last communication of the author on this subject ("Proc. Roy.
 Soc," vol. 32, p. 540).
    The following are some of the facts noticed in connexion with the
 alloys : —
    1. The specific      gravity varies but slightly, viz., from           5-7302 to
 5'6950,    and  is  little  above the mean specific gravity of             the con
 stituents.
    2. The melting points are in all cases much lower, for                while the
 melting point of iodide of silver is 527° C, and of iodide                of copper

144              On   the Coefficients   of Expansion,    fyc.         [Dec. 8,
601° C., the highest melting point of any one of the alloys is 514°             C,
and the lowest 493° C.
  3. Some of the alloys possess three points of similar density, and
some two, at different temperatures.  They are resinous in fracture
and transparent in thin layers.        When pulverised they furnish
brilliantly yellow powders, unaffected by light.
  4. When heated in a current of carbonic anhydride they volatilise
very slowly. Heated in dry oxygen iodine is freely evolved, and oxide
of copper appears on the surface of the mass. When heated in dry
hydrogen, hydriodic acid is produced, and the metal is reduced.
  5. The coefficients of expansion of the alloys below the point at
which contraction on heating commences, was found to decrease as the
percentage of iodide of silver was augmented.    Thus —
          Percentage of   Agl.                 Coefficient of expansion.

   The same fact was observed in the case of the chlorobromiodides of
silver. A curve table shows results.
     6. While the iodide of silver commences its considerable contrac
tion at 142° C., the five chlorobromiodides of silver, the percentage
of iodide of silver in which varies from 26"1692 to 73'9285, and the
lead-silver iodide alloy, the percentage of iodide of silver in which
amounts to 33'794, all commence their contraction at 124° C, that                is,
18° C. lower, although the coefficients of expansion of the associated
bodies necessarily differ. Thus     it would appear that 124° C.       the is
temperature at which iodide of silver commences its passage from the
crystalline into the amorphous condition, when freed from the attrac
tion of its own molecules, provided no other attraction or influence
supervenes ;   while the attraction exerted when exists unalloyed with
                                                    it
any   other substance, and when its molecules are hence much nearer to
each other, raises the point of commencement of the change to 142° C.
       The probable cause of this   isdiscussed.
  8. 7.
       When the same result was looked for in the case of the copper-
silver iodide alloys it was not found. In fact, the presence of the
iodide of copper, instead of promoting the assimilation of molecular
motion, and lowering the point at which the change from the crystal
line into the plastic condition commences, was found to considerably
raise it, although the coefficient of expansion of the iodide of copper          is
lower than that of either chloride or bromide of silver, or of the iodide
of lead, which enter into the composition of the other alloys.

                       Institut de France, Paris, 5th of December, 1881.
    My dear Mr. President, — In the meeting of the Academy of to-day
M. Dumas has read a letter from Professor Williamson, informing the
Academy that the Copley Medal has been awarded to me.                I  know
                                                                I
well and appreciate highly the value of that reward, and beg you to
offer to the Royal Society my sincere thanks.
    That illustrious body honoured me, seventeen years ago, by electing
me as one of its foreign members, and now has been pleased to crown
my far advanced scientific career.
    I beg leave to give to my English colleagues a proof of my respect
ful regard by presenting to them the first results of new researches on
the synthesis of oxygenated bases.          By the reaction of glycol-chlor-
hydrine on collidine and on qninoliue I have obtained new alkaloids,
which present a close connexion with neurine. Very soon I intend to
send over to Professor Williamson a paper on that subject.
                          I am, with the highest regards,
                                      Sincerely yours,

I. " On the Electromotive Properties of the Leaf of Dionaja
       in the Excited and Unexcited States."               By J. Burdon
       Sanderson, M.D., F.R.S., &c. Received October 27, 1881.
                                  (Abstract.)
   The paper consists of five parts.       Part I is occupied by the exami
nation of two experimental researches, relating to the subject, which

 1881.]       Electromotive Properties          of  the  Leaf of Dioiicea.        149
 have been    published in Germany since the date of the author's first
 communication to the Royal Society in 1873,* namely, that of Pro
fessor Munk on Dionaea, and of Dr. Kunkel on electromotive                  action in
 the living organs of plants.         According to Dr. Munk, the electric pro
perties   of the   leaf may   be  explained on the theory that each cylindrical
cell of its parenchyma is an electromotor, of which the middle is, in
the unexcited state, negative to the ends, and that on excitation the
electromotive forces of the cells of the upper layer undergo diminution,
those of the lower layer an increase.                He accounts for the diphasic
character of the electrical disturbance which follows mechanical exci
tation by attributing it to the opposite electromotive reactions of the
two layers of cells.          According to this theory, the cells resemble in
their properties the " electromotive muscle-molecules " (" Unter-
suchungen," vol. i, p. 682, 1848, of du Bois Reymond) differing from
them in so far that their poles are positive instead of being negative
to their equatorial zones. Professor Munk has constructed a schematic
leaf in which the cells are represented              by zinc cylinders with copper
zones.     A schema so made is said by him to have the electromotive
properties of the unexcited leaf.
   Dr. Kunkel's experiments have for their purpose to show that all
the electromotive phenomena of plants may be explained                     as conse
quences of the movement of water in the organs at the surfaces of
which they manifest themselves.
   Part   II  contains a description of the apparatus and methods used in
the present investigation.
   In Part    III   are given the experimental results relating to the electro
motive properties in the unexcited state, a subjectof which the discussion
was deferred in the paper communicated by the author (with Mr. Pago)
in 1876.f The fundamental fact relating to the distribution of electrical
tension on the surface of the leaf when in the unexcited state is found
to be that (whatever may be the previous electrical relation between
the two surfaces) the upper surface hecomes after one or two excita
tions negative to the under, and remains so for some time.                       This
difference of potential between the two surfaces the author calls the
" cross difference." It is shown that, under the conditions stated, its
occurrence is constant, and that the differences of potential which
present themselves when other points of the surface of the leaf are
compared, may be explained as derived from, or dependent on, this
fundamental difference.
   Part   IV   relates to the immediate        electrical results of excitation, i.e.,
to the electrical phenomena of the excitatory process. In investigating
these the author takes as the point of departure, an experiment which
 includes and serves to explain those obtained by other methods, and

150        Electromotive Properties     of  the   Leaf of Dioncea.     [Dec.  15,
is therefore termed     the   "fundamental experiment."           It consists in
measuring the successive differences of potential (cross differences)
which present themselves between two opposite points on the upper
and on the under surface of one lobe of the leaf, during periods which
precede, include, and follow the moment at which the opposite lobe
is mechanically or electrically excited.         In this experiment it is found
that, provided that the conditions are favourable to the vigour of the
leaf, the variations of the cross difference (called the excitatory
variation) occur in the following order : —
   Before excitation (particularly             Upper     snrface    negative    to
if   the leaf has been previously          under.
excited).
   At   the moment of excitation.               Sudden negativity of under
                                           surface,    attaining its maximum
                                           in about half a second, when the
                                           difference amounts to not less
                                           than 8Jy Daniell.
   After excitation.                           Rapidly increasing negativity
                                           of the upper surface, beginning
                                           about 1*5" and culminating about
                                           3" after excitation. and slowly
                                           snbsiding.
   This subsidence is not complete, for, as has been said, the lasting
difference between the two surfaces is augmented — the upper surface
becoming more negative after each excitation ("after-effect ").
    When by a similar method two points are taken for comparison on
opposite lobes, the phenomena are more complicated, but admit of
being explained as resulting from the more simple case above stated,
in which only a few strata of cells are interposed between the leading
off electrodes.
    In Part V the relation of the leaf to different modes of excitation
 is investigated. As regards electrical excitation the results are as
follows : — If a voltaic current is led across one lobe by non-polarisa-
ble electrodes applied to opposite surfaces (the other lobe being led off
as in the fundamental experiment) a response (excitatory variation)
occurs at the moment that the current is closed, provided that the
strength of the current is adequate, and not much more than adequate.
 No response occurs at breaking the current. When a current of more
 than adequate strength is used, and its direction is downwards, the
 response at closing is followed by several others.          This effect does not
 happen    when   the current  is directed   upwards.      To  evoke a response
 a current must be much stronger if directed upwards than if directed
 downwards through the same electrodes.             Weak currents cease to act
 when their duration is reduced to 8iho" > ^or stronger ones the limit is

  1881.]      On some Effects of Transmitting Electric Currents.            151
 shorter.     Inadequate currents, if directed downwards, prodnce nega
 tivity   of the  upper surface, which lasts for several seconds after the
 current is broken. This effect is limited to the surfaces through which
 the current is led.     Its direction shows it is not dependent on polarisa
 tion.    By opening induction currents, if their strength does not much
 exceed the limit of adequacy, a leaf may be excited at intervals for
 several hoars without failure.         Weaker currents are more effectual
 when directed downwards than when directed upwards.             If two inade
 quate induction currents follow one another at any interval less than
0"84 and gTeater than 0"'02, they may evoke a response.                In this
case a response follows the second excitation.            When a leaf is sub
jected to a series of induction currents at short intervals (aV) tne
 response occurs after a greater or less number of excitations.          If the
 temperature is gradually diminished, the number is increased by each
 diminution.      All of the above statements relating to excitability refer
 to plants kept in a moist atmosphere at 32 — 35° C.
     Prom the preceding facts, and others which are stated in the paper,
 the author infers (1) that the
                                     " cross difference " is the expression of
 electromotive forces which have their seat in the living protoplasm of the
 parenchyma cells, and that it is due to the contact of cells in different
states of physiological activity ; (2) that the second phase of the
 excitatory     variation is probably dependent on the diminution of
turgor of the excited cells, and therefore on the migration of liquid ;
 (3) but that no such explanation can possibly be accepted of the
 phenomena of the first phase, the time relations of which, particularly
 its sudden accession and rapid propagation, show it to be the

 physiology.

    This communication treats of a class of electro-magnetic rotations
 observed and examined by the author.          The rotations are produced in
 liquids by means of axial electric currents, either in the interior of
 vertical magnets, electro or permanent, or near the poles of such
  magnets, and differ from rotations previously produced in liquids
  placed in those positions, by the absence of radial currents, to the

 152      Dr.   (jr. Gore.      On some Effects    of Transmitting       [Dec.   15r
influence of which rotations in the interior of hollow magnets have
hitherto been ascribed.*
   It is here shown that a column of an electrolyte placed under similar
conditions to an iron wire or rod, when subjected to electro-magnetic
torsion (i.e., enclosed by an electro-magnetic helix, and traversed
axially by an electric current), is twisted in a similar manner to the
wire or bar. This effect, however, in the case of a liquid is not limited
to paramagnetic substances, nor is the direction of torsion altered by
the magnetic character of the liquid.
   The rotations produced in liquids by means of axial currents are
opposite in direction at the two ends of the voltaic helix, are strongest
at the poles, and at a little distance beyond them, and null at the
centre of the tube ; they may be produced at a distance of several
inches beyond the poles.          The directions of rotation within the tube,
and to a short distance beyond the poles, are in the case of an electro
or permanent magnet opposite to those produced by a voltaic selenoid.
A magnet tube, therefore, has three points of no rotation with an
axial current, viz., one at its centre, and one near each end, whilst a
selenoid has only the former one. The existence of the outer neutral
points produced by a magnet depends upon the position of the latter
to the liquid, and the distances of those points from the poles of the
magnet are affected by various circumstances, which are described in
the communication. If the magnet is wholly above or below the
portion of liquid traversed by the axial current, the outer neutral
points do not occur.
   By the influence of a vertical current, the liquid as a whole may be
made to rotate in either single direction ; the motion at one end of the
column, therefore, is not dependent upon the opposite direction of
motion at the other, and torsion is not a necessary form of the effect.
The reaction of the liquid in the production of the rotation is neither
upon another portion of the liquid, nor upon the electrodes, nor upon
the walls of the containing vessel, but upon the adjacent magnetised
body, and the rotation of the liquid is confined to the portion traversed
by the vertical current.
   Under suitable conditions, the phenomenon of rotation is definite,
conspicuous, and strong, and is usually more powerful with a tubular
electro- magnet than with a voltaic coil alone. A very thin iron tube
weakens the effect of the coil, whilst a thick one reverses the motion
 and makes it stronger. The system of rotations, either with a coil or
 magnet, is also perfectly symmetrical. The directions of rotation
produced by a coil alone are independent of the magnetic nature of
the wire of the coil. Like other electro-magnetic effects, the rotations
are not prevented by the interposition of metallic screens, provided

 by the well8known principles of electro8magnetism."

 they are non-magnetic.     The rotations may be easily produced by the
 aid of a current from three or four Groves elements, especially if
permanent bar-magnets are used instead of a voltaic coil. The rota
tions by means of vertical currents in the liquid may be produced by
the influence of coils or magnets, either above or below the liquids, as
well as around it; with magnets, however, in the former positions, no
external reversal points occur. A magnet placed entirely above or
below the liquid produces the same direction of rotation as a coil
placed either above, below, or around it.        The direction of rotation
produced    in a liquid above  or within  a coil by an upward current in
the liquid agrees with that produced by a radial centripetal one within
the coil.
   A rotation apparatus of the same kind, interposed as a screen, does
not prevent or appear to affect the movements.
   Each electrode may be made to separately revolve in the presence of
a coil or magnet by the well-known influence of the radial currents
in them ; and the directions of rotation are the same with a tubular
magnet as with a coil. In this respect the motion produced by radial
currents differs from that produced by axial ones. With each elec
trode diverging currents within the coil or magnet produce dextro,
and converging ones laevo, rotation when the north pole is above. The
rotation of the electrodes by means of radial currents appears to be
independent of that produced in the liquid by means of axial ones.
   The rotation also of the vessel containing the liquid may be obtained
independently of that of the electrodes, by means of the vertical
current in the liquid, without the aid of the radial currents in the
electrodes.
   The rotations produced by a vertical axis current are not confined
to liquids, but may also be produced in a solid conductor, and probably,
therefore, with any body conveying an electric current or discharge.
   If we regard a coil as a collection of currents, with a vertical current
proceeding upwards or downwards from the centre of the coil, either
on its inside or outside, the flow of the liquid is in the same direction
as the current in the coil ; and similarly with a vertical current pro
ceeding in like manner from the central parts of a tubular iron or steel
magnet, the flow of liquid is in the same direction as that of the
nearest layer of hypothetical electric currents in the iron.
   The directions of rotation produced in liquids by means of radial
currents inside a magnet or coil are the same as in the solid electrodes,
and are la?vo at all positions with centripetal currents, and dextro with
centrifugal ones, when the north pole is above. A given direction of
radial current, whether in the electrodes or electrolytes, or above or
below a given pole, provided that the pole was not reversed in posi
tion, produced the same direction of rotation. The direction of rota
tion produced by a radial current approaching a vertical coil or magnet

from the outside is the same as that produced by such a current
approaching it from the inside.
   Various other phenomena, such as temporary reversals of the direc
tion of rotation, successive action of the coil and iron tube, &c., &c.,
are recorded in the paper.
   With a Selenoid. —An axial current flowing upwards from a south to
a north seeking pole, produces dextro rotation at the former and laevo
rotation at the latter.
   With a Tabular Magnet. — These two directions are reversed at all
distances between the two neutral points near the poles of the magnets,
 but not beyond.      The phenomena, therefore, of rotation are more
complex with a tubular magnet than with a selenoid.         The directions
of rotation produced by a vertical current outside a vertical coil or
magnet are the same as those produced by it inside a coil alone.
   The reversals of direction of rotation near the poles, which occur
when a tubular magnet is employed, appear to be due to the inner
surface of the magnet, and to the position of that surface in relation
to the vertical current in the liquid.    The direction of rotation and
the points of reversal appear to be all independent of each other.
   The action of radial currents is more simple than that of axial ones,
especially near the poles of a magnet.    With radial currents, either in
the liquid or electrodes, there is no reversal, either at the centre of the
magnet or coil, or at the poles or beyond them, or near the outside of
the coil or magnet.
   The experiments show the entire group of rotations produced inside
and outside a vertical coil (with and without an iron core), and near
its poles, by radial currents ; also the group of rotations produced by
vertical currents inside and outside a vertical coil and near its poles,
and also those produced inside and outside and near the poles of a
vertical coil with a tubular iron core, by such currents.
   The experiments show in a conspicuous manner the difference of
property of the interior surface of a hollow magnet and of that of a
voltaic selenoid having the same kind of poles at their corresponding
ends.    This difference of property is well known, but is illustrated in
the paper in a new way experimentally.
III.  " Preliminary Report to the Solar Physics Committee on the
      Sun-spot Observations made at Kensington."                By J. N.
      Lockyer. Communicated to the Royal Society at the re
      quest of the Solar Physics Committee. Received Novem
      ber 29, 1881.
   Since the commencement of the observations, in November, 1879, of
 the twelve most widened lines in sun-spots, about 220 observations have

 1881.]      Solar Physics Committee on Sun-Spot Observations.              155
been made      ; the maps for the first and second hundred observations
have been     drawn up and the tabulation of the first hundred completed.
The reductions are being earned on, and           I  hope shortly to be able to
lay a full report upon the 200 observations before the Committee, but
desire, in the mean time, to bring the present preliminary one before
it.
    The reduction of the first hundred observations, extending from
November, 1879, to September, 1880, has yielded the following re
sults   : —
    1. An immense variation, from           spot to spot, is to be observed
between     the  most  widened  lines seen   in the first hundred observations.
Change of quantity or density will not account for this variation.           To
investigate this point     I had  the  individual observations of lines seen
in the spectrum of iron plotted out on strips of paper, and             I  then
tried to arrange them in order, but       I  could not sncceed, for even when
the observations were divided into six groups about half of them were
left outstanding.
    2. If   we consider the lines of any one substance, there is as much
inversion between these lines as between the lines of any two metals.
By the term inversion I mean of any three lines A, B, C, that we may
get A and B without C, A and C without B, B and C without A, and
so on.
    3. We have reason to believe, from experiments made here, that
most    of the lines seen in the spectrum of iron volatilised in the oxy-
hydrogen blowpipe flame are amongst the most widened lines.
    4. Certain lines of iron have been seen at rest, while other adjacent
lines seen    in  the spectrum  of this metal in the same field of view have
shown change        of wave-length.
    5.  The spectrum of iron in the solar spectrum is more like that of
the arc    than that of the spark.
    6. The greater part of the lines seen in spots and flames are
 common to two or more substances with the dispersion employed.
    7. The first hundred spot observations            being compared with a
 hundred observations of the spectra of flames, made by Tacchini at
 Palermo, have shown that there is no iron line in the region b-F
 common to spots and prominences.
    In addition to these facts, already communicated to the Committee
 in more or less detail at different times, the following have been
 noticed in the continuation of the reductions.
    8. The lines of iron, cobalt,          chromium, manganese, titanium,
 calcium, and nickel seen in the spectra of spots and flames are usually
 coincident with lines in the spectra of other metals, with the dis
 persion employed, whilst the lines of tungsten, copper, and zinc seen
  in spots and storms are not coincident with lines in other spectra.
     9. The lines of iron, manganese, zinc, and titanium most frequently


 1881.]      Solar Physics Committee on Sun-Spot Observations.                      157
 seen  in spots are different from those most frequently seen in flames,
 whilst in cobalt, chromium, and calcium the lines seen in spots are the
same as those seen in flames.
    10.  Towards the end of the first series a few lines appeared among
 the most widened ones which are not represented, so far as is known,
 among the lines seen in the spectra of terrestrial elements.                      This
 change took place when there was a marked increase in the solar
activity.
    So much for the results from the first series of observations.
    The second series began on 29th September, 1880, and comes down
to October,     1881.     From a partial reduction of the observations the
following results have been obtained : —
    11. The number of new lines seen amongst the most widened lines
has been steadily increasing.             Many of these lines are very faint in
the solar spectrum, and are unrecorded by JLngstrom, while they are
wide and dark in the spot-spectrum.
    12. In the months of May and June of this year (1881), there was
a great change in the spectra of the spots, the old lines dying out and
new lines appearing.
    13. When series of observations, consisting of ten consecutive
observations of the spectra of spots, taken from the commencement of
the first series in November, 1879, and from the end of it on 27th
September, 1880, were compared with those made towards the end of
the second series on 18th July, 1881, it was found that the lines
widened in each set were markedly distinct from those in the other
sets.
    To  illustrate this,   I  have prepared the diagram opposite.                At tht:
top are some      of the principal Fraunhoferic lines in the region F to D,
the lengths representing the intensities.                   The lower part of the
diagram     is  divided    into   three    sections     by strong lines ; the first of
these (1   —  10) contains the observations made between November 12,
1879,    and   January 20, 1880, the second (11 — 20) the observations
made between September 27 and October 1, 1880, and the third those
made between July 18 and July 29, 1881*

158     Mr. J.  N. Lockyer.        On Sun-Spot  Observations.    [Dec. 15,.
   14. At the commencement       of October, 1881, there was a change in
the spectra of the spots similar to that which took place in May and
Jnne, but mnch more abrupt, for only one of the old lines remained.
This is exactly analogous to the variations Tacchini saw in the
spectra of the prominences in the region F to b, in December, 1872.
   15. In the first series of observations the total number of most
widened lines in the region F to b was fifty-seven, forty of which
were due to iron, whilst in the second series the total number of lines-
seen was 104, and the iron lines faded away gradually, the last dis
appearing on 26th July, 1881.
   16. So far as the observations have gone there has been no dif
ference caused by the nearness of the spot to the limb.
   17. At the present time more than 75 per cent, of the most
widened lines are not represented in the spectra of terrestrial
elements.
   18. A line of titanium at wave-length 5865-0 and a line of barium
at wave-length 5852-5 are amongst the recent most widened lines.
Both these are long lines in the spectra of these metals.         The line
at wave-length 5852-5 has been seen by Young in flames, with a?
frequency of eight.

there appears a notice of a paper read before the Russian Chemical
Society, by MM. Boutlerow and Wischnegradsky, in which they state,
among     other things, that by the action of alkalies ou cinchonine they
had obtained qainoline (chinoline) almost pure, and a volatile colourless
liquid alkaloid boiling constantly at 166°, having the formula C7H9N ;
and which they say appears to be identical with the base obtained
by me in distilling cinchonine with potash, and also with the lntidine
of Anderson. Of the identity of the base obtained by them with /3-luti-
dine there can be no doubt; the boiling point (166°) given by them
being to half a degree the mean of the range (163° to 168°) given by
me in my "Researches on Isomeric Alkaloids."*
   With regard to the identity which they assume between lutidine and
3-lutidine, it is evident that they have not seen my paper last quoted,
or they would hardly have ignored the mass of facts which                I

adduced to prove the isomerism, and not identity of the two bases.
   In the " Bulletin of the Chemical Society " of Paris, Nos. 5 and 9, for
September 5, 1880, p. 210, M. W. Oechsner de Coninck publishes an
investigation on the lutidine, collidine, and parvoline obtained as above
from cinchonine ; his only reference to my work being to the " Ann.
Chim. Phys.," xlv, p. 488, t in which he says that         Ihave shown the
presence of a base possessing the composition of lutidine.         He then
proceeds to give analyses, density, and vapour-densities of /3- lutidine,
apparently unaware that they were simply repetitions of what           had    I
done many years before.          I

 from cinchonine is modified by hot water, losing two molecules of
  hydrochloric acid.    The extraordinary difference between the decom-
 posability of the platinum salts of lntidine and |8-lutidine on boiling
 with water with evolution of hydrochloric acid, was one of the numer
 ous illustrations of the isomerism of the two bases which           I  adduced in
       " Researches on Isomeric Alkaloids " seventeen                           The
  my                                                            years ago.
  tone of M. de Coninck's paper shows that he believes his results to
 be entirely new.     I  mention the above facts partly because they are
 facts, but, chiefly as showing that other chemists are working on ji-
 lutidine, and that it therefore becomes necessary to publish my more
 recent experiments somewhat earlier than           I  should otherwise have
 done.
     The preparation of /3-lntidine in a state of purity is a work of much
 labour. On distilling cinchonine with hydrate of potassium a mixture
 of at least ten alkaloids is obtained, and the /3-lutidine has to be
 separated by fractional distillation.       I  have, however, prepared for
 the purposes of this investigation probably the largest quantity of the
 base that has yet been obtained — rather more than half a pint.
                      Action of Sodium upon /3-Lutidine.
    I  found that by the action of sodium upon chinoline it became
 polymerised with the formation of a body having the composition of
 dichinoline. This substance forms a crystalline hydrochlorate, having,
 when freshly prepared, a magnificent scarlet colour.*                 The hydro-
 chlorate of dichinoline dyes silk a brilliant but fugitive orange colour.
 This reaction, namely, the formation of a coloured hydrochlorate from
 a colourless oily base, being probably unique, it became desirable to
 ascertain how /9-lutidine would behave under similar circumstances.
     Fragments of sodium were added to /Hutidine in the cold ; they
 acquired a brilliant yellow colour, and had exactly the appearance of
 pieces of metallic gold.      The mixture was then warmed until the
 sodium melted, it was then removed from the lamp.                       A violent
 reaction ensued, and the whole turned greenish-black by reflected
 light, and yellowish-brown by transmitted light. The product was
 left until the next day, and was then boiled for five minutes; it
 thickened, and, on being poured into water, yielded a heavy brown
-oil. No pyrrol was formed. Excess of hydrochloric acid being added,
the oil dissolved, forming a brown solution; this was fractionally
 precipitated with solution of platinic chloride.              Six precipitates
 were obtained ; the first was pale      brown,    the second fawn-coloured,
 the third a paler fawn, the fourth Naples yellow, the fifth sulphur-
yellow. The last only was distinctly crystalline under the lens. If
 put in a wet state into the water-oven they melt, but, if first dried over

    The second precipitate, in its percentage of platinum, agrees with
the formula for the platinum salt of the hydrochlorate of dibetaluti-
dine   containing two molecules of dibetalutidine, the formula being—
                             2(C1*H18Ns)HCl.PtCl*
or,  of a still higher polymer, in which      case the   formula becomes —
                               C28H36N*.HCl.PtCl4;
whichever     formula we adopt, the percentage of platinum required is
24*61, which agrees closely with the experimental number. The other
precipitates were probably mixtures of this salt with the platinum
salt of dibetalutidine —
                               CWBPW.HCLPtCa*
which requires 33'53 per cent. of platinum.
    A second preparation was then made, but the oil obtained           on treat
ing the crude product with water was distilled ; the boiling point
varied from 180° C. to a temperature above the range of the mercurial
thermometer.       Four fractions were received, the fourth, which dis
tilled at and above 300°, was dissolved        in hydrochloric acid, and frac
tionally precipitated with platinic chloride.

    The   second   precipitate, therefore, afforded almost exactly the
numbers required for the salt C^HW.HCl.PtCl4, and the others
were probably mixtures of the kind           I  have indicated above.      It is
possible that the fourth precipitate had the composition shown by the
formula CuHl8N2.3HCl.PtCl* which would require 29 84 per cent.
of platinum;      I  propose to settle this question by further experi
 ments.

162                            Mr. C. G. Williams.                        [Dec. 15,.
    During the precipitation of the platinum salts from the distilled
base the solution became of a brilliant but fugitive scarlet colour.             It
is evident from the above numbers that the oil of high boiling point
had the same general character as the crude mixture first examined.
    Sodium amalgam, although it so readily polymerises chinoline,* was
found to be almost without action on /3-lutidine.
    The action of sodium was then tried upon /3-lutidine dissolved in
toluene ; two products were obtained, one solid, the other bquid. The
solid substance on being dissolved in hydrochloric acid, and fraction
ally precipitated as before, gave two precipitates.                              »

    The results, while proving that /3-lutidine is polymerised by the
action of sodium, show also that at least two substances are formed,
and that separation is not easily effected by fractional precipitation
with platinic chloride. It will be seen that the second precipitate from
the hydrochlorate of the solid base gave for the platinum a number
almost exactly agreeing with that required for the platinum salt of
dibetalutidine CuH18N3.HClPtCH, which requires 33 53 per cent, of
platinum.
              Compound of fi-Lutidine with Nitrate of Silver.
    I have shown      in my paper " Researches on Isomeric Alkaloids, "t
that /3-lutidine combines directly with platinic chloride ; it does the
same with nitrate of silver.
    When /3-lutidine is added to an aqueous solution of nitrate of silver,
 a white curdy precipitate is thrown down, it dissolves in alcohol, and
is reprecipitated by water as a glittering mass of snow-white crystals.
 These latter crystallise readily from alcohol in beautiful stellar groups.

     The chlorination of /3-lutidine was effected by Hugo Miiller's method ;
 for this purpose iodine was added to the alkaloid, the mixture was
 heated to 100°, and a current of chlorine was passed through until com
plete saturation.     The product was a dark reddish-brown fluid, which
 was distilled.   The portion boiliiig below 220° was washed with a dilute
solution   of  hydrate of sodium, and then treated with hydrochloric
acid, a viscid green substance of peculiar odour remained undissolved.
 On adding solution of platinic chloride to the filtered liquid, a
granular precipitate was obtained ; it was washed, dried, and the per
centage of platinum determined : it amounted to 23'49 per cent.
The formula 2(C7H6Cl3N.HCl)PtCl* requires 23 74.                   This result
shows that the product is a trichlorinated /3-lutidine retaining the
basic properties of the original alkaloid.
 V. " On the Effect of the Spectrum on the Haloid Salts of
       Silver, and on Mixtures of the same." By Captain Abney,
       R.E., F.R.S. Communicated to the Royal Society at the
       request of the Committee on Solar Physics.                     Received
       December 6, 1881.
    There have been many investigations as to the sensitiveness to the
spectrum of the haloid salts of silver, from the very earliest days of
photography ; and when the results obtained by the different investi-

 1881.]         Spectrum an     the Haloid Salts of Silver,    fyc.        165
 gators  are compared      one   with another there      are often very wide
 discrepancies apparent.       It appeared to me that it was desirable if
 possible to examine the subject afresh, and to endeavour to reconcile
or to explain as far as possible these discrepancies.
   The    earlier  investigators, such as Herschel, Hunt, Draper, and
 Becqnerel,    added much to the knowledge of the subject, but their
researches   were carried on at a time when the modern modifications
and more    powerful means of development of an image were unknown.
Later investigators, including such eminent names as H. W. Vogel
and Eder, have availed themselves of the modern appliances, but their
results are not always consistent one with another.
   In the following researches points are brought out which are, it is
believed, new and deserving of attention, not only on account of their
applicability to the practical working of photography, but also because
they throw a light on molecular physics.
   For solar photography it is essential that a knowledge of the relative
effect of the various parts of the spectrum should be known, since,
if the photo-heliograph be adjusted for one particular part, and
the films employed 8be more sensitive to another part, it is manifest
that no great sharpness of image can be obtained.               The following
researches it is believed show what an enormous effect the mixture of
haloid salts has in shifting the position of maximum effect, and it may
be possible to either alter the achromatism of the objectives employed,
or else solely to use the sensitive compound to which the objective is
at present adapted.
   Apparatus employed. — The spectroscope employed in these researches
was that already described " On the Effect of the Atomic Grouping of
Molecules." * Two prisms of medium dense and colourless flint-
glass were used to obtain the necessary dispersion.             They were set
to have the angle of minimum deviation near G.            The angle of disper
sion between A and H was about G^°, the length of spectrum between
these two lines was about 2\ inches, the spectrum in the ultra-violet
extending some 1^ inch beyond H, and the infra-red about £ of an
inch beyond A.        The whole spectrum as given by the prisms under
consideration thus had a length of 4s\ inches, a length in which all
phenomena could be fully recognised and measured.
   Sources of Light. — The sources of light employed were the sun
and the crater of the positive pole of the electric light.          Images of
these sources were thrown on the slit by means of a condensing lens
alone in the second case, and by it and a heliostat in the first case.
   Vehicles holding the Sensitive Salts. — The sensitive salts were held
t* situ, in paper, in gelatine, and in collodion, in the last vehicle the
salts being prepared either as emulsions in fluid collodion or by tho
ordinary silver nitrate bath process.         In gelatine the salts were all
                       * " Phil. Trans." for 1881 : Part 3.

  prepared    as emulsions  ;   when in paper they were prepared by soaking
   it in a soluble haloid salt, and floating on solution of silver nitrate.
   The question of the production of sensitive silver haloid salts on a
                         I
   metallic silver plate have left to be considered later, since it has no
  direct bearing on the points      I  wish to discuss in this communication.
      Exposures. — When it was desired to obtain the expression of the
  action of the spectrum by its direct effect without the intermediary
  of a developer, the slit of the spectroscope was opened to a width of
  -Jj of an inch, and the exposure prolonged for five to twenty minutes.
  When the effects had to be shown by development the slit was closed
  to       of an inch, and exposure given varying between ^ second and
  one minute or even two minutes. By having a shutter at the slit of the
  spectroscope it was easy to give two exposures on the same plate or
  paper, using half the length of the slit for each exposure.          This was
  excessively   convenient,   since it allowed  the different  phenomena arising
  from different methods of exposure to be accurately compared together.
  The principle on which the exposures were given was as follows : —
  1st. An exposure was given to the plate, when a pale solution of chro-
  mate of potash so dilute as to cut off the spectrum above E, was placed
  in front of the slit. This exposure was in all cases prolonged in order
  to see if there was any action produced, however feeble, by the spectrum
  remaining unabsorbed.         The next exposure was always taken with the
  slit nnshaded, and on the same plate (or paper) as the first exposure.
  After a certain interval of time had elapsed, the yellow chromate
  was again placed in front of the slit, and the exposure continned.
  The reason for adopting this plan was that the effect of diffused white
 light (diffused from the prisms during unshaded exposure) would
 thus be differentiated. Thus, supposing it was found that the first
  exposure caused no sign of a change in the sensitive salt by the
 exposure to the spectrum unabsorbed by the chromate, but that the
 unshaded spectrum caused an action on these parts, it would be evident
 that the action of diffused light had played a part in causing such an
action.
     When such phenomena resulted, plates or papers were first exposed
to the unshaded spectrum through the chromate solution, then with
 drawn from the camera and exposed to the diffused light of the
 laboratory for a fraction of a second, or for eight or ten seconds, accord
 ing as the experiment was to be conducted by development or by
-direct printing action, and again inserted in the slide and exposed to
 the action of the partially absorbed spectrum. If the experiments
were rightly conducted, the results of the last two should be con
firmatory of the first two exposures.         Other plates or papers were then
exposed, giving, unshaded, one half of the slit of a short period, and
the other half for a period ten to twenty times as long. By this system
jill the phenomena met with could be differentiated and traced.

      Localities of Maximum Action. — have followed the usual custom
  -of  writers on this subject, and shown the top of my curves as the
  place of     maximum action.           Although      this correctly shows what
  appears on the photographic plate, yet in all cases               it is apt to give a
  false notion regarding the effect of the spectrum.                 If we look at the
  energy of the spectrum          in   its different localities, we find that it
  rapidly decreases as it approaches the violet and ultra-violet.                If this
  diminution of energy be taken into account, it will be found that
  usually the point of maximum effect nearest the violet indicates the
  region where the absorption of the rays becomes total, and that the
  shading off towards the ultra-violet is really only due to the diminished
 energy of that part of the spectrum.               In other cases, as, for instance,
  where there are two maxima, this will not apply to the second
 maximum.
                                     Silver Iodide.
      Visible Effect of the Spectrum on Silver Iodide. — If paper be soaked
 in a 10 per cent. solution of potassium iodide and dried, and then be
 floated on a 10 per cent. solution of silver nitrate and exposed whilst
 moist,*     the spectrum will be impressed in five minutes, as given in
fig.    1,  where it will be seen that the whole visible spectrum is
 impressed.      Similar paper if exposed to the spectrum coming through
a weak solution of potassium chromate, exhibits after ten minutes a
slight action in the least refrangible region (fig. 3).                If, however, the
paper     be  exposed  for  ten  seconds    to  diffused  light  and   then be exposed
to the same spectrum as the last the action is more intense than before,
though the exposure be for only two minutes (fig. 2).                    From this we
learn that part of the action of the spectrum in fig. 1 is due to the
action of diffused light.         It next remained to trace the action on the
different silver compounds existing in this paper, which was ordinary
sized saxe paper. Paper was prepared as before, but washed in common
water till nearly all excess of silver nitrate was eliminated, and it was
then given a wash of potassium nitrite, an absorbent of iodine.                    Such
paper was exposed        to   the   spectrnm, first, coming through chromate,
second, unshaded.          The print obtained is that shown in fig. 4, by
which it will be seen that the same limits were reached as before, but
that there is not that abrupt descent of sensitiveness                         near G;
evidently some cause of the extreme sensitiveness near this point had
been eliminated, and apparently that could only be the silver nitrate
and the presence          of the potassium nitrite.             To test the matter
further, paper was prepared in the same manner, but before applying
the potassium nitrite it was soaked in common salt and water and
washed.        This would effectually remove all traces of silver nitrate
    •
       The same action was observed where the paper was         allowed to dry, but the
darkening was less.

converting it into silver chloride. Exposure for five minntes to the
spectrum gave the result shown in fig. 5, in which it will be seen that
whilst the most refrangible portion took a grey colour, the small portion
below G became a pink, the line of demarcation between the two
being well defined.    It now seemed probable that the pink part of the
spectrum was due to the chloride and the grey to the iodide.
   To further investigate the matter, the same paper without iodide
was floated on silver nitrate and exposed to the spectrum, witm
result given in fig. 6, a very faint trace of action being visible
the paper was exposed for a quarter of an hour to the spectrum
mitted by the potassium chromate.
   Iodised paper prepared as in the first experiment was well washe
and simply exposed with the resnlt to be seen in fig. 7. Finally,
was prepared and washed, then immersed in a weak solutic
potassium iodide, washed well and flooded with potassium nitrite, ;
the result is given in fig. 8. Now, fig. 1 coincides with the observfc?
tions made by Sir J. Herschel, on paper similarly prepared, in 18
and described in the " Phil. Trans." for 1843, and he cli
spectrum as due to the silver iodide. It will be seen that the print
spectrum due to silver iodide is that given in fig. 8, and that the
extending to the least refrangible end is really due to the action
that region on the organic salt (and perhaps chloride)                of
present  in the paper.    Further,   it  will be seen  that the greater  pij
the darkening in fig. 1 of that tail is due to the action of the different
                                                                             " 1
rays after or whilst diffused light has acted or is acting on
organic compound.      Confirmatory experiments were made with
silver iodide in collodion with excess of silver nitrate, and also
such excess, with the result shown in fig. 8.
   If further confirmation were required, it was only necessary >
to a film of collodion containing the iodide and excess of silver
a small trace of organic matter, such as resin or albumen,
 result given in fig. 9 was obtained.
    Thus, then, we may say that the parts of the spectrum capable
 direct action on silver iodide are shown in fig. 8.
    The next point to which my attention was turned was to
the true region of the spectrum which was active on silver
 when developed.

170                   Capt. Abney.        On the  Effect  of tlie     [Dec. 15,
Now, the first three        gave precisely similar      results as did the last
three.     It  will, therefore, be unnecessary for me to state for every ex
periment which developer was used. With collodion or gelatine plates
I preferred the 2nd and the 4th developers, and with paper the 3rd
and the 5th.
    It may be necessary to point to the different materials employed.
In the first place very pare potassium iodide was obtained by Stas's
method, and as much as would dissolve was put into collodion ; by
the free use of water with the alcohol as much as 4 grs. was dissolved.
This was employed with a silver bath prepared in the usual way, con
taining 35 grs. of silver nitrate to each ounce of water.
    5 grs. of commercial cadmium iodide was dissolved in an ounce of
collodion, and this was also used with a silver nitrate sensitising bath.
The pyroxylin forming the collodion was carefully selected.              Before
taking     into   use   it had  been    precipitated  from   solution by water,
washed in alcohol, again precipitated, and washed and dried, and then
redissolved in equal parts of pure ether and alcohol at the rate of
7 grs. to each ounce.        Such a solution after prolonged exposure when
impregnated with nitrate of silver gave no reduction of the salt.
    The emulsions of silver iodide were made by dissolving 6 grs.
of silver nitrate in alcohol, adding this to collodion, and gently adding
the equivalent to 5 grs. of silver nitrate of the soluble iodide (dis
solved in alcohol) to it.         This formed a perfect emulsion of silver
iodide   in  the  presence   of a  slight excess of silver nitrate, and also of
course of the soluble nitrates formed by the double decomposition of
the above.      I may at once say that the presence or absence of these
soluble nitrates had no effect at all on the results, and may at once be
dismissed from further consideration.
    Gelatine emulsion was prepared in the same manner, keeping in
mind, however, that in this case it was prepared with an excess of
soluble iodide instead of silver nitrate. It is well to remark that it is
impossible to get a fine emulsion of silver iodide in collodion unless
the plan indicated above be followed of first dissolving the silver
 nitrate in the collodion and then adding the iodide to that, in addition
to which it is necessary that the silver nitrate be in excess or the
 emulsion becomes granular. With gelatine the emulsification is an
easier matter, but in order to prevent spontaneous decomposition of
 the gelatine it is necessary that the soluble iodide be in excess.
                                      " washed " by the usnal methods
 Emulsions of both kinds were                                            known
 to photographers. In the case of the collodio-iodide of silver great
care was taken that nothing but pure distilled water was employed.
    It will be well to show here how it was we ascertained that nothing
 but pure iodide of silver exists in a film. The impurities to be met
 with are oxides, chlorides, and bromides.              Now when an oxide of
 silver, or silver chloride or bromide is placed in a solution of potas

1881.]         Spectrum on the   Haloid Salts of Silver,   §-c.        171
sium    or other soluble iodide, the silver compound is at once decom
 posed, and silver iodide formed in its place.           If, then, a film of
 iodide of silver in collodion (whether prepared from an emulsion or
 by the bath process) be washed from silver nitrate, and be then im
mersed in a weak solution of potassium iodide (it must not be strong
or it will dissolve out the silver iodide from the film) or other soluble
iodide, it may be seen that there will be nothing but silver iodide in
the film, all impurities being decomposed.       If the film be washed well
with distilled water, and again immersed in the bath, or flowed over
with some sensitiser, such as potassium nitrite, sodium sulphite, beer,
pyrogallic acid, &c., it may be exposed with the certainty that only
pure silver iodide is under examination.          It was necessary to make
these remarks, since the whole of the utility of the research        depends
on the use of the pure substance,         the collodion being absolutely
inert as regards the silver salt.    The silver iodide emulsion made from
the purified potassium iodide proved to contain nothing but the pare
iodide, but that prepared with the cadmium and other iodides, as will
be seen, proved untrustworthy        as to purity.     It was owing to this
that I was led into a mistake in a paper which appeared in the
                                                                       " Pro
ceedings of the Royal Society," wherein       I    stated that owing to the
oxygen-absorbing      properties of potassium nitrite,     I    was able to
obtain an image lower than ordinary.           It seems now that this may
have been due to a contamination of bromide or chloride, or to the
formation of silver nitrate, any of which would have given me the
same results.
   One word also as to the neutral or alkaline developer employed.
It has been customary to state that silver iodide is unamenable to
alkaline development.      This  is, however, not the case. The ferrous
oxalate and the ferrous citro-oxalate bring out a distinct image, as
does pyrogallic acid and ammonia, when no restraining iodide             is
employed. In all dry plates prepared with the iodide and other silver
haloids, the iodide  is   developable (though     it  gives a weakly image
compared with that       due  to  other  salts) by the alkaline or organic
iron developer.
 A     plate was coated with cadmium iodised collodion, and placed in
the bath    for a couple of minutes, and exposed to the spectrum. The
top half of the slit was nncovered for one second, the bottom half for
ten seconds;  the results are seen in figs. 14 and 15. The develop
ment took place by the acid developer.        Plates similarly prepared
and washed, and then, similarly exposed, also gave as results figs.
14 and 15.   When using ferrous oxalate, the cadmium emulsion also
gave the same result.   Plates coated with a film of the same collodion,
washed, and then immersed in a weak solution of potassium iodide
or cadmium     iodide, again washed clean with distilled water, and
finally treated with silver nitrate, beer, pyrogallic acid, potassium

nitrite, when developed by the acid or other methods, gave the re
sults in figs. 10 and 11. The purification of silver iodide by this treat
ment cut off the small tail on the least refrangible side of G seen in
fig. 14.   When the pure silver iodide prepared by the aid of the pure
potassium iodide was used, figs. 13 and 12 resulted. A plate was next
coated with collodion iodised with the pure potassium iodide, im
mersed in the bath, washed, and then placed in a solution of common
salt (1 gr. to 5 oz.), with the result that figures similar to figs. 16 and
17 were obtained.
   A  plate similarly treated, except that potassium bromide was sub
stituted for the common salt, gave as a result figs. 16 and 17. There
was no marked difference whether the plate was developed by the acid
developer or by the ferrous oxalate.      It would be useless to describe
the many other experiments which were made, all tending to prove
that the true action of the spectrum on silver iodide in collodion is
that given in figs. 10 and 11. No deviation from it has been obtained,
unless impurity in the pyroxyline or in the soluble iodide was proved
to exist.
    With gelatine emulsions of yellow silver iodide, when rendered
sensitive by the use of potassium nitrite or silver nitrate, the same
action was found to hold good, and the same may be said for plates
prepared with albumen as a vehicle, when all the silver was converted
into iodide, and the sensitising was effected by potassium nitrite or
some other similar sensitiser.
    We next come to the iodide of silver when held in situ by paper.
The same method of preparation was adopted as that given above for
the printing experiments.     When paper was exposed with the excess
of silver nitrate, on acid development fig. 18 was obtained. When
developed by an organic ferrous developer, fig. 19 was obtained ;
figs. 14 and 15 were obtained when similar paper was washed and
salted with common salt, and washed again, and then sensitised with
potassium nitrite.
    Figs. 18 and 19 are worthy of attention.      It is seen in fig. 18 that
the iodide has much greater power        of   attracting freshly deposited
silver than have the impurities present with it in the paper.        On the
other hand, fig. 19 shows that the ferrous oxalate developer has more
power of reducing the impurity (or rather the reduction is better seen)
than it has the iodide.
    When silver iodide paper is prepared and washed, and treated with
a weak solution of potassium iodide and resensitised by potassium
nitrite, figs. 10 and 11 are obtained.
    Fig. 20 shows the action of the spectrum on pure iodide when the
exposure is very prolonged. It appears as if the sensitiveness on the
 more refrangible side of G had diminished.           This is not the case,
 however. The prolonged exposure causes a commencement of what is

 1881.]          Spectrum on     the  Haloid Salts of Silver, fyc.         173
called a reversal of the image due to oxidation, which         I have already
investigated    in the  " Philosophical Magazine," 1880, and the maximum
 effect has,  therefore, apparently shifted to the least refrangible side of
 G, as shown.      This is important, since phenomena which have been
described and figured by other investigators can be shown to be caused
by this reversing action.         I  shall have to allude to it myself again
further on.
    What has been noted regarding the action of impurities in the silver
iodide points to a method of ascertaining if an iodide or iodine itself
is pure.     It is believed that the merest trace of impurity may be
recognised by this method of spectrum analysis.
                                  Silver Bromide.
    When paper is immersed in a 10 per cent. solution of potassium
bromide, then dried and floated on a 10 per cent. solution of silver
nitrate, and exposed       to the action of the spectrum, the visible effect
will   be observed   as  shown in fig. 21. Figs. 22 and 23 show the action
of the spectrum after filtration through potassium chromate, the
former being what is observed after a preliminary exposure to diffused
white light, and the latter when the paper has only seen the yellow
light.    It is needless to go into all the details which were described
when silver iodide paper was under examination.             The same causes
exist for the shape of the curve as they do with the latter paper.          It
may be interesting to remark that the spectrum observed on paper
which has been washed and treated with potassium bromide after sen
sitising is the same as that shown in fig. 25, whilst when only washed
and not treated with the soluble bromide it takes the form of fig. 29.
The reason of these differences in shape of enrve is apparent when it
is remembered how the effects on silver iodide paper were traced to
their source.
    It must  be noted that there       are several molecular modifications of
silver bromide.      The first is that form in which it exists in the paper
and also in collodio-bromide emulsions when prepared in the ordinary
way; also when prepared in collodion by the bath.                   This form
transmits a yellow-orange tint when white light traverses it. Another
form is one which I described in the Bakerian Lecture for 1880, viz.
a form which transmits a blue-green tint ; and a last form which
transmits a grey tint, which is found in gelatine emulsions which
have been boiled, or treated with ammonia in the manner which is
common at the present day. These three varieties were examined both
for the visible action of light and also for development.          A plate was
coated with the first emulsion named, with the result that the direct
action of light gave fig. 25. The blue-green transmitting form gave
 fig. 24.   This form is one which is sensitive to the infra-red rays of
 the spectrum on development, and it will be seen that the printing

action also extended to that region. The printing action on the grey
form (which was submitted to the spectrum in a film of gelatine) is
shown in fig. 26. On comparing these together, it will be seen that
the maximum action commences between G and F (nearer F than G),
and that the main difference in their impressed spectra lies in the tails

 silver nitrate, or with a slight excess of soluble bromide, no difference
 in the spectra resulted.

 1881.]         Spectrum on      the  Haloid Salts of Silver,     Sfc.           175
 silver bromide.       Fig. 27 represents       the action of the spectrum on
silver bromide        paper, prepared as above, which has been washed.
 Whether development took place by acid developer or by ferrous
citro-oxalate, no difference was observable.            Pig. 28 shows the same
 with  a  short exposure.     When     the  paper  was washed    and treated with
potassium bromide and then exposed, we have as a result figs. 31
and 32.      The slight difference in the pairs of figures results from the
presence in one case of inorganic matter combined with silver, and in
the other case its absence.
    When a plate is coated with collodion containing cadmium bromide,
zinc bromide, or potassium bromide, and placed in a strong silver nitrate
bath, and developed with either acid developer or with ferrous citro-
oxalate, we get carves similar to figs. 31 and 32.             The same figures
also represent tho action of the spectrum on collodio-bromide emul
sions transmitting orange light by any kind of development.                     This
applies equally      whether   the   plate be exposed    wet  or  dry, or   whether
exposed in the presence of silver nitrate or other inorganic sensitisers.
    Figs. 29 and 30 show the results obtained when using gelatine
bromide plates with the silver bromide in the grey molecular state,
whether exposed with an inorganic sensitiser, or without, and
whether developed with an acid, alkaline, or organic iron developer.
    Figs. 33 and 34 represent the action on the blue-green molecular
form of silver bromide in collodion, when developed and exposed
under similar circumstances to the preceding case.
    It will be remarked that the direct visible action of the spectrum
and the developed image coincide.
    The effect of impurity in the bromide is not so marked as it is in the
iodide.     The presence of iodide except in minute quantities is rare ;
the haloid most frequently present as an impurity being the chloride.
When the spectrum on the chloride is considered, it will be seen that
such an impurity is hardly possible              to be detected, as the spectra
impressed     on  it  are somewhat      similar   in general character to those
on the bromide.
                                   Silver Chloride.
    Paper was impregnated with a 10 per cent. solution of sodium
chloride and sensitised on          a 10 per cent. solution of silver nitrate.
 Paper thus prepared was exposed to the spectrum in a damp state,
 and also in a dry state, and the visible impression recorded.               Fig. 35'
 shows the action.       When the paper was exposed for twenty seconds to
 diffused light a different curve as shown in fig. 36 was found ; an
 approach to the same curve being also shown with very prolonged
 exposure without the preliminary action of light.              This is probably
 due to the action of the diffused light in the prism.*

      I have not taken into consideration  the spectrum impressed   on silver chloride

 176                   Capt. Abney.          On   the   Effect of  the          [Dec. 15,
     Similar paper was washed, some was used in this state and other
 was afterwards treated with a solution of sodium chloride and again
 washed, leaving thus only a trace of an organic salt of silver in the
 fibre.    The action of the spectrum on the simply washed paper is
 shown in fig. 37. With a short preliminary exposure, traces of an
 impression between P and C were obtained, tending to show that
 the preliminary action in fig. 36 was effective on the chloride besides
•on the organic compound of silver.                  Fig. 38 gives the action of the
spectrum      in the chloride which had all traces of silver nitrate removed
 by the wash of sodium chloride.
     To obtain an emulsion of silver chloride in collodion, 20 grains
 of calcium chloride were dissolved in 1 oz. of collodion, and 1 gr.
 more, or 1 gr. less, according as excess or defect of silver nitrate was re
 quired, than the equivalent of silver nitrate dissolved in another ounce
of collodion ; the former solution was poured in the later, shaking at
intervals, till a perfect emulsion was obtained.                    In some cases the
 emulsion was washed in the ordinary way known to photographers,
 and in others used when made as above, and the films washed or
 exposed in their natural state.           In no case did any difference in the
 resulting impression of the spectrum appear.                    I may also state that
¦other chlorides were tried, and there is no apparent difference from
 those obtained where sodium chloride was employed.                          Fig. 38 also
gives the action of the spectrum on such emulsion, there being no
 apparent difference between the washed emulsion or the emulsion
 exposed with an excess of silver nitrate, or with an excess of the
soluble chloride, unless it be one of general sensitiveness.                      In other
 words, the spectrum seemed to act on the silver chloride in one and
the same manner.            Fig. 39 shows the printing action on the chloride
 when enveloped in gelatine.              The emulsion was formed in the usual
 manner habitual amongst photographers, each ounce of emulsion con
taining about 25 grs. of converted silver nitrate.                   Fig. 39 has refer
 ence to this emulsion after it was heated to its boiling point for half
 an hour, and when treated with ammonia ; when used unboiled it took
an impression similar to fig. 38.
     When these same preparations of the chloride in gelatine are
 exposed for a short time to the spectrum and developed with ferrous
 citro-oxalate developer, or with gallic acid and silver, we get figs. 42,
 43, 44- and 45, the first two expressing the result of the unboiled
 emulsion which transmits yellow-orange light, and the two latter
 numbers that on the boiled emulsion which transmits a blue-grey light.
 v-isibly darkened by the light.    This, as is well   known, is impressed throughout the
 spectrum, and takes the approximate colour of       the spectrum.    This is true whatever
 vehicle is used to hold the silver chloride, and     also whether exposed in the presence
•of an excess of silver nitrate or other sensitiser,  and also when organic com pounds of
 silver are mixed with it.

 178                Capt. Abney.        On  the Effect of the     [Dec. 15,
The first numbers of these           pairs   of figures show the result of
exposures ten times longer than the exposures          shown by the second
numbers of the pairs.
   Silver chloride in collodion by whatever means prepared, and
whether exposed with an excess of silver nitrate, or an excess of
soluble chloride, gave figs. 40 and 41, the former being the result of
exposure ten times longer than that shown by the latter.       The mode of
development had no effect on the spectrum developed.
   The washed paper gave on development the same result as that
shown for the direct action of light, viz., fig. 37. The mode of
development had no effect on the result.
   The washed paper subsequently treated with a solution of sodium
chloride and again washed, when exposed to the spectrum gave on
development with either gallic acid, and silver nitrate, or with ferrous
citro-oxalate, the same figure as that obtained by the direct action of
light, viz., fig. 38.
   When a brief preliminary exposure to white light was given to
either the paper or the different emulsions, fig. 46 was obtained on
development.       On looking at figs. 35 to 46 it will be seen that in
variably  the   maximum    intensity is reached between H and h. Accord
ing to many authors the maximum is near G, whilst, according to others,
it is in the ultra-violet.    I  have carried out about 200 experiments
on the chloride with sunlight and with the electric light, and in no
case have    I  found it possible to alter the maximum. Of course if
candle or gas light be used as a source the maximum will be about G,
since the ultra-violet rays are almost absent with these.          The idea
suggests   itself that the   prismatic arrangements employed may be at
fault ; in some cases where the most definite results have been
registered,    a direct vision spectroscope has been utilised.       I  need
hardly say that such an arrangement, from the very nature of the
apparatus, is unsuited for photo-spectroscopy.          Such a spectroscope
transmits very few rays beyond H, and at H their intensity is much
diminished. In order to settle the matter to my own satisfaction, I
used a diffraction grating with the same results as those shown in the
figures under consideration.          In a paper read before the British
Association in August last, I pointed out the great need of caution in
measuring daylight intensity by the chloride, and my subsequent
examination of the subject has more than ever confirmed me in my
opinion therein given.
   Methods of obtaining Mixtures of Silver Iodide and Bromide, Silver
                            Iodide and Chloride, 8fc.
   To test mixtures of the iodide and bromide, paper was prepared
by immersing it in a solution of potassium iodide and potassium
bromide, the proportion of each being so arranged that there should

 1881.]        Spectrum on    the Haloid Salts of Silver,  fyc.       179
be definite proportions     between each, supposing that each salt was
entirely decomposed by the silver nitrate. Unfortunately this is never
absolutely the case, and hence the results obtained with the paper
must be received with some caution.          Chemists know that silver
bromide or silver chloride cannot exist in the presence of a soluble
iodide, nor can silver chloride in presence of a soluble bromide.
Hence when we have an iodide and bromide impregnating paper, the
silver iodide will first be formed, and then the bromide ; or, again, with
iodide and chloride, the silver iodide will first be formed and then the
chloride ; and, finally, with bromide and chloride, the bromide will
first be formed and then the chloride.
   It was necessary to make these remarks, as a right conception of the
results might not be taken on casually looking at them.
   The same remarks apply with equal force when a sensitive film of
the double salts is prepared by the ordinary silver bath when very8
short immersion is given to the plate. The only true way of obtaining
definite results seems to be by means of separate emulsions, in which
a definite amount of soluble chloride, bromide, or iodide is fully con
verted into silver chloride, bromide, or iodide, and then to mix these
emulsions, after proper washing, in the required proportions. It was
in this manner that the emulsions which will be discussed presently
were prepared.
   I would here call attention to a somewhat remarkable behaviour of
silver iodide. It is well known that if silver iodide be prepared with
an excess of soluble iodide, it is totally insensitive to light. Thus
if we prepare (say) an emulsion in collodion with an excess of
iodide, and wash it thoroughly in the usual manner, and after redis-
solving the pellicle resulting from the washing operations, expose it in
the camera, no amount of development will bring out an image.           If,
however, to such an emulsion but a drop of a bromide or chloride
emulsion be added sensitiveness will appear.         This seems to be due
to the last trace of soluble iodide being converted into silver iodide.
                  Mixtures of Silver Iodide and Bromide.
   Equal Equivalent Proportions of Iodide and Bromide. — Paper was
soaked in a solution of equivalent proportions of soluble iodides and
bromides, and, after drying, was sensitised on a 10 per cent. solution
 of silver nitrate for such a time that the back of the paper became
thoroughly damp.        The silver nitrate solution was acidified in order
to prevent the formation of any sub-salts.
   A strip of such paper was exposed to the spectrum whilst moist,
and the printing action noted.     The result is given in fig. 47. Similar
 paper was washed and treated with potassium nitrite, and exposed
 whilst moist ; the effect of the action of the spectrum is seen in the
 same figure.

   180                 Capt. Abney.       On  the   Effect  of the          [Dec.  15,
      Paper was next washed, and portions were treated with a solution
  of potassium bromide, and again washed.              Strips of these two speci
  mens were dried      and  exposed to   the  spectrum, and in both cases the
  printing action is seen in fig. 48. Similar papers, in a moist state,
  were also exposed without any deviation of the result.               Again, paper
  which had been prepared as above was allowed to dry with the excess
  of silver nitrate on it, and exposed, and fig. 48 again approximately
  resulted ; as also it did when the washed paper treated with potassium
  nitrite was dried.
      The difference between curves 47 and 48 is very remarkable, and at
  first sight might not seem to admit of explanation. A study of the
  experiments described, however, affords a clue to the apparent incon
  gruity of the results.      According to text-books on chemistry, bromine
  will displace iodine in combination, whilst iodide displaces bromide.
  Later researches seem to modify the first statement to a certain extent.
 Bromine will only displace a definite proportion of iodine when it is
 in excess ; but for our purpose we may take the text-book statement
 as practically correct.      When the paper was exposed wet with either
 silver nitrate or potassium nitrite (I may remark that other halogen
 absorbents gave the same result) the iodine and bromine liberated by
 the action of light would be at once absorbed by them ; in the one
 case silver iodide (or bromide) and silver iodate (or bromate) being
 formed, and in the other potassium iodide (or bromide) ; so that each
 of the two kinds of sensitive salt would have its full action. When
 the paper was washed and exposed in a dry state the result would be
 different, and the question would arise, what would become of the
 iodine and bromine liberated by light ?
     If silver iodide be exposed to light and treated with a trace of
 bromine, the sub-iodide combines with the bromine, and all trace of
the action of light is destroyed.        Thus when the mixture of iodide and
 bromide is exposed to light, both iodine and bromine being liberated,
the bromine will at once combine with the sub-iodide and destroy it.
Thus,
                                Ag2I-rBr=Ag2IBr,
the only factor remaining being the sub-bromide, which is develop
able.     Now it may be said that the iodine liberated should also destroy
the sub-salts ; but it is a matter of fact that, in the presence of light,
it has no power of destroying the sub-iodide, since it is immediately
again shaken off from the molecule.* Iodine can destroy the                      sub-
bromide molecule, and form a new saturated molecule ; thns,
                               Ag2Br+I=Ag2BrI.
    *
       [At the same time it must be noted that the iodide is much less sensitive of
light when no absorbent of iodine is present. This is fully accounted for by the
immediate recombination of, at all events, a portion of the iodine liberated with the
sub-iodide molecule. — Dec. 19.]

 1881.]         Spectrum on     the Haloid Salts of Silver, fyc.        181
Whether the two molecules Ag2BrI and Ag2IBr have the same value
is a moot point, but the evidence tends to show that such is the case.
If the equivalents of bromide and iodide were equal, that is, if the
bromide and iodide of silver were equally distributed, supposing both
the above actions took place, the locality of the spectrum in which
the iodide and bromide are equally sensitive should show an almost
entire destruction of a developable image, and also of a printed
image.
    This locality is doubtless about G, and when we come to analyse the
curve in fig. 48 we see that there is very small effect about G, whilst
there is an increased effect between G and F. Now, to test the matter
further, paper prepared with washed silver bromide was exposed
to light till it darkened thoroughly, and such paper was treated
with a very dilute solution of iodine, and then exposed in the
spectrum, with the result given in fig. 74, in which it will be seen that
the new molecule is more sensitive to the green between G and F than
above G ; in fact, we have very little action comparatively at G and
above it.     In this case we have then a paper prepared in which there
is an absolute imitation of the action that takes place in the mixed
iodide and bromide. It cannot be said that by this treatment we have
Ag2I3+Ag2Br2, since the molecule formed by light is Ag3Br, and the
addition of the iodine is simply to form Ag3BrI, which is very different
from a simple mixture. This experiment then 'seems to show that
this new molecule is more sensitive to the blue-green than it is to the
 violet. The point then comes as to how, when the original paper is
 exposed to the spectrum, we have not only a fall of sensitiveness at
 G and beyond it, but also a greater sensitiveness in the green. Now,        ,
 silver iodide, as has already been shown, is not in tho least sensitive
 to beyond a very small region below G ; therefore, in the green the
 only component of the mixture of bromide and iodide that can be
 acted upon is the bromide.         As we see when bromide is acted upon
 one atom of bromine     is liberated  from the molecule ; thus,
                              Ag3Br2=Ag2Br+Br.
    The liberated atom of bromine immediately attacks the molecule of
 iodide in its immediate neighbourhood and forms a new bromo-iodide
 molecule liberating iodine.       Thus
                            Br+Ag2I3=Ag.JBr+I,
 and the iodine either escapes or else forms the molecule      Ag2BrI ; thus
                               Ag2Br+I=Ag2BrI.
    Here then it is probable that we have a new saturated molecule
 formed by the action of light, which on formation is susceptible of
 being acted on by light in its turn. Whether iodine or bromine is

liberated from this new molecule        I  am not at present prepared to
state, but it is my belief that it is the iodine, since density in develop
ment by the alkaline method is readily obtained when experimenting
•with it.
   To sum up, the difference in shape between curves 47 and 48 seems
to depend on the destruction of the sub-iodide when formed, and its
conversion into a new molecule, which is sensitive to the blue-green,
the same new molecule being formed by the liberation of the bromine
from the molecule of silver bromide when the sub-bromide is formed.
In the case of the paper which is dried in the presence of silver nitrate
and potassium nitrite the same result occurs.          Bromine and iodine
attack these salts when in a crystalline state with difficulty, and hence
will in preference form the new molecules as before.
   Fig. 49 shows the curve of washed paper when developed with
ferrous citro-oxalate, and nearly the same result is seen when the
development proceeds by acid development, the difference being that
the dip in the curve between h and G is less pronounced.       To illustrate
this further, in Fig. 50 we have the case of a collodion lilm containing
equal parts of silver iodide and silver bromide and an excess of silver
nitrate, the latter salt absorbing both the iodine and bromine libe
rated.    In fig. 52 we have the results obtained from the same film,
but thoroughly washed from all excess of silver nitrate. Whether the
plates be developed by acid, alkaline, or an organic ferrous salt, the
curves remain in all essential particulars the same. In fig. 51 we have
the curve resulting from the same mixture (equal equivalent propor
tions) held in gelatine when developed by ferrous oxalate or alkaline
developer.     At first sight it might be said that this action is really
due to the "reversing action" of light, of which          I have treated in
the   " Proceedings of the Royal Society," in 1878, and in the
                                                                    " Philo
                      "
sophical Magazine for 1880. That this is not the case is shown by
fig. 53, in which the exposure was exceedingly short ; in fact, when
very quick exposure was given the curve started at h and reached a
maximum as shown in fig. 53. These results are exceedingly inte
resting and important.       There is a figure showing something some
what similar in Vogel's " Lehrbuch der Photographie," Berlin, 1878,
but there is no explanation of the cause, nor has it been noticed by any
other observer, as far as I am aware.
   Three Parts of Iodide to One of Bromide. — When we take three
equivalents of silver iodide to one of bromide the curves are somewhat
modified.    When washed paper prepared with the above proportions
is allowed to print in the spectrum, we have the curve shown in fig. 54.
When exposed damp in the presence of silver nitrate or other inor
ganic sensitiser, we have almost a facsimile of the curve in fig. 47.
   Washed paper developed with acid developer shows that the propor
tion of iodide is so large in comparison to the bromide that the sub

   1881.]         Spectrum on     the Haloid Salts of Silver, $c.              183
  iodide is   not all destroyed, and we get the maximum corresponding
  with the maximum of pure silver iodide, fig. 55.               The same paper
  developed     with   ferrous  citrate  shows   a  slight dip  near    G, fig. 56.
  The difference in 55 and 56 is seemingly due to the fact that silver
  iodide has more attractive power for precipitating metallic silver
  than has the bromide (a fact which is well known) and that the
  bromide is more amenable to reduction than is the iodide.
     Figs. 57 and 58 are well worthy of attention.          They are the results
 of the exposure of the same plate for different lengths of time to the
 spectrum.       It was prepared in the silver nitrate bath and exposed in
 the presence of free silver nitrate.        Taking fig. 57 alone, it might be
 supposed      that  we  had  a  similar  case to that which we have recently
 considered, since we find an extraordinarily (apparent) greater sensi
 tiveness in the green than in the violet, and yet we have the image
 formed in the presence of an excess of silver nitrate, which would be
 against    the theory    I have promulgated.        Fig. 58, however, clears up
 the discrepancy      : the maximum is found to be at G, and in this case
 the dip in the curve        of fig. 57 is caused by the reversing action
 alluded to.
    Fig.  59 gives the curve obtained by the above mixture of three
parts    of  iodide to one of bromide ; when emulsified in gelatine the
bottom curve shows a short exposure.
    One Part of Iodide and Three of Bromide. — We now come to a mix
ture of one part of silver iodide to three of bromide.                I have not
described the printed spectra since they correspond nearly with figs.
47   and 48.
    If  we compare the curves in figs. 60 and 57 we see a strange simi
larity between them, but if we take into consideration fig. 61, which
is that due     to a short exposure on the same plate, we shall at once see
that the      dips about G are due to two different causes; the dip in
fig. Gl is caused by the formation of the new molecule.              Figs. 60 and
61 are also the curves shown by paper prepared with the above equi
valents of iodide and bromide, and also of the same in collodion when
developed by an organic ferrous salt.            When developed by acid deve
lopment, the curve in the more refrangible region is a little more
pronounced       in character.
    Figs. 62 and     63 show    the same equivalents emulsified        in gelatine
and developed by ferrous oxalate.
    The different equivalent proportions of bromide to iodide, it will be
noticed, show themselves in the curves more particularly when a com
parison is made between figs. 51, 59, and 62.

  chloride  and washed and dried, or if exposed in the presence of
  dried silver nitrate or dried potassium nitrite, we have the curve
  shown in fig. 64.   If, on the other hand, we have the same paper
  exposed  moist, with silver nitrate or potassium nitrite we have the
 curve shown in fig. 65.       The reasoning applied to the mixture of
  iodide and bromide applies with equal force here, the results being
  modified for the shift of maximum of the chloride which lies about
  \ H7t. In fig. 64 the most refrangible part of the spectrum as far as
  G is ruddy, between G and F a pink colour, and beyond that grey.
 This difference in colour indicates (as it does in all other photo
 graphed spectra where different colours are impressed or developed) a
 difference of compound acted upon.         According to our theory the
 molecule acted on beyond G in the violet and ultra-violet would be
 Ag2Io+AgICl, and between         G and E Ag2ICl-|-Ag2Cl2        alone.  The
 grey here is probably due to the organic silver compound formed           in
 the paper.
    Fig. 66 shows     the  same   equivalents  if  contained in paper or
collodion, and when exposed to light in the presence of moist silver
 nitrate or other inorganic sensitiser and developed by acid or ferrous
citro-oxalate developer, the slight modification due to the former
-developer noted above still holding good.        Fig. 67 shows the same
 paper or collodion emulsion washed and developed              with ferrous
citro-oxalate. Fig. 68 shows the same when emulsified in gelatine
and developed with the same ferrous developer.         There is a difference
in the curves obtained with collodion and gelatine, but not more than
is explainable by the fact that the former is essentially porous and the
latter almost continuous.
    One Equivalent of Iodide to Three of Chloride. — When three equiva
lents of silver chloride are taken with one of iodide, we have, on
printing a washed paper, the curve shown in fig. 70 ; exposing the
•same paper moist in the presence of silver nitrate we have fig. 71 ;
the reasoning given when the mixture of bromide and iodide was
under consideration holds good.         Figs. 72 and 73 show the same
•equivalents of sensitive salts held in paper, the former showing the
action of development on washed salts and the latter on the same
8exposed in the presence of moist silver nitrate.
    Fig. 69 shows the effect of the spectrum on equal proportions of
the iodide and chloride when emulsified in gelatine.
    Paper and also collodion films containing silver chloride were
blackened in the light and treated with a solution of iodine till the
darkening was obliterated, washed, and then exposed, with or without
sensitisers ; we had nearly the same results on printing and on
development as shown in fig. 74, hence, it was thought useless to
repeat the curve there shown.           (The same applies to darkened

186          Effect  of Spectrum      on  Haloid Salts of Silver.      [Dec. 15,
This appears to be a confirmation of the view already propounded
regarding the formation of a new molecule, in the case of the chloride
and iodide the new molecule taking the form of Ag3ClI, as already
indicated.
   From these results we may observe that to obtain a compound
sensitive to the green a mixture of iodide and bromide, or iodide and
chloride, should be employed, the former in preference to the latter,
since it is more sensitive.        The same sensitiveness to daylight with
the former in gelatine plates can be obtained as when using pure
bromide alone, the sensitiveness being preserved by a shift of the
maximum to the green.
                  Mixtures of Silver Chloride       and Bromide.
   There is nothing special calling for remark in a mixture of these
two sensitive salts.      The printed spectrum and the developed spec
trum seem to be a combination of the spectra impressed on each
individually, a slight prolongation towards the least refrangible end
taking place.
            Mixture of Silver Iodide,        Bromide,   and Chloride.
   When these three salts are combined              together we have spectra
which are very similar to the spectra produced on iodide and chloride,
or iodide and bromide, with a prolongation towards the red.
                              Concluding    Item a rks.
   In  a paper     read,  in 1880, before the Photographic            Society of
Great Britain,     I  recommended        the addition of a small quantity of
iodide to the bromide used in the preparation of gelatine emulsion.
 On carefully examining spectra photographed on such plates (having
•jL part of iodide to ^J8 of bromide)              I find traces of the loss of
sensitiveness about G.       I  stated also that addition of iodide diminished
 the sensitiveness of the bromide to the red rays ; an examination of
 curves given for the mixtures of bromide and iodide of silver bears
out my statement.

    It will be noticed that have not touched upon organic sensitisere
 of the haloids, prepared with an excess of silver and then washed, and
 such sensitiser applied. I have only treated of the haloids themselves,
 endeavouring to eliminate every extraneous effect which would modify
 the action of the spectrum.        I purpose in a subsequent communication
to  enter into  this part of   the subject.

VI. " On a New Electrical Storage Battery."                  By Henry
        Sutton (Ballarat, Victoria). Communicated by The
        President.      Received December 10, 1881.
   The great utility of some thoroughly practical method of con
serving electric force has caused a great deal of attention to be
applied to the subject; no system of electric supply can be con
sidered as perfect until some means is used to so store the force
generated that it may be drawn off equally and regularly, and this
whether the generator be on or off. If we take, as an example of
electric supply, the present systems of electric lighting, it is at once
seen, should an accident or stoppage take place in the machinery
generating the current, the whole of the apparatus such as lamps or
motor-machines are influenced ; should there be a reservoir of elec
tricity between the generator and the apparatus of whatever sort for
ntilising the force this inconvenience would not occur.
   All the present systems of storing electricity depend on certain
chemical changes produced by electrolysis.
   I   have gone through a long series of experiments on storing elec
tricity and made many forms of cells, one being a porous pot con
taining dilute hydric sulphate and a sheet of lead, in an outer
vessel containing a sheet of lead in solution of acetate of lead, the
plate in the porous pot being made the positive electrode ; this cell
had the power of storing electricity, by peroxidising the positive
electrode, and depositing from the acetate of lead solution metallic
lead on the negative electrode, the hydrogen having combined to form
acetic acid.      On discharging the peroxide is reduced, and the oxide
formed during discharge on the other plate dissolves in the acetic
acid, forming the original solution of acetate of lead ; by this means    I
eliminated the injurious effects of the hydrogen on charging.
    During my experiments I found that red oxide of lead is a very bad
conductor of electricity, and the peroxide a good conductor.        I also
discovered that by amalgamating lead plates with mercury a marked
increase was immediately manifest in polarisation effects, the plates
becoming more uniformly and rapidly peroxidised when used as
positive electrodes, and local action entirely disappearing.        These
mercury amalgamated plates        at once gave  me  an  advance  of  other
-cells.   I used them in many ways, constructing cells in which the
positive plate was amalgamated, and the negative coated with red
•oxide, or with peroxide, produced by treating red oxide with dilute
hydric nitrate till the brown precipitate of peroxide fell, the pre
cipitate being washed and painted on the electrode.         I also amal
gamated the negative electrode simply.      I found that in every way
positive    electrodes  amalgamated produced the best results.      I  also

 188                         Mr. H. Sutton.                      [Dec.  15r
made cells in which cither peroxide or red oxide was formed into a
porous conglomerate, using the conglomerates as electrodes, immersed
in dilute hydric sulphate.   I constructed cells with parallel plates, red
oxide or peroxide being filled in between the plates ; in this experi
ment red oxide is useless and peroxide efficient.   In all these experi
ments I succeeded in storing electricity to different extents.
   Having thoroughly satisfied myself that positive electrodes amal
gamated with mercury were the best, I investigated the behaviour of
various forms of negative electrode, having in view the conservation
of the hydrogen ; this I thought to do by occluding the hydrogen in
suitable electrodes, as spongy platinum or metallic palladium ; but as
both these methods would be useless owing to expense I did not even
experiment on them.
   I further thought of having negative electrodes, whose oxides
shonld be soluble in the solntion, and which could be redeposited from
the solution, or of having metallic solutions from which metal could
be deposited, the resulting solution being such that should,        on the
oxidation of the deposited metal, combine with the oxide and again
form the original solution.
   I thought that success in this manner would result in a powerful
and constant source of stored energy, the cell would not polarise itself
during discharge, as is the case in both Plante and Faure cells ; in these
cells the peroxide formed by the discharge produces           a contrary
electromotive force.
   Experimenting from this train of thought, the results           I   have
obtained are such as to have an important practical bearing on the
future of electric work.
   The experiments comprised amalgamated lead as a positive elec
trode with negative electrodes composed of either zinc, iron, or
copper, in each case the solution between the electrodes being a
salt of the metal composing the negative electrode.           With zincr
sulphate of zinc was the solution ; with iron, sulphate of iron ; and
with copper, sulphate of copper.     In all these cases the results were
not only far more powerful than with any form of cell          I  had pre
viously devised, but also very constant, the polarisation lasting many
times longer than in any other form of cell. The cell with zinc negative
electrode   I discarded, owing to the necessity there would be to keep
the zinc plate amalgamated to prevent local action ; the iron negative
electrode was set aside owing to the iron oxidising when the cell'
was not in use.      The cell having a negative electrode of copper, a
positive electrode of lead amalgamated with mercury and a solution of
cupric sulphate,   I have adopted as a thoroughly economical, lasting,
and practical form of storage reservoir.       The chemical changes in
this cell are exceedingly interesting and beautiful, the cell being com
posed of a sheet of lead cleaned with dilute sulphuric acid and amal

1881.]            On a New Electrical Storage Ikittery.               189
gamated thoroughly with mercury, and a sheet of thin copper a little
shorter ; the two sheets are perforated with a number of holes and
then    rolled in a spiral, separated by rubber bands cut every five
inches, the holes in plates and cuts in rubber bands being to allow
free circulation of the solution (the short plate being uppermost
before rolling).   This combination is immersed in a solution of cupric
sulphate, and the amalgamated lead plate made the positive electrode
of a suitable source of electricity, the chemical action being that the
oxygen of the decomposed solution combines with the lead, forming a
perfectly even coating of the insoluble peroxide, the hydrogen re
placing the copper of the solution, and the copper being deposited in
the metallic state on the negative electrode.    As the decomposition of
the cupric sulphate proceeds the solution gradually loses its azure blue
 colour, becoming more acid, and finally when the whole of the copper is
deposited, we have the solution colourless and transformed into hydric
sulphate and water, the positive electrode peroxidised and copper
deposited on the negative electrode.     During discharge the peroxide is
reduced and the copper element oxidised, the oxide combining with
the acid and forming cupric sulphate, the solution returning to its
original colour. This change of colour forms a beautiful means of
telling when the cell is charged ; it is a veritable charging gauge.
The power of this cell is very great and very constant, it can be made
to last for hours, the time being dependent on the quantity of cupric
sulphate decomposed.
    I  have, by the decomposition     and recomposition of one pint of
cupric sulphate, obtained over two hours' effective work in heating to
a red heat one inch of No. 28 iron wire, the cell measuring internally
4 inches deep and 4 inches diameter.
   I  constructed cells with free crystals of cupric sulphate suspended
in the solution, and found that the presence of free crystals prevented
the oxidation of the amalgamated lead electrode, it being essential
that the solution become slightly acid before the peroxide will form.
The cell during charging gives out a peculiar rattling noise, which        I
consider due to the deposition of copper on the negative electrode
altering the form of the spiral.
   A practical form of cell for storing purposes ought to be made, by
fixing a series of amalgamated lead plates in a box in grooves, as in
Crnikshank's trough battery, filling the interval between the plates
with solution of cupric sulphate, and passing a current through of
sufficient tension to overcome the contrary electromotive force of the
series, the positive sides of the plates being peroxidised and copper
deposited on the negative sides.      I have two boxes on this plan, each
containing twenty-five plates,   the total being equivalent to fifty cells.
By this means batteries of great tension can be charged from thirty
Bunsens. A number of twenty-five plate boxes can be coupled for

  It will be seen from the foregoing that this method of conserving
energy has a wide field before      it,
                                   and as    will benefit fellow-workers

       Mole."  By Walter Heape.     Communicated by F. M.
       Balfour, F.R.S. Received November 30, 1881.
  The following     a note on some investigations which
                   is                                         have been I
carrying on by  the  kindness and  with the help of  Mr. Balfour, in the
Morphological Laboratory, Cambridge, upon the origin and formation
of the germinal layers in mammals, more especially in the mole
(Talpa EuTopea).    I  hope shortly to be able to give   more complete
                                                                    a
account.
     In the communication the following subjects are dealt with              :   —
     (1.) The origin of the epiblast.
   (2.) The mode of development of the mesoblast.
  (3.) The structure of the neurenteric canal.
  (4.) The relations of the mesoblast and the hypoblast to the noto-
chord.
  Recent investigations have left the earlier phases of mammalian
development in some confusion,    may therefore be advisable briefly to
                                      it
mention the more important views which are entertained on this
subject.
  Professor Edward van Beneden, in a paper entitled " La formation
                                "         Archives de Biologie," vol.            Part
des feuillets chez de   Lapin       ("                                      i,          1,

 1881.]            and  Karly  Development   of  the. Mole.           1!>1
1880), gives an account of the segmentation of the ovum of that
animal, and states that during segmentation a differentiation of tho
segmentation spheres into two layers is established, the one of which
grows over and encloses the other, giving rise in this manner
to what Van Beneden calls a metagastrula.          The outer of these two
layers he terms ectoderm and the inner entoderm, names which seem
to me, for reasons which will appear in the sequel, to bo misleading,
and for which    I propose to substitute the terms outer and inner layers
respectively.
   Subsequently, according to Van Beneden, a cavity, the blastodermic
cavity, is developed between the outer and inner layers of cells ; the
cells of the former layer become flattened and multiply, and form the
wall of the so-called blastodermic vesicle ; at the same time the blasto
dermic cavity is enlarged, while the inner layer remains as a rounded
mass of cells attached to the wall of the vesicle over a small area known
as the embryonic area. Van Beneden considers that the outer layer of
cells forms the permanent epiblast, both of the embryonic area and of
the blastodermic vesicle, while the inner mass of cells breaks up into
two layers, a lower single layer of flattened cells, the hypoblast, and a
layer of cells which he calls the mesoblast, lying between the hypo
blast and the epiblast of the embryonic area.
    Professor Kolliker, on the other hand, writing in the " Zoologischer
Anzeiger" (Nos. Gl and 62, vol. iii, 1880), "Die Entwicklung der
Keimblatter des Kaninchens," does not dispute the presence of Van
Beneden's epiblast, hypoblast, and mesoblast, in the stage of develop
ment described above, bnt states his agreement with an earlier view
of Rauber, that in the region of the embryo the outer of these layers
disappears, while the whole of the middle layer becomes converted
into the epiblast of the embryonic area ; the epiblast of the remainder
 of the vesicle, however, he considers is formed from part of the
original outer layer of cells.     The mesoblast owes its origin, in his
opinion, wholly to a budding from the epiblast of the primitive
streak.
    Professor Lieberkuhn published in Marburg, in 1879, in a paper
 "Ueber die Keimblatter der Saugethiere," the results of his researches
 upon the dog and mole, in which he states that the epiblast of the em
 bryonic area is derived from the greater part of tho primitive inner
 mass of cells (that portion in fact forming Van Beneden's mesoblast),
together with the part of the original outer layer of cells which over
 lays the inner mass ; the hypoblast he derives from the inner mass of
 cells, while the mesoblast he believes to be formed from both epiblast
 and hypoblast, in the region of the primitive streak.
    I myself have been fortunate enough to secure a fairly complete
 series of mole embryos ranging from an early appearance of the blasto
 dermic cavity until the formation of the medullary groove ; an exami

nation of which leads me, in the main, to agree with Lieberkiihn's
account of the development of the embryonic layers of that animal.
    I have not been able to follow completely the course of segmenta
 tion, nor have I been able to trace a differentiation of the segments
 into two layers, an outer and an inner, though there appears to be no
doubt, on nccount of the arrangement of the spheres in a somewhat
later stage, that Van Beneden's description of a fully segmented
ovum is substantially correct.
    The earliest specimen of an ovum in my possession after the com
pletion of segmentation is similar to that figured in Van Beneden's
paper (loc. cit.), Plate IV, fig. 6, III, and in Lieberkiihn's paper
 (loc. cit.), fig. 1.
    The ovnm consists     of an outer layer and an inner mass of cells,
between and partly separating which is a cavity. The outer layer has
the form of a sphere of somewhat flattened cells, while the inner mass
is composed of irregularly polygonal cells ; these two are attached
together for a small area, elsewhere they are separated by a cavity, the
blastodermic cavity, which is seen in optical section as a crescent-
shaped space partially surrounding the inner mass of cells.            The
diameter of this ovum measures '11 millim., and that of the inner
mass of cells '06 millim.    A thick zona invests the ovum.
     Upon the formation of the blastodermic cavity, the ovum may be
called the blastodermic vesicle.
    The vesicle becomes enlarged, and     I  am inclined to believe, that
during the enlargement, the cells of the inner mass assist in the
formation of the outer wall of the vesicle, since in various vesicles of
about "2, '25, "3, "38 millim. diameter, the diameter of the inner mass,
which is of an approximately spherical shape, is less, being respec
tively '04, '04, '04, '05 millim., than in the youngest vesicle, mea
suring as stated above, '11 millim. in which the inner mass is
*06 millim. diameter.
    Sections through a vesicle measuring "25 millim. diameter (the
inner mass measuring about '04 millim.) show the outer layer to be
composed of greatly flattened cells closely applied to the zona, which
is now much thinner, owing to the expansion of the vesicle, while the
inner mass in the form of a solid mass of irregularly rounded cells is-
attached to the outer layer for a small circular region, which I shall
speak of as the embryonic area.
    As the vesicle enlarges, the inner mass of cells slightly flattens out
and widens at the same time, so that the embryonic area becomes
enlarged.
    In a vesicle '44 millim. diameter, the inner mass of cells is seen to
be commencing to divide into two layers, and in a vesicle "57 millim.
in diameter, in which the inner mass is '08 millim. in diameter,
this division is completed, and a layer composed of a single row of

1881.]            and  Early   Development    of the Mole.             19a
slightly flattened cells is separated off from and underlies the main
portion of the inner mass of cells ; this layer is the hypoblast. The8
main portion of the inner mass of cells is undergoing at the same time
a change in structure, inasmuch as some of the polygonal or rounded
cells of which it has hitherto been composed now become elongated
and columnar.
   The hypoblast in an oval blastodermic vesicle of about 888 millim-
by "81 millim., is still formed of slightly flattened cells beneath the
embryonic area, but it has grown and extended beyond that area, so
that its outer part lies beneath and in close contact with the outer
layer of the blastodermic vesicle ; the cells of this portion of the
hypoblast are wide and much flattened, and their nuclei stain deeply
with hematoxylin.
   A cavity appears about this stage of development in the region of
the embryonic area between the flattened outer layer and the inner
mass, the cells of the latter having now largely become colnmnar.       In
the vesicle last mentioned ('88 millim. by '81 millim.), nearly the whole
of the inner mass has become transformed from a rounded mass of
polygonal cells into a concave plate of columnar cells, forming the
floor of a cavity which is roofed over by the cells of the outer layer of
the blastodermic vesicle.    In this cavity a few cells are placed, which
are connected with the outer layer or inner mass, or with both of
these, by means of protoplasmic processes ; I believe these cells to be8
cells of the inner mass which have not yet become columnar.
   Lieberkuhn states that some of the cells of the inner mass grow
round and above the cavity just described, which thus comes to lie
within the inner mass. The specimens from which he derives his8
opinion however, were,    I believe, preserved in Miiller's fluid.  I hnve
myself seen a similar apparent arrangement in such preparations,
which upon comparison with sections of vesicles of similar ages
prepared in picric acid, appear to me to bear a different interpreta
tion, the layer of cells above the cavity being formed of flat outer
layer cells with a few more or less isolated cells of the inner mass.
   In a vesicle of about 897 millim. diameter, the inner mass of cells8
has still the form of a concave plate composed of two or three layer*
of for the most part columnar cells : the flattened cells of the outer
layer remain, as in the previously described specimen, closely attached
to the zona, and the cells lying in the cavity are fewer, while some of
them appear to have been drawn on to the concave plate and trans
formed into columnar cells.      Cells in a transition stage may be seen
on the surface of the plate.
   At a later stage the concave plate extends itself, the curvature
 becoming less, and eventually approaches to and finally comes into-
contact with the flat cells forming that portion of the wall of the
 vesicle which in the previously described specimens lay above the8

plate   ;   the flattened     cells   of this part soon become columnar,        and
the fusion between them and the plate below becomes complete.
    Somewhat prior to this stage, the edges of the plate become con
tinuous with the outer layer of the wall of the vesicle beyond the
region of the embryonic area.
    Thus, the greater part of the inner mass of cells, as Lieberkiihn
correctly states, combines in the form of a plate of more or less columnar
cells with that part of the flat outer layer of cells which immediately
overlies     to form a plate of columnar cells two and three rows deep
             it,                                                                   ;
this plate     the epiblast plate of the embryonic area, the remainder
               is
of the outer layer of cells forming the epiblastic wall of the blasto
dermic vesicle.
    The portion of the inner mass of cells which was separated off
from the main mass as the hypoblast still forms only a single row of
somewhat rounded cells, the central part of which underlies the
embryonic area, while the peripheral part continually extends as a
layer of flattened cells along the inner aspect of the epiblastic wall of
the remainder of the blastodermic vesicle.
    In concluding this portion of my subject may add, in support of
                                                         I
what    Ibelieve in harmony with Lieberkiihn to be the origin of the
true epiblast of the embryonic area in the mole, that in the course of
my work on this subject, carried on since the investigations of Mr.
Balfour and myself, published in the second volume of Mr. Balfour's
" Comparative Embryology,"            have obtained from an embryo rabbit
                                       I
of six days four hours old, sections which appear to me conclusively to
confirm the results at which we before arrived, namely, that the
epiblast plate of the embryonic area             derived (as in the mole) con
                                                  is
jointly  from   the at first  flattened    cells of the primitive outer layer
                                         "
 (called by Rauber and Kolliker             Deckzellen," and stated by those
observers to disappear     from   the  embryonic area), and from the larger
portion of the primitive inner mass of cells (held by Van Beneden to
be the true mesoblast, and stated by Kolliker alone to form the
 epiblast plate).    In the sections of this embryo the cells of the
 already described primitive outer layer are seen in a transition stage,
 being wedge-shaped and prolonged in between the cells of the inner
mass.
   Atthe stage of growth now arrived at the blastodermic vesicle
may be considered to consist of an embryonic and a non-embryonic
portion.           A                                        in the form
                       surface view shows the embryonic area to be
of a more or less circular opaque disk.    The wall of the vesicle con
sists of a two-layered and a single-layered portion the latter, formed
                                                               ;
of epiblast, alone comprises the portion of the wall opposite to the
embryonic area, while the former, consisting of epiblast and hypoblast,
forms the embryonic area and the part of the vesicle immediately
adjoining it.

    In the course of further growth the vesicle greatly enlarges, and
 the zona becomes much attenuated, affording but little support to the
now also exceedingly thin and delicate wall of the vesicle ; it therefore
becomes difficult to obtain specimens in good preservation.
    In the earliest specimen of this stage which I possess the embryonic
area is oval,   measuring -74 by '48 millim.       In a surface view a dark
line or band is seen to run along the centre of the hinder third of the
area.    This is the well known primitive streak ; it is narrow an
teriorly, while posteriorly   it becomes broader, and finally behind takes
up   nearly the whole breadth of the embryonic area ; it is due to the
presence of a third layer of cells, the mesoblast, between the epiblast
and hypoblast.       Transverse sections of this embryonic area show
the major portion in front of the primitive streak to be composed
(1) of a plate of epiblast formed of two or three rows of columnar
cells, and (2) of a single layer of rounded hypoblast cells somewhat
flattened towards the edge of the area.         Immediately in front of the
primitive streak there appears, extending entirely across the area, a
layer of mesoblast, which is not connected with the epiblast, but is so
intimately united with the hypoblast in the middle line, that the two
layers cannot there be clearly distinguished, though towards the
periphery of the area they are quite distinct.             A section taken
through the anterior end of the primitive streak discovers a narrow
band of epiblast cells in the middle line, giving rise by budding to a
layer of mesoblast which extends laterally to the edge of the area,
aud in each section following        (i.e., towards the hind end of the
primitive streak) the budding epiblast appears continually as a wider
band until the greater part of the whole breadth of the epiblast plate
is concerned     in the production of mesoblast.       A pit is seen in the
epiblast almost at the front end of the primitive streak, and at this
point a neurenteric canal will eventually be formed ; this structure,
hitherto overlooked in mammalian embryos, is identical with the
nenrenteric canal found in other types of Vertebrata.
   The primitive streak grows relatively longer compared with the
increase in size of the embryonic area, until in a vesicle, in which the
latter measures about '84 by '71 millim., the primitive streak reaches
along it fully three parts of its length.      It is very narrow in front,
while behind it occupies the whole breadth of the embryonic area.
In sections of the region in front of the primitive streak there is
 present a layer of cells several rows thick immediately underlying the
epiblast plate.     In the seven anterior sections this layer is seen
beneath the epiblast, as a mass which cannot be resolved into hypoblast
and mesoblast    ; for about three following sections, placed immediately
in front of the primitive streak, the layer is clearly composed of (1) a
 layer of flattened hypoblast below, and (2) a layer of mesoblast above.
 The mesoblast in the axial line is thickened in the last two of these

sections,and posteriorly joins the anterior wall of the neurenteric
canal, while the hypoblast extends as a distinct layer below the
anterior end of the primitive streak. It appears highly probable that
the whole layer in the seven sections at the front end of the embryonic
area, is the hypoblast originally present there engaged in the act of
budding off mesoblast, as Balfonr believes to be the case with regard to
a similarly situated portion of the hypoblast in the chick (" Compara
tive Embryology," vol.  ii,p. 129 et seq.). In the three following sections
where distinct layers of mesoblast and hypoblast are found, the whole
of the mesoblast, with the exception of the cells forming the central
thickening in the second and third sections, has,      I  believe, a similar
origin, and may be distinguished by the form and appearance of its cells
from the mesoblast of the primitive streak.         The mesoblast derived
from the hypoblast may be called hypoblastic mesoblast           ; joins the
                                                                     it
mesoblast of the primitive streak as the latter grows forward, and the
two become indistinguishable.
   The primitive streak presents in section similar appearance to that
                                                  a
of the embryo last described; a groove — the primitive groove — is,
however, present along its upper surface.      The position of the future
neurenteric   canalisindicated by a pit in the epiblast as in the specimen
described above.
   At a slightly later stage the emhryonic area being 1*17 by *81
millim., the condition of the layers   is much the same. A neurenteric
canal now perforates the whole thickness of the blastoderm at the
front end of the primitive groove.     The upper opening of this canal,
which   is longer than the lower opening, has the appearance of a slit
with its anterior wall sloping obliquely backwards this wall is con
                                                       ;
tinuous with the thickening of mesoblast cells in the axial line which
I  described in the last stage.     The first traces of the amnion are
now visible, as a fold of the epiblast round the whole circumference
of the embryonic area at the posterior end the folds of the two sides
                        ;
meet to form a hood, covering the hinder part of the area, but
anteriorly   I  have been unable to determine the extent of their
growth.
   In the surface view of an embryonic area measuring '97 by "70
millim. in diameter, a band of a lighter shade than the remainder                is
to be seen in the front part of the long axis of the area, its posterior
end adjoining the anterior end of the primitive streak the latter    ;
occupies the hinder third of the area, and where            joins the light-

coloured band a pit, the upper opening of the neurenteric canal,                 is
distinctly to be seen surrounded by a dark rim.
   In transverse section the light-coloured band       isseen to be caused
by a diminution in thickness of the epiblast plate and of the mesoblast
in the middle line. The epiblast of this region        is bent inwards to
form   a groove, the medullary groove   ;    itwide and shallow through
                                                  is

  1881.]           and  Early  Development   of the Mole.             197
 out, and the cells forming it are not more than two rows deep, while
 the remainder of the epiblast plate, except at the extreme edge, is
 three cells deep.
    Anterior to the medullary groove a continuous layer hardly differ
 entiated into mesoblast and hypoblast underlies the epiblast plate.
 In the region of the medullary groove an axial strip of the cells
 underlying the epiblast exhibits no division into hypoblast and meso
blast ; this portion, though partially separated from the lateral masses
of mesoblast, is still connected with them however on each side by a
narrow neck of cells, and is also directly continuous laterally with the
hypoblast.     The lateral hypoblast is quite distinct from the super
jacent   lateral masses of mesoblast.    The axial strip of cells under
lying the medullary groove (thus shown to be continuous with both
the mesoblast and the hypoblast) may be regarded as the commencing
notochord.
    The neurenteric canal does not any longer perforate the blastoderm,
its upper part alone remaining, which is surrounded by a thick mass
of mesoblast, causing the dark rim seen in the surface view round the
pit.   Its anterior wall is connected with the axial mass of cells under
lying the medullary groove, while its hind wall forms the front end of
the primitive streak.
   The surface view of a somewhat older specimen, 1"5 millims. by -81
millim. diameter, shows the mednllary groove relatively much longer
and more clearly defined.     Anteriorly it reaches near to the edge of
the embryonic area.
   In section it is seen to be shallow at each end, but is much deeper
and narrower towards the middle of the embryonic area.          Its walls,
at the anterior end, are but slightly less thick than the remainder of
the epiblast plate, but in the deeper part of the groove become con
siderably thinner.     Where the groove is deepest the notochord and
adjacent parts form a well-marked projection into the blastodermic
cavity beneath.
   The rudimentary notochord has now extended beyond the anterior
end of the medullary groove, and its relations to the adjacent layers
are, for the most part, the same as in the previously described speci
men.     In front of the medullary groove it is composed of a single row
of somewhat columnar cells, continuous laterally with both mesoblast
and hypoblast ; below the anterior more shallow part of the medullary
groove similar relations exist, towards its middle and deeper part how
ever, where the lateral mesoblast is commencing to form protovertebrse,
the notochordal cells, still in the form of a single row, are connected
solely with the lateral plates of hypoblast, while further baekwwds,
wher« the mednllary groove becomes again more shallow, the cells of
the notochord become more than one row deep, and are again con
tinuous both with the lateral mesoblast and hypoblast. The notochord,

                 On  the  Germinal Layers,   $c  of  the Mole.  [Dec. 22,
continually thickening towards its hinder extremity, terminates by
 fusing with the anterior wall of the neurenteric canal.       The latter
 structure is now open above on the floor of the posterior end of the
 medullary groove, and extends downwards into the cells beneath,
though it no longer perforates the hypoblast, which is, however, some
what involuted, and indistinguishably fused with the mesoblast in the
median line.
    Briefly to recapitulate, I have attempted to show : —
    (1.) The epiblast of the blastodermic vesicle owes its origin as well
to the inner mass of segmentation spheres as to the outer layer of
segments.      It appears to originate in two ways :
    («.) In an early stage of development (in the mole) probably by
the cells of the inner mass being directly transformed into part of the
wall of the blastodermic vesicle.
    (I.) In a later stage (mole and rabbit) by the transformation of
the rounded cells of the inner mass into a plate of columnar cells,
which joins the part of the outer layer lying immediately above it to
form the epiblast plate of the embryonic area.
    (2.) The mesoblast in the mole is formed in two portions : —
    (o.) A larger portion which has its origin in the primitive streak.
    (6.) A smaller portion which is derived from the hypoblast situated
in front of the primitive streak.
   I  have been unable to distinguish where the latter, or hypoblastic
mesoblast, comes into contact with the mesoblast of the primitive
streak, and what part these respective layers take in the future
development of the embryo.
    (3.) A neurenteric canal is present in the mole similar to that
formed in other types of Vertebrata, first appearing as a pit at the
anterior end of the primitive streak, while in later stages it perforates
the floor of the hinder end of the medullary groove.
    I may here add that I have also found in a seven days' rabbit embryo
a rudimentary neurenteric canal in the form of a shallow pit in the
epiblast at the front end of the primitive streak.
    (4.) The notochord is formed of an axial strip of cells, which un
derlies the epiblast of the medullary groove, and which either never
become divided into mesoblast and hypoblast, or in which such a
division, if it does take place (as appears not impossible), is very soon
lost. This strip of cells is originally continuous laterally with both
mesoblast and hypoblast, but as the lateral mesoblast becomes con
verted into definite vertebral plates the connexion is lost.             ,
   There can,    I believe, be no doubt of the connexion of the lateral
hypoblast and mesoblast with the notochordal cells in the mole ; in
the rabbit   I am inclined to believe that a similar connexion is present,
but my evidence on this point is not yet conclusive.

 II. "On the Rhythm of the Heart of the Frog, and on the
       Nature of the Action of the Vagus Nerve." By W. PL
       Gaskell, M.D. Cantab. Communicated by Dr. Michael
       Foster, Sec R.S. Received December 8, 1881.
                                  (Abstract.)
   The method of investigation employed by the anthoris as follows: —
The heart with the vagus nerve intact having been removed from the
body together with a portion of the oesophagus, a thread is tied to the
very apex of the ventricle and another to the loose flap which is dis
closed at the junction of the two auricles when the two aortic trunks
are cut away.     The piece of the oesophagus removed with the heart
is held firmly in a suitable holder and the heart suspended between two
horizontal levers by means of the two threads which are attached to the
auricles and ventricle.     Between the two levers a clamp is placed, the
edges   of which can be approximated to any degree by means of a fine
micrometer screw     ; the two limbs of this clamp are placed one on each
side of the suspended heart, and by means of the micrometer screw, the
tissue between the two edges can be simply held firm or compressed to
any extent required. In this way, with the clamp in the auriculo- ven
tricular groove, the beats of both auricles and ventricle are registered
simultaneously and separately ; the contractions of the auricles pull
the upper lever downwards, those of the ventricle the lower lever
upwards.      Similarly by varying the position of the clamp the con
tractions of any two adjacent portions of the heart can be studied, as
for example, sinus and kauricles, base and apex of the ventricle, <fcc. ;
heat, cold, and poisons can be applied to the tissue on the one side of
the clamp and not on the other ; and under all these various condi
tions the effects of stimulation of the vagus can be observed.
   The paper is divided into two parts : Part I, on the rhythm of the
heart ; Part II, on the action of the vagus nerve.
   In Part 1 reasons are given for the view that discrete impulses
pass from the motor ganglia to the muscular tissue, that, therefore,
the normal rhythm of the heart is dependent upon rhythmical dis
charges from the motor ganglia, and is not due to the production by
the cardiac muscle of rhythmical results from a constant stimulation.
This follows from the fact that any influence which, when applied to
the auricles and sinus alone, causes an alteration in the rhythm of
the auricles, affects the rate of the ventricular beats synchronously;
while the same influence applied to the ventricle alone, causes no
alteration in the rhythm of the auricles or in the synchronism of the
ventricular with the auricular beats.         Thus heat applied to the ven
tricle alone does not alter its rhythm although it reduces the force of

its contractions; while on the other hand, when applied to the
auricles and sinns alone, it quickens the rhythm most markedly.
Cold, atropin, muscarin, all slow the rhythm when applied to auricles
and sinus, but cause no alteration of rhythm except in extreme doses
when applied to the ventricle alone.
   The author then proceeds to consider the conditions which are
necessary in order that each one of these impulses should produce a
contraction, and concludes that a due relation must exist between the
strength of the impulse and the excitability of the tissue in order to
obtain this result.
   By a comparison of the rate of the contractions of the auricles with
those of the ventricle, it is found that the ventricle can be made to
beat synchronously with every second, third, fourth, or more auricular
beats, or to cease from beating altogether by increasing the com
pression of the clamp in the auriculo-ventricnlar groove or by heating
the sinus and auricles alone without heating the ventricle.    The com
monest and most permanent effect is to make the ventricle beat
synchronously with every second auricular beat.
   This same want of sequence between the ventricular and auricular
contractions can also be obtained by the application of various poisons
to the ventricle alone.   A marked difference however exists between
the two cases.   In the first case, when the ventricle is made to beat
with half-rhythm by tightening the clamp, or by heating the auricles
and sinus, its contractions are those of a strong vigorous muscle, and
are more powerful than when the ventricle was beating synchronously
with every beat of the auricles ; on the other hand, the application of
poisons to the ventricle does not produce this effect on its rhythm
until by the action of the poison the force of the contractions has
become greatly reduced.
   For this and other reasons given in the original paper, the author
concludes that either tightening the clamp or heating the anricles and
sinus alone diminishes the strength of the impulses passing to the
ventricular muscle, and so causes the half-rhythm observed ; while
various poisons applied to the ventricle alone produce the same effect
by diminishing its excitability, without affecting the strength of the
impulses.
   The conclusions arrived at in Part I can be summed up in the
following propositions : —
   1. The rhythm of the heart is caused by discrete motor impulses
passing to the muscular tissue from certain motor ganglia.
   2. In order that each one of these impulses may produce a con
traction of the ventricle a due relation must exist between the
strength of the impulse and the excitability of the ventricular muscle.
   3. When each impulse is inefficient to cause a contraction of the
ventricle, the ventricular muscle has the power of summing up the

   1881.]          On  the Rliythn of the Heart of   the  Frog.          201
  effects of two or more   of these inefficient impulses,   and so continues
  to beat rhythmically      though   no  longer synchronously with every
  impulse.
     4. The most satisfactory explanation of this summation process is as
  follows : — Every impulse which is inefficient to produce a muscular
  contraction increases the excitability of the muscle, and therefore
  makes it easier for a second similar impulse to cause a contraction.
      5. The impulses can be made inefficient to produce contractions syn
  chronous with them by lowering sufficiently the excitability of the
  ventricle, as is seen in the action of poisons, even although the rate
  and strength of the impulses remain unaltered.
     6. The impulses can also be made inefficient, when the excitability
 of the muscle is unchanged, by diminishing the strength of the im
  pulses, as is seen in the effects of compressing the tissue between the
 ventricle and the motor ganglia, or of heating the auricles and sinus
 without heating the ventricle.
     7. There is a limit to the extent to which a series of inefficient im
 pulses can raise the excitability of the muscle, so that the ventricle
 can remain absolutely quiescent, even although the impulses still pass
 to it, when those impulses are sufficiently weakened.
     In Part  II  the action of the vagus nerve is considered, and it i-
 shown that its stimulation produces a most marked effect upon the
 force of the contractions, both of auricles and ventricle, entirely
 independent of any alteration of rhythm.         The curves obtained can
 be classified under the three following types : —
     1. Complete quiescence of both ventricle and auricles, followed by
 contractions which at first are scarcely visible, but which rapidly
 increase in size, until at the maximum they are much greater than
 before the stimulation of the nerve.       From this maximum they very
 gradually decrease, until the original size of contraction is again
 reached.
    2. During the stimulation no quiescence of either ventricle or
auricles, but simply a diminution of the size of the contractions,
followed by a rapid and marked augmentation of the contractions
beyond the original height, and then a slow gradual diminution to the
size obtaining before the nerve was stimulated.
    3. No primary diminution, but from the commencement              of the
stimulation the beats increase in size, and after a time gradually
return again to the original size.
    Between these three types every conceivable variation may occur, so
that a series of curves may be selected in which no line of demarca
tion can be drawn between complete primary quiescence, or to use the
usual term, inhibition, on the one hand, and a simple primary aug
mentation of the size of the contractions on the other.
    These curves alone show that the vagus is able to cause a standstill
                                                                p 2

202             On  the Rhythm  of the Heart of   the Frog.     [Dec.  22,
by diminishing the force of the contraction down to quiescence ; this
is further shown by the fact that standstill of the ventricle alone can
occur while the auricles are beating with accelerated or unaltered
rhythm, but diminished force, or even when from the commencement
of the stimulation the force of the auricular contractions is in
 creased.
    This same gradation of effect, as the result of the stimulation of the
 nerve, from absolute standstill to a simple primary augmentation, is
seen more or less clearly in the course of each separate experiment ;
the stimulations that occur immediately after the suspension of the
 heart are much the most likely to produce standstill ; later ones to
cause primary diminution followed by augmentation, and finally aug
mentation   alone.
    The power of diminishing the contractions to standstill appears to
last longer after the heart has been suspended at some times of the
year than at others.
    The conclusion is drawn that the variations in the effects produced
by stimulation of the vagus on the force of the contractions are
dependent essentially upon the condition of the nutrition of the heart ;
and possibly for the same cause the vagus tends to lose all power of
producing slowing after the heart has been suspended in the apparatus,
for in most cases acceleration only is seen, although slowing occurred
on stimulation before the heart was cut out, and apparently slowing is
more likely to occur immediately after the suspension of the heart
than later.
    The action of the vagus upon the muscnlar tissue is not only shown
by its effect on the size of the contractions, but also by its influence
on the excitability and tonicity of the ventricular muscle.
    When by tightening the clamp the ventricle is made to beat
synchronously with every second auricular beat, stimulation of the
nerve may cause the ventricle during the stimulation              to beat
synchronously with every third, fourth, or more auricular beats ; and
the same alteration in the relation between the rhythm of the two
parts above and below the clamp is seen in the case of the contractions
of the apex and base of the ventricle, when the clamp is placed midway
across the ventricle.
    Also, when the ventricle is beating with half-rhythm from the
action of the clamp, stimulation of the nerve may make it beat syn
chronously with every beat of the auricles for a definite time; and
 when the ventricle is not beating, either in consequence of tightening
 the clamp, or of heating the auricles and sinus, then vagus stimula
 tion may cause a series of contractions synchronous with those of the
 auricles.
    These experiments are to be explained on the supposition that the
 vagus stimulation diminishes the excitability of the ventricle at one

1881.]             Dr. E.  J. Mills.    On Melting Point.           203
time and increases it at another, and it is also shown that the
times of this diminution and increase correspond respectively to the
periods when the vagus causes a diminution and increase of the size
of the contractions.
   The action of the vagus upon the muscular tissue of the ventricle is
further shown by its power of removing the inequalities in the size of
the ventricular contractions, when as often happens, the ventricle is
 beating with alternately strong and weak contractions.
   Stimulation of the nerve causes this inequality to disappear when it
increases the force of the contractions, and to reappear again when it
diminishes that force.
   The effect of stimulation of the vagus upon the tonicity of the
ventricle was studied by the method described elsewhere,* and the
author shows that the relaxation between the beats of the ventricle is
increased dnring the stimulation of the nerve, even although the rate
of rhythm is not made slower.
   The conclusion therefore is drawn, that stimulation of the vagus acts
upon the muscular tissue of the ventricle in such a way as to diminish
its excitability and lower its tonicity, when it reduces the force of
the ventricular contractions, while it increases its excitability and
possibly also increases its tonicity when it augments the contraction
force.
   Finally, it is shown that atropin removes the whole action of the
vagus stimulation, and the effects of the local application of curare,
muscarin, and atropin are described and discussed.
   In conclusion, the author sums up the results of these experiments,
and suggests that a series of formative processes are going on in both
the muscular tissue and the motor ganglia of the heart, similar to
those which occur in gland-cells, and that the vagus produces all its
effects by increasing the activity of these processes and not because it
contains a multiplicity of fibres, each of which possesses a different
function.

given below, consists of a bath nearly filled with oil of vitriol. In this is
inserted a glass funnel, having on its lower edge six equidistant semi
circular cuts of about 5 millims. radius, and, at the end of the neck, four
of the same. A thin test-tube, resting freely on the funnel, contains
a bath of paraffin oil, in which the thermometer's bulb is centrally
placed ; against the bulb, in a little tube separately represented, is
fixed the substance whose melting point is to be determined. When
the large bath is heated, constrained and regular convection takes place
in the liquid ; the effect upon the thermometer is such as to cause the
mercury to rise with very great steadiness.
   A preliminary series of researches in thermometry has enabled me
to give a series of results completely corrected, and in terms of the
air thermometer.

   The method      of purification adopted was based upon what may be
termed the    principle of multiple successive solvents. It is well known
that small    quantities of impurities are prone to cling to substances
with great tenacity ; but the observation has most frequently been
made in connexion with a single solvent.               One can readily conceive
that the tenacity with which a given trace of a foreign body is held,
under such circumstances, may be in effect constant.           If, however, we
now transfer the mixture to a second solvent, it may be presumed that
the trace will be in a condition of altered adhesiveness, and may be
much more readily separable.            In accordance with this principle the
substances     were crystallised from two solvents at least, and the
constant melting points of successive fractions recorded.            After every
fractional crystallisation, pressure was had recourse to for about
 twelve hours.
   A glance at the table shows that, on the whole, melting point and
 formula grow together.            The following instances of this law
 (M.P.=j» Formula) are adduced: —

    The melting points recorded in the memoir are important physical
constants,   now first determined with a small probable error, and with
an apparatus of considerable simplicity.         Under no range of ordinary
atmospheric pressure or latitude, and in no ordinary interval of time,
are these constants likely to become impaired.            Hence, if the sub
stances referred to be prepared and preserved with average care, and
 handled with moderate skill, they constitute in themselves a set of
 thermometric standards, distributed at mean intervals of about 4
between 42° and 120°.         If these substances, or most of them, be at
 hand, they enable an investigator to at once calibrate and directly
 refer to the air thermometer any standard mercurial instrument, without
 the necessary application of any correction whatever.

 the whole being prefixed a list of the more important papers dealing8
 with the double theta-functions.

the sums of the four similarly situated numbers in the characteristics
of the functions are all even, the equation comprises 4,096 cases

  This general result seems to be new, but numerous particular cases
occur in Rosenhain's paper.   All the important parts of his theory
are deduced, viz., the quadratic relations between                                            the constant terms

   (1.) The following proof of the equation to a circle inscribed in a
triangle, expressed in trilinear co-ordinates, is very short and simple.
   Let «,      be the sides of the triangle, A, B,

be the equation to an inscribed conic.      Then when this conic                                                        is   a
circle, the centre    given by the equations «=<3=7, and the equation
                                 is

    (2.) The following theorem      given by Dr. Salmon in his Higher

Plane Curves " —             :
   If through any point of inflexion A in a curve of the third order
there be drawn three right lines meeting the curve in ab, df, ec, then
every curve of the third degree passing through the seven points A, a,
b,   d,
      f,    will have A for
               c,
               e                point of inflexion. It follows from this
                                                       a
that any curve of the third degree described through the nine points
of inflexion of a cubic will have those points as points of inflexion.
   Dr. Salmon has given a geometrical proof of this theorem, and this
is the only demonstration    have ever seen. I   have, therefore, obtained      I
the following analytical proof, which possesses,       think, considerable             I
beauty.

Hence, if ae + cb — ne — mb vanish, the origin will be a point of in
flexion, whatever values we give to 6 and 0 ; hence the theorem is
true.

third order ; two of these are at right angles to one another, determine

                                (Abstract.)
   This   paper is concerned  with two kinds of functions of the coeffi
cients of Linear Differential Equations, which have certain invariant
properties.
   In the first part of the paper it is shown that every Linear Differen
tial Equation possesses a certain number of functions of the coeffi
cients which are unaltered by changing the dependent variable y to
iju where u is any given function of x, the independent variable.
These functions bear remarkable analogies to functions of the differ
ences of the roots of ordinary algebraic equations, and many problems ,
 provided they involve only the ratios of the solutions of the differen
tial equation, may be solved in terms of them ; for example, the
condition that two solutions yl and y2 of a linear differential equation
of the third order should be connected by the relation y^=y^c is
expressed in terms of two such functions of the coefficients of the
equation.    This problem is analogous to that of finding the discrimi
nant of an algebraic binary cubic.
   The second part of the paper is concerning functions of the coeffi
cients of Linear Differential Equations which are unaltered by change
of the independent variable, and the theory of these functions is
applied to the solutions of problems involving only relations among
the solutions of the equation without the independent variable.
   In this part of the paper it is shown how to form the condition that
the three solutions yv ija, y3 of a linear differential equation of the
third order should be connected by the relation yiy2=ys~, which
relation, involving only ratios of the solutions, and not containing the
independent variable, can be expressed in terms of either class of the
functions of the coefficients considered in the paper ; these two
methods of writing the condition are accordingly given.

       diant Heat." By S. A. Hill, B.Sc, Meteorological Reporter
       for the North- Western Provinces and Oudh, India."                  Com
       municated by Lieut-General R. Strachey, R.E., F.R.S.
       Received December 14, 1881.
    Notwithstanding the ingenuity with which Dr. Tyndall has made
use of the most recent physical appliances to support and confirm the
results of his classical researches concerning the behaviour of gases and
vapours with regard to radiant heat, his conclusions, in so far as they
relate to the comparative diathermancy of dry air and water vapour,
have not yet met with general acceptance among meteorologists.
There is even, on the part of some, an evident reluctance to accept
the decision of laboratory experiments ou the question of atmospheric
absorption as final, however ingenious, varied, and consistent with
one another the experiments may be.
    I have, therefore, attempted to approach the question from another
side, and to determine, if possible, what constituent of the atmosphere
has the greatest absorptive power, by means of the actinometric observaT
tions so carefully made at Mussooree and Dehra by Messrs. J. B. N. Hen
nessey, F.R.S., and W. H. Cole, M.A., in conjunction with the records
of meteorological observations made at the same or neighbouring
places in the same months of the year.          The actinometric observations
were made between the 27th October and 4th November, 1869, and
between the 31st October and 19th November, 1879. Abstracts of the
results have been published by Mr. Hennessey in the " Proceedings,"
vol. xix, p. 229, and vol. xxxi, p. 154. In both years the observations
were made with two actinometers of the Rev. Gh C. Hodgkinson's
form, marked A and B, each of which appears to have remained
absolutely unaltered during the ten years.            The results taken from
Mr. Hennessey's tables are those expressed in units equal to a tenth of
a millimetre of the scale of the instrument A, glass off.
    The observations which serve to throw most light on the question
under discussion are those of the long diurnal series, from 8 a.m. to
4 p.m., made on tho 4th November, 1869, and the 12th and 14-th
November, 1879. In Tables I, II, III, the observed values of the
 radiation received in three minutes at each hour* are compared with
certain symmetrical values computed in the following way.
    It has been assumed that Jamin and Masson's law of absorption
holds good for each day at both stations ; that is to say, that the
logarithm of the heat received varies inversely as the thickness of the
atmosphere      traversed, or, in other words, that- the quantity of heat
    * On the 4th November,   1869, the mean time of each set of observations was
 several minutes after the exact hour.  The values given in Table I have been in
 terpolated from Mr. Hennessey's figures by means of parabolic formula; extending
 over three hours at a time.

1881.]            the Atmosphere which absorbs               Radiant Heat.               217
absorbed by each unit thickness of the absorbent substance (supposed
homogeneous) is proportional to the total heat which falls upon it.
This rule was long ago found by Pouillet to be approximately true of
atmospheric absorption. The thickness of atmosphere to be traversed
by the solar rays at various angles of incidence has been taken to be
simply proportional to the secant of the sun's zenith distance.                       If the
vertical thickness of the absorbent atmosphere be taken at 8j-J-gth of
the earth's radius, the error of the preceding assumption is almost
insensible for the inclinations in the tables; and below an elevation
equal to xuoth of the radius lie 68 per cent. of the dry air, and 99£
per cent. of the water vapour of our atmosphere.                         If, then, R stands
for the total radiation that would fall upon the actinometer at the
limit of the atmosphere, and r for the observed radiation at the place of
•observation,       when the sun's zenith distance is 2, we may put log r
 = log R— K sec z, where K is a coefficient the antilogarithm of which
represents the fraction of the total radiation that would be absorbed by
a vertical column of the air above the place at the time of the observa
tion. Assuming the K to be constant for each day at each station,                            I
have computed the values of log R independently from the sets of obser
vations made at the two stations ; and then, taking the most probable
value of R for each day to be that derived from the mean of the two
log R's, in which the logarithm deduced from the observations at the
 upper station* is given double weight, I have recomputed the coeffi
cients marked KM and KD respectively, and finally worked out the
 symmetrical values of r for the hours before and after apparent
 noon.

  These    tables suggest two independent methods of inquiring which
among the atmospheric gases has the greatest power of arresting

  1881.]         the  Atmosphere which absorbs Radiant Seat.                  219
 radiant heat.      We can inquire which constituent of the atmosphere is
 subject to a diurnal variation most resembling that of the absorption
 coefficient, and also which constituent is distributed vertically in a
 manner most closely approaching to that of the absorptive substance.
    If the coefficient K were truly constant for each day, as has been
 assumed, the positive and negative differences between the observed
 and computed values of r should be irregularly distributed ; but we
 find that, almost without exception, the computed values are too low
 in the forenoon and too high in the afternoon at Mussooree, while at
 Dehra there is no such regular order in the differences.         The excess of
 the morning over the afternoon radiation at Mussooree                and their
approximate equality at Dehra are very clearly seen         in  the averages of
 the three sets of observations, which are the following : —
                       8       9    10     11   12    13      14     15      16

    The departure from complete symmetry at Dehra is due chiefly to
one observation at 4 p.m. on the 4th November, 1869, whe,n probably
there was a    slight haze partially obscuring the sun.
    The absorption of heat by the atmosphere on a clear, calm day
cannot be, in any appreciable degree, a mere apparent effect due to
the scattering of the rays brought about by disturbances set up in the
atmosphere through heating from below ; for any variations in the
amount of such scattering must be even more apparent at the lower
station that at the upper one, because, to get to the lower station, the
rays must pass through more of the disturbed atmosphere.             Moreover,
such disturbances, and the apparent absorption caused by them, would
probably be at least as great during the hours of rising temperature
(up to about 1 p.m.) as when the temperature is falling.          The increased
absorption    of   the   afternoons  at Mussooree  must  therefore be due to
the fact that more of the absorbent substance — whatever it be — lies
above the level of the station in the afternoons than in the mornings,
while above the lower station the total quantity of this substance is
practically constant throughout the day ; that is to say, the absorbent
substance is carried upwards during the day and probably sinks down
wards again at night.
    Such an upward movement of the total atmosphere occurs under
the influence of diurnal heating, but what proportion of the air that
is lifted above Mussooree by expansion           from below remains there
cannot be exactly determined.           The barometer falls from 10 a.m. to

4    p.m.   at all elevations         where     observations have been made in the
Himalaya,         as  it does on the plains.         In any case, the fraction of the
 total atmosphere which accumulates above Mussooree dnring the day
 hours must be a very small one, and its influence in increasing the
absorptive power of the upper atmosphere may be safely neglected.
     With water vapour the case is different. This diminishes so rapidly
as we ascend* that, if it be the chief absorbent substance, a small
variation in the quantity of it lying above the higher station will con
siderably affect the absorbing power there observed.                       In the following
table the value of KM for each hour of observation, computed from the
mean of the three series, is compared with the mean hourly values of the
barometric pressure and vapour tension for November at Simla, a neigh
bouring station of nearly the same altitude, and with the vapour tension
and cloud proportion observed at Roorkee, a station 40 miles S.S W.
from Mussooree and 887 feet above the sea. General Boileau's ob
servations at Simla in 1843-5, from which the figures for that station
have been taken, were made inside a house, and do not strictly repre
sent the variations in the humidity of the external air.                         The normal
variation      of  humidity      in  the upper     air  may,    however,   be  inferred with
some approximation to the truth from the variations of cload ; for
though the days of observation were without cloud, like most days in
November in North India, there is no reason to suppose that the
diurnal movements of the vapour were different in direction on those
days from what they are when the humidity is so high that clouds
are formed.

     It  will be seen from Table IV, and from the diagram below, that
the variation of the absorption coefficient is similar in its chief
feature — the increase from morning to afternoon — to that of the

 1881.]        the Atmosphere which absorbs Radiant Heat.             221
vapour pressure observed at Simla, but totally different from the
variation of the barometric pressure ; while the absorption curve
agrees closely with that of the humidity of the upper atmosphere as
indicated by cloud, even in minor points like the decrease at 10 A.M.
Also, since the hourly observations at Roorkee show that the pressure
of vapour there is less in the afternoon than in the morning, it is
probable that the variations, both above and below, are caused by an
upward movement of the vapour during the day.           Sach a movement
would not affect the absorption of heat by the whole depth of the
atmosphere, if water vapour be the chief absorbent substance, and we
find that at Dehra the absorption in the afternoon is little, if at all,
greater than in the morning. The evidence of the diurnal variation,
therefore, points strongly to the conclusion that water vapour is the
chief absorbent.
   The question may be answered more directly by the second method,
the determination of the law of vertical distribution of the absorbing
matter. Since both stations lie above the dust-haze so common over
India in the cold weather, and since the days of observation were free
from cloud, we may assume that the absorbent substance we have to
deal with is a gas distributed according to the barometric formula;
and therefore the observations at two places suffice to determine the
law approximately.       We have, then, for each day, log KM=

In computing Cj       the vapour tensions observed        at the Meteorological
Observatory     of Roorkee have been combined             with those of Dehra.
because the latter seem to be somewhat          too great at all times of the
year in comparison with those for other places in the Himalaya at
nearly the same altitude,t while Roorkee is generally a little too dry.
In  any case, with such a variable element as water vapour, it is best
to deduce the law of distribution from as many observations as
possible.
   The difference between the values of C and C2 is so small, con
sidering the nature of the observations, while that between C and Ci
is so very great, that there can be very little error in agreeing with
Dr. Tyndall that the absorptive power of dry air is sensibly nothing,
and that the total absorptive power of the atmosphere is due to the
water vapour it contains.
   The true absorption coefficient at sea-level, on the supposition that
the absorbent substance increases in density according to the same
law as between Mussooree and Dehra, appears to have been a good
deal less on the two days of observation in 1879 than the mean value
found by Pouillet in 1838, while its value on the 4th November,
 1869, differed but little from Pouillet's mean result.           Pouillet found
the absorption      of  a vertical  column     of  transparent atmosphere at
Paris to vary between 818 and '27 of the total incident radiation. the
 mean being about 824.       From Mr. Hennessey's observations the co
efficient for Naperian logarithms at sea-level appears to have been
   * Computed from the observations made at the Meteorological Observatories of
 Dehra and Roorkee, and at CUakrata, 30 miles north of Mussooree and 7.160 feet
above the sea. No observations of humidity were made at Mussooree on this day.

    If the  differences    in these values of the total absorption be caused
 entirely by variations in the quantity of aqueous vapour in the air,
 the fraction of the total incident heat which is arrested before reaching
 the ground will be a direct function of the vapour tension at the
 place of observation, and an inverse function of the rate of diminution
of the vapour tension with height. We may suppose it to be simply
proportional to the total quantity of water vapour over the place of
observation.       This has been shown by Dr. J. Hann* to be equal to a
depth of water, /X

    If  now   K=«Q,     the value of a on the 12th November is found to
be '0495, and on the 14th, '0648.             The fraction of the total radiation
absorbed from day        to   day   therefore  does not bear a constant relation
to the quantity of aqueous vapour in the air ; and. consequently, it
seems probable that the quality of the sun's heat is subject to con
siderable variations from day to day. If this be so, it will be impos
sible to arrive at comparable actinometric results from a few observa
tions about apparent noon each day, unless the observing station
be sufficiently elevated to lie above the greater part of vapour atmo
sphere.
    Unfortunately no bygrometric observations were taken at Mussooree
in November, 1869, so that it is impossible to determine precisely,
from the actinometric observations made there by Mr. Hennessey,
whether     the radiation emitted from the sun was more or less sus
ceptible   of  absorption in 1869 than in 1879.             At Dehra, however, the

The vapour tension observed at Dehra is a strictly local phenomenon,
as has been above pointed out, but still the values of a for the two dap
in 1879 accord so well with those deduced from the observations at
Mussooree, that there can be little donbt that water vapour had a
greater absorbent effect on the radiation of the 4th November, 1869,
than on that emitted from the sun on the other days.
   From the observations made simultaneously at Mussooree and
Dehra, for several days near apparent noon, we may perhaps deter
mine approximately whether the mean emissive power of the sun
was greater at the beginning of November, 1860, or in November,
1879.     There are only three quantities to determine for each year,
the total radiation at the limit of the atmosphere, the absorption co
efficient for Mnssooree and the same for Dehra, and we have three
relations between these quantities : —
                       (1) LogR=log»M + KMseczM,
                       (2)  LogR=logrD + K2seczD,
                       (3)  LogKM=logKD-l^feet.
In (3) we     may take C to be the constant of the formula for water
vapour,   which,    for 1869, may be computed from the observations at
Roorkee, Dehra, and Chakrata.        From Mr. Hennessey's tables and
the Meteorological Observatory records,         I  find the following mean
values for the required data : —

As far as we can judge from seven days' observations in 1869 and
sixteen days in 1879, it would seem that the mean radiation of the
sun, and the mean absorption of the atmosphere lying above Dehra
were practically the same in the two years ; while the absorption at
Mussooree was slightly greater, and that at sea-level somewhat less
in 1879 than in 1869.
    On the mean of all the days the quantity of water vapour in the
air above Dehra was equal to "846 inch of rain in 1869, and T174
inch in 1879 ; and the corresponding values of «, the coefficient of
absorption for common logarithms, when the water vapour is equal
to an inch of rain, were *072 and '0525 respectively.                The vapour
tensions at Dehra are of too local a character to admit of any safe
inference from these figures ; but, as far as the evidence goes, it
points to the conclusion that the radiation emitted by the sun
during the days of observation in 1869 was more readily absorbed
by water vapour than that emitted in 1879.
    It is to be hoped that the observations which are to be com
menced next year at Leh — a station 11,500 feet above the sea — that
is, lying above four-fifths of the absorbent atmosphere — will enable
us to solve the all-important problem whether the sun's heat varies-
to any appreciable extent or not ; but simultaneous observations at
a lower station, such as Mussooree, will be required to settle without
doubt the further question, whether there is any sensible variation
in the quality of the solar rays, as tested by actinometric methods,
that can be compared with the changes in the absorption lines which
are observed in the spectra of spots.
    Since writing the above, I have seen a report of a lecture* by
M. Violle, Professor at the Faculte des Sciences, Grenoble, in which
the lecturer described some simultaneous observations made by him
self and another at the summit of Mont Blanc and Grenoble, and
at the Grands Mulets and Glacier des Bossons, on the 16th and 17th
of August, 1875. M. Violle's values for the heat received in a minute
by a square centimetre of surface exposed perpendicularly to the sun's-
 rays are given in calories in the following table      : —

 From these results M. Violle concluded that the absorptive effect due
to water vapour was about five times as great as that due to dry air;
 but when the constant C, of the logarithmic formula for the vertical
 distribution of the absorbent substance is computed, it is found to bo
 22,137 feet on the lGth August and 22,580 on the 17th.                        These
numbers agree1 so closely with the mean of those found above, and
with the constant of the average vapour formula found by Dr. Hann,t
viz., 6,517 metres or 21,382 feet, that it is evident that in the Alps, as
in the Himalayas, practically the whole absorptive power of the atmo
sphere is exercised by the water vapour it contains.

   The disease of the scalp popularly known in England as ringworm
is described in medical works under the names herpes tonsurans and
tinea tonsurans.   When it occurs on the skin of the body it is known
as tinea circinata and also as herpes tonsurans.       The disease is
widely spread in the human subject, exists in all climates, and also
occurs in the horse, ox, and dog.   It can be communicated from these
animals to each other and to man.
   It was shown almost simultaneously by Gruby,* in France, and by
Malmsten,t in Sweden, that the disease is due to the growth in the
hairs and in the horny layers of the epidermis of a fungus which was
named by Malmsten Trichophyton tonsurans. The statements of Malm-
sten and Kuchenmeisterj; that the parasite is found only amongst
the cells which have undergone the horny change, that is to say, in
the hair-shaft, between the hair-shaft and the internal root-sheath,
and in the horny layer of the epidermis, have been recently confirmed
by the evidence of sections made through the affected skin in the
horse§ and in man. The parasite is not found amongst the living cells
of the epidermis.

         On Trichophyton           tonsurans    {the  Fungus     of Ringworm).        235
     The fungus, as at present known, consists of a mycelium and spores,
  and very little has been determined regarding its nature.                     Attempts
  that have been made to cultivate it artificially have led to contra
 dictory conclusions.          Lowe, in 1850,* was induced to believe that
 Trichophyton tonsurans is a spore formation of the fungus of favus — a
 specifically distinct parasitic disease of the skin — and that both are
 forms of Aspergillus.           Neumann, f on the other hand, whilst believing
 that his cultivation experiments showed that herpes tonsurans and
 favus are produced by the same fungus, traced it in both diseases to
 Penicillium glaucum. Dr. Atkinson, J again, was led by his cultivations
 to believe that the fungus belongs to the Mucors, and is probably
 Mucor mucedo.
     The reason why the botanical relations of the parasite to the
 common fungi have been so difficult to determine has been stated by
 De Bary.         " If," he remarks,§ speaking of the vegetable parasites of
 the skin, " the parasites, when removed from the bodies of their hosts,
are cultivated in water, sugar solution, &c., the vegetation of their
spores is then observed, and after a short time there appears in the
 fluids the universally wide-spread fungi, e.g., Penicillium. glaucum,
Aspergillus glaucus, or Torula. The latter and the mycelium of Peni
cillium resemble more or less the spores and mycelium of the parasites
in question, and, being found in immediate contact with them, it seems
as if they had been developed from them in the artificial medium."
    Kobner,|| who endeavoured to solve some of the problems connected
with the development of the parasite by clinical experiments, found
that Trichophyton tonsurans, when inoculated on the skin, produced
only herpes tonsurans, and that he could not produce this disease by
Inoculation with Penicillium glaucum.
     A strong reason exists, independently of experimental results, for
believing that trichophyton is not a form of the common fungi. The
facility with which ringworm is communicated from one child to
another by contact, or by interchange of caps, shows that the fungus
takes root easily on the scalp, whilst, as many a country medical prac
titioner can testify, bareheaded children may be exposed indefinitely
to contact with all the spores with which the atmosphere is pregnant
without a single instance of the disease being produced.
     In endeavouring to cultivate Trichophyton tonsurans artificially, it
was clear to me that one of the chief difficulties to be overcome was to

avoid confusing accidental growths of common fungi with the spores
and mycelium of the parasite.        The size of the spores and mycelium
is not to be relied on for this purpose, but their arrangement in an
affected hair offers facilities for ascertaining whether in any given case
trichophyton has developed.
    When a hair is extensively affected with ringworm fungus, the root
for a considerable extent is loaded with spores in all its thickness, and
along its free borders the spores on the extreme edge can be seen
under the microscope with perfect distinctness. It was thus evident
to me that if there were observed at an early stage of the culti
vation a growth of those spores in the sides of the hairs which from
their position could be recognised as ringworm spores, the fallacy of
deception by admixture of adventitious fungi would so far be avoided.
    At an early stage of my investigations, Mr. Banham, of the Brown
Institution, showed me a preparation in which ringworm spores had in
considerable numbers pushed out a tubular projection, by which their
length had become at least double their breadth, and which was
evidently the beginning of growth. This growth had taken place in a
prepared cell in a drop of aqueous humour, but Mr. Banham informed
me that he had not succeeded in getting the cultivation to go farther.
    The first attempts  I made at cultivation were with ringworm hairs,
which had been kept in my house for varying periods, having been
put aside for the purpose of the investigation ; but, after a series of
negative results, I confined myself entirely to hairs freshly extracted
from the heads of children affected with ringworm.              These were
usually put in the different solutions with which           I experimented
within periods varying from a quarter of an hour to two hours. When
these ringworm hairs are placed in contact with fluids at a high tem
perature (92° to 98° F.), the spores soon show an outer surface or
 capsule, containing a spherical mass within it. This seems to be to
 a great extent independent of the nature of the fluid, and it is very apt
 to be mistaken for the first beginning of growth.      When growth does
 not take place   the appearance remains stationary.     A variety of solu
 tions were tried without result.      These were used at first in cells, the
 hair being laid on the inner surface of the cover-glass of the cell and a
 drop of the solution placed over it. The hair was sometimes covered
 with the drop and sometimes only moistened ; in the latter case a ring
 of damp blotting-paper was placed in the bottom of the cell, to prevent
 evaporation.      The cells were then placed in an incubator.           The
 temperature    within  the   incubator  varied during  the   course of   the
 experiments between 92° and 98° F., bat was mostly from about 9C°
 to 98°.
     As these negative results afford evidence that Trichophyton ton
 surans and the fungi usually present in the atmosphere are essentially
 different, they are worthy of being recorded.

which I found had been in use in cultivation experiments at the Brown
Institution.
   Thirteen cells with ringworm hairs in contact with this solution
were placed at different times in the incubator, viz., two for three
days, three for four days, five for six days, two for nine days, and one
for fourteen  days.   There was no growth of trichophyton in any of
them.
    Some minute particles of bread, on which common mould had been
sprinkled, were placed in a drop of the same fluid in a cell, and placed
in. the incubator.   Long mycelial threads grew on the under surface
of the cover-glass.
    Again, a piece of bread slightly mouldy at some points was soaked
in the same fluid, and with ringworm hairs placed on                 it,
                                                            was put into
a bottle, and the bottle placed    in the incubator. The roots of the
hairs were found entwined with a rich mycelial growth of fungi,
considerably larger than the fungus of ringworm, but the spores of
trichophyton could be seen after preparation and maceration in
potash to be undeveloped.
  2. A fluid (known,    Ibelieve,       as      Cohn's fluid) with the following^
composition —  :
           Magnesium Sulphate                           1   grn».
           Potassium Nitrate                            1  grm.

One per cent. ammonium tartrate to be added before use.
   Two cells charged with ringworm hairs and the above fluid were
placed at different times in the incubator, one for two and the other
for eight days. The fungus grew in neither. Two hairs containing
spores were floated on the surface of the fluid in a test-glass, and
placed in the incubator for four days.   There was8 no growth.    Other
ringworm hairs, placed in a small tube, were sank at the bottom of
the same test-glass.  There was again no growth.
   Ringworm hairs were placed on bread soaked in the fluid, the bread
being then put in a bottle and placed in the incubator for four
days. The hairs were found enveloped in aspergillus. Trichophyton
spores had not grown       being found after maceration to be in the
                           ;
same condition as in a diseased hair freshly extracted from a ringworm
patch.

    3. Miik. — The milk used had been purified by boiling in             a water
bath, and had been kept pure in purified glasses, according to the
method described by Mr. Lister.*
    The results of the experiments were negative, but are in other
respects interesting.
    A hair from a patch of ringworm was placed on the surface of milk,
in a glass otherwise kept pure and set aside at the room temperature
on the 10th March.        It was taken out on the 27th, a fungus growth
having been visible to the naked -eye for several days. The root of
the hair was found enveloped in Penicillium glaucum.             Wheu the hair
had been macerated in a solution of potash it was seen that it had been
healthy, and it contained no ringworm spores.
    Two hairs, which turned out to be ringworm hairs, were kept on the
surface of milk far eighteen days.          There was large development of
fungus, but I could obtain no evidence that it had any connexion
with the ringworm spores. A supposed ringworm hair, after being
on the surface of milk for three days in the incubator was found
enveloped in fungus, but maceration .in potash showed that there
was no trichophyton in the hair. A ringworm hair in a tube at the
bottom of the milk glass in two days in the incubator had developed
nothing.
    Two experiments showed that even with milk the development of a
fungus does not necessarily follow when protected pure glasses are
used.
    A  supposed ringworm hair was placed on pure milk in a protected
 glass in the incubator lor three days.         No fungus of any kind grew,
and maceration of the hair in potash showed that the hair was not
affected    with trichophyton. Another supposed ringworm hair,                  but
 which subsequent examination showed to contain no spores,                     was
placed in pure milk in a protected glass for thirteen days without             any
fungus developing.
    My attempts to grow trichophyton in milk thus failed.
    In connexion with Mr. Lister's experiments on the lactic fermenta
 tion, it may be worthy of remark that the glasses nsed were all charged
 with pure milk by the method he has described, and that the milk
  remained unchanged until they were used for these experiments.
With the introduction of the hairs bacteria were necessarily also
 introduced, but the glasses being immediately protected, no other
 bacteria than those adhering to the hairs were present.               The hairs,
 after they were extracted from the patients' heads, had been kept in
paper until they were brought in contact with the milk. Various
 although usually very slight changes took place in the appearance of
 the milk, but in none of the glasses did the common lactic fermenta-

tion occur, so far as a curdled condition is evidence of that change.
A thin stratum of clear fluid in one case appeared on the surface of
the milk, but to a much less extent than in ordinary curdling.
   4. Aqueous Humour. — Two experiments only were made with aqueous
humour, the cells charged with it being placed in the incubator. In one
after five days there was no growth of the ringworm spores ; in the
other, during forty-eight hours, a bulging had taken place from some
of the spores, evidently the beginning of growth. On account of the
greater convenience in getting large quantities of fluid vitreous
humour was used instead of aqueous humour in subsequent experi
ments.
   5. Tap Water. — A ringworm hair, moistened with tap water, was
placed in the incubator. During nine days there was no growth.
   6. Carrot  Infusion. — One cell was prepared with carrot infusion.
During four days no growth took place.
    7. Salt Solution. — Strength 0 75 per cent. — A cell thus prepared
was placed in the incubator for five days : no growth. Hairs were
Boated on the solution in a glass in the incubator for six days without
growth of trichophyton spores.
   8. Turnip Infusion. — Bread, soaked in turnip infusion, was placed
in a box and ringworm hairs placed on the bread at different points.
The box was covered and placed on the top of the incubator, where
the heat was less than inside. After four days the bread was found
covered with fungi.
   The ringworm hairs were picked out, macerated in potash, and
examined. All the spores were round, and there was no appearance
on the sides of the hairs of bulging or early mycelium formation.
   Ringworm hairs were floated on pure turnip infusion in protected
glasses, and placed in the incubator for five days.      They were then
examined. The spores observed in the hairs were all round, and there
was no growth from the sides.      Another experiment of the same kind
in which the hairs were examined after four days, showed a like
negative result.
   In another similar experiment the hairs were found after eight days
imbedded in fungus, Penicillium glaucum. The hairs, when examined,
were seen to be full of spores, which had not sprouted from the sides
in the least degree ; those which were lying on the extreme edge of
the hair being found round and unchanged.
   In two cells charged with diseased hairs, minute morsels of bread and
turnip infusion, and placed in the incubator, no ringworm growth took
place during four days ; and another experiment, in which the hairs
were floated on the infusion and kept in the incubator for seven days,
also showed a negative result.
   The   attempts     to grow trichophyton in turnip infusion thus all
failed.

in the incubator, and one at room temperature, also one with acid
albumen in the incubator, conducted in the same manner as those
already described, all failed.
   10. Egg Albumen and Potash. — Four attempted cultivations with
albumen, to which a small proportion of solution of potash had been
added, also failed. In two of them the hairs were floated on the surface
of the fluid in glasses placed in the incubator ; in the other two the
hairs had been sunk to the bottom.
   11. Vitreous Humour and Potash. — Three cultivation experiments
with vitreous humour and potash, similarly conducted, in one of which
the ringworm hairs were floated on the top, whilst in the other two
they were sunk to the bottom, also failed.
    12. Vitreous Humour. — As vitreous humour is the only fluid with
which I have succeeded iu cultivating trichophyton, and as, even
with this fluid, special conditions are necessary, it is desirable to
describe the experiments and mode of procedure in detail.
   It will be convenient to divide them into —

    The cells were, during these periods, examined daily, and imme
 diately afterwards put back again into the incubator. Those regard
 ing which it is remarked that the time was not noted are the cells
which were used in the earlier experiments.          They were kept a long
time, and frequently examined, the date on which they were finally
taken out not being noted.
   In the earlier of these experiments, the hairs used had been extracted
for some time from the patients, and had been kept folded in paper.
This may possibly have had something to do with the negative results.

      On Trichophyton       tonsurans (the Fungus      of Ringworm).        241
In   a large proportion   of them, however, froshly extracted hairs were
used.
    2. Cultivation   in cells at room temperature.           No growth     took
place.

    3.  About the time when the experiments referred to in the above
tables were ended, it occurred to me that the reason why the spores
did not grow was because the hairs were submerged in the fluid.
    Acting on this idea, I moistened the under side of the cover-glass
of the cell, taking care that the roots of the hairs used were not
covered with the fluid.        For the first time   I  obtained evidences of
undoubted growth. The convenience of the cell for such experiments
was now well shown, as I was able to observe the earliest evidence of
mycelial growth from the spores on the sides of the hairs without
disturbing the preparation, which could be put back again into the
incubator without any part of it being moved.               In these instances
there was no possibility of a mistake being made by confounding adven
titious fungi with trichophyton.          The spores of the latter could be
examined in situ through the cover-glass, and as germination took
place the spores could be seen elongating into a mycelium from their
original position on the edge of the hair.
    In three cells prepared in this way trichophyton grew.                  The
 first appearance of elongation in the spores was observed after the
 preparation had been a few hours in the incubator, the hairs having
 been transferred from the head of the child to the incubator after a
 very short interval.     During the two following days the growth went
 on to the formation of mycelium.          The mycelium, however, ceased to
 grow    after having  attained    a very moderate   length ; spore formation
 soon beginning to take place.
     (Similar cells prepared in the same way with Cohn's fluid and with
 hairs from the same patch showed no signs of growth.)
    The disadvantages associated with this mode of cultivation were
 found to be the following : —
    It was difficult to hit on the right quantity of fluid.       If there was
 too much the spores did not grow, and if there was too little
 they did not grow, and when the quantity happened to be sufficient
 to encourage germination it was not enough to maintain growth after
 the mycelium had attained a comparatively limited length/
    This difficulty was got over in the following way : —
    4. When the hair was laid gently on the surface of vitreous humour
 in a test-glass, it did not sink, and by simply floating the hairs was   I
 able to secure the requisite conditions of moisture without immer
 sion.

242                             Dr. G. Thin.
   The vitreous humour used had been prepared in the manner
described in a paper on Bacterium fcetklum (" Proc. Roy. Soc.," No.
205, 1880), and the hairs were laid on this pure fluid, and placed in
the incubator in protected glasses.        The only source of contamination
was the organisms that were introduced with the hair.                Experiment
showed that whilst in all cases there was a free development of
bacteria, the development        of adventitious fungi was frequently
avoided.
   The following table gives the results of twelve cultivations              made
by this method : —

        12             No.                6        Growth of aspergillus.
   One experiment was made to ascertain whether trichophyton could
be  cultivated at ordinary temperatures.
   On the 20th April several ringworm hairs were placed on the
surface of vitreous humour in a protected flask, which was put aside
and kept at the ordinary temperature of the work-room.                    On the
3rd May the hairs were examined.             Trichophyton was found to be
growing from their edges, but the growth was not so luxuriant as it
was usually found to be after two days' cultivation when the test-
glass was kept in the high temperature of the incubator.
   In one recorded experiment the hairs extracted from a ringworm
patch did not happen to contain trichophyton.                 After three days'
cultivation in the incubator no fungus of any kind had grown.
   Several other similar experiments,           which were not accurately
noted, showed that if a hair which did not contain trichophyton was
not much exposed before being placed on the vitreous humour, the

       On Trichophyton     tonsurans (the Fungus of Ringworm).        243
  glass containing  it might  be placed for several days in the incubator
  without the development of adventitious fungi.
     It follows from the facts recorded in this table that although the
  method may be relied on for the cultivation of ringworm fungus, it
  cannot be considered certain.
     I am not able to account for the failures recorded in experiments
  1, 2, 7, and 12, but they did not surprise me.     Simultaneously with
 the experiments on trichophyton I had made a nnmber of cultiva
 tions of the common fungi found in our houses, and had learned how
 delicate are the conditions of growth to which they are all subject.
 One of the most important of these conditions is the reqnisite degree
 of moisture, which must be neither in deficiency nor excess. The
 failures recorded in these experiments may possibly have been due to
 the hairs having become too much immersed, or the spores themselves
 may have been incapable of germination from changes effected in
 t hem by inflammatory exudation around the hair follicles before    they
 were extracted.
     The growth observed consisted in a development of mycelium from
 spores, and in the formation of spores within the mycelium, as is por
trayed in the drawings in the plate. No organs of fructification were
observed.
     Two experiments were made with ringworm hairs which had been
snnk in water. In one case the length of time of the immersion is not
noted    ; in the other the hairs were immersed six days. In neither
case did trichophyton grow when an attempt at cultivation on
vitreous humour was made. Considering the uncertainty of vitreous
humour cultivations, these two experiments have only a very limited
value, but, so far as they go, they support the inferences which follow
from other experiments made in the same direction. The hairs in
which trichophyton grew were all freshly extracted, but one expe
riment was made with two hairs, kept dry in a box for thirteen days.
The spores were very numerous in these hairs ; only one appearance of
growing mycelium was observed, a spore having sprouted on the side
of the hair. There were, on the other hand, some similar experiments
with negative results. Four cultivations were tried with hairs which
had been kept eleven days. and three with hairs which had been kept
twenty-two days ; in all of them the spores remained unchanged.
    The value of these experiments is, on account of the uncertainty of
the cultivations, not very great, but it may be well to put them ou
record.     The same remark applies to experiments made with hairs
taken from patches which were nnder treatment.           The vitality of
trichophyton is destroyed as a result of many varieties of treatment, the
essential feature in all of which is that they produce inflammation of
the skin.                            I
              As soon, therefore, as had determined that the spores in
untreated hairs could be grown in a fairly large proportion of the

244                               Dr. G. Thin.
experiments made, I undertook cultivations with hairs extracted from
patches which were under active treatment for the cure of the
disease. With one exception, and in that one the growth was open to
doubt, all these cultivations failed. Nineteen such cultivations were
attempted, in two the hairs being on the vitreous humour in the incu
bator for two days, in eight for three days, in six for four days, and in
three for five days.      The treatment had consisted in rubbing into the
scalp, on the affected places, sulphur ointment and mercurial ointments
of various kinds and strengths.
    The failure to cultivate trichophyton in these cases did not coin
cide in point of time with the cure of the disease, for in many of them
the malady followed its somewhat tedious course for a considerable time
after the dates of the experiments.
    The fact that 1 had been unable to produce growth of tricho
phyton in cells, so long as the spores were completely immersed in
vitreous humour, led me to make the following experiments.                       Ring
worm hairs were extracted from a patch of untreated ringworm. Some
of them were inserted into a small glass tube, which was placed at the
bottom of the test-glass, and others were floated on the surface of the
fluid in the usual way. After two days the hairs were examined
There was an abundant growth of mycelium around the roots of those
hairs which were on the surface.              The mycelium was of the size of
that of ringworm. and in some of it black pigment had been depo
sited.   No spores had formed.            I  satisfied myself at the time that it
had developed from the ringworm spores.                  On macerating the hairs
the mycelial growth        of  trichophyton       inside   the hair-shafts was also
found pigmented.
    In the hairs deposited in the tube at the bottom of the test-glass no
growth had taken place, although on maceration they were found to
contain mycelium and spores of trichophyton, both containing black
pigment.*
    In another instance, in which the experiment was conducted in pre
cisely the same conditions, an examination was made after the test-
glass had been six days in the incubator.              There was free growth of
trichophyton      in  the  hairs    which   had    been   floating on the surface
of the fluid, whilst there was no growth in the hairs which were in the
tube at the bottom of the glass.
    In these two experiments all the hairs, both those on the surface and
those at the bottom, contained         trichophyton, and in each experiment
both the surface and the sunk hairs were taken at the same time from
the same patient, every condition being alike, except that in the one
   * This patient is not tho only  one in whose diseased     hairs the ringworm fungus
was pigmented.     I have found the same peculiarity in other cases. and iu llw
affected hairs from a patch of tlus disease, in a black horse,  I found pigmented niv8
eclium and spores ver.v common.

      On Trichophyton      tonsurans (the Fungus of Ringworm).        245
  case the  hairs were on the surface of the fluid, and in the other they
 were completely immersed in it.
    It seems impossible to resist the conclusion from these and from
 the earlier cell experiments that trichophyton cannot grow when im
 mersed in vitreous humour, whilst it grows freely when only moist
 ened by it.
    These experiments farther suggest the view that inflammation cures
 ringworm by drowning the fungus. The data supplied by recent
 pathological researches show that serous effusion from the blood
 vessels is the invariable concomitant of inflammatory action, however
 it is produced. When a persistent inflammatory congestion is kept up
 by irritants around the hair follicles, it of necessity follows that the
 serous effusion should make its way through the root-sheaths, whilst
 the inner root-sheath, and the cuticle of the hair are more or less
 broken np by the growth of the fungus. It is a fair inference
 from the experiments       described in this paper that the capacity
 for growth in trichophyton must be destroyed by the resulting
 immersion in serum. Clinically and as a matter of fact, we know
that this is just what takes place, and the only reason why ring
worm is such a tedious disease under treatment is that the same
amount of irritation by external agents does not produce the same
amount of congestion in any two patients, and that a careful practi
tioner will always hesitate to induce such an intensity of inflammation
as might injure the health of the patient or produce partial baldness
by destruction of the hair follicles. Trichophyton tonsurans, although
it grows in the epidermis of children and adults alike, and thrives in
the hairs of the scalp in children, cannot, as a rule to which there is
hardly any exception, live in the hairs and follicles of the scalp of
adults.    The explanation of this peculiarity will probably be found in
the anatomical relations of the inner root-sheath and the hair, and     I
suggest as an hypothesis that the fungus does not penetrate between
these structures in the adult because it does not find there sufficient
moisture for its development.
    Preparations showing the mycelium well, with the process of spore
formation as it takes place within the hair-shaft, do not appear to
have been often portrayed, if we may judge by the figures in ordinary
medical works, most of the drawings which are found in text-books
of medicine representing it imperfectly.
    I  found that hairs which had been macerated for several days in
vitreous humour afforded excellent specimens for observation.
    Good preparations of trichophyton, showing the different stages of
development, are easily obtained by ordinary methods from scrapings
of the epidermis in ringworm of the skin of the body, and an excellent
representation of the appearances then seen is given in Cornil and
Kanvier's "Manuel d'Histologie Pathologique," p. 1221.

 24G                                      Dr. G. Thin.
    The main conclusions regarding Trichophyton tonsurane which are
 warranted by the experiments recorded in this paper are that: —
    1 . It is not one of the common f nngi.
    2. It can bo cultivated artificially                  when moistened by vitreous
 humour.
    3.  When covered by vitreous humour it does not grow.
    The second of these formulated statements suggests whether the
 inability of the fungus to grow in the hairs of the scalp in adults may
 not be due to the firmer texture of the root-sheaths, and the consequent
 comparative absence of moisture between the inner root-sheath and the
 hair. The third explains why the fungus may be destroyed by pro
 voking inflammation of the scalp.

    Although Gruby,* in the year 1843, announced that the affection of
the hairy scalp known as alopecia areata (area eelsi) is caused by a
 fungus, the parasitic theory of the disease has met with comparatively
little support.    If the patients on whom Gruby made his observations
really suffered from this disease and not from ringworm, which in
some of its forms is apt to be mistaken for it, this uncertainty is very
remarkable.      The fungus, if it exists, should not be difficult of
observation, since it is described in his paper as consisting of a sheath
 of mycelium and spores which accompanies the hair to a distance of
 1 — 3 millims.   from the skin. Few competent observers have, how
 ever, been able to find a fungus in this disease, and Dr. Michelson, of
 Konigsberg, in an able historical sketch in a recent number of
                                                                    " Vir-
chow's Archiv,"f quotes with approval a statement by Pincus,^ who
avers that up to the year 1869 none of the observations which are
relied on as confirming Gruby's observations will stand criticism. The
fungus has been sought for chiefly by dermatologists, and in Hebra's
text-book of "Skin Diseases,"§        a work of recognised      standing,
v. Barensprung, Hebra, Wilson, Neumann, Boeck, Duhring, Scheren-
berg, and Kaposi are cited as having been unable to find it.          The
parasitic theory originated by Gruby was noticed less and less by
authorities, the disappearance of the hair in patches from a pale un-
                                       "
inflamed skin being attributed to a tropho-neurosis."
   Latterly, the question of parasitism has been again raised. Malassez||
stated in a paper published in 1874 that he had found a fungus, not
in the hairs, but on the surface of the epidermis of the diseased parts.
There was no mycelium found, but only spores, of which he described
three types      :   —
  1.       Double-contoured spores, sometimes with a bud (bourgeon), 4 — 5fi
in diameter      ;

    Eichhorst* states that in nine cases he found spores on the diseased
hairs once, between the shaft and root sheaths.             There was no myce
 lium, and the spores were about the size of those of the Microsporon
furfur. The descriptions given by Gruby, Malassez, and Eichhorst of
his solitary case diner from each other; Gruby describing a fungus
 with mycelium which ensheatbes the hair shaft, Malassez single spores
 of various sizes scattered over the epidermis, and Eichhorst large
 spores between the hair shaft and root sheaths.
    A hypothesis of another kind has been put forward by Buchner.f
 Considering that the disappearance of the hair in ever-widening
 circles which bear no relation to the distribution of blood-vessels or
 nerves, without any evident cause, is best explained by the theory of
 parasitism, but yet acknowledging the failure of the attempts that
 have been made to discover the parasite, this observer asks whether
 the parasite may not be a bacterium, which on account of its smallness
 and position in the hair cannot be brought under observation.               In
 support of this hypothesis he instances an experiment which he made.
 In a case of the disease he extracted hairs from the affected patch
 with heated forceps (so as to exclude contamination to the greatest
 possible extent), and placed them in a cultivating fluid.         He reasoned
 that if there are bacteria in the hairs they will be in greater number
 than the bacteria introduced accidentally with the hairs, and that in
 the first hours of cultivation they would greatly outnumber these
 latter.   Accordingly, he found in eight successive cultivations a
 bacterium which he describes as a small refractive sharply contoured
 particle (Korncheii), scarcely 08001 millim. in diameter, with two very
 fine and short thread-like processes projecting from opposite poles.
 He remarks that this may not necessarily be the form which the
 presumed bacterium has in the hair, as the effect of cultivation is
 sometimes to alter the forms of bacteria.
    The observations which are recorded in the following paper were
 preceded by desultory studies of hairs extracted from patients suffer
 ing from this disease during the five years preceding 1880, of which
 no notes were taken, my attention having been directed to the subject
 after the appearance of Malassez's paper in 1874.
    In none of the hairs, however, which I examined did            I discover a
 fungus.    The hairs which I did not have time to examine were put
 away for future study, carefully folded in paper.
    In examining one of the hairs which had been kept for some time,
 I  observed flakes of a filmy substance fall away from the hair, and
imbedded in this substance there were what seemed to me to be great
 numbers of micrococci.
    From that time when examining hairs from the margin of patches

 of this disease       I always looked for evidences of the presence of
 bacteria. The difficulty of distinguishing in a fluid minute granules
 from micrococci or from the spore forms of rod bacteria, is so great,
 that it was only when the characteristic appearances of elongating
 spheroids or small rod-shaped bodies containing spheroidal ele
 ments, arranged linearly, or rod bacteria were observed, that the
 evidence of the presence of organisms was deemed conclusive.                  These
 were, however, observed sufficiently often to satisfy me that their
 presence was probably more than accidental, and to induce me to
 submit the affected hairs to various processes with the view of enabling
 the contents of the hair shaft to be better observed.
     During the year 1880 six cases were specially utilised for this
 purpose, and, as in all these cases, a considerable number of hairs, in
 several of them a large number, were examined and submitted to
 methods of examination eminently fitted to display a fungus, if
 such were present, it may be useful to state in further confirmation
 of the opinions generally entertained, that in none of them any more
 than in those previously observed, was any fungus discovered.*
     All these six cases were unmistakable examples of alopecia areata.
 Evidence that this was so would be out of place in this paper, but
 will be given in due time in a professional journal in connexion with
a description of the treatment under which the disease was in all of
 them at once arrested. t
     The treatment referred to was based on the evidence which, by this
        I
 time believed I had obtained, that the progress of the disease was
 due to the development of a bacterium.
     In utilising these cases for the demonstration of an organism, my
 object was not so much to observe bacteria in fluids in which the hair3
 were examined, as to endeavour to find some method by which their
 presence could be shown in the substance of the hair.                In five of the
             I
 six cases satisfied myself that this had been done. This demonstra
tion is attended with great difficulty. In a comparatively sound hair
it is very difficult to bring minute objects like bacteria under observa
 tion, and in hairs which are considerably affected the shaft is found,
 when prepared for examination, to be so full of pigment and other
granules that it becomes very difficult to distinguish organisms
amongst them, presuming these to be present.
     The methods employed were the following : —
    * The  extent to which these investigations have been carried, more especially as
regards the number of hairs examined in some of the cases, leads me to believe that
those authors who have described a fungus in alopecia areata made a mistaken
diagnosis, and that their cases were examples of ringworm in which the growth of
the trichophyton had produced comparatively little reaction in the skin.
    f  As I am familiar with the disease, for the purposes of this paper my statement
as regards the diagnosis may be considered sufficient.

   1.  The liairs when extracted were placed for a short interval in
potash solution (the strength used varied from 5 to 20 per cent.) ;
they were then washed in distilled water, and passed successively
through absolute alcohol and ether. After being thoroughly subjected
to the action of ether they were again placed successively in alcohol
and distilled water, and were then finally mounted for examination in
diluted Goadby's solution.*
   The object of these manoeuvres was to make the hair transparent,
free it from oily particles, and finally mount it in a medium suitable
for the detection and preservation of any organisms which it might
contain. The method was not perfectly nor always successful, but in
some instances it sufficed to show objects within the cuticle of the
hair, which I believe it is justifiable to consider as bacteria.
   2. The extracted hairs were at once examined in the Goadby's
solution.
   3. The hairs were placed successively in absolute alcohol, oil of
cloves, and dammar varnish, in which they were examined.
   4. Hairs kept for future examination in Goadby's solution, and in a
5 per cent. solution of carbolic acid were at convenient times, after
being soaked for a little while in distilled water, subjected to the
alcohol, oil of cloves, and dammar process.
   In all cases precautions were taken to prevent the development
of organisms after the hairs were extracted.
   Attempts to show the presence of bacteria in the hairs by staining
with methylaniline were defeated by the intensity with which the
hair itself was stained with this dye.
   The result of the examinations of a large number of hairs prepared
by these methods has been to satisfy me that minute objects can be de
tected in them similar in size and form to those which I had recognised
as organisms on the borders of freshly -extracted hairs, and preparations
were obtained in which these objects were found in positions, and so
arranged as to show that they were distinct from the rows and aggre
gations of minute grannies which are found in healthy hairs.
    The objects referred to were seen either as round or as elongated
rounded bodies, and resembled in shape and in their refractive
qualities the element* which            I   have described as cocci in a paper
on Bacterium fcetidum (" Proc. Roy. Soc.," No. 205, 1880).                      In the
preparations put up in dammar varnish these bodies were not liable to
be mistaken for oily particles or crystals, which were not present in
the hairs.      In the preparations put up in Goadby's solution, in spite
of the care which had been taken to soak the hairs in ether. oily

particles were present to such an extent as frequently to make accu
rate observations impossible.
   In some hairs, however, this mode of preparation had produced
results which were most instructive.
   The effect of the potash and other treatment had been to get quit
of the whole contents of the cuticle at some parts, the cuticle being
then seen as a transparent membrane.
   At  these  parts the minute objects I have described were found
clustered on the inner surface of the membrane.          In all the hairs in
which they were found, and in all the patients, these bodies were the
same in size, and refracted light in the same way. They were found
frequently in pairs, the long axis of each member of the pair forming
a continuous line.    Sometimes three of them were found end to end
with an appearance of one continuous sheath for the three. These
appearances are characteristic of bacteria in development.
   In seven cases in which a treatment was applied that was designed
to arrest the development of organisms, and mechanically to prevent
their being transported from one hair to the other, the disease at once
ceased to spread.    In one case, whilst the patches under treatment had
been arrested, and new hairs were coming on them, two other patches
had appeared unobserved on other parts of the head.
   The same treatment at once arrested the growth of these new
patches.
   I have taken much pains to represent         the size of these bodies by
means of camera drawings, and I believe       I  have succeeded fairly well ;
but  I confess to have found   it very difficult to get the exact size.   As
many measurements made of the same objects agreed with each other
I believe the drawings may be taken as a guarantee, both of size and
shape.
   In order further to ensure accuracy in this respect I obtained the
kind assistance of Mr. Noble Smith, whose capacity as an accurate
draughtsman in all that relates to microscopic objects is recognised
and appreciated.    Fig. 2 was prepared from a drawing by Mr. Smith.
He determined the outlines of the hair, and drew a number of the
objects (or organisms) to the size in which he saw them.         The others
were filled in to the scale determined by Mr. Smith. The magnifying
power represented in the drawing was estimated by measuring the
hair.
   Clusters of the organisms were also found in dammar preparations
in which the hair was found split into shreds.           These shreds were
sometimes so thin that the objects which I am describing were seen
with much distinctness.
   The order of development of the organisms, or the different stages
of their action in breaking up the hair shaft, I believe to be indi
cated by the appearances which I have figured in the drawings. In

252                           Dr. G. Thin.
fig. 1 there is represented what     I believe to be an early stage, the
earliest which I have observed.     A cluster of bacteria is seen on the
surface of the hair shaft, but under the cuticle of the hair, whilst on
the side of the hair others are seen embedded in granular debris,
probably remains of the inner root sheath.       The shaft of the hair is
unbroken.
   In fig. 2 great numbers of bacteria are seen near the root of a
hair.     By regulation of the fine adjustment the position of the
bacteria could be accurately made out.       A considerable length of the
root sheath had come away with the hair, completely investing it.
The bacteria were found in a circular layer between the root sheath
and the shaft of the hair.      They had neither penetrated the root
sheath nor the shaft.    Fig. 4 indicates the position of the organisms
as they are seen when the centre of the hair is brought into focus:
the drawing being on too small a scale to show the individual bacteria
their position has been shown by dark shading. In fig. 5 the dark
shading shows the position of the bacteria when the lower surface of
the hair is brought into focus.   By comparing these three figures with
each other, the arrangement of the bacteria becomes apparent.          In
fig. 6 part of a hair is represented in which the removal of the sub
stance of the hair shaft has shown a number of organisms disseminated
over the inner surface of the cuticle. They were traced towards the
thick unemptied part of the hair, in which they became lost in a thick
granular mass. In fig. 7 a hair is shown in which organisms were
found immediately under the cuticle.
   I  infer from all these appearances that the bacterium penetrates
downwards between the internal root sheath and the shaft.        Towards
the root of the hair it penetrates the hair substance, and as it multi
plies it ascends upwards in the substance of the hair. The breaking
up, loosening, and disappearance of the hair is to be attributed to the
disorganisation of the hair substance by the growing organisms, for it
is impossible to suppose that a free development of bacteria could take
place in the shaft of a hair witbout the substance being decomposed
and its integrity destroyed.
   This is the inference which it seems to mo follows naturally from
the detection of organisms in the diseased hairs in alopecia areata. It
might be alleged that it has hot been shown that the composition of
the hair is not altered by some supposed error of nutrition, and that
bacteria find in these abuormal hairs a soil in which they can thrive.
No such alleged nutritive change has ever been shown to exist, and I
believe that the existence of an object of a definite size and form
having the characteristic appearance of a bacterium, and now ascer
tained for a certain although a small number of cases, will afford to
workers in similar fields strong presumptive evidence that its presence
is the key to the mystery in which the disease has been shrouded. In

extracting       hairs for examination           I took them from a considerable
breadth of margin, and as the proportion of the hairs examined
which showed any change or evidence of organisms was small, it is
probable that these are present only in a narrow zone, and that after a
hair is once attacked development takes place rapidly and the hair soon
falls.
   It   may be well to divide the statements made in this paper into two
heads    ; those which relate to ascertained            facts, and those which relate
to a theory of the causation of alopecia                  areata, which     I  believe is
sustained by these facts : —
   1. The facts are that minute bodies of definite and fixed shape and
size are found in and on the haiis in alopecia areata.                     These bodies
are    distinct from the granular elements present in hairs, and are
neither oily particles nor crystals.               They are of the size and shape,
and have the refractive qualities of bacteria.                When present in small
numbers on the shaft the hair is entire, whilst within some hairs much
affected by the disease they were found in great numbers.
   2. The       theory is that these bodies are bacteria, and that the
disappearance of the hair is due to a breaking up of the hair shaft by
the multiplication in it of the organisms.
   As     I  believe it is desirable to give to definite objects like those
which     I  have described a name which will mark their association with
the theory      I  have founded on them, and as           I  am myself satisfied as to
their nature,       I suggest     the  term    Bacterium   decalvans  as a convenient
designation.

   On the surface of the coal stand many erect Sigillarice, penetrating

base and nine feet in height.        In the lower part of many of these erect

vegetable remains, and richly stored with bones of small reptiles, land
snails, and millipedes.     Detailed descriptions of the contents of       these

trees are given, and    it is shown that on decay of the woody axis and
inner bark they mnst have constituted open cylindrical cavities, in
which small animals sheltered themselves, or into which they fell and
remained imprisoned. These natural traps must have remained open
for some time on a subaerial surface.
    In all twenty-five of these erect trees had been discovered and
extracted, and the productive portions of them preserved and carefully
examined. Of these, fifteen had proved more or less productive of
animal remains. From one no less than twelve reptilian skeletons had
been obtained.     In a few instances, not only the bones, but portions of
cuticle, ornamented with horny scales and spines, had been preserved.
    The Batrachians obtained were referred to twelve species in all. Of
these two were represented so imperfectly that they could not be defi
nitely characterised.      The remaining ten were referable to the two
family groups   of  Microsauria  and Labyrinthodontia.
    The Microsauria are characterised by somewhat narrow crania,
smooth cranial bones, simple or non- plaited teeth, well-developed limbs
and ribs, elongated biconcave vertebrae, bony scales and plates on the
abdomen, and horny scales, often ornate, on the back and sides. They
show no traces of gills. The species belonging to this group are
referred to the genera Hylonomus,           Smilerpeton, Hylerpeton and
Fritschia.   The characters of these genera and of the several species
are given in detail and illustrated by drawings and photographs,
including microscopic delineations of the teeth of all the species, with
their internal structure and the microscopic structure of their bones, as
well as representations of their cuticular ornamentation and armour.
    The Labyrinthodonts are represented by only two species of Den-
drerpeton, which are also described and delineated.
   About half of the reptilian species described are new, and those
previously described from fragmentary remains are now more fully
characterised, and their parts more minutely examined.
   The invertebrate animals found are three species of land snails and
five of myriapods, besides specimens supposed to represent new species
of myriapods and insect larvae, not yet fully examined, and which have
been placed in the hands of Dr. Scudder, of Cambridge, U.S.
   The memoir, consisting in great part of condensed descriptions of
the facta observed, does not admit of much abridgment, and cannot be
rendered fully intelligible without the accompanying plans, sections,
and drawings. It closes with the following general statement : —
   " The negative result that, under the exceptionally favourable con
ditions presented by these erect trees, no remains of any animals of
higher rank than the Microsauria and Labyrinthodontia have been
found deserves notice here. It seems to indicate that no small
animals of higher grade inhabited the forests of Nova Scotia at
the period in question ; but this would not exclude the possibility of

the existence of higher animals of a larger size than the hollow trees
were capable of receiving. Nor does it exclude the possibility of
higher animals having lived contemporaneously in upland situations
remote from the low flats to which our knowledge of the coal forma
tion is for the most part confined.       It is to be observed also that
as some of the reptilian animals are represented only by single speci
mens, there may have been still rarer forms, which may be disclosed
should other productive trees be exposed by the gradual wasting of
the cliff and reef."

      fessor Sir William Thomson, F.R.S.            Received December
      28, 1881.
                                  (Abstract.)
   In this  paper the results of the continuation of a series of experi
ments,    some preliminary results of which were published in the
" Phil.  Mag." for October, 1880, are given. The experiments were
performed in the Physical Laboratory of the Imperial College of
Engineering, Tokio, Japan.
   In the preliminary experiments it was found that the conductivity
of glass increased with the temperature, following a similar law to that
found to hold for other highly insulating substances.        It was also
found that the effect of successive heatings and coolings was to
diminish the conductivity.     Further experiments on this subject show
that although the diminution of conductivity here referred to some
times occurs, it does not always occur, and does not seem to do so
when the glass is newly manufactured. Reference is made to pre
liminary experiments on the effect of time on the electric conductivity
of glass, the results of which indicate an increase in conductivity with
time.
   The subject of the main part of the paper is an account of experi
ments on the relation between the electric conductivity of glass and
its density and chemical composition.      A large number of specimens
of lime glass were examined, but, as was to be expected in this case,
no marked connexion between electrical quality and density could be
observed.    It was found, however, on analysing a few specimens, that
the composition of those which had a high conductivity differed con
siderably from that required to form an exact chemical compound,
 while those which had a low conductivity had a composition agreeing
more or less closely with that required for a trisilicate of potash and
lime, or a mixture of potash, lime, and soda-lime trisilicates.

    A  few specimens of lead or flint glass were examined in the same
way, and in this case a very marked connexion between electric con
ductivity and density was observed.         This result was, however, no
doubt due to the fact that the density of this kind of glass gives an
indication of its chemical composition. In all the specimens examined
it was found that the higher the density the lower the conductivity. The
highest density reached, however, was that in the case of a Thomson's
electrometer jar, which had a density of 3"172.       On examining these
specimens for chemical composition it was found that the electrometer
jar contained almost exactly the proper amount of lead and potash to
form a trisilicate of potash and lead.        It appears likely, therefore,
that the electric conductivity of glass is lowest when it is an exact
chemical compound.        It will be interesting to learn from future ex
periments if still more dense glass has a higher conductivity, and if
the conductivity passes a minimum at the point where the pure
silicate is reached.
    The author has to express his great obligation to his colleague,
Dr. Edward Diver, in whose laboratory and under whose superin
tendence the chemical analyses of the specimens of glass were made.

    The new cell consists of a flat copper case, of the same shape as a
 Grove's cell ; it has a lid of paraffined wood, from which hangs a plate
 of lead amalgamated with mercury, the lower part of the lead plate
 being held in a groove in a slip of paraffined wood resting on the
 bottom of the copper case : through the lid a hole is bored for the
 introduction of the solution, which consists of a solution of cupric
 sulphate, to which is added one-twelfth of hydric sulphate ; the pre
 sence of this free sulphuric acid improves the cell at once.

     fessor DEWAR, M.A., F.R.S.          Received January 14, 1882.
    The experiments recorded in my former paper, entitled " Studies on
the Electric Arc,"* together with the numerous observations made
conjointly with Professor Liveing on the spectrum of the arc dis
 charge between carbon electrodes in different gases, led me to ascer
tain if the interior of the gaseous envelope of the ordinary arc showed
any peculiarities of pressure.         Pressure might be caused by the
 motion of the gas particles, the transit of material from pole to
 pole, electric action, or indirectly by chemical combinations taking
 place in the arc.      As any effect due to the above causes must
 necessarily be very small, a delicate manometer capable of measur
 ing easily the Too"tn of a millimetre of water pressure had to be
 employed.      The records of such an instrument in the present
series of experiments,      are complicated by the indirect action of
 the hot currents of air passing the poles, and the irregularities in
 the steadiness of the arc which undoubtedly cause marked variations
 of pressure ; yet by multiplying and varying the conditions of the
 experiments, it is possible to eliminate these secondary effects and secure
 reliable results. The general appearance of the apparatus used is shown
 in the diagram. A and B are two hollow carbons, similar to those I
 formerly employed in the separation of cyanogen from the arc.t They
 must be free from all porosity before they can be used in the experiments
 to be detailed, and the drilled hole should not be less than 3 millims. in
 diameter. In order to fill up minute apertures in the carbons, and render
 them non-porous, they are placed in a porcelain tube and heated to a
 white heat in a current of coal-gas saturated with vapour of benzole.
 This treatment causes the deposition of a layer of dense metallic carbon
 over the surface of the tubes which renders them capable of with
 standing a considerable interior pressure of air or other gas without
 exhibiting leakage. The hollow poles are connected by means of tubing

  with the     two manometers.       Two glass cylinders, ED and GF,
  50 millims.     in diameter, have each a uniform horizontal tube
  open   at  both  ends, 2 millims. in diameter, marked GG' and EE',
  passing through the corks E and G, fitted in side apertures.
  When fluid was added to a fixed level, these vessels constituted
  the manometers.       The tubes leading from the hollow poles have
  been made of metal or thick india-rubber, and to prevent heating
  of the tubes and manometer by radiation from the arc, they have
  been carefully guarded by hollow tin screens (shown at C) through
  which a current of water flowed continuously.       The lengths of tube
  between the manometers and poles have been varied, and in some
  cases the tube made into a spiral form has been immersed in
  water so as to guard against unequal heating. The little glass
  stoppers marked Dd and F/ were convenient for the alteration of
  the zero point by the addition or withdrawal of fluid from the
  vessels ED and GF.       In the experiments water, ether, and alcohol
  have been used in the manometers, but the largest nnmber of the
  experiments have been made with ether.         This fluid is most con
  venient from its mobility, and the only precautions to be taken are
  to use plain cork stoppers instead of india-rubber, and to have a con
  siderable length of tube between the manometers and the arc. In
  the diagram K is a millim. scale divided on glass, and H represents a
  levelling stand on which the apparatus is placed.        By careful level
  ling and the use of ether 1 millim. of motion of the fluid in the
  horizontal tube may be made to correspond to about the 250th of a
  millim. of water pressure.        In the present investigation as the
  absolute value of the pressure is not so important as the general
  variation,  I  have not thought it advisable to give other than rela
  tive records taken with the same instrument at different times ; it
  is quite possible, however, to get absolute values of very small pres
  sures by means of this instrument, and    I have satisfied myself of its
  accuracy by measnring a series of pressures of soap bubbles of
  different sizes, which confirm the previous observations of Plattau
  that the internal pressure varies inversely as the diameter of the
  bubble.
     When the arc passes between two pointed carbon poles it assnmes
  two very different forms ; in one case the envelope of the intensely-
  heated gaseous materials is well defined, almost spherical in appear
  ance, surrounding the whole of the end of the positive pole, but
  touching the negative only at a single point, without showing that
  close adhesion to the pole which is so characteristic of the layer of gas
  at the positive.   At other times the arc is very unsteady, noisy with
  apparent blasts of green flame-looking ejections, which generally
  arise from the positive pole.    These blasts are invariably associated
  with a great increase of intensity in the hydrocarbon and cyanogen

1882.]         Manometric Observations in    the  Electric Arc.        265
spectrum.      While the arc is in this unstable condition manometric
observations are impossible, as the small area of the carbon tube is
rarely completely covered by the arc, so that the manometers often
record neither positive nor negative pressures during the discharge.
The effect of the hot poles on the registration of the manometers is to
produce a small negative pressure when the arc has stopped, due
to the passage of currents of hot air. Many experiments were made
to ascertain if a local heating of the carbon tube caused any per
 manent pressnre. This was carefully tested by taking the arc at right
angles to a carbon tube placed in a block of magnesia so as to
raise the middle of the tube to the highest possible temperature.
Under these conditions the manometer connected with the hollow
carbon remained perfectly steady, whether the tube was made the
positive or negative pole of the battery.           This experiment also
showed that repulsion of the inclosed gas in the tubes through an
 electric charge, had no effect on the manometer.        During the main
 tenance of the steady arc, the manometer connected with the positive
pole exhibits & fixed increase of pressure, corresponding to a motion of
 the fluid in the horizontal tube of the manometers employed, of
from 50 to 150 millims., which is equivalent to from 1 to 2 millims.
of vertical water pressure, in different experiments and under varied
conditions.    The manometer connected with the negative pole shows
no increase of pressure, but rather on the average a diminution.
   When the arc begins to emit a hissing sound, the pressure on the
positive pole instantly diminishes, and when blasts are ejected from
the positive in the direction of the negative, the negative manometer
which had stood at zero before showed a marked increase of pressure.
If a commutator is placed in the circuit, so as to quickly reverse
the direction of the original current, the arc is not broken, but the
manometers immediately record a reverse action. In order to equalise
the temperature of the poles to some extent, the arc was taken in the
middle of a block of magnesia, but the same results were observed ;
the pressure is generally smaller in the hot crucible than it is in air.
When the crucible gets highly heated and filled with metallic vapours,
the arc will pass a distance of more than an inch, and in this con
dition the shorter the arc the greater the pressure.         It was found
advisable   in  these experiments  to  use a  negative pole which had a
sharp conical termination, otherwise the form of the arc in the block
of magnesia was very irregular. owing to the high conductivity of the
hot walls of the crucible. When the poles are brought into contact in
the magnesia crucible, the pressure at the positive instantly falls.
   Whether air, carbonic oxide, or nitrogen filled the manometer and
carbon tubes the results were invariably the same. The chief experi
ments have all been made with the Siemens machine, but a 70-cell
Grove's battery produced the same results.       The use of the horizontal

arc is a matter of convenience,   as  in this condition the  manometers
are least affected by air currents, but the same general action may be
observed by the use of vertical poles.    A thin carbon spatula placed in
front of the end of the positive pole at once lowered the positive pres.
sure of the manometer.      This experiment does not prove much, as the
carbon diaphragm causes a noisy and unsteady arc until a minute hole
is pierced by the current. It is probable that the diminution of pressure
may be due to the instability of the arc. In the same way the action of
the magnet on the arc causes an instant reduction of the positive pres
sure by withdrawing the arc from completely covering the end of the
carbon tube, so that this action must be regarded as an indirect one.
A small carbon tube connected with a manometer was inserted into
the arc, passing between two solid carbons, so as to take a section at
right angles to the passage of the current. In this condition the arc
is apt to be irregular in shape, and to pass rather between three poles
than two, but the average records point to an increase of pressure in this
position also. When the negative carbon tube is about 1 millim. in
diameter, and the point sharp and the tube short, so as to diminish
any air friction, the negative pole manometer seems also to give a
positive pressure.    The intermittent Siemens arc shows an increase of
pressure at both poles.
   It appears from the above experiments that the interior of the
gaseous envelope of the electric arc always shows a fixed permanent
pressure, amounting to about a millimetre of water above that of the
surrounding atmosphere.      This looks as if the well-defined boundary
of the heated gases acted as if it had a small surface tension. This
pressure may be due to various causes: motion of the gas par
ticles under the conditions, transit of material from pole to pole, or
a succession of disruptive discharges ; and a more elaborate investiga
tion will have to be made before the origin of the excess of pressure
can be clearly defined.

I. " On a Series of Salts of a Base containing Chromium and
       Urea.    No. 1."     By W. J. Sell, M.A., F.I.C., Demon
       strator of Chemistry in the University of Cambridge. Com
       municated by Professor G. D. LlVElNG, F.R.S. Received
       January 13, 1882.
   Various compounds of urea with metallic salts and oxides have
been described   by Werther and Liebig.    Some of these are suggestive
of  an   analogy between urea and    ammonia,   while others seem alto
gether anomalous. The following account of some chromium com
pounds of urea may help to throw some light on the nature of such
compounds, for they appear to show that a very definite base is
formed by a combination of urea with chromium.
   When powdered and carefully dried urea is moistened with chromyl
dichloride, and the mixture vigorously shaken, the temperature rises
considerably, and on treating the resulting mass with water, there
remains undissolved, a green crystalline powder. The nature of the
green salt thus obtained is at present under investigation.       It is
insoluble in alcohol, ether, and chloroform. It dissolves in hot water
with decomposition, another salt separating out as the liquid cools in
brilliant olive-green needles, which by a second crystallisation is
obtained in a pure state. The examination of this body showed it to
be the dichromate of a base containing the elements of urea and
 chromium, and to have the formula
                      {(CON2H4)12Crs}  (CrsO,)33H20.
   The dichromate thus obtained is sparingly soluble in cold, more
freely in hot water, and is decomposed by boiling the solution. Its
aqueous solution gives green crystalline precipitates with platinic
 chloride and potassium ferrocyanide, but none with ammonia.
   The following results were obtained on analysis : —

to the contrary.

    11. The mean of three concordant experiments gave on ignition
41'62 per cent. Cr203.         Deducting from this the Cr existing as CrOs,

    When a hot solution of the dichromate is mixed with a solution of
platinic chloride, and the mixture allowed to cool, the chloroplatinate
crystallises out in long green silky needles.          The compound is mode
rately soluble      in hot,  but  very sparingly   in cold water. The sparing
solubility in cold water was made use of in preparing the bulk of this
salt from washings and drainings from other compounds.                 After one
or two crystallisations from hot water, the compound is obtained in a
state of purity. The examination of the body led to the formula

    This compound may be obtained from the original green body, or
from the dichromate, by treatment with water and lead chloride. The
lead chromate is filtered off, and from the filtrate the chloride is pre
cipitated in fine silky needles by passing in hydrochloric acid gas. The
compound recrystallised from warm water is deposited in long bright
green prismatic crystals, having the composition
                            (CONjH4)12Cr2Cl„6H90.
    It   is freely soluble in hot water, less readily in cold, the com
pound being decomposed by boiling its solution. Its aqueous solution
is precipitated by potassium dichromate, the compound precipitated
being similar in every respect to the dichromate just described. It
also gives precipitates with platinic chloride and potassium ferro-
cyanide, but none with ammonia, until the compound has been
destroyed by boiling or otherwise.          The compound is almost com
pletely precipitated from its aqueous solution by the addition of
hydrochloric acid.

This solution appears to contain the hydroxide of the same base as the

sulphate by means of barium hydroxide. The compound, however, is
slowly decomposed in the cold, more rapidly on heating, the solution
losing its alkalinity, chromic hydroxide separating out and urea
remaining in solution. If the green aqueous solution be mixed with
alcohol, most of the hydroxide is deposited as a light green precipitate,
which may be collected, redissolved in water, and reprecipitated by
alcohol unchanged. It is, however, difficult to prevent some decom

     In our former communication on the subject of the water           spectrum
(" Proc. Roy. Soc.," vol. 30, p. 580) we stated that the spectrum we
then figured did not by any means exhaust the spectra of flames wo
had observed, but it was as much as we had at that time been able to
trace to water as its cause.   We had, in fact, noticed in the spectrum
of coal-gas  and  hydrogen-flames a still more refrangible but less intense
series of lines ; and we have since observed that this second series is
produced under the same circumstances as the first, and we therefore
ascribe it to the same cause, namely, the incandescent vapour of
water.    It is easily produced not only by the flames just mentioned,
but by the arc of a De Meritens machine when a current of steam is
passed into      and by the spark of an induction coil without jar in
               it,

almost or wholly disappears.

  The temporary alteration of electrical conductivity which can be
produced by longitudinal traction was measured for all the metal
wires used in Part  I,botfy in the hard-drawn and annealed condition,
and, in addition, for carbon and nickel, by the following method —              :
The wires were suspended in pairs of equal lengths in an air-chamber
4 feet in length and     4 inches inner diameter. This vessel, which
consisted of two concentric cylinders containing a layer of water

1 inch thick between them, stood upright on a stout table.          The ends
of the wire to be tested, and of the other wire, which will be called
the comparison-wire, were clamped into three brass blocks which
rested upon a support of hard wood placed on the top of the chamber.
One of the blocks was twice the length of each of the other two, and
into this was clamped one end of each of the wires ; the other ends
were clamped into the other two blocks.          The blocks were provided
with terminal screws, and a         " Wheatstone's bridge
                                                              " was formed,
having four branches consisting of the wire under examination, the
comparison-wire, and two sets of resistance-coils each of about
100 ohms, but capable of variation by such small amounts as -1 ohm
at a time.     These resistance-coils were connected by caoutchouc-
covered copper wire, several feet in length but of small resistance, to
two of the brass blocks, and were also united to each other by a
platino-iridium wire having a resistance of 81 ohm, which was stretched
along a scale divided into millimetres, and was traversed by a sliding-
piece, which, by means of a suitable spring and catch, could be readily
clamped to any part of the wire. By means of the resistance-coils
and the platino-iridium wire an alteration of less than one in a million
could be measured.      As the change of resistance was in general very
small, it was necessary to take every precaution to avoid sudden
changes of temperature. It was necessary also to keep the galvano
meter-circuit always closed in order to avoid errors which would
otherwise have arisen from thermo-electric currents. A single Le-
clanche cell was employed for the current-motor, and with this it was
possible in a large majority of cases to measure with the aid of a
delicate reflecting galvanometer an alteration of resistance not exceed
ing one in a million. The wire to be strained was provided with a
moveable pulley 2 inches in diameter, to which was attached by means
of a stout wire passing through a small aperture in the table a scale-
pan, and both wires were, before suspension in the air-chamber,
surrounded with caoutchouc tubing, silk, or other insulating material.
   The electrical resistances of all the substances which were examined,
were, with the exception of nickel, increased by temporary longitudinal
stress. With nickel, however, of which metal a wire nearly chemically
pure was at length with difficulty procured,* the resistance was found
to diminish under longitudinal stress not carried beyond a certain
point ; but after this point had been attained further stress began to
increase the resistance.      The effect on nickel appears still more
remarkable   when   we reflect that the change of dimensions produced
by the stress, namely, increase of length and diminution of section,
would increase the resistance.

 aluminium, were increased by temporary longitudinal stress. With
 aluminium and nickel the specific resistances were diminished by stress
 not carried beyond a certain limit. With nickel and carbon it was
 necessary to introduce slight modifications of the original method of
 determining the influence of stress on the resistance.                      With carbon,
 though the increase of resistance produced by a given amount of
 stress was greater than was the case with any of the other substances

    The numbers given in the above table are calculated on the assump
tion that the alteration of resistance is proportional to the stress ; this
was found to be nearly, but not quite, the case.                With most metals the
resistance increases in a greater proportion than the stress ; but with
iron which has been very heavily loaded for some time, the ratio of
the increase of resistance to the stress producing it after increasing to
a maximum begins to diminish ; and altogether, we may say, that the
results here obtained completely confirm those already recorded in                             •

 Part I, which concern the temporary alterations of length produced
 by longitudinal traction.
    One of the most remarkable features            discernible in the table is the
 similarity  of  the  order   of  the metals,   as given in the last column, to
 that of the table of     " rotational coefficients " of metals recently given
by Professor Hall ;* indeed, so striking is the relationship in the case
of the metals iron, zinc, aluminium, and nickel, that there would
 appear to be no doubt that a series of experiments made with a view
of determining the effects of mechanical stress and strain on the
 " rotational coefficients " would be of the greatest value.
    Another point to be noticed is, that the alteration of the specific
 resistances of the alloys brass, platinum-silver, and German-silver is
much less than that of the several constituents of these alloys, and at
first sight there would appear to be some relation between the altera
tion of resistance caused by change of temperature and that due to
mechanical stress ; but it has been proved by these and other experi
ments that the increase of resistance caused by rise of temperature is
in some cases one hundred times that attending the same amount of
expansion by mechanical stress ; and, apart from the fact that with
nickel and carbon the effects of change of temperature and of longi
tudinal stress are of an opposite nature, it is evident that the former
are to be attributed to other causes than mere expansion.
    The influence of permanent extension on the temporary alteration
of resistance caused by longitudinal stress was examined, and the
results obtained verified the statement made in Part                I  that " the
elasticity of a wire is diminished by permanent extension not exceeding
a certain limit, but beyond this limit it is increased." The effect of
permanent extension on the alteration of resistance which can tem
porarily be produced in nickel by traction is very remarkable.
    Compression was proved to produce on the electrical resistance of
carbon a contrary effect to that caused by extension ; this statement
applies to the alteration of specific resistance as well as of the total
resistance.
    Stress, applied in a direction transverse to that of the current, was
also found to produce in several metals both temporary and permanent
alterations of resistance of a nature opposite to those resulting from
longitudinal traction. The time during which the stress was allowed
to act exercised with strips of tin and zinc a large influence on the
amount of the temporary alteration of resistance which was produced
by the stress.       In the case of the strips of tin and zinc also, the
alteration of resistance seemed to be very much greater than when
longitudinal stress was applied to these same metals in the form of
wires.

the experiments showed that the lowering of the temperature of the
freezing point of water can be accurately and readily measured by
observations of the change of electrical resistance of a wire.        These
experiments also furnished still further proof that the change of
resistance of a metal wire caused by rise of temperature is due almost
 entirely to other causes than mere expansion.
    Experiments on the permanent alterations of resistance which can
 be produced by stress, furnish valuable information respecting the
 " limit of elasticity " of metals.
    There are two " critical points
                                       "
                                         in every metal at which sndden
changes occur in the ratio of the permanent extension due to any load
and the load itself.    The first of these points fixes the position of the
true limit of elasticity, and the second that of the " breaking- point."
 With iron there are three, and, perhaps, more " critical points."
    The total resistance of most metals is permanently increased by
permanent longitudinal extension, but with nickel the total resistance
is permanently decreased, provided the extension does not exceed a
certain limit : beyond this limit further extension causes the resistance
to increase.
    The rate at which a wire is " running down " under the influence of
a load can be very advantageously studied by observing the permanent
increase of resistance produced by the load.        If P be the " breaking-
load
       " of a metal, and p be the load actually on the wire, the decrease
per unit of the velocity of the increase of resistance is inversely pro
portional to P— p: so that the breaking-load of a wire can be calcu
lated from observations of the rate of increase of resistance when a
 loaded wire is " running down."       The above-mentioned proportion is
 constant not only for one and the same metal, but for all metals.
    The small effects which can be produced by permanent extension,
 hammering, and torsion on specific electrical resistance were very
fully investigated, and are shown in the paper by a series of curves.
 All the metals examined, except iron and nickel, have their specific
resistances increased by strain caused by the above-mentioned pro
cesses, provided the strain does not exceed a certain limit, beyond this
limit further strain decreases the specific resistance.       In the case of
iron   and  nickel, on the contrary, the specific resistance is at first
decreased and afterwards increased.
    The effect on the resistance of annealed steol produced by heating
and suddenly cooling was also studied, and it was proved that if the
steel be heated to a temperature under "dull red," sudden cooling
decreases the resistance ; whereas if the metal be heated up to or beyond
" dull red," sndden cooling increases the resistance : the strain, there
fore, caused by this process, and that resulting from purely mechanical

1882.]     Stress and Strain on    the Action of Physical Forces.    281
treatment, are similar as regards their influence on tlie electrical
resistance.
    In order to make certain small corrections rendered necessary by
the changes of density of the metals after they had been subjected
to extension, hammering, or torsion, these changes were very carefully
measured, and were found to be in every case small.
    The amount of recovery of electrical conductivity produced by time-
in wires, which are in a state of strain, is shown in the paper for
several metals by a series of enrves, and these exhibit most con
clusively the superiority of platinum-silver over German-silver when
an accurate copy of a standard resistance has to be kept for a long
period of time ; in fact, of all the metals tested, German-silver showed
the most marked recovery of conductivity, and platinum-silver the
least.
    The recovery of electrical conductivity is in all cases attended with
recovery of longitudinal elasticity and of torsional rigidity.
    A full examination of the influence of permanent strain on the
susceptibility to temporary change of resistance from change of tem
perature showed that metals may be divided into two classes. In the
 first of these classes, which includes iron, zinc, and platinum-silver,,
the strained wire is most increased in resistance by rise of temperature
 up to a certain limit of strain, whilst beyond this limit further strain
diminishes the first effect.      In the second class, which comprises
copper, silver, platinum, and German-silver, the strained wire is least
 increased in resistance by rise of temperature, but that, here again,
after a certain point of strain has been reached, the first effect begins
to be diminished. It will further be shown in Part IV, that there
must be some close relationship between the thermo-electrical pro
 perties of strained and unstrained metals and their susceptibility to
change of resistance from change of temperature, and that strain of
any kind, whether produced by purely mechanical means, such as
traction, hammering, and torsion, or by the process of tempering,
 renders a piece of metal thermo-electrically positive or negative to a
 similar piece of metal unstrained, according as the strained piece is
caused to be less or more increased in electrical resistance by rise of
temperature.
     After some trouble, means were found of measuring with consider
 able accuracy at 100° C. the alteration of electrical resistance due to
 temporary longitudinal traction, and the experiments led to the belief
 that the elasticity of iron and steel is not temporarily but permanently
 increased by raising the temperature to 100° C. Subsequently direct
 observations of the elasticity made in the manner described in Part I,
but on shorter lengths of wire, placed in an air-chamber, the tempera
 ture of which could be maintained constantly at 100° C, proved
 beyond a doubt that if M. Wertheim, to whom we owe so much of our

282                 Mr. H. Tomlinson.         The Influence     of        [Jan. 26,
knowledge concerning elasticity, had examined the elasticity of iron
and steel after these metals, tested at the higher temperature of
100° C., had again cooled down to the lower one, he would have found
that what to him appeared, in the case of these metals* to be a tem
porary increase of elasticity was really a permanent one, and if the
wires used had been tested several times, first at the higher and then
at the lower temperature, he would have also found, provided sufficient
rest after cooling had been allowed, that the elasticity of both iron and
steel is temporarily diminished by raising the temperature to 100° C.
    Not only is a comparatively large and permanent change produced
in the elasticity of iron by merely raising the temperature to 100° C,
but in the case of well annealed iron wire there is sometimes an enor
mous change produced in the dnctility (in one specimen the ductility
was diminished 50 per cent.) by the same process ; and since very
appreciable effects have been proved to be brought about in the same
manner in the magnetic inductive capacity, the specific resistance,
and the thermo-electrical properties of iron and steel, it would appear
that researches on these properties might lend valuable aid in investi
 gations on the liability of wrought-iron axles to fracture, which is
produced by sudden changes of the temperature of the air.
    It was further noted that shortly after the iron or steel has been
heated and then cooled, there is less elasticity than when a rest of
some hours has been allowed, and in fact we have in the case exactly
the same kind of restitution of elasticity as we have seen takes place
 after a wire has received mechanical extension.                 With nickel the
 increase of elasticity produced by rest after cooling is still more
 remarkable.
    The effects of very slight mechanical strain, and of the strain
caused by raising annealed iron or steel to 100° C., and afterwards cool
 ing, on the torsional rigidity of these metals were next examined, and
 it was shown that the torsional rigidity is affected in a precisely similar
 manner to the longitudinal elasticity, both by raising the temperature
 to 100° C., and then cooling, and by the strain resulting from slight
 mechanical traction. On the whole it was seen that as regards either
 purely mechanical strain, or that cansed by tempering, there are for
 iron and steel three critical points : very slight strain increasing,
 moderate strain diminishing, and excessive strain again increasing
both the torsional and longitudinal elasticity.
    The temporary alteration of susceptibility to change of resistance
 from change of stress, which is effected in the case of nickel by
 raising the temperature to 100° C., is as remarkable as the suscepti
 bility itself, and the maximum diminution of resistance which could
 be produced by stress when the metal was at the temperature of the
 room was actually more than twice that at 100° C.

  1882.]     Stress and Strain on       the Action of Physical Forces.            283
    The alteration of electrical conductivity which can be produced by
 magnetisation was carefully studied, and a full account of the modes
 of experimenting, of the apparatus employed, and the precautions
 adopted will be found in the paper.           The substances examined were
 iron, steel, nickel, cobalt, bismuth, copper, and zinc, and in all cases,
 except that of copper, it was proved that longitudinal magnetisation
 increases the electrical resistance, whether the substance is in an
 annealed or unnannealed condition.            With copper wire no trace of
 change   of  resistance  could  be   detected   when the wire was under the
 influence of a powerful electro-magnetic solenoid. In the case of zinc,
 which was in the form of foil, no alteration of resistance was discern
 ible until the action of the solenoid was supplemented by that of a
 stout iron core, which was placed inside the solenoid and round which
 the foil was wrapped.       In the next table will be found the increase of
 resistance per unit produced in the different substances                     by an
 absolute electro-magnetic unit of magnetising force, when the mag
 netisation is longitudinal.

    Of all the metals examined, annealed nickel was by far the most
affected by a given amount of magnetising force.
    The increase of resistance produced by magnetisation can be
very accurately represented by the formula 7=0 . a + b . fi ; where y is
the increase of resistance, a. the magnetising force, /3 the induced
magnetism, and a, b constants for the same substance when the same
amount of current per unit of area flows through the substance.
    When different strengths of current are used in measuring the
resistance of annealed iron, the alteration of resistance caused by a
given magnetising force increases with the amount of current per unit
of area which flows through the substance.                The induction current
produced by the magnetisation of the iron in a coil surrounding the
latter is also greater when a current is flowing through the iron than
•when it is not.       With annealed nickel, or with unaanealed steel,

284             The Influence   of Stress   and Strain, §c.    [Jan.   26,
there   is little or no perceptible difference in either the increase of
resistance or the induction current due to magnetisation, whether a
current is or is not at the time flowing through the metal.
   In the paper curves are shown exhibiting the connexions between
increase of resistance, magnetisation, and induced magnetism.      From
these curves, and from the fact of the above-mentioned formula
holding good, it is assumed that the resistance will go on increasing
with the magnetising force even when the latter is so great that
further increase of force does not produce perceptible increase of
magnetism.
  In some remarks made in the paper on the nature of the alteration
of resistance which is produced by magnetisation, it is stated, that
" had the nature of the change of resistance been the same for longi
tudinal mechanical stress as for longitudinal magnetisation in the case
of all metals, there is nothing in the actual amount of alteration that
might not lead us to suppose that the change of resistance from the
latter cause is due to mere rotation of the molecules considered simply
as molecules without regard to the electric currents, which, according
to Ampere's hypothesis, are constantly circulating round these
molecules.    But when we find, that with nickel, longitudinal traction,
which must also cause to a certain extent rotation of the molecules,
but without magnetic polarity, actually produces decrease of resistance,
we arc probably right when we conjecture, that the change of
resistance resulting from magnetisation is in a great measure due to
                                          '       '
the fact that the current used in the       bridge is encountered by a
set of molecular currents circulating all more or less in the same
direction, and in planes more or less at right angles to the direction
of the ' bridge '-current. according as the magnetism induced is
greater or less." These molecular currents would cause the current
passing through the substance to flow spirally, and the effect would be
aided by the action of the magnetising force itself, which action would
go on increasing with increase of force, even when no appreciable
further increase of induced magnetism took place.        Since Professor
Hall has proved that such action is possible, and that nickel, iron.
and cobalt are very conspicuous in this respect, we have some support
for this view.
                    "
    The " circular     magnetisation which any magnetic substance
undergoes   when  a  current is conducted through   it,
                                                      seems to have very
little or no appreciable effect on the electrical resistance of the sub
stance, so that,
               if  we compare the resistances of iron and platinum, the
ratio of the two will be independent of the electromotor employed       in
the "bridge."
   The effects of temporary stress on the alteration by magnetism of the
resistance of an iron or nickel wire are of a somewhat similar nature
to those caused by the stress on the magnetic inductive capacity        of

these metals, and the same may be said with regard to the effects of the
permanent strains due to extension, torsion, &c. Longitudinal stress
which may be made to diminish considerably the susceptibility to
alteration of resistance from magnetisation, cannot even when carried
to the extent of causing breakage, change the nature of the alteration.
   There is apparently a close relationship between the " viscosity " of
a metal and its specific electrical resistance, and it seems very pro
bable that a full investigation of the former of these two physical
properties by the method of torsional vibrations would afford valuable
information respecting the latter.

      The uncertainty which characterises our knowledge of the true con
   dition of a fluid immediately above and below the critical temperature,
   induced me to enter into a full examination of various fluids, with the
   object of gaining accurate definitions of the liquid and gaseous states,
   as well as to arrive at a true conception of the state of matter to which
   the term vapour can be applied.               In a former paper, which the
   Royal Society        has  honoured   me   by publishing,* experiments wen8
   detailed which seemed to show that the liquid state terminated at the
   critical temperature, and that no amount of pressure would suffice at
   any higher temperature to render the fluid capable of exhibiting

surface tension or capillarity ; in fact, that the state of a fluid above
that temperature coincided with the properties we call gaseous. The
paper concluded,
                    " The difference between the liquid and the gaseous
states is not then entirely dependent upon the length of the mean free
path ; but also upon the mean velocity of the molecule." That is to say,
we may compress a gas (when a few degrees above the critical tempe
rature) to a less volume than it might occupy as a liquid, and it will
still remain gaseous. In the following paper, therefore, the term
liquid will be applied only to such bodies as exhibit surface tension,
either as capillarity or by forming a permanent limiting surface when
in contact with a vapour or gas. The term gas will be applied to that
state of a fluid which precludes its being reduced to a liquid by
pressure alone, in other words, to any fluid above its critical tempera
ture. The term vaponr will be applied, as has already been done by
Andrews, to fluids which can be reduced to liquid by pressure alone,
that  is, to any aeriform fluid at a  temperature lower than the critical.
 Thus carbon dioxide   isa   vapour  at  ordinary temperature, but      a gas
                                                                           is
at temperatures over 31°. A further distinction of gas and vapour
lies in the fact that, on increasing the pressure, the volume of a gas
goes on diminishing in a regular way, whereas there               part of the
                                                                 is   a
 curve representing pressure and volume of vapour where the curve                is
 asymptotic, that is, where the vapour        in contact with its liquid.
                                              is
    In the following paper reasons will be shown for believing that the
 gaseous state depends entirely upon the mean velocity and not upon
 the mean free path of the molecule at all.          The difference between
 vapour and liquid, on the other hand,         entirely one of the length of
                                              is
 the mean free path. The methods of experiments used were similar
 to those detailed in the paper above referred to, but a larger appa
 ratus was employed, so that the results might be more distinctly
 visible.   It was soon noticed that the readings of pressures of mano
 meters varied a little with the diameter of the tube employed, the
 smallest bore giving the highest reading, and this was the case to such
 an extent as to cause an error of two atmospheres in 70, and about
 five in 100 the higher the pressure the greater the difference. The
             ;
  wide tube was about 0'8 millim. in diameter, the smaller O'l millim.
 Now, whether this error was caused by the hydrogen condensing
 against the glass, and being thus lost as a manometric substance, or
 whether    it was caused by the hydrogen being dissolved in the film of
 moisture which may be supposed to adhere to the interior of the tube,
 has not yet been determined.          It has been shown by Professors
 Liveing   and  Dewar   that the  moisture   adhering to glass is not driven
 off till nearly a red heat   is reached, and we may be sure that the
 capillarity of the smaller tube would cause       itto retain moisture more
 eagerly than the larger one.      Whatever was the cause,         was almost
                                                                      it
 invariably found that manometers with small bores gave higher read

  ings than those with wide bores. They were dried by passing dried
  hydrogen through them for over two hoars and keeping them warm
  all the time.
     In order to obtain readings which would always be near the truth,
  and be more independent of accidental errors, an apparatus was con
  structed with two manometer tubes, and the manometers were made
  of tubes as wide as was consistent with the strain they were destined
  to bear.   The apparatus as used is shown in fig. 1, where the two
  manometers are shown fixed in the two upright branches, while the
  pressure screw is at the right hand, and the working tube at the left.
  The air-bath has been drawn as though it were transparent, to show
 the internal arrangement. The working tube is recurved, so that the
 liquid to be experimented upon is contained between the mercury and
  the sealed top of the tube. The air-bath consists of two cylindrical
  baths "with holes in the lids for passing the working tube through,
 and an outside cover which keeps the heat from the lamp from being
 too quickly radiated. The internal baths are supported by one of
 Fletcher's solid flame burners, and the bottoms are covered by a layer
 of non-conducting cement. The outside cover has openings at the
 top for the escape of the burnt gases, and its top is covered with a
 thick layer of asbestos wool, to prevent cooling. The whole of the
 baths and cover were made of iron, as the high temperature used
 caused copper to scale heavily.
     Two thermometers were used in the bath, one on each side of the
 working tube ; and at first each thermometer had a little one fixed to
 it for temperature corrections, but it was subsequently found that one
 hung between the two gave quite as much accuracy.
     The two thermometers used were of soda-glass with cylindrical
 bore, and registered the same temperatures       to within 0°85, being
 chosen from a number.       They were heated and cooled from 270° to 0°
over seventy times, and one sent to Kew, where it was compared with
the standard np to 100, and the stem calibrated and the corrections np
 to 350 calculated. The zero points of both thermometers rose from
 0°'2 to 2°82 during the preliminary heating and cooling.   The changes
were determined daily. The temperatures given in this paper may,
therefore, be considered practically correct.
    Two small thermometers were fixed to the manometers for tempera
ture corrections.
    After trying several stands  I found that shown in fig. 1 to be the
most convenient and steady ; it is simply a large block of wood with
a groove cut in it, in which the tube lies, the two upright arms
preventing any movement of the apparatus.          The packing of the
joints has been described before, and I would only add that    I find it
better to face the India-rubber packing with leather by fixing a piece
of fine soft leather to the face of the plug with india-rubber solution.

298                          Mr.  J.  B. Hannay.
This leather face is then oiled, and can he screwed up with much less
damage      to the india-rubber ping.       The larger the screw the more
easily  is   it kept tight. The  first screw    I used was     of an inch, and
it soon cut the leather facings ; the second was 8fa and it was found to
last much longer ; and now working with a half-inch screw it has not
required repacking for three months, although in constant use. The
dimensions of the apparatus as used are as follows : — Length of hori
zontal tube, 24 inches ; height of vertical branches, 8 inches ; caps,
2 inches long by 1£ inches diameter ; screw, ^ inch ; external diameter
of tube, 1£ inches ; internal diameter, £ inch ; length of manometers,
22 inches to 26 inches ; external diameter, ^ inch to f inch ; internal
diameter, from 8^fa inch up to         inch. Small bath, 5 inches high by
4 inches diameter ; larger bath, 7 inches by 6 inches ; external cover,
 13 inches high by 9 inches diameter.          In each of the baths and in the
cover two vertical slits were cut and fitted with mica windows," and a
light placed behind allowed an observer to see clearly what occurred.
 The measurements are given in English standards, as engineers who
 construct such apparatus always use that method of measurement.
    As Amagat has shown that hydrogen is the only gas which follows
Boyle's law at high pressure, that gas was always used as the mano-
metric substance, and was carefully purified and dried before use.
 The drying was done by passing it through five U -tubes with pumice-
stone and strong sulphuric acid, and then through two U "tubes with
phosphoric anhydride. The manometers used were always 084 millim.
in internal diameter, as narrower manometers always gave higher
 readings. In determining the pressure of alcohol at its critical tem
 perature, the difference of pressure indicated by different manometers
puzzled me at first, especially as there was no difference in temperature,
 but upon determining the diameters of the manometer tubes it was
 found that the highest pressures were registered by the smallest
bores.
    The pressure of alcohol at its critical point         as registered by the
different manometers was as follows : —

    These numbers are the means of thirty measurements in each case.
The manometers A and B were used in most of the first portion of the
 work, but as they both broke subsequently, they were replaced by two
others, A' and B', and these again by A" and B". When a pressure of

over 300 atmospheres is required, these wide manometers are very apt
to burst, so that for high pressures a narrower tube must be used.
    The first work undertaken was to ascertain without doubt the
critical point of pure anhydrous ethyl alcohol, and this was done as
follows : — The alcohol sold as absolute by the makers was fractionated,
and the middle third taken. This was placed in a retort with freshly
burnt lime, and an inverted condenser adapted to it. After it had
been boiling for some time, the end of the condenser was fitted with a
drying tube of calcium chloride, to prevent moisture from entering.
The cohobation was continued for a week, and the alcohol then dis
tilled off. The first fifth was rejected, as was also the last. The
receiver was a small flat-bottomed flask, which is shown fitted up for
use (after it was filled with alcohol) in the front of the drawing.     It
was arranged as a wash-bottle, having the tube for the eutrance of air
connected with a small vitriol tower, and an india-rubber ball, fitted
with valves, to apply pressure.      The exit tube was adapted to the
experimental tube by a piece of india-rubber tubing, through which
was forced a piece of capillary tubing.        When the apparatus was
to be used in experiment the arrangements were made as follows : —
The cap with the pressure-screw was first fitted on next the experi
mental tube, with its point sealed up, and the whole filled up to the
top of the manometer branches with mercury. The manometers were
now placed in position and screwed tight.       The apparatus was then
tilted so as to raise the point of the experimental tube, keeping it,
however, above the level of the lower ends of the manometers, and
the point then broken off-. If the point were below the level of the
manometers some gas might escape.         The wash-bottle arrangement is
then fitted to the experimental tube and the ball compressed. Alcohol
is driven over and escapes by the capillary tube, and this is continued
till the inside of the tube has been well washed and all impurities
removed.     The capillary tube is then withdrawn, when the small
puncture in the india-rubber at once closes itself. The screw of the
pressure apparatus is then retreated, and when sufficient alcohol is
made to enter the apparatus, the joint is undone and the whole wash-
bottle arrangement placed under a bell- jar over oil of vitriol for use
another time, the india-rubber tube being clipped.      The screw is then
further retreated to leave a small air-space over the alcohol, which is
then boiled and the point sealed, and the tube placed in the air-
bath.    A mercury regulator, such as I have described elsewhere, was
sometimes used when the temperature was required to be constant for
long.
    The following tables contain some of the series of observations on
alcohol, and are given to show the numbers obtained when the work is
done with every care.      The alcohol used was different in each case, so
that slight variations in the averages may be due to differences in the

    -We see from the foregoing tables that the mean of over a hundred
experiments     gives a critical     point for alcohol of 235°'47 under a
pressure of 67'07 atmospheres.         The reason why so many experiments
were done was because the first two or three series did not agree well,
and it was only after some experience was gained at the work that
good results were obtained.         I have no doubt that by further refining
of the methods better results would be obtained, but                 I do not think
 the above numbers would require material alteration.                  Having now
fixed the critical temperature and pressure of alcohol under its own
vapour, the next work consisted in determining the critical tempera
 ture of the same liquid under greater pressure.                When any greater
 pressure than the critical is used, the tube is filled with a homogeneous
 fluid, the two states of a fluid being impossible under such a pressure.
 The critical state cannot, therefore, be observed under such conditions,
 as all the phenomena by which the liquid state can be recognised are
 dependent upon the observation of a limiting surface having a certain
                                                                       i2

 water, hydrocarbons, ethers, &c., however immiscible they may be at
 ordinary temperatures, mix freely or act upon one another long before
 the critical point of one of them is reached ; therefore liquids will not
 serve to furnish a free surface.     A gas, therefore, is the only substance
 which will bear any pressure without becoming miscible ; and if it is
insoluble in the liquid (and all liquids have some gases insoluble in
them) we are provided with a substance to overlie the liquid which will
 allow of a limiting surface being see a at any pressure.       This was the
method used. A quantity of pnre dry hydrogen was placed over the
alcohol, and pressure applied, and the effect of rise of temperature
observed.       It was seen that when the temperature rose to the critical
point the line dividing the alcohol from the mixture of alcohol vapour
and hydrogen became quickly indistinct, and was replaced by a broad
mark, indicating a gradual change in the refractive index of the fluid
when passing the place where the liquid surface had been, showing
that diffusion was taking place.        On lowering the temperature before
much diffusion had taken place, the point where the liquid surface had
been became dim just as the temperature passed below the critical
temperature and the sharp limiting surface became re-established.
    The pressure was then increased by decreasing the volume of
hydrogen, and the experiment repeated many times at the new pres
sure.    The temperature must be raised much more slowly for these
observations than for the simple observation of the critical point with
alcohol alone, as in the latter case the upper and lower portions of the
fluid become of the same density, instantly obliterating the line of the
meniscus ; but when hydrogen is above the alcohol the line remains
although the alcohol be gaseous, until it is obliterated or broadened by
diffusion. Thus, on raising such a mixture to the critical temperature,
it is necessary to keep the temperature steady, to ascertain whether or
not diffusion will take place.       If a rise of temperature is going on,
the thermometers will register a higher temperatnre than that at which
diffusion began. In this way the following series of observations were
carried out : —

   From these tables we see clearly that the critical temperature is not
materially altered by a very large increase of pressure ; in fact, in the
last case the pressure is nearly three times as great, and yet we have
only a lowering of the critical temperature by about one degree.         It
was found, howover, that as the pressure was increased the solubility
of the hydrogen in the alcohol also increased, so that at high pressures
a very considerable lowering of the critical temperature takes place.
When the two fluids have thoroughly mixed at a temperature over the
critical point, the passage of the mixture through the critical tempera
ture downwards is not attended with immediate liquefaction ; in fact,
this does not take place till a temperature 10° lower is reached, the
hydrogen preventing the alcohol from assuming the liquid condition.
At a pressure of 250 atmospheres the meniscus disappeared, or rather
became broad at 225°' ; but diffusion did not take place completely ; the
surface seemed to be destroyed, but the action did not go deeper,
while at 300 atmospheres the meniscus was lost at 220°. This is
plainly owing to the action of the compressed hydrogen, and could we
have a gas quite insoluble in the liquid, this lowering would not take

place.    It
           seems clear then that the temperatnre at which the perma
nent snrface of a fluid (which constitutes liquidness) disappears is not
altered by increase of pressure, and this is equivalent to saying that
the critical point is the termination of an isothermal line which marks
the limit of the liquid state.
   It next remained to be seen whether any other insoluble gas would
act in the same manner as hydrogen. It must be remembered that
hydrogen is furthest removed from the liquid condition and the least
dense body known, and the nearer the density of the superincumbent
gas approaches to the density of the liquid, the greater effect will it
have upon the critical temperature.       To test this, a quantity of
nitrogen was placed over alcohol, and the experiment conducted simi
larly to those with hydrogen.

   These numbers                plainly show that the meniscus of alcohol disappears
at the same temperature, whether under tne pressure of its own
vapour or at pressure of eighty atmospheres with nitrogen, affording
                    a

temperature.
   Another          method          still remained to

capillary height of a liquid under various pressures and temperatures.
The method used at first was to fix a small piece of capillary tubing

into the interior of the working tube by melting a small piece of sili
cate of soda, and causing the tube to adhere ; but this was found to be
disadvantageous, as the tube almost invariably burst where the silicate
was adhering.       The method latterly used was simply to make an
obtuse-angled bend on the tube, so that the piece of capillary tube
could not pass beyond this, but became wedged. The capillary height
was measured by a cathetometer in the usual manner.

    From these tables we see that the capillary height of the liquid is
lowered by a gas under pressure impinging on its surface.              Thus at
 *]6'7 atmospheres (the critical pressure of alcohol), the capillary height
 falls to zero at 235° '4, at 163'5 atmospheres of pressure zero is reached
at 230°-3 ; while at 236-8 atmospheres capillarity disappears at 224°-6.
 It is curious to note that, although the capillary action had ceased at
these temperatures, the liquids had not assumed the gaseous state, as
 Tables IV, V, VI, VII, and      VIII   show that in no case up to a pres
sure of 183 atmospheres did the alcohol diffuse into the hydrogen at a
temperature below 234°.
    As capillarity is entirely a surface phenomenon, the surface tension
of a liquid seems to be weakened by the impinging of a gas under
 pressure upon its surface, and this we might expect to be the case, as
 we can imagine a constant disturbance of the surface of the liquid,
owing to the high velocity of the hydrogen molecules striking it ;
whereas, not being soluble to any extent, few hydrogen molecnles
penetrate to disturb the liquidness of the interior.             It would thus
appear   that,   under  such conditions,  capillarity is not  a true measure of
the liquidness or cohesion of a fluid, and were the pressure high
enough the surface of a liquid might be made to disappear, while its
interior was in a truly liquid condition.        This question can be most
readily settled by passing a liquid, whose surface tension has thus
been caused to disappear, through a capillary tube, and observing
whether increase of temperature diminishes the time of flow, for the
resistance of a fluid is decreased by increase of temperature, while that
of a gas is increased.       The experimental realisation of such a test
is difficult, but apparatus is being at present constructed for the trial.

314                         Mr.  J. B. Hannay.
    In drawing  onfc the above tables  (which may exhibit slight irregu
larities) recourse was made to a large number of quite separate
observations, as full series are often difficult to obtain, owing to some
failure in the apparatus when it has been in use for some time at high
pressures.
   Hitherto only one liquid — alcohol — had been used in these experi
ments, so it was determined to try the same experiments with other
liquids, and those chosen were carbon disulphide, carbon tetrachloride,
and methyl alcohol.
   The carbon disulphide was digested over sodium for some time and
distilled off pure quick-lime.    This gives a liquid having no offensive
odour and quite colourless.     It was distilled into an apparatus similar
to that used for alcohol, and preserved under a bell-jar over oil of
vitriol.   Four sets of observations were done in order to determine
the critical temperature and pressure accurately; in all 1C3 experi
ments.    The results are as follows : —
             Mean temperature corrected              277°-68.
               Probable error of mean                   0°'16.
             Mean pressure corrected                 78"14 atmos.
               Probable error                         0807     „
   The apparatus was now arranged so that the critical temperature
could be observed under pressure with hydrogen with the following
results : —
             Mean temperature corrected              2740-93.
               Probable .error                          0° 09.
             Mean pressure corrected                 171*54 atmos.
               Probable error                          0'07    „
   For these numbers sixty-two experiments were done.
   Nitrogen was then substituted for the hydrogen, and the experi
ments conducted as before.       Forty-one determinations were made to
obtain the following means : —
             Mean temperature corrected              273°"12.
               Probable error                          0°19.
             Mean pressure corrected                 141*45 atmos.
               Probable error                           0"16     „
   Here we see that while the pressure of the nitrogen on the carbon
disulphide is much lower, the temperature at which the meniscus
disappears is also lower. k This is likely owing to the greater solubility
of the nitrogen in the liquid, as the density makes it approach much
nearer to the density of the disulphide than hydrogen.

    On examining these tables, and the curves which graphically repre
 sent them, we see that here also the capillary action of the liquid is
 weakened by a gas impinging upon its surface, even at low tempera
 tures, and again we see that the capillarity is reduced to zero before the
 liquid is really gaseous, showing that like alcohol the surface tension
 of carbon disulphide is destroyed by the activity of the molecules of
 the gas overlying it. The curve for carbon disnlphide and hydro
 gen, XIV, fig. 3, should not be really a straight line, but a number
 of accidents happened during these experiments, and the cnrve is
 made up from many readings from different manometers, that for the

   middle part of the curve evidently reading a little low. The whole
   result agrees well with what was shown from alcohol.
     The next body examined was methyl alcohol, a sample of which
  was carefully purified in the same manner as the ethyl alcohol, until
  its boiling point was constant.      It was then distilled off quick-lime
  into the wash-bottle arrangement for use. It gave as follows : —

     These   means were taken from three     series, each of     thirty experi
 ments. The same experiments were then carried out with methyl
 alcohol and hydrogen and nitrogen, as in the case of ethyl alcohol and
 carbon disulphide, yielding the following results from twenty-two
 experiments : —

     Here we have, as before, a slight depression of the critical tempera
 ture. Experiments were then tried with higher pressure. Forty-seven
 gave the following means : —
               Mean temperature corrected            227°-92.

experiments were —

    We have a further depression of the critical point, and as the point
was determined with great difficulty we have an increase of the
probable error. However, the result confirms the other experiments.
The same mode of experiment was then carried out with methyl
alcohol and hydrogen and nitrogen as with ethyl alcohol, with the
following results.

   In  these experiments we see again that increase of pressure never
increases the liquidness of the fluid, and never enables it to remain
liquid at a temperature  above the critical point.

   The last liquid examined was carbon tetrachloride, and this was
very carefully dried and purified by fractionation and distillation off
quick-lime, the purified liquid being kept with the same precautions as
were used in the other cases.       It was seen, however, that the tetra
chloride acted upon the mercury, forming a white crystalline body
which crystallised out as the liquid cooled. It appeared to be mercuric
chloride, as it dissolved in water; but whether the crystals were pure
mercuric chloride or a compound of that body with some other
chloride of carbon there was not sufficient obtained to determine.
The critical temperature and pressure were determined with twenty
different samples, using one quantity only for two or three readings,
and the following numbers were obtained : —

   On attempting to obtain the critical temperature under pressure it
was found that the hydrogen at once dissolved under pressure, and
not only dissolved, but formed a compound with the tetrachloride.
Some curious     observations   were made on the relation of pressure to
chemical combination with this mixture.          It was found that for a
given temperature and pressure only a certain amount of combination
would take place, leaving the excess of hydrogen overlying the tetra
chloride quite free. If then more pressure were applied, th6 mano
meter would jump up say five atmospheres, and then gradually fall
about four or four and a half atmospheres, and again become stable,
and this would take place each time, a large portion of hydrogen
disappearing for a small permanent rise of pressure.          A sudden rise
of temperature had somewhat the same effect, but as the temperature
could not be varied so suddenly the effect was not so obvious.        Several
bodies   were  formed  by   the action  of the hydrogen,   the  action being
 capable of being pushed so far as to form chloroform.         Nitrogen was
used as a pressure substance, and it answered well.           The following
 numbers were obtained from twenty-seven experiments : —
              Mean temperature corrected              277°'56.
                Probable error                          0°829.
              Mean pressure corrected                 142'83 atmos.
                Probable error                           0-13    „
    From this it will be seen   that by increasing the pressure to nearly
 three times the normal, a fall of five degrees in the critical temperature
 has taken place.    This was no doubt due to the surface tension being

 destroyed by the action of the gaseous molecules, so another series
was tried at a lower pressure.      Forty-two experiments were done : —
              Mean temperature corrected             282°850.
                Probable error                          0°"12.
              Mean pressure corrected                  83"18 atmos.
                Probable error                          0-38    ,,
    Here we see that a large increase of pressure has not altered the
critical temperature at all, as was before seen to be the case with
alcohol.    A series of capillary measurements was commenced with this
liquid, but a series of accidents interfered with the work, and only
 twelve reliable readings were obtained, and no time has been at my
disposal since to finish the work ; but sufficient evidence of the course
of capillary action has already been gained from the other liquids to
 draw conclusions as to the liquid state and its limit.
                                    Fig. 4.
    Three curves have been drawn to show the depression of the critical
temperature with increase of pressure, and these lines have been con
tinued down the curve of vapour pressure to show the break at the
critical point. This will be clearly shown in curves Nos. XVII, XVIII,
and XIX, fig. 4.      The consideration of these results yields a novel
mode of looking at the states of matter which I have illustrated in
fig. 5. From this it appears we might classify matter under four
                                                                       states;
first, the gaseous which exists from the highest temperatures down to
an isothermal passing through the critical point and depending
entirely upon temperature or molecular velocity ; second, the vaporous,
bounded upon the upper side by the gaseous state and on the lower
                                                                       of the
by absolute zero, and depending entirely upon the length
mean free path, because shortening of the mean        free  path   alters  the
state ; third, the liquid bounded upon the upper side by the gaseons
state, and on the lower by the solid or absolute zero    ; fourth, the   solid

whose condition is also determined by both pressure and temperature.
The gaseous state is the only one which is not affected by pressure
alone, or in which the molecular velocity is so high that the collisions
cause a rebound   of sufficient energy to prevent grouping.      Another
distinction between the gaseous and vaporous states is that the former
is capable of acting as a solvent of solids, whereas the latter is not.
   The two conclusions arrived at from this work are —
   1st. The liquid state has a limit which is an isothermal passing
through the critical point.
   2nd. The vaporous state can be clearly defined as a distinct state of
matter.
   To the original distinction between these two states given by
Andrews — namely, that of condensibility — I have added another, that
of solvent power. A vapour over a liquid holding a coloured solid in
solution is colourless, but on passing the critical temperature the
whole becomes coloured. In some cases, however, the solid is deposited
and redissolved as the temperature rises, showing that the more per
fectly gaseous the greater the solvent power.       Andrews's distinction
compels us to travel along an isotherm, mine l-equires high pressure ;
both are thus arbitrary, requiring given conditions, but this is the case
with many of the other distinctions used in science.
   My thanks are due to my assistant, Mr. Ewing McConechy, for his
assiduous aid during the above described investigation.

     The Presents received were laid on the table, and thanks ordered

 I. " Sur     les Surfaces Homofocales          du    Second Ordre."         By
        Lieut-Colonel A. Mannheim, Professor in the École Poly-
        technique. Communicated by Dr. HlRST, F.R.S. Received
        January   19, 1882.
    Un ellipsoïde (0) étant donné, on sait que par nn point quelconque
de l'espace, on peut faire passer trois surfaces du second ordre qui lui
sont homofocales.       La connaissance de l'ellipsoïde (O) entraînant la
connaissance de ces surfaces homofocales, il existe des liaisons géo
métriques 'entre (O ) et ces surfaces.
    Je me propose d'établir, parmi ces liaisons, celles qui permettent
d'obtenir les rayons de courbure principaux des trois surfaces homo
focales.     Pour cela, j'appliquerai d'abord un théorème que j'ai eu
l'honneur de communiquer à la Société Royale (séance du 16 Juin,
1881) et dont je vais rappeler l'énoncé :
    Un angle de grandeur constante, circonscrit à un ellipsoïde donné et
dont le plan est normal à cette surface en chacun des points de contact des
côtés de cet angle, se déplace de façon que son sommet reste sur l'ellipsoïde
(E)    homofocal à V ellipsoïde donné  :  ce sommet   décrit une ligne de cour-
hure de    (E).
    Appelons c le sommet de l'angle mobile, c a, c b, ses deux côtés et a
et b les points de contact de ces côtés avec l'ellipsoïde (O).          L'angle
a c b n'est autre que l'une des sections principales du cône circonscrit
à l'ellipsoïde (O) et dont le sommet est c.        Si l'on prend un ellipsoïde
homofocal à (O) et si on lui circonscrit de même un cône de sommet
c, on sait que le plan de l'angle a c b est aussi le plan d'une des
bections principales de ce cône.
    Appelons c a', c b\ les génératrices qui forment cette section princi
pale. On peut de même considérer une suite d'ellipsoïdes homofocaux
à (O) et l'on aura pour chacun d'eux des droites telles que c a, c b,

4:a', c V, &c. D'après ce que nous venons de rappeler,                                toutes ces droites
sont dans le même plan, a ch.
     Par le point  (fig. 1), élevons la droite G perpendiculairement au
                              c
plan a ch. Les droites c a, cb, G forment un trièdre, que nous allons
entraîner en même temps 'que l'angle a c 5 et qui reste de grandeur
invariable pendant le déplacement de cet angle.        La droite G, ainsi
entraînée, reste tangente     en  son point c à la ligne de courbure E
décrite par ce point.
   La caractéristique du plan de la face (c a, G) est la droite c a, car
cette droite passe par les points où cette face touche E et l'ellipsoïde
{O). Le lieu des positions du côté c a est alors la surface développable
«nveloppe du plan (c a, G). Nous appellerons (a) la courbe, lieu des
points de contact, tels que a, de cette surface développable et de (O).
    Prenons cette courbe (a) comme directrice d'une normalie à
l'ellipsoïde donné.    Pendant le déplacement du trièdre le plan a cb
contient successivement       une génératrice de cette normalie.       Sa
caractéristique passe alors par le point <%, où il touche cette normalie.
Mais la tangente en a à (a) et la tangente a c sont deux tangentes
conjuguées relativement à (O) ; le plan a cb est alors un plan central
de la normalie et le point a est le poiut central pour la génératrice
a a de cette surface.
     Le point  est aussi le centre de courbure de la courbe de contour

aussi sur la caractéristique dn plan a cb, c'est-à-dire qu'ils appartien

plan est doublement tangente à la section faite dans A' par ce même
plan. Ceci est vrai, quel que soit le plan sécant ; il en résulte, lorsque

 focale de   (S), est alors rencontrée normalement par ce plan principal ;
ces points de rencontre avec ce plan principal sont alors les foyers de
 la section faite dans (S) par ce plan.               Nous sommes alors amenés an
 théorème suivant, qui a déjà été énoncé ainsi par M. Faure.f
     Deux coniques homofocales étant données, si, d'un point m de l'une, on
 même deux tangentes à l'autre et que l'on trace une conique passant par
 le point m et ayant pour foyers ces points de contact, elle aura avec la
première un contact du troisième ordre au point m.
     Reprenons maintenant l'ellipsoïde (0) et l'ellipsoïde (E) qui lui est
 homofocal.       Projetons ces surfaces sur le plan (a c b) qui est le plan
<l'une section principale de (E).               En vertu d'un théorème connu, les
 lignes de contour apparent de (0) et de (E) sur ce plan sont deux
•courbes    homofocales.        Mais la ligne de contour apparent de (E) a,
 pour rayon de courbure en e, le rayon de courbure principal, cyt de
 (E) : on aura donc ce rayon C72 en appliquant le théorème de Faure.
 Voici la construction qui, sur le plan (a c b) donne ce rayon de cour
 bure : au point a on élève une perpendiculaire à a c. Du point où
cette droite rencontre la normale c-(x on élève une perpendiculaire à
cette normale.          Cette perpendiculaire rencontre c a en un point que
 l'on joint par une droite au point obtenu de la même manière sur c b ;
cette droite rencontre la normale C7X an point 73 qui est le centre de
 courbure cherché.
     On construit de la même manière sur la normale cêj le centre de

forment les sections principales du cône de sommet c, on a le théorème
suivant :
    On donne un cône du second ordre de sommet c, un point 1 sur l'un de
ses axes, et par ce point on mène un plan arbitraire qui coupe le cône
suivant une certaine courbe.         Le long de cette courbe on inscrit dans le
cône une surface du second ordre quelconque, et Von construit la surface
homofocale à celle-ci qui passe en c et qui a pour normale en ce point la
droite c   1.   Cette surface et toutes les surfaces analogues, que l'on obtient
en faisant varier le plan sécant mené par 1 et les surfaces du second ordre
inscrites, sont osculatrices entr' elles au point c.
    Reprenons la ligne de courbure E de l'ellipsoïde               (E), cette ligne
étant le lieu du sommet de l'angle constant a c b,                il résulte de l'ex
pression de C73 que :
    Les rayons de courbure tels que cy3 des sections faites dans (E)         par  des
plans normaux à E sont proportionnels aux segments tels que c 1.
    La ligne de courbure E peut être engendrée, comme nous l'avons dit
 en commençant,          en employant l'un quelconque des ellipsoïdes homo-
 focaux à (0). Parmi ceux-ci nous pouvons prendre celui qui, limité
 à l'ellipse focale de (E), est infiniment aplati et appliquer le résultat
 précédent.       Nous voyons alors que :
    Les rayons de courbure, tels que C70, des sections faites dans (E) par
 des  plans normaux à E sont proportionnels aux segments compris sur ces
 rayons entre les points de     E  et les points où ces rayons rencontrent le plan
 de l'ellipse focale de (E).
    Comme       les plans principaux d'un ellipsoïde déterminent sur une
 normale quelconque de cette surface des segments proportionnels, on
 pent remplacer dans cet énoncé le plan de l'ellipse focale par l'un quel
 conque des plans principaux de l'ellipsoïde.
    Appelons n le point où la normale c           l rencontre    le plan de l'ellipse
 focale de (E). Puisque les rayons de courbure tels que C73 pour les
 points de E sont proportionnels à ci et à en, ces segments sont pro
 portionnels entr'eux.         On a alors ce théorème :
    Les    normales à      (E), issues des points    de  E, sont partagées    par  les
plans polaires      de ces points pris par rapport à    des ellipsoïdes  homofocaua;
  à (E),    en segments proportionnels.

 à cette surface et tangents à E.

332                Dr.   E. Frankland.      On Measuring tlie          [Feb. 2,
between the two temperatures being taken as a measure of the sun's
radiant heat operating at the time and place of the two observations.
   The chief sources of error in this method are the difficulty of
ascertaining the temperature of the air immediately surrounding the
vacuous globe containing the blackened bulb, and the placing of this
thermometer under exactly similar conditions at different meteoro
logical stations.       How considerable may be the errors arising from
these sources will be evident from the following observations and
«xperimental results.
                      Determination   of Shade Temperature.
   A thermometer merely shaded from the sun gives, in air of uniform
temperature, readings differing very widely from each other according
to its surroundings.          If it be placed opposite a wall, for instance,
upon which the sun is shining, the temperature indicated will be
several degrees above what it would be if there were no such object
near.    I have    also observed a difference in its readings when, on the
one hand,   it is exposed towards a blue sky, or, on the other, towards
white clouds.       Again, if the thermometer be placed in a louvred box,
the readings    will   be much too high, unless the ontside of the box be
white ; because the box becomes heated by the sun and communicates
its heat to the air entering the louvres. Even the colour of the ground
beneath the box has considerable influence upon the temperature of
the air inside.
   A true shade temperature means the temperature of free air in full
sunshine ; and, strictly, it ought to be ascertained without any shade
at all, for, as soon as a shade is created, conditions supervene which
often entirely baffle the object of the observer.        The shade of a parasol
exhibits a different temperature from the shade of a tree, and this
again differs widely from that of a house.            The temperature of the
shade of a sheet of tinfoil is quite different from that of a sheet of
writing-paper.        Indeed, it may be truly said that every shade has its
own peculiar temperature.          The following thermometric readings show
-this effect of the area of shade, and of the quality of the shading
material : —

                ,,      small arch of bright tinfoil   ....   45"2
    Thus shade temperatures, measured during 1£ hours of uninter
rupted sunshine in the middle of the day, and within a few yards of
 the same spot, differed by no less than 25°' 7 C.          These observations

1882.]           relative Thermal Intensity     of the. Sun.            333
were, however, made at Pontresina, 5,915 feet above sea level, and so
wide a range wonld probably not occur at lower altitudes.
   The most effective shading material is, obviously, that which most
perfectly reflects solar heat ; and of all materials with which I have
experimented white paper is the best, white linen and zinc-white being
nearly equal to it. The most trustworthy shade thermometer, there
fore, is one having its bulb covered with a thin layer of white paper,
or, in default of this, the naked bulb may be shaded by a small arch
of white paper.     So placed, the thermometer will indicate a lower
temperature than any obtainable in a similar shade produced by any
other material.
   The foregoing temperatures were observed when the thermometer
was level with the ground, but the readings often rapidly become
lower as the instrument is raised.       The ratio of the diminution of
temperature at increasing heights above the ground is, during sun
shine, enormously great within a few feet of the earth.       The ground,
strongly heated by the sun, powerfully warms the molecules of air in
immediate contact with it ; these, becoming specifically lighter, rise,
and at once begin to share their heat with the colder molecules above
them, losing temperature in proportion as they mix with larger and
larger volumes of supernatant cold air. The intensity of this effect
attains a maximum when the air is calm, and a minimum during a
storm. Indeed, these powerful convection currents are readily seen,
on a calm sunny day, rising from the ground like the heated air from
a stove, but they are scarcely, if at all, visible when a strong breeze is
blowing.
   In order to be comparable with each other, therefore, observations
of shade temperature, whether at the same place or at different
stations, should always be made under uniform conditions. That is
to say, the thermometers, fully exposed to the air, should be similarly
protected from radiant heat, and should be placed either at the level
of the ground or at a definite height above          it,  upon a surface of
uniform quality as regards absorbing and reflecting power.        I     would
suggest that the bulb of the thermometer and         2     inches of its stem
should be protected from the rain by being placed beneath a sheet-
zinc arch of 1-inch span and      4     inches long, painted inside and out
      "

                  zinc-white.      The instrument with the arch should be
securely fixed horizontally upon a wooden stand      1   foot square, painted
on both sides with       " flatted "  zinc-white, and, in order to avoid the
excessively  warm    air   very  near  the ground, the stand should have a
height of  4 feet —  an elevation convenient for observation, and one at
which the temperature of the air suffers comparatively small decre
ments per foot of elevation.          It should also be at a distance from
buildings or trees, and have as free a horizon as possible.       By the use
of instruments so prepared and mounted, comparative and fairly

 ;$34             Dr. E. Frankland.          On Measuring      the    [Feb.   2,
trustworthy determinations of air or shade temperatures            in different
localities would be obtained.
                     Determination    of Sun Temperature.
    The term sun     temperature,     as commonly employed, has a very
vague meaning.       If  a body could be placed in sunlight under such
circumstances as to absorb heat rays and emit none, its temperature
would soon rise to that of the sun itself. But as all good absorbers
of heat are also good radiators, the elevation of temperature            cansed
by the exposure of even good absorbers to sunlight is comparatively
small.. Thus an isolated thermometer, with blackened glass bulb,
placed in sunshine, will rarely rise more than 10° C. above the tem
perature which it marks when screened from direct sunlight.              Under
these circumstances, however, the thermometer loses heat not merely
by radiation, but also by actual contact with the surrounding cold air.
If the latter source of loss be obviated a much higher sun temperature
is obtained ; thus, the blackened bulb inclosed in a vacuous clear glass
globe will sometimes, when placed in snnlight, rise as much as 60° C.
above the shade temperature, and a still higher degree of heat may be
obtained by exposing to the sun's rays the naked blackened bulb of a
thermometer inclosed in a wooden box padded with black cloth, and
closed by a lid of clear plate glass.        Thus I obtained with such a box,
on the 22nd of December, in Switzerland,* when the air was con
siderably below the freezing point, a temperature of 105° C., and a
still higher temperature could doubtless be obtained by surrounding
the thermometer with a vacuous globe before inclosing it in the padded
box.    These widely different temperatures, produced under different
conditions by the solar rays, show that such observations can be com
parative only when the thermometer employed to measure them is
always surrounded by the same conditions. Under these equal con
ditions, however, the relative solar intensities at different times or
places, are expressed by the number of degrees through which the
sun's rays can raise the temperature of any body — the bulb of a
thermometer, for instance— above that of the surrounding air.
Various instruments have been contrived for such measurements,
but the thermometer with blackened bulb in vacuo is the most con
venient.     As indications of solar intensity, however, its readings
are,  as  I shall  proceed to show, of little value if, as is sometimes
the case, the instrument be simply placed upon grass, or if the
shade temperature be not determined in immediate proximity to the
vacuous bulb.       The following experiments, made with a blackened
bulb in vacno verified at Kew Observatory, show how dependent

   In some observatories, the blackened bulb in vacuo is laid upon grass ;
but the experiments at Tosten Vierod show that its indications vary,
under the same insolation, as much as 4°'7 C. according to the con
dition of the grass ; somewhat parched, and consequently                                lighter
coloured grass, giving a higher temperature than green and mode
rately long grass, whilst the latter raises the thermometer more than
newly-mown grass.              These differences result partly from differences
of shade or air temperature in the immediate neighbourhood of the
vacuous globe of the thermometer,                     and partly from the different
reflecting power of the subjacent surface.                   With regard to the first of
these causes, it must be borne in mind that the solar intensity is
measured by the number of degrees through which the blackened
bulb in vacuo is raised above the temperature of the medium imme
diately surrounding the vacuous globe.                       If this medium becomes
warmer, the temperature of the blackened bulb will rise in a corre
sponding measure, and vice versa, although the solar intensity remain
the same. Now, the more absorbent the surface upon which the sun's
ra} S fall, the higher, cevteris paribus, will be the temperature of the
air resting upon that surface.                Thus, with the same solar intensity,
the shade or air temperature on white paper was 25°-2 C., on black
caoutchouc       28°'5 C., on short grass 22°'7 C., and upon a rock
22°86 C. ; whilst at a height of 4 feet above the grass it was only
17° 9 C.
   It  is to the second of the causes just specified, however — the dif
ferent reflecting power of the snbjacent surface — that the variations
of the sun thermometer under the same solar radiation are mainly
due, as is proved by the following observations, in which the shade
 temperature was alwaj'S taken under a small paper arch close to the
 vacuous globe      : —

      These results show that the indications of the black bulb in vacuo
  are profoundly affected by the character of the surface beneath th e
  instrument, the more perfect the reflecting power of that surface,
  other things equal, the higher the solar intensity indicated. Of all
  the substances tried, the highly reflecting power of white paper and
  linen8 for solar heat was very remarkable, exceeding appreciably that
  of bright metals, and even of freshly-fallen snow of dazzling white
  ness.    Of course, lateral reflection produces the same effect, and    I
  found that the indicated solar intensity was increased by no less than
  11° C. when the blackened bulb in vacuo was placed at a distance oi'
  10 feet in front of a whitewashed wall upon which the sun was
  shining.
      Finally the indications of the solar thermometer are also affected
  by strong wind, the readings of solar intensity being somewhat
  lower when the instrument is exposed to the current than when it is
  sheltered. The cause of this is obvious ; the difference of tempera
  ture produced by the sun's radiant heat is really that between the
  inner blackened bulb and the glass of the vacuous globe.        Now the
 latter is constantly receiving and absorbing obscure rays of heat from
 the blackened bulb, and its temperature must therefore always be
 somewhat higher than that of the surrounding air, which is measured
 by the shade- thermometer; but the glass globe will obviously main
 tain a less elevated temperature when it receives the strong impact of
 the molecules of cooler air in a breeze than when it is surrounded by
 a still atmosphere.      The error thus introduced into the observations
 by a light breeze, however, does not seem to be serious, for I have not
 found it to exceed 0°'7 C. ; but in a high wind it would probably be
 more considerable.
     The results of the foregoing experiments disclose the precautions
 necessary to be observed to render such determinations of relative
 solar intensity fairly comparable and trustworthy.         They are the
 following: —
     1 . The vacuous globe should always and everywhere be placed upon
 the same kind of horizontal reflecting surface.
     2. The temperature of the air upon this reflecting surface should be
 taken as the shade temperature, and its observation should be syn
chronous with that of the sun-thermometer.
     3. The horizon all round the instrument should be as free as possi
 ble, and there should be, especially, no sunlit walls in such a position
as to reflect heat upon the thermometer.
     4. As far as compatible with these conditions, the solar thermo
meter should be sheltered from the wind.
     The white surface on which the thermometers are laid need not be
-of large area.     A square foot practically affords to the blackened
 bulb in vacuo a reflective plane of infinite extent, for   I  have ascer-

tained that the indicated solar intensity is not augmented when the
area of white surface is increased fourfold.
   There is not much use in having tielf-registering shade and sun
thermometers, because the highest temperature of the blackened bulb
does not necessarily occur at the time of maximum shade tempera
ture ; and, co nsequently, the maximum solar intensity during any
period cannot be found by merely deducting the maximum shade
from the maximum sun temperature.           Correct observations of maxi
mum solar intensity are, therefore, very laborious with these instru
ments ; and are,    I believe, never made in the routine work of a
meteorological station. As they afford, however, very interesting
data, I have endeavoured to simplify them by contriving an instru
ment which allows them to be recorded for each day with one
reading only.
A Differential Self-Registering  Temperature,   far measuring relative solar
                                 intensity.
   This instrument, as seen from the accompanying figure, has consider
able  similarity to a Leslie's differential air thermometer; but in the
new instrument the differential changes in the elasticity of the air of
the two bulbs are measured by their action in elevating a column of
mercury.

    A, B  are the two bulbs, 20 millims.   in diameter, one of which, A, is
blackened in the nsnal way, and then sealed into the larger clear glass
globe, C, which has a small neck at c for attachment to a Sprengel
pump. As soon as a good vacuum has been obtained, the neck is
sealed off before the blowpipe, as shown in the figure. The other bulb,
 B, is shaded by a small zinc arch, /, 3 inches long, painted on both sides
with " flatted " zinc-white. These bulbs are connected by a tube bent
twice at right angles and furnished at d with a branch and stopcock.
    The tube from the bulbs to e e is of the diameter of that of a self-
registering spirit thermometer, but the remaining part of it is much
wider, in order to diminish the friction of the column of mercury
moving in it. The upright tube attached to B is provided with a scale,
and the usual steel index is enclosed in the capillary part of it. The
length of the scale is quite independent of the capacity of the bulbs,
provided the volume of that part of the capillary tube in which the
mercury oscillates is nearly a vanishing quantity in relation to the
volume of the bulbs.       It is well to have the two bulbs of nearly the
same size, but a difference of capacity does not interfere with the
accuracy of the instrument.          The difference of the level of the
mercury in the two limbs will be exactly proportional (neglecting the
volume of the capillary tube) to the difference of temperature in the
two bulbs, and the degrees of the scale, g, will therefore .be equal
throughout.      The length of these degrees, however, though constant
for any one instrument, will vary with the temperature and pressure
at 'which the instrument has been filled, being greater the lower the
temperature and the higher the pressure.         At 0° C. and 760 millims.
mercurial pressure, the difference of mercury level corresponding to
1° C. difference of temperature would be 28784 millims., and the full
length of these degrees may be practically obtained by making the
wide portion of the tube longer in the limb A e than in B e, so that a
minute depression of the mercury in A e will cause a great rise of the
column in B e. The relative capacities of the capillary and wide tubes
can be readily determined, and the necessary correction made in the
readings for the depression of the mercury in A e.
   The instrument may, however, be so constructed as to make the
mercury rise and fall equally in both capillary tubes ; in which case the
rise in one limb would be accompanied by a corresponding fall in the
other, and consequently the indicated degrees on the limb B e would be
only half as long, 1'39 millims. corresponding to 1° C. — a graduation
wbich is sufficiently open for all practical purposes.        As a greater
difference than 60° C. between the shade and sun thermometers has
never been yet observed, a scale 163 millims. long in the one case, or
half that length in the other, is sufficient, except perhaps for obser
vations at very great altitudes.
    As shown in the figure, the bulbs are supported upon a firm table,

of suitable size to permit of the passage of the          \J -tube and stopcock,
the aperture being subsequently closed by a slip of wood level with the
top of the table.      This table is painted on both sides with " flatted "
zinc- white, and its legs are firmly fixed in the ground, so that it cannot
be disturbed by the wind.              The branch tube, d, should also be
anchored to the ground by elastic bands, so as to prevent any move
ment of the instrument from the same cause.               It is, moreover, desir
able to surround the table with wire netting.
   By means of a funnel and flexible tube, mercury is now introduced
cautiously into the U"tUDe through the stopcock, d, until it reaches
the zero of the scale, care being taken that both bulbs are at the same
temperature       (which should be noted) during the operation. The
pressure upon the air in the bulbs must then be determined,                      and
employed, together with the temperature, in calculating the length of
each degree npon the scale.            Once charged, the instrument must
thenceforward be kept in its normal position, or nearly so, otherwise
the mercury will get into the bulbs, whence it can only be dislodged
with difficulty. In transporting the instrument from place to place it
is therefore advisable to withdraw the mercury.

and                     20aW-15as&e + 3ay-86s=0.
   It   would perhaps be difficult to obtain the results for the general
case by the present method ; but if the question be regarded from a
different point of view, we can see not only how many conditions will
exist in general, but also what will be their form ; and, moreover, we
can actually obtain them in any particular case.
   The problem is in fact identical with that of finding the conditions
under which an equation of the degree 2n can be solved by means of
an equation of the degree n.              To answer this, we have merely to sub
stitute in the equation

This will give n equations, from which we can of course eliminate w
in n — 1 ways ; and the results of the eliminations will consequently
be the conditions sought, n—1 in number.                     Applying this to the case
of the sextic, we have

       I. — The Siderites  of Cranbourne, near Melbourne, Australia.
    The large masses of meteoric iron found at Cranbourne, near Mel
bourne, Australia, were known as far back as 1854. The larger block
was bought by Mr. A. Bruce, now of Chislehurst, for one sovereign,
who determined to present it to the British Museum. The smaller
mass, weighing a few hundredweight, became the property of Mr.
Abel; and was sent to the International Exhibition of 1862. When

344                 Dr. W. Flight.        On Meteorites.            [Feb.  9r
the block belonging to Mr. Bruce came to be uncovered          and moved it
was found to weigh 3£ tons.          Some difficulties arose   respecting its
shipment to England, and eventually Mr. Abel's block was purchased
for 300Z. by the Trustees of the British Museum, and presented to the
colony, and the larger mass was sent to this conntry.              They lay
3'6 miles apart ;   and   the  major   axis of the   Bruce   meteorite, some
5 English feet, lay exactly in the magnetic meridian of the place.
    The Bruce meteorite consists entirely of metallic minerals, and
contains no rocky matter whatever. The iron contains no combined
carbon, but from 7 to 9 per cent. of nickel, some cobalt, a little
silicium, and copper; and, distributed through its mass, rather less
than 1 per cent. of bright, apparently square prisms of a phosphide.
    Lying on the plates of meteoric iron, which make up the mass, were
found thin metallic plates of the thickness of writing paper, of a
flexible mineral, which had the composition Fe5Ni2.               It is this
mineral which forms the figures on etched surfaces, and not schrei-
berite as generally stated.     I  propose to call this compound Edruond-
sonite, in memory of the late George Edmondson, the Head Master of
 Queenwood College, a great lover of science ; a man with whom 1
 had the honour to be long and intimately connected.
    Nodules of troilite, varying from half an inch to two inches in
 length, are frequently met with.        The composition of the sulphide
 proved it to be the iron monosulphide beyond question.          Occasionally
 nodules of graphite    were  noticed, enclosing troilite in curious pointed
 forms, so that a section resembles the outline of a holly leaf. The prisms
 already referred to appear to be identical with the mineral to which
 Gustav Rose gave the name of rhabdite, and to have the composition
 indicated by the formula (Fe4Ni3)P.        The resemblance between them
 and the phosphide described by Sidot, and more recently by Mallard,
 is gone into. A very brittle coarse powder, left by treating the iron
 with acid, yielded what appears to be schreibersite with the formula
 (Fe2Ni)7P.     Among the debris of the meteorite were occasionally
 found large brass- coloured oblique crystals; these readily cleave
 across the base, and have a composition according with the formula
  (Fe9Nij)P2. There were also curious crystals met with on two or three
 occasions, apparently square prisms, which, while the sides were quite
 bright and metallic, had a square centre of a dull, almost black,
 colour ; this also is a phosphide, and has a composition closely accord
 ing with the formula (Fe^Nio)?.
    Graphite occurs occasionally, but rarely, as nodules, sometimes as
 nodules enclosing troilite, in one case in a mass extending over an
 area 4 inches in length by 2 inches wide.        It contained from 0825 to
 0 30 per cent. of hydrogen.
     The occluded gases amounted in bulk to 3'59 times the volume cf
  the iron, and consisted of —

                 II. — The Uowton Siderite or Meteoric Iron.
    The metallic mass next to be described is one of unusual interest in
more than one respect : in the first place, before it fell, only one iron
meteorite was known to have fallen in Great Britain, while eight stony
meteorites that have fallen in the British Islands are in the National
Collection ; and, secondly, of the more than 300 meteorites which are
contained in the collection in the Natural History Museum more than
100 are unquestionably iron meteorites, and of these the fall of seven
only has been witnessed.
    This iron fell at about twenty minutes to four on the afternoon of
the 20th April, 1876, in a turf-field adjoining the Wellington and
Market Drayton Railway, about a mile north of the Wrekin, on
land belonging to the Duke of Cleveland, at Rowton, near Welling
ton, Shropshire.       A strange rumbling noise was heard in the air,
followed instantaneously by a startling explosion resembling a dis
charge of heavy artillery.          Rain was falling heavily at the time.
About an hour later a man entering the field had his attention
attracted by a hole cut in the ground ; he probed it with a stick,
 when he found a block of meteoric iron weighing 7£ lbs. It had
penetrated to a depth of 18 inches ; the hole was nearly perpendicular,
but the stone appears to have fallen in a south-easterly direction.
 When removed from the hole the mass was still quite warm.
    It is covered with a thin dull black crust of the magnetic oxide,
though in certain spots the metallic character of the block is revealed,
especially at the point where it struck the earth. It closely resembles
 the iron of Nedagolla, in India.       Some fragments were analysed, and
 found to contain iron 9125 and 918046, nickel 88582, cobalt 08371,
and a trace of copper.
    A part of a nodule of troilite, which was found not to be in the
 slightest degree magnetic, and was covered with a thin layer of
graphite, was submitted to analysis ; and there was found sulphur
 36'073 per cent., theory requiring 36'36 per cent.
    Some fragments of iron were sawn into very thin plates, and the
 gases contained in them pumped out.           The gas collected was 6'38
 times the bulk of the iron used, and its composition proved to be —

             III. — The  Meteorite of Middlesbrough,     Yorkshire.
   During the past year a very beautiful specimen of a meteorite fell
near Middlesbrough, at a spot called Pennyman's Siding on the
North Eastern Railway Company's branch line from Middlesbrough
to Guisbrough, about one mile and three-quarters from the former
town. Its descent was witnessed by W. Ellinor and three platelayers,
who heard a whizzing or rushing noise in the air, followed in a second
or two by a sudden blow of a body striking the ground not far from
them ; the spot was found to be 48 yards from where they stood. The
fall took place at 3-35 p.m. on the 14th March, 1881. No luminous or
cloud-forming       phenomena are reported.          According     to Professor
Alexander Herschel, who at once visited the spot, the fall appears to
                                                                         "
have been nearly vertical.        The stone was " new milk warm when
found, and weighed 3 lbs. 8^ oz. ; the crust is very perfect and of an
unusual thickness, and has scarcely suffered by the fall.             The stone
forms a low pyramid, slightly scolloped                or conchoidal-looking,
6%   inches   in  length,   5 inches   wide, and   3  inches   in height The
rounded summit and sloping sides are scored and deeply grooved,
with a polish like black lead in waving furrows running to the base,
showing that this side came foremost during the whole of the fusing
action of the atmosphere which the meteorite underwent in its flight.
The base is equally fused by heat, but is rough, dull brown in colour,
and not scored or furrowed.            It penetrated the soil to a depth of
 11 inches.      From experiments made by Professor Herschel it is
calculated that it struck the ground with a velocity of 412 feet per
second.     As it would acquire this velocity by falling freely through
half-a-mile, it is evident that little of the original planetary speed with
which it entered the atmosphere can have remained over.
   The stone contains 9'379 per cent, of nickel-iron, the composition
of which was found to be —

     The percentage of nickel is high ; but it is pointed out that in the
 nickel-iron present in meteoric stones the nickel rises in quantity as the
 quantity of nickel-iron falls. The remaining constituents consist of
 rocky matter, amounting to 90'621 per cent., and are soluble silicate
 548315 per cent. and insoluble silicate 36'306 per cent.             The soluble
 silicate appears to be an olivine of the form 2(8JEe,*Mg)0,Si02,               or
 one closely resembling that which occurs in the Lance stone, which
 fell July 13th, 1872, and was examined by Daubree.                 The insoluble
 part is chiefly bronzite, and most closely resembles that which is to be
 found in the meteorites of Iowa co., Iowa, east of Marengo, which
 fell 12th February, 1875, and were examined by Dr. L. Smith. The
 aluminium      constituent is doubtless labradorite, and is probably
 present as some of the occasional chondra which are seen in a micro
 scopic section.

    The apparatus previously used* by the author for following the
progress of the splash of liquid drops impinging on a solid plate has
been improved.      The main principle of the method by which succes
sive stages are isolated and rendered visible remains the same, viz.,
instantaneous illumination at any desired stage by means of the
primary spark of an induction coil ; but the timing of the illumination
is now effected by a timing-sphere let fall simultaneously with the
solid or liquid sphere whose impact is to be observed.               The timing-
sphere    strikes a  plate  whose   height     can    be  adjusted,  and  thereby
starts the mechanical action which results in the spark.

348                 On Impact with a   Liquid Surface.         [Feb.   16,
    The time interval between successive stages of the dist urbance can
be measured to within a few thousandths of a second.
    The significant portion of the whole series of changes in most of the
splashes observed is comprised within about one-third of a second.
The impact of both solid and liquid spheres has been studied, and is
illustrated by several series of drawings which accompany the paper.
    Milk drops falling into water were found to produce a similar
disturbance to that resulting from the impact of similar water drops,
and were used for the sake of distinguishing the original liquid of the
drop from that into which it fell. With a drop about o millims. in
diameter, falling from less than 1 metre, an annular rim is raised at
the first moment of impact, bounding a hollow which is afterwards
characterised    by regularly disposed radial ribs and arms, at the
bottom of which the drop descends, passing below the surface and
becoming completely submerged, to emerge again at the head of a
column of adherent liquid, but with its upper portion apparently
unwetted by the liquid with which it has been covered.       The column
then subsides, and the liquid of the original drop is seen to pass into
the well-known vortex ring which descends through the liquid.
    The influence of velocity of impact in modifying the phenomenon
is shown by the drawings.
    When the drop is large, and the fall considerable, the rim thrown
up takes the form of a hollow crater-like shell of liquid, the mouth of
which closes over the drop, imprisoning air which may remain as a
bubble on the surface.     This is the bubble seen when large rain drops
fall into water.     Observations of the bursting of this bubble confirm
incidentally  the explanation lately given by J. Plateau of the manner
of bursting of a soap bubble.
    The splash of a milk drop in petroleum and in olive oil is also
described.    The course of phenomena is very similar to that in water,
modified however by the greater or less mobility of the liquids in
question.
    The impact of solid spheres is then described.     The nature of the
disturbance produced, with a given velocity of impact, is found t6
depend entirely on the state of the surface of the sphere.
    A polished and perfectly dry sphere of ivory or marble 1 to 3
centims. in diameter, let fall from a height not exceeding 1 metre, is
apparently wetted at once, and is seen to be sheathed with liquid
before the whole is below the average level of the surface.          The
disturbance of the surface is very slight.
    The same sphere if rough or wet with the liquid in question, behaves
quite differently, making a very deep depression, similar at first to
that produced by a liquid drop, which finally becomes an almost
cylindrical column of air within the liquid, part of which afterwards
rises as bubbles while a portion descends in the wake of the sphere.

     The influence of roughness in hindering the spread of liquid over
 the surface of the impinging sphere is then pointed out.
     At the close of the paper an explanation is put forward of the radial
 ribs, arms, and striae which are a notable feature of all splashes.
 Measurements of the annular rim bordering a thin central film, into
 which a drop falling upon a plate passes,* show that the number of the
 lobes and arms which are subsequently observed, agrees well with the
 number of drops into which such an annulus would theoretically tend
 to split if unhindered by friction with the plate on which it rests,
 and it is then pointed out that the effect of the connecting film
 would be exactly such as to counteract the influence of this friction.
     In the same way the radial striae and ribs which characterise the
 hollow formed round a drop or solid sphere impinging on a liquid
 surface, are accounted for by the instability of the annular rim of the
 hollow, which through its tendency to cleave into a definite number of
 drops, determines a corresponding number of lines of easiest flow, at
 each of which a rib or arm is developed.
     The author has observed that after the details have been once

 to identify the broad features of any splash that may occur by
 attentive observation in continuous light.              Such observation may

    Three short notes relating some of the facts mentioned in this
research have been published in the
                                              " Proceedings," vol. 27, p. 369 ;
vol. 31, p. 326, and vol. 33, p. 11.
    The paper begins with a history of the views which have been
held as to the anatomy, physiology, and development of the thymus.
    The microscopical sections in many instances were double-stained
by haematoxylin, by using first a red and then a blue solution ; the
colours of the solutions depend on the alum used with the haematoxylin
extract.     The red solutions stain the protoplasm of the cells, the
connective-tissue, and the granular cells ; the blue, the lymphoid
corpuscles and the reticulum.
    In all mammals the thymus disappears at some period of adult life ;

 in the bird it disappears generally before adnlt life; in the reptile
and the fish it is found even in very large specimens, although in
 such cases it is in great measure transformed into connective-tissue.
    The fully developed gland is divided into lobes, lobules, and follicles;
the follicles, except in earliest embryonic life, are composed of cortex
 and medulla ; the follicles are generally attached to one another, either
 by cortical or by medullary tissue.
    When first developed the thymus is composed at its upper end of a
single tube, and below of a number of tubes, some of which are solid,
 the others hollow ; the cells in cross section of the tube vary from two
or three to many in number, and are epithelioid in character; the
lumen of the tube is at times closely packed with blood-corpuscles,
and appears to be a vessel. The follicle first grows by pushing out
 processes of epithelioid cells.   In a subsequent stage the connective-
 tissue (ensheathing the vessels which enter and leave the follicles)
 invades the follicles and divides them up ; at the same time the follicles
increase in size : there is thus an increase in the number of the
follicles, which are partially united to one another.
    The cortex when first formed is small, but in the fully developed
gland is more than twice as large as the medulla ; in involution the
outer part of the follicle disappears much the more rapidly of the
two. As fnrther the cortex is composed chiefly of cells (thymic corpus
cles), similar to those which are formed in the lymphatics of the
thymus, this portion is the more important.
    The blood-vessels are disposed in two rings, one of which surrounds
the follicle, the other lies just within the margin of the medulla ; the
cortex contains only fine vessels arranged in a radiating manner ; the
blood in these vessels flows chiefly to the inner circle of vessels.    The
centre of the medulla contains only few and fine vessels during growth
and the period of full development, but in involution there are many
more and larger vessels.     The blood-vessels met with in the invading
 processes  of connective-tissue  during involution are surrounded by an
adventitia of epithelioid cells, so that they look somewhat as if com
posed of proliferating endothelium ; this probably is not the case, as
their lumen is unaltered.
    There are no lymphatic vessels in the cortex of the follicle, although
perivascular sheaths are found on the vessels during the period of
involution.
    The cortex is composed in great measure of lymphoid cells, sup
ported by a delicate reticulum.     If sections of the cortex are shaken
a second retiform tissue is brought into view, i.e., a branched neticorl;
composed of finely branched cells, and of coarse threads; these
together form an adventitia to the vessels. This network of cells
is permanent, and is found in the thymus of adult animals when the
organ is undergoing involution.         In specimens stained in indigo

carmine and carmine, the network is stained         of a different colour to-
the reticulum.
    The network of the cortex is continuous with a network in the
metlulla ; in the latter situation, however, the cells are large and their
 processes are coarse.    There is a gradual transition between these last
and epithelioid connective-tissue      corpuscles ; and, further, in some
places   the  network  assumes  the  form  of multi-nucleated protoplasmic
 masses not differentiated into cells.    In the medulla but few lymphoid
cells and only traces of the reticulum are seen, but it contains con
centric corpuscles, giant cells, and numerous granular and epithelioid
cells.
    Granular cells are met with in the later period of embryonic life ;
they are not readily acted on by ordinary staining solutions ; their
 protoplasm resembles that of the giant cells of the medulla of bone.
 They are present in four forms: — (1) As polygonal or rounded
 epithelioid cells, the central part only of the cells being granular ; (2)
as vacuolated cells, the mass lying in the vacuole being granular ; (3) as
 spherical masses lying in cavities between the branching processes of
the connective-tissue corpuscles ; and (4) as rounded or club-shaped
masses attached (often by fibrillated extremities) to blood-vessels and
to newly formed connective-tissue.       The first form arises from epithe
lioid connective-tissue corpuscles, and gives origin to the Recond and
third varieties. The fourth variety forms fibrous tissue, and sometimes
 forms blood-vessels : the cells of this class are very similar in ap
pearance to certain cells (Bildungszellen) which have been described
by Ziegler and Tillmanns in pathological new formations.
    The giant cells arise in two ways, either from the fusion of several
granular cells, or from the branched protoplasmic network.
    The concentric corpuscles consist of a central mass and of a capsule ;
the central mass is at times found passing down the vessel-like pro
longations, which are attached to the concentric corpuscles ; the
capsule is formed of epithelioid cells ; these cells are anatomically
continuous with the branched connective-tissue corpuscles forming the
network ; the cells of the network around the concentric corpuscles
are larger than in other parts of the medulla.              The concentric
corpuscles are attached to one another by long coarse threads which
have nuclei imbedded in them, or by bands of fibrous tissue. They are
finally transformed into bands of fibrous tissue containing vessels.
The central part of the concentric corpuscles is never penetrated by
injection, although the outer part of the capsule often contains
 vessels, as the capsule of epithelioid cells in its growth may surround
a vessel.    The smaller concentric corpuscles are composed of one or
more granular cells, surrounded by epithelioid connective-tissue cor
puscles; they arise from these two sources.
   Ciliated epithelium is found lining cysts in the thymus of the dog.

352                The Minute Anatomy       of the Thymus.         |Feb. 16.
The cysts are formed by the vacuolation and degeneration of the
central cells of the small concentric corpuscles ; they are filled with
degenerated epithelium, or with haemoglobin masses.           The borders of
the cysts are at first formed of epithelioid cells, but there is a gradual
transition from these flattened cells to ciliated epithelium.
   The process of involution is very gradual ; the first steps are begun
in foetal life. The main factors are : — (1) The formation of fibrous
tissue within the follicle ; this arises by means of the granular cells,
of the giant cells, and of the connective-tissue corpuscles ; (2) the
increase in the inter-follicular connective-tissue, and the deposit of
plasma cells in this tissue ; the plasma cells are here the forerunners
of fat cells ; they are identical with many of the colourless cells of the
medulla of bone, and stain in a very characteristic manner in indigo-
carmine and carmine solutions ; (3) the invasion of the inter-follicular
connective-tissue and plasma cells into the follicle.       There is no fatty
degeneration of the cells of the thymus.
   There is considerable difference in size between the thymic corjmtcUt
and the colourless     blood-corpuscles in amphibia and reptiles, and still
greater difference in the bird and the fish.    The differences between the
thymus of birds, reptiles, and fishes, and that of mammals are also
pointed out in the paper.
   Haemoglobin is found in the thymus contained either in cysts, or in
cells which are situated near to, or form part of, the concentric
corpuscles.     The haemoglobin in the cells varies from granules to
masses exactly resembling colonred blood-corpuscles; these masses
are oval in the bird, reptile, and fish, but circular in all mammals
except the camel.
   The lymph issuing from the thymus was obtained by tying the
vessels ; it contains more colourless cells than do the large lymphatics
of the neck, and, in addition, contains cells inclosing haemoglobin in the
form of granules, or in masses resembling coloured blood-corpuscles.
   The physiological conclusions arrived at are : that the thymus forms
one source of colourless blood-corpuscles, and that the cells containing
haemoglobin masses form coloured blood-corpuscles.         This view is sup
ported by    the  inclosed  masses   being identical in  form  with, though
often smaller in size than, the colonred blood-corpuscles ; is further
supported by finding such cells in the lymphatics, in the blood, in the
lymphatic glands, the medulla of bone, and the spleen ; and is still
further supported by the development of the blood in the chick, anil
in the connective-tissue    of young mammals.

      by J. S. Burdon Sanderson, M.D., F.R.S. Received
      February 2, 1882.
                                 (Abstract.)
   The object of the experiments described in this paper is to demon
strate on the living nerves of man, alterations of excitability during
and after the passage of a galvanic current, and to determine how far
such alterations concord with the results obtained by Pfliiger and
other physiologists on the exsected frog's nerve.
   In order to subject the nerve to the influence of a " polarising "
current, and to test its excitability by means of induction currents, the
secondary coil is introduced into the galvanic circuit, so that the
points of entrance and exit of the two currents (galvanic and in
duced) coincide at the two electrodes.       One electrode, N, is applied
over the nerve, the other, F, to any distant part of the body.
   The density of the current which passes in the nerve is much
                    " polar " region
greater in the                          (that is, immediately under the
electrode N) than in the adjacent region, which may be termed the
" peri-polar " zone, and the authors' experiments go to prove that
these two regions are to be physiologically distinguished by the fact
that their electrotonic states are opposed.
   The authors observe that the excitatory effect of an induction
current is increased during the passage of a galvanic current in the
same direction, diminished during its passage in an opposite direction,
that the increase is greater when both currents are directed from F
to N than when both are directed from N to F, and that the diminution
is greater when the indnction current is from F to N and the galvanic
current from N to F than when these two currents flow in the reverse
direction.
   These results admit of a complete explanation, for which the
grounds are stated in the paper.      During the passage of the galvanic
current from F to N katelectrotonus is set up in the polar region
and anelectrotonus in the peri-polar region ; during the passage
of a galvanic current from N to F the polar region is in anelectrotonus,
the peri-polar in katelectrotonus. At the passage of the induction
current from F to N excitation is made in the polar region, at its
passage from N to F in the peri-polar region.
   Some subsidiary phenomena are discussed, and an experimental
proof is given of the physiological reality of the above changes.
   In addition to the induction current the authors have used the

 They   find that the effect of the make excitation     increased when       is                     it

 region, polar or peri-polar, and that increase and diminution are more
 marked in the case of the polar than that of the peri-polar region.
    They also tested the polar region b^ mechanical excitation, and
 obtained    evidence of increased    excitability at the kathode,                                  of
 diminished excitability at the anode.
    The authors have also observed " after-effects " of polarisation
 corresponding with the after-effects of electrotonus in the frog's nerve
 as described by Pfliiger.
    The experiments were for the most part made on the peroneal
 nerve, which was selected on account of its superficial course, and
 the facility with which the muscular responses could be recorded
 graphically.

   During the years 1877-78,                    I    conducted     a series of experiments on
the excretion of nitrogen by the skin.                          Some of the data then obtained
were communicated at the Dublin Meeting of the                               British   Association,
but    Ihave since extended the inquiry, and now beg to submit an
account of the investigations.
   The results obtained by various experiments as to the existence                                   of
nitrogen in the sweat have been contradictory.            Voit,* Eanke,*
Parkes,f and others, relying on indirect methods, have denied                                        its
existence, finding that the quantity excreted by the kidneys and
intestinal tract was equal to, and in some cases even exceeded, that
ingested, therefore leaving no room for any excretion by the skin.

 1882.]            On the    Excretion of Nitrogen by          the Skin.           355
 others who have analysed portions of the sweat collected by different
 methods have found nitrogen, though Schottin and Ranke failed to do
 so.    Funke, by his experiments upon- himself and his two pupils,
 published in 1858, not only found nitrogen in the sweat, but also
 proved its existence as urea, and was the first to make an estimation
 of the quantity excreted by the skin of the entire body in a given
 time. Adopting Schottin's method, he collected, by means of a
 caoutchouc sleeve, the sweat excreted by the arm in a given time ; and,
 having filtered, he estimated the quantity of nitrogen present by the
 combustion process.           Then, having established by measurement a
 ratio between the superficies of the arm and that of the entire body,
 he calculated the entire cutaneous excretion.                  Dr. Fleming,* adopt
 ing the same method, arrived at almost identical results.                     I  may
 add that Dr. Fleming's experiments were made subsequently to mine.
     In addition to the unsatisfactory character of all indirect proofs, the
 investigations of Voit, Ranke, f Paries, and others seem liable to a
 further objection, arising from the extreme difficulty of ascertaining
the exact quantity of nitrogen ingested.                  Again, as already noted by
 Parkes, the amount of nitrogen excreted, due to waste of animal
 tissue during the experiment, cannot be determined.                     These objec
tions seemed to me to make such negative results of doubtful value
npon this point; and Professor Parkes' conclusion that,
                                                                         " apart from
detached skin structures the balance of evidence is against the passage
of nitrogenous substances by the human skin," to my mind, at least,
required confirmation. As regards the direct evidence of nitrogen in
the sweat the researches of Funke, confirmatory of those of Anselmius,
Berzelius, Pavre, and others seemed to me to be conclusive on the point.
     Funke's method is the only one by means of which an estimation of
the entire cutaneous excretion in a given time has been made, and it
alone required re- examination. Funke's method seemed to me to be
open to the following amongst other objections : first, the uncertainty
attaching to the relative measurement of the superficies of the arm
and that of the entire body ; secondly, that arising from the two
underlying assumptions — (a) assumed equality of secretive power of
rest of body to that of arm, (6) assumed identity of chemical compo
sition of sweat from the arm with that excreted from the rest of
body. Considering these grave objections to Funke's method, and the
general uncertainty as to any nitrogen being excreted by the skin,                    I
determined, if possible, to ascertain the quantity of nitrogen excreted
by the entire skin in a given time without reference to measurement
or actual amount of fluid sweat excreted.

 I     shall now briefly state the mode of collecting the excretion which
I   adopted.     Having first tested the atmosphere of the ward in which        I
  was about to operate, to ascertain that         it  did not contain free am
 monia in any quantity,      I      placed upon one of my hospital beds an
  india-rubber sheet, and over        it  another sheet of pure linen, upon
 which the person experimented upon lay. Over his body was placed                a
 wooden cradle or canopy, covered outside with             athick felt, and lined
 inside with linen, which coverings were to be carefully adjusted round
 his neck.      To raise the temperature within the canopy              used the
                                                                        I
 lamp-fnrnace invented by the late Surgeon-Major Wyatt, the flue
 from which fitted accurately through a hole in the coverings guarded
 by a wooden ring.         Considering the spirit lamp of -Wyatt's furnace
 objectionable for many reasons,       I    substituted a Bunsen gas-burner.
  To insure the regular renewal of the air within the canopy, and                to
 prevent its saturation, as well as to collect any free ammonia which
might be evolved,     I      iutroduced a tube leading from         aBunsen air8
pump, which tube was connected with two glass towers filled with
 large glass beads, and charged with half an ounce of dilute hydro
chloric acid of known strength. Through another hole in the canopy
I   introduced   a    hydrometer, by which    I    was enabled to observe the
temperature, and calculate the degree of saturation of the atmosphere
within.      As the gas, water, and reagents employed contained some
small portion of nitrogen, my first task was to ascertain the constant
 error arising from this source. To effect this performed three blank
                                                       I
experiments,       omitting only the introduction of the person to               be
experimented upon.          The result was that obtained

and having a mean value of       0    064 grm., that being the total amount
collected in one hour under the experimental conditions.               The water
I   used was Yartry water,     it    being the water supply to my hospital,
and when     I    usedit    unfilteredI    employed the above number as          a
constant.      Asit     would be necessary when     I     wished to get rid      of
epithelium     to filter the  portion  of the bath   water I   took for analysis,
I   made three similar blank experiments, using filtered Vartry water,
and obtained another constant, amounting to 0'0408 grm. of nitrogen.
which I      used in all such experiments.          The method employed for
estimating the nitrogen will be described         later on. In the nine experi
ments in which       I    estimated the chlorides  I    took the precaution      of
finding the amounts of chlorides present in the Vartry water on that day,
as
 I      found the quantity of chlorides present in         it liable to periodic
variations.
I      now commenced a series of experiments upon myself, with the
assistance of my clinical clerk, Mr. Clune.              One of these       Ishall

loose epithelial scales, as well as minute fibres from the underclothing,

which      I
           always found adhering to the skin, and having noted my
poise, respiration, bodily weight, and temperature, I entered under
the canopy.* The coverings being carefully adjusted round my neck,
the gas furnace was lighted, the air-pump and hydrometer adjusted,
and the experiment continued for an hour, the time being carefully
noted.    Before leaving the canopy the pulso respiration and bodily
temperature were again noted, also the mean temperature and point
of saturation of the atmosphere within the canopy.      On leaving the
canopy     I
           got into a bath containing twenty litres of Vartry water,
acidulated with half an ounce of dilute hydrochloric acid of known
strength.      I took with me into the bath the linen sheet upon
which   I  had lain whilst under the canopy, and with it        gently           I
rubbed myself so as to remove any loose epithelial scales. On leaving
the bath I again weighed myself, and in twenty minutes after again                   I
noted my pulse, respiration, and bodily temperature.        caused the       I
linen and india-rubber sheets, as well as the towers containing the
dilute hydrochloric acid, to be washed in the water of the bath, and
then brought a specimen of it to my laboratory for analysis.       On two
occasions I analysed the contents of the towers separately and got
hardly a trace of ammonia with Nessler's test, proving, in these
instances, at least, that free ammonia was not given off by the skin.
The process of analysis of the water which I employed was briefly as
follows : — I carefully measured 100 cub. centims. and poured it into
a fractional distillation flask, which I altered to suit my purpose by
shortening and bending the side tube upwards towards the mouth.
I  now took a porcelain dish, in which                 I
                                                placed a small quantity of
pure sand, carefully cleansed by hydrochloric acid and subsequent
washing with distilled water, and moistened it with a drop of
strong, ammonia-free, sulphuric acid.       Having placed the dish upon a
water-bath,  I inverted  the  flask  into     and, properly suspending it,
                                                 it,
carefully evaporated the water as          gradually flowed into the dish.

 value and that afforded by the fluid containing suspended epithelium
 gave me the weight of the nitrogen present in the insoluble condition
 in the same portion of the bath-water. In the tabular statement                                  I
 have noted the instances in which this additional estimation was
 made.  I     may here note that       examined the deposit from the water

 trace of anything but epithelial scales.
    Funke, by the only two completed analyses which he made, found
 in one case 0'198 grm. and in another 0-2935 grm. of soluble nitrogen
 excreted by the entire skin in one hour. But           must be remembered,
                                                                  it

 soluble nitrogen excreted per hour        as low as 0-038 grm.
                                                   is              And find                I
that the mean result of all my direct experiments, upon healthy and
unhealthy subjects, gives 0'0824 grm. of soluble nitrogen collected
from the entire skin in one hour. The difference between Funke's
 and my results may be in part due to the circumstance that my
experiments were made upon the body in a state of rest, while
 Funke's were made under conditions of violent exercise, which                                    I,
accepting the views of Liebig, so strongly supported by the more recent
experiments of Professor Flint,* believe to be always accompanied                                 by
waste of animal tissue and consequent increased excretion of nitrogen.
With regard to Funke's estimation of the possible excretion                                       of
nitrogen per diem, amounting to as much as from 4'76 to 7"045 gnus.,
I  believe   itto be excessive.    He arrives at these result* by multiply
ing the quantity obtained in an hour by twenty-four, necessarily
assnming the constancy of the sweat secretion, which assumption                                   is
contradictory to the statement made in another part of his paper,                                 to
the effect that " in one or two hours the quantity of the supply begins
to diminish, even though the temperature and movement remain un-

altered, and falls to such a minimum     that one can scarcely perceive
the increase even during greater   intervals of time."
   I believe that under ordinary circumstances the excretion of
nitrogen by the skin is very small indeed, even in cases of gout
(Case D) and Bright's disease (Case B), in which I expected to find
it present in larger amount. This being so                      I
                                                   can now well under
stand how it was that Voit, Ranke, and Parkes, by their indirect
methods came to the conclusion that there was no such excretion, yet
I  do not deny that under extraordinary circumstances, such as those
mentioned by Leube,* Deininger,i Kanp and Jurgensen,J Taylor,§
Schottin,|| and others, crystals of urea may have been found upon the
skin. However, with the exception of the case of Leube there does
not appear sufficient evidence that adequate care was taken to ascertain
that the crystals found were really those of urea and not of other salts,
such as sodium chloride, crystals of which, as is well known, frequently
simulate those of other bodies.      I find that Leube notices this as
an objection to the researches of former experimenters, and te obviate
it he treated the mass removed from the skin with baryta-water and
absolute alcohol in the usual manner, and so undoubtedly proved the
presence of urea.   Dr. Taylor seems also to have proved the presence
of urea in the  " saline mass
                               " removed from the skin in a case of
uraemic   poisoning. Owing,     presume,  to I                   the        smallness   of the
quantities obtained, none of the above-named                   give the

with the exception of Kaup and Jurgensen, who state that they
obtained 8-4 grms. from the shirt worn by a choleraic patient.      My
method of collecting the cutaneous excretion afforded me an easy
means of ascertaining the quantity of sodium chloride excreted, and in
the table will be found the quantities obtained in nine experiments.
In five of these the amount excreted can be compared with that of
soluble nitrogen, and       will be seen that the quantity of sodium

The Bakerian Lecture on the "Chemical Theory of Gun
   powder," was delivered by Professor H. Debus, Ph.D., F.R.S.
   Received February 8, 1882.
   The following is an Abstract      : —
   1. Dr. Jebb* mentions a manuscript          as  existing at Oxford, entitled
" Liber
         igninm   ad comburendos       hostes,"   by Marcus Graecus, probably
written in the eighth century, wherein the preparation of gunpowder
is accurately described,     and Bellani reports that the English used
cannon at the Battle of Crecy.             Gunpowder, therefore, has been
known more than a thousand years, and its use for the purposes of
war more than five hundred, nevertheless, no chemical theory of the
combustion of gunpowder has hitherto been proposed which will
enable us to calculate the quantity of each of the chief products of
combustion from the known composition of a given weight of powder,
or the amount of heat generated during its metamorphosis.             A theory
which can solve these problems          I have the honour to submit in the
present paper   to  the Royal Society.
   2. The constituents of gunpowder— saltpetre, charcoal, and sulphur
— are transformed during combustion into the following products : —
Potassic carbonate, potassic sulphate, potassic disulphide, potassic
sulphocyanate, carbonic acid, carbonic oxide, nitrogen, sulphuretted
hydrogen, marsh-gas, ammonia, hydrogen, and water.
   The hydrogen compounds — sulphuretted hydrogen, ammonia, and
marsh-gas, the free hydrogen and potassic sulphocyanate — do not, as
a rale, amount together to more than about two per cent. of the
weight of the powder from which they have been produced ; and as
their formation is not the direct result of the reactions which cause
the explosion   of the powder, they are regarded as secondary products
and not considered in a discussion of the chemical metamorphosis of
                                                         i
gunpowder.
   Besides the potassium salts mentioned, potassic hyposnlphite has
been found as one of the constituents of the solid residue left by
powder after its explosion. According to experiments by the author,
which have been confirmed by Noble and Abel, this salt is formed in
considerable   quantities from potassic       sulphide during the analysis of
                   * Poggendorff, " Geschiohte der Physik," 87.

362                               Dr. H. Debus.                     [Feb. 23,
the residues according to Bunsen and Schischkoff's method ; and as it
is decomposed at 225° C., it cannot be considered as one of the chief
products of the combustion of gunpowder.
   3. With regard to the products, potassic carbonate, potassic sul
phate, potassic disulphide, carbonic acid, carbonic oxide, and nitrogen,
the following problems have to be solved : —
   (a.) To determine the reactions which cause the formation of these
substances and the order in which they succeed each other, and to
represent the complete combustion of gunpowder by one chemical
equation.
   (6.) To calculate from the known composition of a given weight of
powder the volume of gas and the amount of heat generated during
its combustion, and to ascertain the relative energies of powders of
different composition.
   The solution of each of these problems is described in the paper.
   4. Noble and Abel* describe the quantitative relations of the
products of combustion of a given weight of powder of known com
position in the following words : —
   "
     (a.) The proportions in which the several constituents of solid
powder residue are formed are quite as muoh affected by slight acci
dental variations in the conditions which attend the explosion of one
and the same powder in different experiments, as by decided differences
in the composition as well as in the size of grain of different powders.
   "
     (6.) The variations in the composition' of the products of explosion
furnished in close chambers by one and the same powder under diffe
rent conditions, as regards pressure, and by two powders of similar
composition under the same conditions, as regards pressure, are so
considerable, that no value whatever can be attached to any attempt
to give a general chemical expression to the metamorphosis of gun
powder of normal composition.
   "
     (c.) Any attempt to express, even in a comparatively complicated
chemical equation, the nature of the metamorphosis which a gun
powder of average composition may be considered to undergo, when
exploded in a confined space, would therefore only be calculated to
convey an erroneous impression as to the simplicity or the definite
nature of the chemical results and their uniformity under different
conditions, while it would, in reality, possess no important bearing
upon an elucidation of the theory of explosion of gunpowder. t
   "
     (d.) Very small-grain powder, such as F.G. and R.F.G., furnish
decidedly smaller proportions of gaseous products than a large-grain
powder, R.L.G. : while the latter again furnishes somewhat smaller
proportions than a still larger powder, P, though the difference
between the gaseous products of these two powders is comparatively
inconsiderable."

   Noble and Abel exploded successively portions of powder of the
same description in their apparatus, and found considerable fluctua
tions in the relative quantities of the products of explosion in different

have as much influence on the relative quantities of the constituents
of the solid powder residue as decided differences in the composition
of the different powders.     And as the exact nature of these " slight
accidental variations in the conditions which attend the explosion " is
not known, they conclude that the metamorphosis cannot be repre
sented by a chemical equation.
   The author of this abstract has described in the paper the causes of
the variations in the relative quantities of the products of explosion,
and has explained the experimental results of Messrs. Noble and
Abel. And further, he has been able, with this knowledge, to repre
sent the chemical metamorphosis     of the English Service powders by
an equation.
   5. Noble and Abel assume that the samples of fine-grain and pebble
powders used in their numerous experiments were, respectively, of the
same composition, and that the samples of R.L.G. powder employed
in their earlier experiments, had the composition given nnder " I,"
and those used in the later experiments that given under "    " in the     II

  The samples analysed by Noble and Abel were taken out of the

364                            Dr. H. Debus.                   [Feb.   23,
name barrel, the one   from the upper, the other from the lower parts.
These two samples showed a difference of no less than l854 per cent.
of the weight of the powder in the amount of carbon they contain, or
the weight of carbon is by one-seventh           greater in the second
than in the first sample.     Mr. Wills found 1*81 per cent. of sulphur
less than Noble and Abel in the same description of powder. Such
differences in the composition of samples of powder of the same
nature, together with the usual errors attaching to complicated and
difficult analytical operations, are almost sufficient to explain the
variations in the proportions of the products of the combustion of
gunpowder, as found by Messrs. Noble and Abel, without requiring
a theory like the one proposed by M. Berthelot for that purpose.
   6. Noble and Abel analysed the products of explosion by means of
Bnnsen and Schischkoff's method.         The author has proved that by
the treatment of the solid powder residue according to this method
a portion of the potassic sulphide is converted into potassic hypo
sulphite, and under certain conditions into potassic sulphate. The
quantities of the two salts so produced vary in different experi
ments.    Hence, the fluctuations observed by Noble and Abel in the
relative quantities of potassic sulphide, potassic sulphate, and potassic
hyposulphite are partly, if not entirely, due to the method of analysis.
Potassic hyposulphite is decomposed at temperatures above 225° ; from
this fact, as well as from a comparison of the oxygen in the original
powder with that of the products of explosion, it follows that the
potassic hyposulphite found in powder residues must be regarded as
the product of the analytical method.
   7. It is well known that the higher sulphides of potassium attack
metals with great energy at a white heat.      Noble and Abel exploded
their powders in a hermetically closed steel cylinder at high pressures,
and the products remained after explosion from one to two minutes in
a fluid condition at a white heat in contact with the iron of the
apparatus.    These products contain potassic disulphide. The descrip
tion given by Noble and Abel of their solid powder residues indicates
that they contain ferrous sulphide. The absorption of a portion of
 the sulphur by the iron will increase the amount of potassic carbonate
and diminish the quantities of potassic sulphate and disulphide.       The
quantity   of sulphur  so uniting with  iron depends on pressure,  time  of
cooling, and other conditions, and will vary in different experiments.
We have then in the formation of ferrous sulphide another cause of
the fluctuation in the quantities of the products of explosion observed
by Messrs. Noble and Abel.
   8. It follows from the statements given under Nos. 5, 6, and 7, that
 there is no reason to assume that the chemical metamorphosis of gun
powder cannot be represented by an equation.
    9. Noble and Abel calculate the total weight of the solid     residue,

 1882.]               Chemical Theory   of Gunpowder.                  3(35
 which a given weight of powder can produce by its explosion, from the
 composition of a portion of the residue and the composition of the
 powder.      They assume that the portions of powder of the same
 description used in different experiments, were of the same compo
 sition. This is, according to the statements under No. 5, not the case.
 The calculated quantities of gas and solid residue which a given
 weight of powder can produce, will, in consequence, be affected by
 certain errors. These errors compensate each other if the mean of
 many experiments is taken.
    10. Portions of powder taken from different parts of the same
 barrel show, according to Noble and Abel's analyses, greater diffe
 rences in their composition than samples of different descriptions
 manufactured at Waltham Abbey, pebble, rifle fine-grain, rifle large-
grain, and fine-grain powder ; hence, we are justified in taking the
 mean of the analyses of these powders, and expressing thereby the
 composition of the English Service powder. The mean of the analyses
 of Noble and Abel, and Wills, can be represented by the symbols —
                          16KN03 + 2M8C + 6-63S,
 if  hydrogen, oxygen, and ash of the charcoal, and the hygroscopic
 moisture of the powder are neglected.
    11. From evidence described in the paper it follows, with a high
 degree of probability, that during the combustion         of gunpowder
potassic disulphide,    and   not monosulphide,  as is usually assumed, is
formed.
     12. If the errors arising from the analytical method are corrected as
 explained in the paper, if allowance is made for the sulphur which has
 united with the iron of the apparatus, and, finally, if, for the reasons
 adduced under No. 9, the mean is taken of the thirty-one analyses
 published by Noble and Abel, then the explosion of the powders of
Waltham Abbey, as conducted by Noble and Abel in a confined space,
can be represented very nearly, if not quite accurately, by the follow
ing equation : —
lGKiSr03 + 21C+5S = 5K2COs + KoS04+2K3S2 + 13COS!-|-3CO + 8N,
                                                                       (2).
    l-63 atoms of the sulphur contained in the powder have united
partly with hydrogen and formed sulphuretted hydrogen, partly with
iron and produced ferrous sulphide. The entire amount of the oxygen
contained in the charcoal is eliminated with hydrogen as water, the
rest of the hydrogen either remains free or produces methane with
carbon and ammonia with nitrogen. The composition of the powder,
calculated from the mean composition of the products of explosion of
thirty-one experiments, can be represented by the symbols
                          16KN03 + 21-35C + 6-62S,

which are almost identical with

representing the mean composition of the powders found by direct
analysis.
   13. An increase of pressure during combustion appears to diminish
the amount of carbonic oxide, and, in consequence,          according to
equation    8, to increase the quantities of potassic carbonate,  potassic
disnlphide, and carbonic acid.      These fluctuations in the quantities
of the products of combustion are, however, very small, and maybe
neglected without serious error.
   14. Craig had asserted that the nature of the products of explosion
of gunpowder depended on the pressure developed during combustion.
Karolyi, in order to test this assertion, made experiments with Austrian
Service powder, and arrived at the conclusion that pressure had no
influence on the quality or quantity of the products famished by these
powders.
   The experimental results of Karolyi, and the differences between
these results and those obtained    by Noble and Abel, have enabled the
author to develop a chemical theory of gunpowder competent to
explain the observations of Bunsen and Schischkoff, Linck, Karolyi,
Noble, and Abel, and other investigators, and which is in harmony
with the thermochemical relations of the reacting substances.
   According to this theory the combustion of gunpowder takes place
in two stages, one succeeding the other.       The reactions of the first
stage cause the explosion of the powder. Gunpowders which differ con
siderably in their composition are transformed during the first stage
according to the equation
        10KNO8 + 8C + 3S=2K2CO3 + 3K2SO4+6COa+5N2               .  .   (3),
but  as it is probable that at the same time some carbonic oxide    is pro
duced, the following would more correctly represent the reactions :—
    16KN03 + 13C + 5S=3K2C03 + 5K2S04+9C02 + CO + 8N2              .   (4),
     The constituents of the powder, and those of the products of com
bustion are, according to equation 4, nearly in the same ratios as they
are according to 3.
    During the first stage of the combustion potassic disnlphide is n8
formed.
    The oxygen of the potassic carbonate, potassic sulphate, and the
carbonic acid, as represented by equation 3, stand to each other in the
most simple possible ratios, if these substances are to be prodnced by
the combustion of a mixture of saltpetre, carbon, and sulphur. In
other words, equation 3 represents the most simple distribution of the
oxygen of the decomposed saltpetre amongst the products of combos

 1882.]              Chemical Theory     of Gunpowder.                 307
 tion produced during the first stage. And because these products are,
according to equation 4, nearly in the same relative proportions as
 they are according to 3, it follows that the distribution of the oxygen
of   the saltpetre  between   potassic  sulphate, potassic carbonate,  and
 carbonic acid, as required by equation 4, corresponds nearly to the
 most simple ratios which can exist under the conditions of the experi
 ments.
    The oxygen of the potassic carbonate stands to the oxygen of
 the potassic sulphate and of the carbonic acid, according to equa
 tion  3, as
                                 1:2:2.
    If a mixture of saltpetre, carbon, and sulphur shall produce, by ita
combustion, the greatest possible amount of heat, and if at the same
 time the products — potassic sulphate, potassic carbonate, and carbonic
acid — shall be formed in such proportions that the heat of formation
 of one shall stand to the heat produced by each of the other two in the
 most simple ratio possible, then the combustion must take place
 according to equation 4.
    The heat developed by the formation of potassic carbonate stands
to that furnished by potassic sulphate and carbonic acid respec
 tively  as
                                  1  : 2 05,
and                               1  : 104.
if  the powder is transformed according to equation 4.
    The relations between the quantities of oxygen in the chief products
of combustion and those of the heat produced by their formation are,
from a theoretical point of view, of the greatest interest.
    15. Gunpowder, as a rule, contains more carbon and sulphur than
is required by equations 3 and 4.
    The carbon left free at the end of the first stage of the combustion
now acts on the potassic sulphate, formed during this stage, according
to the equation
                  4KgS04+7C=2K2COs + 2K3S2 + 5C02.           .  .   . (6),
and the free sulphur upon potassic carbonate      according to
                   4K3CO3 + 7S = K3SO4+3K3S3 + 40O2.         .  .  .  (5),
and some of the free carbon reduces carbonic acid to oxide.
    These reactions constitute the second stage of the combustion of
gunpowder ; they are eudothermic, heat is not evolved but is rendered
latent ; they are not of an explosive nature, and, in practice, are prob
ably seldom complete.      During the second stage of the combustion
the temperature of the products of explosion is diminished and the
volume of the gas is increased.

as the general equation  of the complete combustion of gunpowder.
   By means of this equation the chief products of combustion—
potassic carbonate, potassic sulphate, potassic disulphide, and car
bonic acid — can be calculated from that portion of a given weight of
powder which transforms itself into these products.
   The correctness of the equation is proved by the agreement of the
calculated numbers with those observed by Bunsen and Schischkoff,
Linck, and Karolyi in their experiments on the explosion of gun
powder, and also with the corrected mean numbers derived from
Noble and Abel's investigation.

given weight of powder, if calculated according to equation (8), ia
not affected to more than from one to two per cent. if we put a=0,
and in doing so we gain a considerable simplification of the equation.
If V represents the volume of gas evolved by the combustion of a
quantity of powder containing 16 molecules of saltpetre, y atoms of
carbon, and z atoms of sulphur, and W the units of heat developed
by the same weight of powder, we have, on the assumption that
a=0,

                    1 6KN03  + 200=8^008 + 12C02 + 8N2,
and finally, the sides whose eqnations      are (14)  and (15), intersect  in
point y =24 and z=16, hence
                1 6KN03    + 240 + 1 6S = 8K^S2 + 24C02 + 8N2.
    The geometrical     construction of the co-efficients of equation (13)
possesses the great advantage of indicating by the co-ordinates of the
points of a triangle the composition of the infinite number of mixtures
of saltpetre, carbon, and sulphur which can transform themselves
during combustion according to equation (13), and enables us to
deduce geometrically. as is shown in the paper, the qualitative nature
and the quantitative relations of the products of combustion, as well
as the volume of gas and          the amount of heat     developed by   each
mixture.
    (20.) It is proved in the paper that the composition of a powder
which can transform itself during combustion according to equation
(13), and for which E in equation (11) shall be a maximum, is in
dicated by the co-ordinates of the point of intersection of the sides
of the triangle represented by the equations (14) and (15).
    If, therefore, such quantities of powders of different composition
are compared, which contain 16 molecules of saltpetre, the one com
posed of 16KN03 + 24C + 16S will possess the greatest energy.
     (21.) If E is calculated for equal weights of two powders of different
composition,      the difference of the values of E is found to be very
small, if the powders contain from 21 to 24 atoms of carbon, and
from 8 to 16 atoms of sulphur for every 16 molecules of saltpetre.
Equal weights of the two mixtures
                              I6KNO3+22C + 8S,
 and                          16KN03 + 24C + 16S,
 give for E [equation (11)] the values 16884 and 16-95 respectively.
 If,  therefore, a mixture of saltpetre, carbon, and sulphur is required,
 which shall possess the greatest or nearly the greatest amount of
 energy, and at the same time contain the smallest amount of carbon
 and sulphur compatible with this condition, theory would point to the
 mixture
                               16KN03 + 22C + 8S.
      The gunpowders of most nations fluctuate about
                             16KN03+2182C + 688S,
 which numbers are very near those required by theory.

      as the ' Salmon Disease.'               By Professor T. H. Huxley,
      LL.D., F.R.S. Received February 21, 1882.
   For some years, an epidemic            disease,    followed by a very large
number of deaths, has been observed to prevail among the salmon of
certain Scottish and British rivers, from the Tay,* on the north, as far
as the Conway on the south.
    The first obvious symptom       of the malady is the appearance of one
or more greyish patches upon the skin of parts of the body which
are not covered with scales, such as the top and sides of the head, the
adipose fin, and the soft skin at the bases of the other fins.
    Such a patch, when it first attracts attention, may be as big as a
sixpence.    It is nearly circular, with a well defined margin and a some
what raised softer centre, from which faint ridges radiate towards the
circumference. It is important to observe that a single small patch
of this kind may be seen on the skin of a fish which, in all other
respects, is perfectly healthy, and when there is no indication that the
skin has ever been bruised or abraded in the place occupied by the
patch. The patch, once formed, rapidly increases in size and becomes
confluent with any other patches which may have appeared in its
neighbourhood. The marginal area, as it extends over the adjacent
healthy skin, retains its characters ; but the central part undergoes an
important change.        It takes on the consistency of wet paper, and can
be lifted up in soft flakes, as if it were a slongh, from the surface of
the derma or true skin, which it covers.                In fact, it is obvious that
this papyraceous substance has taken the place of the epidermis, so
that the sensitive and vascular true skin is deprived of its natural
protection. As the patch spreads, the true skin beneath the central
papyraceous slough ulcerates and an open bleeding sore is formed,
¦which may extend down to the bone, while it passes outwards into
burrowing sinuses.
   When the disease has reached this stage it obviously causes great
irritation. The fish dash about and rub themselves against stones,
and thus, in all probability, aggravate the evils under which they suffer.

   One vast open sore may cover the top of the head from the snout to
  the nape, and may extend over the gill covers.              The edges of the fins
  become ragged       ; and, sometimes,      the skin which invests them is so
  completely     frayed away that the fin-rays stand out separately.
       Although the affection of the skin appears, usually, if rot invari
  ably, to commence in the scaleless parts of the body, it does not stop
  there, but gradually spreads over the whole of the back and sides of
  the fish, though I have not yet seen a specimen in which it covered the
  whole ventral surface.        The disease extends into the mouth, especially
  affecting    the delicate   valvular  membrane attached to the inner sides
  of the upper and the lower jaws. It is said to attack the gills, but
  there has been no sign of it on these organs in any fish which I have
  had the opportunity of examining.
      Fish which succumb to the disease become weak and sluggish,
 seeking the shallows near the banks of the river, where they finally
 die.
      The flesh of a salmon affected by this disease presents no difference
 in texture or colour from that of a healthy fish ; and those who have
 made the experiment declare that the flavour is just as good in the
 former case as in the latter. So far as my observations have gone the
 viscera may be perfectly healthy in the most extensively diseased fish ;
 and there is no abnormal appearance in the blood.
      It is known that a disease similar to that described is occasionally
 prevalent among salmon in North America and in Siberia ; and                    I do
 not see any ground for the supposition that it is a novelty in British
 rivers. But public attention was first directed to it in consequence of
 its ravages in the Solway district a few years ago ; and, in 1879, a
 Commission was appointed by Sir Richard Cross, then Home Secretary,
to inquire into the subject.
     The evidence taken by the Commissioners* leaves no room for doubt
that the malady is to be assigned to the large and constantly in
creasing class of diseases which are caused by parasitic organisms.                It
is a contagious and infectious disease of the same order as ringworm
in the human subject, muscardine among silkworms, or the potato
disease among plants ; and, like them, is the work of a minute fungus.
In fact, the Saprolegnia which is the cause of the salmon disease is an
organism in all respects very closely allied to the Peronospora, which
is the cause of the potato disease.
     It is a very curious circumstance,        however,     that while the Perono-
sporce     are always parasites — that is to say, depend altogether upon

 living plants for their support — the Saprolegnice are essentially sapro
phytes ; that is to say, they ordinarily derive their nourishment from
 dead animal and vegetable matters, and are only occasionally parasites
upon living organisms.        In this respect they resemble the Bacteria, if
 the results of   recent  researches, which tend to show that pathogenic
bacteria are mere modifications of saprogenic forms, are to be ac
 cepted.
    As  I   have said, I  do not think    that the evidence laid before the
 Commission of 1879 can leave any doubt as to the causation of the
salmon disease on the minds of those who are acquainted with the
history of the analogous diseases in other animals and in plants.
Nevertheless, this evidence, valuable as it is, suggests more questions
than it answers, and in November, 1881, hearing that the disease had
broken out in the Conway,          I  addressed myself to the attempt to
answer some of these.
    It was already known that when the papyraceous slough-like sub
stance which coats the skin of a diseased salmon is subjected to
microscopic examination, it is found to be a mycelium, or fungus-turf,
composed of a felt- work of fine tubular filaments or hyplim, many of
which are terminated by elongated oval enlargements, or zoosporangia.
Within these the protoplasm breaks up into numerous spheroidal par
ticles, each less than -j-uVo of an inch in diameter. These, the zoospores,
are set free through an opening formed at the apex of the zoosporangium,
and become actively or passively dispersed through the surrounding
water. Herein lies the source of the contagiousness or infectiousness
of the disease. For any one of these zoospores, reaching a part of the
healthy skin of the same or of another salmon, germinates and soon
gives rise to a mycelium similar to that from which it started.
    But   I  could find no satisfactory information as to the manner in
which the fungus enters the skin, how far it penetrates, the exact
nature of the mischief which it does, or what ultimately becomes of
it ; nor was the identity of the pathogenic Saprolegnia of the salmon
with that of any known form of saprogenic Saprolegnia demonstrated.
It appeared to me, however, to be useless to attempt to deal with the
disease until some of these important elements of the question were
determined.
    To this end, in the first place, I made a careful examination of the
minute structure of both the healthy and diseased skin, properly
hardened and cut into thin sections ; and, in the second place,      I tried
some experiments        on  the transplantation of the Saprolegnia of the
living salmon to dead animal bodies. Perhaps it will conduce to
intelligibility if I narrate the results of the latter observations first.
    The body of a recently killed common house-fly was gently rubbed
two or three times over the surface of a patch of the diseased skin of a
 salmon and was then placed in a vessel of water, on the surface of which

384                 Prof. T." H. Huxley.           Pathology    of the       [Mar.    2.
it  floated,  in consequence of the large quantity of air which a fly's body
contains.      In the course of forty-eight hours, or thereabouts, innumer
able white cottony filaments made their appearance, set close side by
side, and radiated from the body of the fly in all directions.               As these
filaments     had approximately the same length, the fly's body thus
became inclosed in a thick white spheroidal shroud, having a diameter
of as much as half an inch. As the filaments are specifically heavier
than water, they gradually overcome the buoyancy of the air contained
in the tracheae of the fly, and the whole mass sinks to the bottom of
the vessel. The filaments are very short when they are first discernible,
and usually make their appearance where the integument of the fly
is softest, as between the head and thorax, upon the proboscis, and
between the rings of the abdomen. These filaments, in their size, their
structure, and the manner in which they give rise to zoosporangia and
zoospores are precisely similar to the hyphffi of the salmon fungus;
and the characters of the one, as of the other, prove that the fungus
is a Saprolegnia and not an Achhja. Moreover, it is easy to obtain
evidence that the body of the fly has become infected by spores swept
off by its surface when it was rubbed over the diseased salmon skin.
These spores have in fact germinated, and their hyphae have perfo
rated the cuticle of the fly, notwithstanding its comparative density,
and have then ramified outwards and inwards, growing at the expense
of the nourishment snpplied by the tissues of the fly.
    This experiment, which has been repeated with all needful checks,
proves that the pathogenic Saprolegnia of the living salmon may
become an ordinary saprogenic Saprolegnia ; and, per contra, that the
latter may give rise to the former ; and they lead to the important
practical conclusion that the cause of salmon disease may exist in all
waters in which dead insects, infested with Saprolegnia}, are met with ;
that is to say, probably in all the fresh waters of these islands, at one
time or another.
    On the other hand, Saprolegnia has never been observed on decaying
bodies in salt water, and there is every reason to believe that, as a
saprophyte, it is confined to fresh waters.*
    Thus it becomes, to say the least, a highly probable conclusion that
we must look for the origin of the disease to the Saprolegnia; which
infest dead organic bodies in our fresh waters.                    Neither pollution,
drought, nor overstocking will produce the disease if the Saprolegnia
is absent. The most these conditions can do is to favour the develop
ment or the diffusion of the materies morbi where the Saprolegnia
 already exists.
    Having infected dead flies with the salmon Saprolegnia, once from
    • So far as I  know, there is only one case on record of the appearance of a fungus
 on a fish in salt water, and in this case it is not certain that the fungus was 3

 Conway and once from Tweed fish,* was enabled to propagate it from
 these flies to other flies, and, in this manner, to set up a sort of garden
 of Saprolegnim.      And having got thus far, I fancied it would be an
 easy task to determine the exact species of the Saprolegnia with which
 I was dealing, from the abundant data furnished by the works of
 Pringsheim, De Bary, and others, who have so fully studied these
 plants when cultivated on the same materials.            For this purpose, it
 was necessary to obtain the oosporangia ; and, in ordinary course, these
 should have made their appearance on my Saprolegnioe in five or six
 days.    Unfortunately, in the course of cultivations continued over two
 months, nothing of the kind has taken place.              Zoosporangia have
 abounded in the ordinary form and also in that known as " dictyo-
 sporangium," but, in no instance, have any oosporangia appeared. After
 a few days of vigorous growth, the zoosporangia become scanty, and
 the fnngus takes on a torulose form, segments of the hyphae becoming
 swollen and then detached as independent " gemmae," which may
 germinate.     Sometimes the gemmra are spheroidal and terminal, and
 closely  simulate   oosporangia.
    Although, therefore, I have very little doubt that the Saprolegnia of
 the salmon is one of the forms of the " S. ferax group " of Pringsheim
and De Bary,     I  have, at present, no proof of the fact.
    Another very curious and unexpected peculiarity of the salmon
 Saprolegnia, both on the fish and when transmitted to flies, so far as
my observations have hitherto gone, is that locomotive                 ciliated
zoospores do not occur.       I once saw one which exhibited a very slight
 motion for a few minutes after it left the zoosporangium ; but
although thousands must have passed under my notice, with the ex
 ception to which I have referred, they have always been perfectly
 quiescent and not unfrequently in different stages of germination.
 Whether the season of the year, or the conditions under which my
saprolegnised flies were placed, have anything to do with the non
appearance of oosporangia and of locomotive zoospores in them                 I
cannot say. But it is certain that the Saprolegnia ferax which com
monly appears upon dead flies and other insects normally develops
both oosporangia and locomotive zoospores in abundance.
                                                   I
    From such notices by other observers as can gather, oosporangia
appear to be of very rare occurrence in the Saprolegnia of the salmon
itself. Mr. Stirling mentions that he has met with them only four
times. With respect to locomotive zoospores,           I  can find no positive
evidence    that  they  have  been  regularly,  or even  frequently, observed
in the salmon Saprolegnia.        But these points require careful investi
gation on freshly taken diseased fish.
    Whether the zoospores are actively locomotive or not, they are quite

free when they emerge from the zoosporangia ; and, from their extreme
minuteness, they must be readily carried away and diffused through
the surrounding water.       Hence, a salmon entering a stream inhabited
by   the Saprolegnia  will  be exposed to the chance of coming into con
tact with Saprolegnia spores ; and the probability of infection, otler
things being alike, will be in proportion to the quantity of the
growing Saprolegnia, and the vigour with which the process of spore-
formation is carried on. At a very moderate estimate, a single fly
may bear 1,000 fruiting hyphae ; and if each sporangium contains
twenty zoospores, and runs through the whole coarse of its develop
ment in twelve hours, the result will be the production of 40,000
zoospores in a day, which is more than enough to furnish one zoo
spore to the cubic inch of twenty cubic feet of water.         Even if we
halve this rate of production, it is easy to see that the Saprolegnia
on a single fly might furnish spores enough to render such a
small shallow stream as salmon often ascend for spawning purposes,
dangerous for several days.        But a large fully diseased salmon may
have as much as two square feet of its skin thickly covered with
Saprolegnia.      If we allow only ],000 fruiting hyphae for every
square inch, we shall have 288,000 for the whole surface, which,
at the same rate as before, gives over 10,000,000 spores for a day's
production, or enough to provide a spore to every cubic foot of
a mass of water 100 feet wide and 5 feet deep and four miles long.
Forty such diseased salmon might furnish one spore to the gallon for
all the water of the Thames (380,000,000 gallons per diem) which
flows over Teddington Weir.          But two thousand diseased salmon
have been taken out of a single comparatively insignificant river in
the course of a season.
    It will be understood that the above numerical estimate of the pro
ductivity of Saprolegnia, has been adopted merely for the sake of
illustration ; that I do not intend to suggest that the zoospores are
evenly distributed through the water into which they are discharged
by the zoosporangia ; and that allowance must be made for the very
short life of those zoospores which do not speedily reach an appro
 priate nidus. Nevertheless,      the conclusion   remains arithmetically
certain that every diseased salmon adds immensely to the chances of
infection of those which are not diseased ; and thus, the policy of
extirpating every diseased fish as soon as possible, has ample justifi
cation.     But. in practice, the attempt to stamp out the disease in this
fashion would be so costly that it may be a question whether it is not
better to put up with the loss cansed by the malady.
    There are many practical difficulties in the way of directly observing
the manner in which the zoospores effect their entrance into the skin
of the fish ; but, on comparing the structure of the healthy integument
 with that of the diseased patches, the manner of the operation can

 readily be divined. The skin of the head of a salmon, for example,
 presents a thin superficial cellular epidermis covering the deep
 fibrous and vascular derma.     The epidermic cells are distinguishable,
as in fishes in general, into a deep, a middle, and a superficial layer.
 In the first, the cells are vertically elongated, in the second more
rounded and polygonal, in the third flattened.       Many of the cells of
the middle layer are of the nature of "mucous cells." They enlarge
and become filled with a mucous secretion ; and, rising to the surface,
burst and discharge their contents, which give rise to the mucous
fluid with which the fish's body is covered.        The openings of these
 " mucous cells " remain
                           patent for some time and are to be seen in
thin vertical sections. The hyphae of the spores which attach them
selves to the fish may enter by these openings, but even if they do
not, the flattened superficial cells certainly offer no greater resistance
than does the tough cuticle of a fly. However this may be, sections
of young patches of diseased skin show that the hyphae of the fungus
not only traverse the epidermis, but bore through the superficial
layer of the derma for a distance, in some cases, of as much as one-
tenth of an inch.        Each hypha thus comes to have a stem-part,
which lies in the epidermis, and a root-part, which lies in the derma.
Each of these elongates and branches out. The free ends of the
stem-hyphae rise above the surface of the epidermis and become con
verted into zoosporangia, more or fewer of the spores of which
attach themselves to the snrrounding epidermis and repeat the pro
cess of penetration.       Thus the epidermis and the derma become
traversed by numerous hyphae set close side by side. But, at the same
time, these hyphas send off lateral bcanches which spread radially,
forcing asunder the middle and deeper layers of the epidermic cells,
and giving rise to the radiating ridges which are visible to the naked
eye in the peripheral part of the patch.      The force of the growth of
the hyphae which traverse the epidermis, is made obvious by the
curious manner in which, when the central tract of a patch is teased
out, the distorted epidermic cells are seen adhering to     it,   if
                                                                 as    they
were spitted upon it.
    In the derma, the root-hyphae branch out, pierce the bundles of
connective tissue, and usually end in curiously distorted extremities.
    The effect of the growth of the stem-hyphae       is    to destroy the
epidermis altogether. Its place   is  taken by a thick, felted, mycelium,
which entangles the minute particles of sand which are suspended in
the water, and thus no doubt constitutes     a  very irritating application
to the sensitive surface of the true skin.
    In the true skin, the tracks of the root-hyphae are not accompanied
by any obvious signs of inflammation, but the hyphae are so close set,
that they cannot fail to interfere with the nutrition of the part, and
thus bring about necrosis and sloughing.          Such sloughing in fact

gradually takes place, small vessels give way and bleed, and the
burrowing sore, which is characteristic of the advanced stages of the
disease, is produced.
   The skin of the head may thus be eaten away down to the bone
aDd gristle of the skull, but       I  have not observed the fungus to
enter these.     On the scaly part of the skin, the fungus burrows in the
superficial and in the deep layer of the pouches of the scales, but I
have not observed the scales themselves to be perforated.
   When   I  found that the fungus penetrated the true skin, and thus
gained access to the lymphatic spaces and blood-vessels, it became a
matter of great interest to ascertain whether the hyphae might not
break up into toruloid segments (as in the case of the Empusa muscoe),
and thus give rise to general septic poisoning, or fungoid metastasis.
However, I have never been able to find any indication of the occur
rence of such a process.
   But a very important practical question arises out of the discovery
that the fungus penetrates into the derma.        There is much reason to
believe, that if a diseased salmon returns to salt water, all the fungus
which is reached by the saline fluid is killed, and the destroyed
epidermis is repaired.    But the sea water has no access to the hyphae
which have burrowed into the true skin ; and hence it must be
admitted to be possible, that, in a salmon which has become to all
appearance healed in the se"a, and which looks perfectly healthy when
it ascends a river, the remains of the fungus in the derma may break
out from within, and the fish become diseased without any fresh
infection. It has not infrequently been observed, that salmon in their
upward course became diseased at a surprisingly short distance from
the sea, and it is possible that the explanation of the fact is to be
sought in the revival of dormant Saprolaynia, rather than in new
infection. It is to be hoped, that experiments, now being carried on at
Berwick, will throw some light on this point, as well as upon the
asserted efficacy of sea water in destroying the fungus which it
reaches.
   These are the chief results of this season's observations on the
salmon   disease.    Incomplete as they are, they appear to me to justify
the following conclusions : —
   1. That the Saprolegnia attacks the healthy living salmon exactly
in the same way as it attacks the dead insect, and that it is the sole
cause of the disease, whatever circumstances may, in a secondary
manner, assist its operations.
   2. That death may result without any other organ than the skin being
attacked, and that, under these circumstances, it is the consequence
partly of the exhaustion of nervous energy by the incessant irritation
of the felted mycelium with its charge of fine sand, and partly of the
drain of nutriment directly and indirectly caused by the fungus.

1882.]             On  the  Conservation of Solar Energy.             389
   3.   That the penetration of the hyphae of the Saprolegnia into the
derma renders it at least possible that the disease may break ont in a
fresh-run salmon without re-infection.
   4. That the cause of the disease, the Saprolegnia, may flourish in
any fresh water, in the absence of salmon, as a saprophyte upon dead
insects and other animals.
    5. That the chances of infection for a healthy fish entering a river,
are prodigiously increased by the existence of diseased fish in that
river, inasmuch as the bulk of Saprolegnia' on a few diseased fish
vastly exceeds that which would exist without them.
    6. That, as in the case of the potato disease, the careful extirpation
of every diseased individual is the treatment theoretically indicated ;
though, in practice, it may not be worth while to adopt that treat
ment.
II.    " On the Conservation of Solar Energy." By C. William
        Siemens, D.C.L., LL.D., F.R.S., Mem. Inst. C.E.         Received
        February 20, 1881.
    The question of the maintenance of Solar Energy is one that has
been looked upon with deep interest by astronomers and physicists
from the time of La Place downward.
    The amount of heat radiated from the sun has been approximately
computed, by the aid of the pyrheliometer of Pouillet and by the acti-
nometers of Herschel and others, at 18,000,000 of heat units from every
square foot of his surface per hour, or, put popularly, as equal to the
heat that would be produced by the perfect combustion every thirty-
six hours of a mass of coal of specific gravity=l85 as great as that of
our earth.
    If  the snn were surrounded by a solid sphere of a radius equal to
the mean distance     of the sun from the earth (95,000,000 of miles),
the whole of this prodigious amount of heat would be intercepted ;
but considering that the earth's apparent diameter as seen from the
sun is only seventeen seconds, the earth can intercept only the
2,250-millionth part.      Assuming that the other planetary bodies swell
 the intercepted heat by ten times this amount, there remains the
 important fact that MioGWotf of the solar energy is radiated into
space, and apparently lost to the solar system, and only -tst>66c>6o
 utilised.
    Notwithstanding this enormous loss of heat, solar temperature has
 not diminished sensibly for centuries, if we neglect the periodic
 changes — apparently connected with the appearance of sun-spots — that
 have been observed by Lockyer and others, and the question forces itself

 390                       Dr. C. W. Siemens.                    [Mar. 2,
 upon us how this great loss can be sustained without producing an
 observable diminution of solar temperature       even within a human
 lifetime.
    Amongst the ingenious hypotheses intended to account for a con
 tinuance of solar heat is that of shrinkage, or gradual reduction of the
sun's volume suggested by Helmholtz.         It may, however, be urged
against    this theory that the heat so produced would be liberated
throughout his mass, and would have to be brought to the surface by
conduction, aided perhaps by convection; but we know of no
material of sufficient conductivity to transmit anything approaching
the amount of heat lost by radiation.
    Chemical action between the constituent parts of the snn has also
been suggested ; but here again we are met by the difficulty that the
products of such combination would ere this have accumulated on the
surface, and would have formed a barrier against further action.
    These difficulties led Sir William Thomson to the suggestion that
the cause of maintenance of solar temperature might be found in the
circumstance of meteorolites falling upon the sun, not from great
distances in space, as had been suggested by Mayer and Waterston, but
from narrow orbits which slowly contracted by resistance until at last
the meteorolites became entangled in the sun's atmosphere and fell in;
and he shows that each pound of matter so imparted would represent
a large number of heat units without disturbing the planetary equili
brium.      But in considering more fully the enormous amount of
planetary matter that would be required for the maintenance of the
solar temperature, Sir William Thomson soon abandoned this hypo
thesis for that of simple transfer of heat from the interior of a fluid
sun to the surface by means of convection currents, which latter hypo
thesis appears at the present time to be also supported by Professor
Stokes and other leading physicists.
    But if either of these hypotheses could be proved, we should only
have the satisfaction of knowing that the solar waste of energy by
dissipation into space was not dependent entirely upon loss of his
sensible heat, but that his existence as a luminary would be prolonged
by calling into requisition a limited, though may be large, store of
energy in the form of separated matter.         The true solution of the
problem will be furnished by a theory, according to which radiant
energy which is now supposed to be dissipated into space and irre
coverably lost to our solar system, could be arrested, wholly or partly,
and brought back in another form to the sun himself, there to continue
the work of solar radiation.
    Some years ago it occurred to me that such a solution of the solar
problem might not lie beyond the bounds of possibility, and although I
cannot claim intimate acquaintance with the intricacies of solar
physics, I have watched its progress, and have engaged also in some

  1882.]            On the Conservation  of Solar Energy.             391
  physical experiments bearing upon the question, all of which have
  served to strengthen my confidence and ripened in me the determina
  tion to submit my views, not without some misgiving, to the touch
  stone of scientific criticism.
     For the purposes of my theory, stellar space is supposed to be filled
 with highly rarefied gaseous matter, including probably hydrogen,
 oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, and their compounds, besides solid materials
 in the form of dust. This being the case, each planetary body would
  attract to itself an atmosphere depending for its density upon its
  relative attractive importance, and it would not seem unreasonable to
 suppose that the heavier and less diffusible gases would form the staple
 of these atmospheres; that, in fact, they would consist mostly of nitro
 gen, oxygen, and carbonic anhydride, whilst hydrogen and its com
 pounds would predominate in space.
     But the planetary system, as a whole, would exercise an attractive
  influence upon the gaseous matter diffused through space, and would
 therefore be enveloped in an atmosphere, holding an intermediate posi
  tion between the individual planetary atmospheres and the extremely
 rarefied atmosphere of the stellar space.
     In support of this view it may be urged, that in following out the
 molecular theory of gases as laid down by Clausius, Clerk Maxwell,
 and Thomson, it would be difficult to assign a limit to a gaseous atmo
 sphere in space and, further, that some writers, among whom I will here
 mention only Grove, Humboldt, Zoellner, and Mattieu Williams, have
 boldly asserted the existence of a space filled with matter, and that
 Newton himself, as Dr. Sterry Hunt tells us in an interesting paper
 which has only just reached me, has expressed views in favour of such
 an assumption. Further than this, we have the facts that meteorolites
 whose flight through stellar, or at all events through interplanetary
 space, is suddenly arrested by being brought into collision with our
 earth, are known to contain as much as six times their own volume of
 gases taken at atmospheric pressure ; and Dr. Flight has only very
recently communicated to the Royal Society the analysis of the
occluded gases of one of these meteorolites taken immediately after
the descent to   be as  follows : —
                      COv                         0 12

    It appears surprising that there was no aqueous vapour, considering
there was much hydrogen and oxygen in combination with carbon, but

392                         Dr. C. W. Siemens.                   [Alar. 2,
perhaps the vapour escaped observation, or was expelled to a greater
extent than the other gases by external heat when the meteorolite
passed    through    our atmosphere.     Opinions concur that the gases
found occluded in meteorolites cannot be supposed to have entered
into their composition during the very short period of traversing our
atmosphere, but if any doubt should exist on this head, it ougbt to be
set at rest by the fact that the gas principally occluded is hydrogen,
which is not contained in our atmosphere in any appreciable quantity.
   Further proof of the fact that stellar space is filled with gaseous
matter is furnished by spectrum analysis, and it appears from recent
investigation, by Dr. Huggins and others, that the nucleus of a comet
contains very much the same gases found occluded in meteorolites,
             " carbon,
including              hydrogen, nitrogen, and probably oxygen," whilst,
according to the views set forth by Dewar and Liveing, it also con
tains nitrogenous compounds such as cyanogen.
    Adversely to the assumption that interplanetary space is filled
with gases, it is urged that the presence of ordinary matter would
cause sensible retardation of planetary motion, such as must have
made itself felt before this ; but assuming that the matter filling space
is an almost perfect fluid not limited by border surfaces, it can be
 shown on purely mechanical grounds, that the retardation by friction
 through such an attenuated medium would be very slight indeed, even
 at planetary velocities.
    But it may be contended     that, if the views here advocated regard
 ing the distribution of gases were true, the sun should draw to himself
 the bulk of the least diffusible, and therefore the heaviest gases, such
 as carbonic anhydride, carbonic oxide, oxygen and nitrogen, whereas
 spectrum    analysis   has  proved    on  the  contrary a prevalence   of
 hydrogen.
    In explanation of this   seeming anomaly, it can be shown in the first
 place, that  the temperature of the sun is so high, that such compound
 gases as carbonic anhydride and carbonic oxide, could not exist within
 him ; it has been contended, indeed, by Mr. Lockyer, that none of
 the metalloids have any existence at these temperatures, although as
 regards oxygen, Dr. Draper asserts its existence in the solar photo
 sphere.    There must be regions, however, outside that thermal limit,
 where their existence would not be jeopardised by heat, and here great
 accumulation of those comparatively heavy gases that constitute our
 atmosphere would probably take place, were it not for a certain
 counterbalancing action.
    I here approach a point of principal importance in my argument,
 upon the proof of which my further conclusions must depend.
    The sun completes one revolution on its axis in 25 days, and its
 diameter being taken at 882,000 miles, it follows that the tangential
 velocity amounts to l825 miles per second, or to 4'41 times the

  1882.]          On  the  Conservation of Solar Energy.              393
 tangential velocity of onr earth.    This high rotative velocity of the
sun must cause an equatorial rise of the solar atmosphere to which
Mairan, in 1731, attributed the appearance of the zodiacal light.      La
 Place rejected this explanation on the ground that the zodiacal light
extended to a distance from the sun exceeding our own distance,
whereas the equatorial rise of the solar atmosphere due to its rotation
 could not exceed -^ths of the distance of Mercury.       But it must be
 remembered that La Place based his calculation upon the hypothesis
 of an empty stellar space (filled only with an imaginary ether), and
 that the result of solar rotation would be widely different, if it was
 supposed to take place within a medium of unbounded extension.         In
 this case pressures would be balanced all round, and the sun would
 act mechanically upon the floating matter surrounding it in the
 manner of a fan, drawing it towards itself upon the polar surfaces,
and projecting it outward in a continuous disk -like stream.
    By this fan action, hydrogen, hydrocarbons, and oxygen, are sup
 posed to be drawn in enormous quantities toward the polar surfaces
 of the sun ; during their gradual approach, they .will pass from their
condition of extreme attenuation and extreme cold, to that of com
 pression, accompanied with rise of temperature, until on approaching
the photosphere, they burst into flame, giving rise to a great develop
ment of heat, and a temperature commensurate with their point of dis
sociation at the solar density. The result of their combustion will be
aqueous vapour and carbonic anhydride or oxide, according to the
sufficiency or the insufficiency of oxygen present to complete the com
 bustion, and these products of combustion in yielding to the influence
 of centrifugal force will flow toward the solar equator, and be thence
projected into space.
    The next question for consideration is : What would become of
 these products of combustion when thus rendered back into space ?
 Apparently they would gradually change the condition of stellar
                                                     I
material, rendering it more and more neutral, but venture to suggest
the possibility, nay, the probability, that solar radiation would, under
 these circumstances, step in to bring back the combined materials to
a condition of separation by a process of dissociation carried into effect
at the expense of that solar energy which is now supposed to be lost
to our planetary system.
    According to the law of dissociation as developed by Bunsen and
Sainte-Claire Deville, the point of dissociation of different compounds
depends upon the temperature on the one hand, and upon the pressure
on the other.     According to Sainte-Claire Deville, the dissociation
tension of aqueous vapour of atmospheric pressure and at 2800° C. is
0'5, or only half of the vapour can exist as such, its remaining half
being found as a mechanical mixture of hydrogen and oxygen, but
that with the pressure, the temperature of dissociation rises and falls,

 as the temperature     of saturated steam rises and falls with its pressure.
 It is therefore     conceivable    that the temperature of the solar photo
 sphere may be raised by combustion to a temperature exceeding
 2800° C, whereas dissociation may be effected in space at compara
 tively low temperatures.
    These investigations had reference only to heats measured by
 means of pyrometers, but do not extend to the effects of radiant heat.
 Dr. Tyndall has shown by his exhaustive researches that vapour of
 water and other gaseons compounds intercept radiant heat in a most
 remarkable degree, and there is other evidence to show that radiant
 energy from a source of high intensity possesses a dissociating power
 far surpassing the measurable temperature to which the compound
 substance under its influence is raised.           Thus carbonic anhydride and
 water are dissociated in the leaf cells of plants, under the influence of
 the direct solar ray at ordinary summer temperature, and experiments
 in which I have been engaged for nearly three years* go to prove that
 this dissociating action is obtained also under the radiant influence of
 the electric arc, although it is scarcely perceptible if the source of
 radiant energy is such as can be produced by the combustion of oil
 or gas.
    The point of dissociation of aqueous vapour and carbonic anhydride
 admits, however, of being determined                by direct experiment.            It
 engaged my attention some years ago, but             I  have hesitated to publish
 the qualitative results I then obtained, in the hope of attaining to
 quantitative proofs.
    These experiments consisted in the employment of glass tubes.
furnished with platinum electrodes, and filled with aqueous vapour
or with carbonic anhydride in the usual manner, the latter being fur
nished with caustic soda to regulate the vapour pressure by heating.
Upon immersing one end of the tube charged with aqueous vapour in
a refrigerating mixture of ice and chloride of calcium, its temperature
at that end was reduced to —32° C., corresponding to a vapour pres
sure, according to Regnault, of tsVo °f an atmosphere.                     When so
cooled no slow electric discharge took place on connecting the two elec
trodes with a small induction coil.              I then exposed the end of the
tube projecting out of the freezing mixture, backed by white paper,
to solar radiation (on a clear summer's day) for8 several hours, when
upon again connecting up to the inductorium, a discharge, apparently
that of a hydrogen vacuum, was obtained.                  This experiment being
repeated    furnished    unmistakable       evidence,   I  thought, that aqueous
vapour had been dissociated by exposure to solar radiation. The CO.,
tubes gave, however, less reliable results.              Not satisfied with these
qualitative results, I made arrangements to collect the permanent

 8gases so  produced by means of a Sprengel pump, but was prevented
 by lack of time from pursuing the inquiry, which I purpose, however,
 to resume shortly, being of opinion that, independently of my present
  speculation, the experiments may prove useful in extending our know
  ledge regarding the laws of dissociation.
     It should here be observed that, according to Professor Stokes, the
  ultra-violet rays are in a large measure absorbed in passing through
 elear glass, and it follows from this discovery that only a small portion
 -of the chemical rays found their way through the tubes to accomplish
  the work of dissociation. This circumstance,       being adverse to the
  experiment, only serves to increase the value of the result observed.
     Assuming, for my present purpose, that dissociation of aqueous
 vapour was really effected in the experiment just described, and
  assuming, further, that stellar space is filled with aqueous and other
  vapour of a density not exceeding the            Par'; of onr atmosphere,
 it seems reasonable to suppose that its dissociation would be effected
  by solar radiation, and that solar energy would thus be utilised. The
  presence of carbonic anhydride and carbonic oxide would only serve
  to facilitate the decomposition of the aqueous vapour by furnishing
 8substances to combine with nascent oxygen and hydrogen.           It is not
  necessary   to suppose  that all the energy radiated   from  the  sun into
 space should be intercepted, inasmuch as even a partial return of heat
 in the manner described would serve to supplement solar radiation,
  the balance being made up by absolute loss.        To this loss of energy
 must be added that involved in keeping up the circulating movement of
  the gas, which, however, would probably not be relatively greater than-
 that concerned in the tidal retardation of the earth's rotation. By
 means of the fan-like action resulting from thejrotation of the sun, the
 vapours dissociated in space would be drawn towards the polar surfaces
 of the sun, be heated by increase in density, and would burst into flame
 at a point where both their density and temperature had reached the
 necessary elevation to induce combustion, each'complete cycle taking,
 however, years to be accomplished.        The resulting aqueous vapour,
 carbonic anhydride and carbonic oxide, would be drawn towards the
 equatorial regions, and be then again projected into space by centri
 fugal force.
     Space would, according" to these views, be filled  with gaseous com
 pounds in process of decomposition by solar radiant energy, and the
existence of these gases would furnish an explanation of the solar
-absorption spectrum, in which the lines of some of the substances may
 be entirely neutralised and lost to observation.    As regards the heavy
 metallic vapours revealed in the sun by the spectroscope, it is assumed
 that these form a lower and denser solar atmosphere, not participating
 in the fan-like action which is supposed to affect the light outer
.atmosphere only, in which hydrogen is the principal factor.

    Such a dense metallic atmosphere could not participate in the fan
action affecting the lighter photosphere, because this is only feasible
on the supposition that the density of the in-flowing current is, at
equal distances from the gravitating centre, equal or nearly equal to
the outflowing current.      It is true that the products of combustion
of hydrogen and carbonic oxide are denser than their constituents,
but this difference may be balanced by their superior temperature on
leaving the snn, whereas the metallic vapours would be unbalanced,
and would therefore obey the laws of gravitation, recalling them to
the sun.     On the surface of contact between the two solar atmo
spheres intermixture, induced by friction, must take place, however,
giving rise perhaps to those vortices and explosive effects which are
revealed to us by the telescope in the intermediate or stormy region of
the sun, and which have been commented on by Sir John Herschel
and other astronomers.       Some of the denser vapours would probably
get intermixed    and  carried  away mechanically by the lighter gases.
;md give rise to that cosmic dust which is observed to fall upon onr
earth in not inappreciable quantities.     Excessive intermixture would
be prevented by the intermediary neutral atmosphere, the penumbra.
    As the whole solar system moves through space at a pace estimated
at 150,000,000 of miles annually (being about one-fourth of the velo
city of the earth in its orbit), it appears possible that the condition of
the gaseous fuel supplying the sun may vary according to its state of
previous decomposition, in which other heavenly bodies may have
taken part.    May it not be owing to such differences in the quality of
the fuel supplied that the observed variations of the solar heat may
depend ? and may it not be in consequence of such changes in the
thermal condition of the photosphere that sun-spots are formed ?
    The views here advocated could not be thought acceptable unless
they furnished at any rate a consistent explanation of the still some
what mysterious phenomena of the zodiacal light and of comet*.
 ttegarding the former, we should be able to return to Mairan's views,
the objection by La Place being met by a continuous outward flow
from the solar equator.     Luminosity would be attributable to particles
 of dust emitting light reflected from the sun, or by phosphorescence.
 But there is another cause for luminosity of these particles, which
 may deserve a passing consideration. Each particle would be electrified
by gaseous friction in its acceleration, and its electric tension would
 be vastly increased in its forcible removal, in the same way as the fine
dust of the desert has been observed by Werner Siemens to be in s
state of high electrification on the apex of the Cheops Pyramid.
 Would not the zodiacal light also find explanation by slow electric

 same cause not account for a great difference of potential between the
sun and earth, which latter may be supposed to be washed by the solar

radial current ? May not the presence of the current also furnish us
with an explanation of the fact that hydrogen, while abounding appa
rently in space, is practically absent in our atmosphere, where aqueous
vapour, which may be partly derived from the sun, takes its place ?
An action analogous to this, though on a much smaller scale, may be
set np also by terrestrial rotation giving rise to an electrical discharge
from the outgoing equatorial stream to the polar regions, where the
atmosphere to be pierced by the return flood is of least resistance.
    It is also important to show how the phenomena of comets could be
harmonised with the views here advocated, and I venture to hope that
these occasional visitors will serve to furnish us with positive evidence
in my favour. Astronomical physicists tell us that the nucleus of a
comet consists of an aggregation of stones similar to meteoric stones.
Adopting this view, and assuming that the stones have absorbed in
stellar space gases to the amount of six times their volume, taken at
atmospheric pressure, what it may be asked, will be the effect of such
a mass of stone advancing towards the sun at a velocity reaching in
perihelion the prodigious rate of 366 miles per second (as observed
in the comet of 1845), being twenty-three times our orbital rate of
motion. It appears evident that the entry of such a divided mass into
a comparatively dense atmosphere must be accompanied by a rise of
temperature by frictional resistance, aided by attractive condensation.
 At a certain point the increase of temperature must cause ignition,
and the heat thus produced must drive out the occluded gases, which
 in an atmosphere 3000 times less dense than that of our earth would
 produce 6x3000=18,000 times the volume of the stones themselves.
 These gases would issue forth in all directions, but would remain
 unobserved except in that of motion, in which they would meet the
 interplanetary atmosphere with the compound velocity, and form a zone
 of intense combustion, such as Dr. Huggins has lately observed to
 surround the one side of the nucleus, evidently the side of forward
 motion. The nucleus would thus emit original light, whereas the tail
 may be supposed to consist of stellar dust rendered luminous by reflex
 action produced by the light of the sun and comet combined, as fore
 shadowed already by Tyndall, Tate, and others, starting each from
 different assumptions.
    These are in brief the outlines of my reflections regarding this most
 fascinating question, which   I venture to put before the Royal Society.
              I
 Although cannot pretend to an intimate acquaintance with the more
 intricate phenomena of solar physics,     I have long had a conviction,
 derived principally from familiarity with some of the terrestrial
 effects of heat, that the prodigious and seemingly wanton dissipation
 of solar heat is unnecessary to satisfy accepted principles regarding
 the conservation of energy, but that it may be arrested and returned
 over and over again to the sun, in a manner somewhat analogous

to the action   of the heat recuperator in the regenerative gas furnace.
The fundamental conditions are : —
   1. That aqueous vapour and carbon compounds are present in stellar
or interplanetary space.
    2. That these gaseous compounds are capable of being dissociated
by radiant solar energy while in a state of extreme attenuation.
    3. That these dissociated vapours are capable of being compressed
into the solar photosphere by a process of interchange with an equal
amount of reassociated vapours, this interchange being effected by the
centrifugal action of the sun itself.                  .
   If these conditions could be substantiated, we should gain the satis
faction that our solar system would no longer impress us with the
idea of prodigious waste through dissipation of energy into space, but
rather with that of well-ordered self-sustaining action, capable of per
petuating solar radiation to the remotest future.

       Sanders, M.R.C.S.   Communicated by [Professor Huxley,
       LL.D., F.R.S. Received February 16, 1882.
                               (Abstract.)
    The author, after a preliminary sketch of the literature of the sub
ject, and a description of his method of hardening and staining.
proceeds to give an idea of the external aspect of the central nervous
 system in the Mormyridae.
    Taking as an example the brain of the Hyjwmpisus dorsali8, he
describes  it  as comparable to that of an ordinary teleostean     fish to
which two additions have been     made, namely, an organ  situated  in the
region in front of the cerebellum, which grows out in the form of plates.
from a pair of stalks. These plates, or wings as they may be termed,
become folded in every direction, and breaking through the tecta lobi
optici, and repressing them to the base of the brain, they cover over
all the remaining lobes of that organ.
    It only the tecta lobi optici which undergo displacement, the tori
      is
semicirculares retain nearly their usual position, so as to become
related to the former as an egg to the egg-cup. or an oyster to its
shell.
    On the outer side of the plates are minute ridges running mostly
 longitudinally, in close proximity to each other the parts where these
                                                 ;
 ridges become external are of a pinkish colour when fresh, but where
the plates are folded on themselves,       the inner side of the wings
becomes external, and shows    a   white colour under the same circum
stances.
   These folds take place when the plates have grown sufficiently to
reach the walls of the skulls, and are arranged as follows — the plate
                                                                :
which grows towards ihe anterior end of the skull turns backwards           ;
that which grows towards the summit of the skull turns inwards;
that which grows outwards turns upwards, while that which grows
backwards ends in a free edge, and conceals the second of the addi
tional parts alluded to above.
   This exists in the form of a large nearly spherical tuberosity placed
behind the cerebellum, in or over the region of the fourth ventricle.
   The author then gives an account of the microscopic anatomy of
this brain. Passing lightly over the remainder of the lobes, which
resemble in structure those of the ordinary teleostei, and noticing in
passiug that the composition of the tecta lobi optici ismuch simplified,
he proceeds to describe the structure of the cerebellum.   He finds that

this presents the four layers usually found in the corresponding lobe in
the teleostei, namely, counting from the outside, the molecular, the
intermediate — which includes the Purkinje cells — the granular, and
the fibrous ; the latter consisting of nerve-fibres on their way to the
crura cerebelli.
    Noticing Denissenko's* paper, and his discovery of two species of
cells in the granular layer of the cerebellum, the author remarks that
he was unable to find them, even by using Denissenko's own method.
 He then discusses the cause of the striation in the molecular layer,
 which he attributes in a great measure, but not entirely, to prolonga
 tions from the epithelial layer of cells which cover the surface of the
cerebellum. Incidentally he mentions that he has traced an axis
  cylinder process of a Purkinje cell into a medullated nerve-fibre.
    He then goes on to describe the structure of the organ in front of
 the cerebellum.       This he finds consists of two parts, a central con
tinuation of the cerebellum, having precisely the same structnre and
arrangement, and two lateral parts spreading out one on each side,
 like wings.
    The plates which form these lateral wings consist of minute cells,
resembling those found in the granular layer of the cerebellum.
 Each ridge has four layers corresponding to those found in the
cerebellum, arranged in a slightly different manner. The molecular
layer comes first, then the granular and intermediate layers mingled
together, and last of all, the fibrillae from the fibrous layer.                The
molecular layers of contiguous ridges are placed in close contiguity
with a process from the pia mater interposed between them ; the
granular and intermediate layers come next, consisting of cells of
different sizes, connected together by a network of fibrillae.                  The
smaller    cells resemble   those  of  the  granular layer    of the  cerebellum     ;
the larger ones are intermediate between the last, and the Purkinje
cells to which they lead up. These latter are arranged in a single
layer ; they are smaller in size than the corresponding cells in the
cerebellum, and usually oval or fusiform in shape ; they generally have
two processes, one, the protoplasmic process, directed towards the
molecular layer, and the other the axis-cylinder process, turned
towards the bundle of fibrilhe which is derived from the fibrous layer,
and which, passing between two contiguous ridges on the side
opposite the molecular layer, forms the boundary between them.
    In some parts, however, these cells are arranged in groups, viz.,
where the bending of the wings causes bays and recesses in the
ridges ; here they are polygonal in shape and present several processes.
The sides of the ridges are inserted into the plates or wings of granular
layer cells, by conical processes.

402         Central Nervous System in Vertebrate Animals.               [Mar. 9;
   The large tuberosity situated behind the cerebellum is termed by
the author the tuberculum impar, and consists of six layers, counting
from the outside.
    1. The first layer has small cells which become deeply coloured by
the staining fluid.
   2. The second contains sections of obliquely directed nerve-fibres.
   3. The third is smoothly granular and does not become so highly
coloured as the outside layer, but shows faint indications of radia'
striations.
   4. The fourth is a narrow stratum of moderately sized cells of
varying dimensions, which become intensely coloured by the staining
fluid.
   5. The fifth consists of a complex of nerve-fibres.
   6. The sixth layer only found at the anterior end of the tubercle is
composed of finely granular material ; the corresponding portion of
the posterior end is occupied by a circular space.
   In addition to these six layers there is intercalated between the
first and second layers a body of granular neuroglia, in which
extremely large cells are collected ; at the anterior end of the tuber
culum impar, this structure takes the place of the first layer and
becomes interposed between the tubercle in question and the cere
bellum.
   The author then discusses the modes of origin of the nerves which
are present in these fishes. The trochleares and the abducentes appear
to be absent. The trifacial and the vagus, in addition to their ordinary
origins, derive the greater number of their fibres from the tuberculum
impar, the former from the anterior end, the latter from quite the
posterior edge. The facial and the glossopharyngeal are parts of
these two nerves respectively.
    The author finds, contrary to the opinion of Bellonci,* that the
optic nerve has an origin from the hypoarium as well as from the
tecta lobi optici.      The other nerves arise as in Teleostei.
    The author then proceeds to indicate the probable homologies of
these two extraordinarily developed organs.            Taking the brain of a
Ballan wrasse (Labrus maculatus) and examining the part which is
generally termed the valvula cerebelli, he finds that it has a central
part resembling the cerebellum in strncture, together with a wing on
each side, occupying much more of the ventricle of the optic lobe8
than in many other Teleostei.
    These wings are formed by an extension of the molecular layer of
the central part, which even here shows two or three folds based on
an extension of the granular layer.           He therefore puts forward the
idea that   if  these wings    of   the valvula   cerebelli of the L. maculatv*

were to continue to increase indefinitely, an organ resembling the-
highly developed structure in the Mormyridte would result.                 This
latter then may be looked upon as homologising with the valvula
cerebelli and its wings in the ordinary teleostean.
   With regard to the body which is placed behind the cerebellum,
the author points out that the Cyprinidae                 possess a well-known
tuberosity occupying a corresponding position, which is termed by
writers the tuberculum impar ; this, in conjunction with the vagal
tuberosities of the medulla oblongata, presents layers comparable to
those existing in the structure in question belonging to the Mormy-
ridav, he therefore suggests that the homology of this exaggerated
tuberosity in these fishes is to be looked for in the tuberculum impar
together with the vagal tuberosities of the Cyprinidee, the increased
size in the former species having caused it to include the origin of
the trifacial in addition to that of the vagus.
   In conclusion, the author offers some criticism of the ideas lately
put forward by Fritsch* as to the homologies of the various parts of
the brain in fishes, the key to the whole of which lies in his interpre
tation of the tecta lobi optici, which he takes to be the persistent
cortex of the primary anterior vesiclef of the brain of the embryo, and
consequently to belong to the thalamencephalon, and not to the
 mesencephalon.
   In reply to this the present writer points out that the homologies of
all the other parts of the brain in Teleostei may be deduced from the
position of the pineal gland, the infundibulum, and the ganglion of
origin of the oculomotorius.
    From this line of argument he maintains that the tecta lobi optici
correspond to the anterior pair of the corpora quadrigemina, and con
sequently belong to the mesencephalon, and not to the thalamen
cephalon. Finally he remarks that the brain in Teleostei would not be
 in accordance with the remainder of their organisation, if all the
parts of a mammalian cerebrum could be distinguished in it, even in
a comparatively rudimentary state as is maintained by Fritsch.

shown the importance of a thorongh and accurate knowledge of the
ultra-violet spectra of the elements, for it is in the lines of short
wave-length as a rule that the greatest emissive power is manifested,
and they are therefore most readily reversed.            Thus we have suc

of iron (" Proc. Roy. Soc.," vol. 32, p. 404).            The necessity for
accurate data in regard to this region of the spectrum led us to make
a. long study of the spectrum of magnesinm, and the results of this

a map and table of wave-lengths of the lines due to carbon in the
visible part of the spectrum, as distinguished from the fluted spectra
given by compounds of carbon, namely, carbonic oxide, cyanogen, and
acetylene.    These lines, they state, always appeared when very power
ful induction sparks were passed through the vapour of any compound
of carbon, or between carbon electrodes. This line spectrum is
 remarkable for simplicity, consisting of eleven lines, of which the
 single line in the yellow, followed by a triple gronp in the green, and
 a very strong line in the blue, recall vividly the spectrum of magne
 sium ; and as we know two modifications of the spectrum of magne
 sium which seem to be due respectively to the oxide and a hydride.
the parallel between the behaviour of the two elements is the more
 striking.   The plates of the ultra-violet spectra of the metals by the
 late Professor W. A. Miller (" Phil. Trans.," 1864) include plates of
 the spark taken between metallic electrodes in different compounds of
 carbon, which show with sufficient clearness that there are some five
groups of lines in the ultra-violet spectrum of this element.               In the
observations here described we have preferred taking inten-e induc
 tion sparks between pure graphite poles in different gases.
    The accompanying figure represents the ultra-violet spectrum of
 carbon to a scale of wave-lengths within the range of the rays trans
mitted through calcite.       The lines figured have been observed in
 photographs of the spark of a large induction coil, having a large
 Leyden jar in connexion with the secondary coil, between poles of
 purified graphite in air, carbonic acid gas, hydrogen, and coal-gas.
 The same lines have been observed in photographs of the spark
 between iron, and between aluminium poles in carbonic acid gas.               By
 comparing the photographs taken under these different circumstances.
 we have, we believe, eliminated the air lines, which are numerous and
 strong in the region between H and T, and will form the subject of a

fature communication, and also the metallic lines which graphite,
purified with the utmost care, still exhibited.
    The graphite was purified by being stirred in fine powder into
fused potash, and subsequent treatment with aqua regia, by prolonged
ignition in a current of chlorine, and by treatment with hydrofluoric
acid. The well washed powder was afterwards compressed into blocks
by hydraulic pressure between platinum plates, and from these blocks
the electrodes employed were cut. Notwithstanding the purification
the photographs of the spark between these electrodes still showed
very distinctly lines of magnesium and iron. This fact shows the
extreme difficulty of getting rid of all impurity, and the caution
which is requisite in any reasoning depending on the assumption of
chemical purity in the materials employed.       It is very possible that
 the magnesium and even the iron in this case may have been due to
oxides of those metals in the floating dust of the laboratory, which
we know always contains sodium compounds, and which at Cambridge,
where the water, soil, and bricks contain sensible quantities of lithium,
almost always shows traces of that element.
    The wave-lengths of the strongest carbon lines were determined by
means of a Rutherford diffraction grating having 17,296 lines to the
inch. The measures were made in the following way : The collimator
and telescope of the goniometer were first centred by the instrument
 maker's marks. The telescope was then more carefully adjusted for
centre by directing it on to a distant mark, taking the reading of the
circle, turning the arm carrying the telescope through 180° and
reversing the telescope, whereby the mark was again brought into the
 field of view, and adjustments were then made until the mark had the
same position on the cross- wires in both positions of the telescope.
The grating was next placed in position, and, after adjustment to the
vertical plane was brought very nearly at right angles to the axis of
the collimator by turning it until the sodium D lines in the spectra
of the second order were observed to fall at equal distances on either
 side of the collimator.    The small photographic slide, containing the
 sensitive plate, fitted the telescope in place of the eye-piece, and so
could easily be turned about an axis coincident, or nearly so, with the
 optic axis of the telescope.    In taking a measurement of the position
of a line the approximate wave-length was first found by interpolating
 between the nearest cadmium or other lines of known wave-length
 in photographs taken with calcite prisms. The telescope was then
 set to the angle corresponding to this approximate wave-length for the
 spectrum of the fourth order. The lower half of the slit was closed
by a shutter, and the photographic slide having been adjusted for
level, the plate was exposed to the light which came through the
upper half of the slit, and gave an image of the lines in the lower
 half of the field. When this exposure was completed, the photographic

1882.J                  On the Spectrum  of Carbon.                   407
slide was turned round through 180° about the axis of the telescope, so
as to bring to the top that part of the sensitive plate which had been
before lowest. It was then exposed a second time, and thus two images
of the same line were impressed on the plate, which were necessarily
at equal distances on either side of the point where the axis of the
telescope met the plate.       By a subsequent measurement with a
micrometer under a microscope of the distance between the two
images, and the conversion of this distance into angular measure, a
correction was found, which was added to, or subtracted from, the
 reading of the circle to get the exact deviation of the ray producing
the line under observation. Another photograph of the same line was
next taken in the same way as before, except that the telescope was
placed at the corresponding angle on the other side of the collimator.
From the two angles thus found, the wave-length of the line was
-calculated.   The process was repeated three or four times for each
line, and the mean wave-length thus found for carbon lines were
2296-5, 2478 3, 2509-0, 251 1 9, 2836 3, and 2837-2.         The numbers
deduced from the different photographs of the same line differed from
one another in the last figure only, so that we are justified in assuming
 the first four figures to be accurate in each case. The wave-lengths
of the remaining lines were obtamed by interpolation from measures
of photographs taken with a train of two calcite prisms of 30° each,
and one of 60°, on which the iron as well as the carbon lines were
 shown. The wave-lengths of the iron lines used in the interpolations
-were deduced from photographs taken with the grating in the same
 way as that above described for the carbon lines.      The wave-lengths
 thus found for the remaining carbon lines are given in the table
below.
    In taking the photographs of the spark, the induction coil was
sometimes worked by a De Meritens magneto-electric machine, and in
 that case the stream of spai'ks was not only extremely brilliant, but
 produced a deafening roar. Notwithstanding this character of the
.spark, the photographs, when the spark was taken in air, between
 poles of purified graphite, showed, besides the carbon lines alwve
described, the set of six cyanogen flatings in the blue very distinctly,
  and those between K and L, and those near N, strongly developed.
 On the other hand, when the spark was taken in carbonic acid gas,
 these flutings almost entirely disappeared, and would no doubt have
 disappeared entirely, if the last traces of air had been removed from
 the apparatus.

  We have also examined the spectmm of Swan's incandescent lamps.
So long as the carbon thread          unbroken,
                                           is        emits a continuous

spectrum, on which     neither  bright nor dark lines are visible. By
gradually increasing the number of cells in the battery, until the
thread gave way, we found at the instant of fracture, for a small
fraction of a second only, that a set of flutings in the green appeared.
In some of those lamps we observed, when the current was nearly as
much as the carbon thread would bear without rupture, that        sort of                           a
flame appeared in the lamp.        On examining the spectrum of this
flame,  it
         gave  the flutings  of carbonic  oxide very distinctly, and we
made sure that they were those of carbonic oxide, and not those of
hydrocarbons, by comparison with the bands of a Bunsen burner.
Closer examination showed that this flame was strongest about the
junction of the carbon thread with one of the conducting wires, and

that on reversing the current, it shifted from one wire to the other,
and the wire about which it appeared was always the positive
electrode.     In fact, the flame was the glow of the positive pole
attending a discharge in rarefied gas ; when the resistance of the
carbon thread became too great in proportion to the intensity of the
current, the discharge began to occur through the rarefied atmosphere
within the envelope of the lamp. The spectrum showed that this
atmosphere contained carbonic oxide.
   By interposing different flames between the incandescent lamp and
the slit of the spectroscope, we have been able to make some compari
sons of the probable temperatures of the flames and filament. For
this purpose a lens of 3 inches focal length was placed 6 inches in
front of the slit, and an image of a horizontal part of the incandescent
carbon thread formed by it across the (vertical) slit. The appearance
in the field of view of the spectroscope was a narrow continuous
spectrum extending all across the field.      When a flame was interposed
between the lens and the slit, the bright lines of the flame were seen
above and below the narrow continuous spectrum, and in some cases
were continued across it, or were seen reversed upon it.         When the
flame was that of a Bunsen burner          in which was a platinum wire
with sodium carbonate, the yellow sodium lines were seen bright
above and below the continuous spectrum of the carbon thread, but
reversed where they crossed it.        When lithium was substituted for
sodium in the flame, the red lithium line was also seen bright above
and below the continuous spectrum, but reversed where it crossed it.
When an oxyhydrogen jet was substituted for the Bunsen burner, and
sodium carbonate held in     it,   the yellow sodium lines were not only
bright above and below the continuous spectrum of the carbon, but
showed us bright lines where they crossed       it, in fact they were con
spicuously brighter than the carbon.        When coal-gas was substituted
 for hydrogen    in the jet, the same appearance presented itself, only the
sodium lines were not so much brighter than the carbon as they were
 before.   Fifty Grove's cells were used with the incandescent lamp,
 which were as many as could be used without danger of rupturing the
 threads.   When barium chloride was held in the hydrogen flame fed
 with only little oxygen, the bright green line of barium (wave-length
          a
 5534) was well seen above and below the continuous spectrum, but
 could not be traced either bright or dark across it. When a flame of
 tyanogen burning in air was interposed, the bright bands of that flame
 could bo seen above and below the continuous spectrum, but could not
 be traced either bright or dark across it. When sodium carbonate
 was held in this flame the yellow sodium lines were seen feebly
 reversed where they crossed the spectrum of the incandescent lamp.
 Wo infer from these experiments that the emissive power of the
 carbon thread for light of the refrangibility of the D lines    is  nearly

temperature of a jet of coal-gas and oxygen, much less than that of
sodium in the oxyhydrogen jet. This seems to render         itprobable
that the temperature of the incandescent thread    isnot far different
from that of a cyanogen flame burning in air (or rather the tem
perature     conveys to the sodium in it), but
               it                                    isless than that
of an oxyhydrogen flame, though this does not necessarily follow
from the experiments, inasmuch as the radiation of the sodium       is
                                                                     so
much more limited as to range than that of the carbon.        When a
Bunsen burner or a gas blowpipe flame was interposed between the
lens and slit, no reversal of the hydrocarbon bands could be seen.
When magnesium was burnt between the lens and slit, the magne
sium lines (6) were seen bright, eclipsing the carbon.     Possibly the
smoke of magnesia may have considerably helped to eclipse the light
-of the carbon.

          municated to the Royal Society by permission of the Solar

     1.   In
         a paper communicated to this Society, and published in 'tis
*'             "
  Proceedings    (vol. 32, p. 406), evidence was brought forward tend
ing to show that what may be termed decliiiation-range weather takes
1*6 days to pass from Toronto to Kew   ;  that is, the same phase occurs
1*6 days later at Kew than at Toronto.   And in a previous paper {op.
cit., vol. 29, p. 308) evidence was brought forward tending to show
that temperature-range weather takes about     8days to pass between
these two places.
   In this last-mentioned paper an attempt was likewise made to show
that there       a similarity between magnetical and meteorological
                    is
changes, and that both are due to the sun.   This result has been con-
finned by subsequent discussion, and there seems reason to suppose
that in America both magnetical and meteorological changes follow
very quickly after the solar changes which produce them.

   If  this be true, if the two kinds of allied weather start together at
America, or nearly together, and if the magnetical moves in the same
direction as the meteorological weather, but only quicker than it, then
it is not unreasonable to suppose that the Kew magnetical weather of
to-day may be found to resemble the Kew meteorological weather six
or seven days later on.
   It is this point which I have endeavoured to test in the present
communication by comparing together the variations of declination-
range and those of temperature-range at Kew during the years 1871
and 1872.
   2. Bearing in mind, however, the local nature of meteorological
phenomena, instead of confining myself to Kew alone,            I  have taken
the means of the daily temperature-ranges at Stonyhurst, Kew, and
Falmouth, these three forming the chief stations in England of the
Meteorological Council, to whose kindness        I  am indebted for a list of
the daily temperature-ranges at these three places for the years 1871
and 1872.
   These mean ranges       have   been compared with the corresponding
Kew     declination-ranges,     excluding disturbances,    for which      I  am
indebted to    the  kindness   of the Kew Committee.        This comparison
has been made after the following method : —
   3. The meteorological material, as already mentioned, consists of a
series of the daily temperature-ranges at Stonyhurst, Kew, and
Falmouth, recorded in degrees Fahrenheit and tenths of a degree. As
the results are merely comparative, decimal points have been omitted ;
also, instead of taking means of the daily temperature-ranges          at these
three places, it has only been deemed necessary to record the sums of
these ranges, thereby Baving the division by three for each day.              A
specimen    of these  sums   is  exhibited  in Table I, column   2.   Further
more, in order somewhat to equalise or tone down individual fluctua
tions, daily sums of four of the numbers of column 2 are recorded in
column 3.
   Again, as it is fluctuations of small period, say twenty-four or twenty-
five days, which we wish to investigate, column 4 is made to contain
means of twenty-five of the numbers of column 3, this mean being
placed opposite to that number of column 3 which has the middle or
thirteenth place in the series of twenty-five. Finally, the differences
between corresponding numbers of columns 3 and 4 are exhibited in
column 5, these being taken to represent the fluctuations we are in
search of, the' sign minus denoting defect, and the sign plus excess, in
the observed values of column 3 with reference to the mean or normal
values of column 4.
   4. These various peculiarities of the method will be perceived from
the following table : —

   5. The numbers representing the diurnal ranges of declination at
Kew are derived by means of a measuring instrument applied to the
magnetograph curves, and are recorded in decimals of an inch. As
the results are merely comparative, decimal points have been omitted.
These numbers have been treated in the same way in which the
numbers in colnmn 2 of the above table are treated ; in fine, the tem
perature and declination-ranges have had applied to them precisely the
same method of treatment.
   Ultimately we obtain, as in the case of the temperature-ranges, a
column representing declination fluctuations, and comparable with
column 5.
   6. In Table       II   the temperature-range and declination-range fluctua
tions are exhibited side by side for the various months of the years
1871 and 1872.

  7.   The following are questions which suggest themselves with refe
rence to the numbers of Table             II   :   —
  In   the   first place, do the inequalities of declination-range at all
correspond with those of temperature-range ? and, secondly, if so, what
is the difference in phase between the two sets of inequalities ?
    I shall endeavour to reply to the last question first. In order to do
so, let us take any three months of temperatnre-range,     and try to find
how far it is necessary to push forward the declination-range numbers
in order to obtain the maximum amount of correspondence between
 them and those of the temperature-range for the three months under
consideration. This will be denoted by a maximum algebraic sum of
the two inequalities ; in fine, we pursue precisely the same process as
that adopted for ascertaining the difference of phase when comparing
together the declination-ranges at Kew and Prague (" Proc. Roy.
 Soc," vol. 29, page 316).
    Now let us perform a number of such operations, taking various
sets of three months each, so that the middles of the sets may corre
 spond, as far as possible, to the middles of the various months between
the beginning of 1871 and the end of 1872.
    8. The results of this process are exhibited in Tables        and IV,                         III
in which, for shortness' sake, the various months of the year are num
bered in order, instead     of,
                              being named.
  9.   The results of Tables       III
                                   and IV are conveniently embodied in
 the following table —:

that were a considerable number of years so treated, more exact values
exhibiting the law wonld be obtained.        The law itself is sufficiently
obvious in each of the two years now treated.
   10. It has still to be ascertained to what extent the two fluctuations,
when brought together so that similar phases coincide as nearly as
possible, show any distinct resemblance to each other.
   The evidence on this point is given by the diagrams which accompany
this paper. These contain curves representing the continuous progress
of the two sets of fluctuations for the years 1871 and 1872, these being
portioned out into months.          The temperature-range curve has a
uniform time scale. The declination-range curve is pushed forward
by a distance derived from the last column of Table V. Thus for
January of each year it is pushed forward eight days, for February of
each year five days, and so on.      The consequence of this is that the
declination-range scale, while constant for the various portions of the
same month, yet varies slightly from one mouth to another.
   An inspection of the curves will show that there is a considerabk-
likeness between them.      Perhaps this likeness is greater in the second
than in the first year, but it must be borne in mind that 1871 was a
year of great magnetic disturbance, and therefore unfavourable for
such a comparison.
   It would thus seem as if a comparison of magnetical and meteoro
logical weather might be made a promising subject of inquiry, besides
being one which may perhaps lead to results of practical importance.
   Before concluding    I  beg to thank Messrs. William Dodgson and
Alfred Nish for the assistance which they have rendered in this
investigation.

quelques unes des liaisons qui existent entre les éléments de courbure
des surfaces homofocales à une surface donnée et les éléments de cette

aux centres de courbure principaux des surfaces homofocales, et de
faire voir comment sont liés géométriquement les six centres de cour
bure principaux des trois surfaces homofocales qui passent par un
même point.
   Je vais prendre, pour point de départ, les expressions des rayons de
courbure principaux auxquelles je suis arrivé dans ma précédente
communication ; c'est le seul emprunt que je ferai à ce travail.
   Je ne me suis pas astreint à conserver mes anciennes notations ; je

1882.]            des   Surfaces Homofocales du Second Ordre.                           423
   Parmi   ces plana polaires, il y a les plans (N, N'), (N, N"), (N',
N")   qui sont les plans tangents en m anx surfaces (B), (H'), (H"),
et les plans principaux des surfaces homofocales, qui sont les plans
polaires de m, par rapport à celles de ces surfaces qui sont infiniment
aplaties.
   L'enveloppe de ces plans polaires est alors une surface développable
tangente à ces six plans. La trace de cette développable sur le plan
(N, N') est la parabole enveloppe des droites telles que I V , cette
développable, qui est tangente au plan (N, N'), étant coupée par ce
plan suivant une parabole est alors dn 4e degré.       Nous avons donc
ce théorème       :
    Les plans polaires d'un point m, par rapport à des surfaces homo
focales, enveloppent une surface (D) du 4' degré', qui est tangente aux
 plans principaux des surfaces homofocales, ainsi qu'aux plans principaux
des cônes de sommet m circonscrits                à ces   surfares.
   Comme         les paraboles       suivant lesquelles          la surface (D) coupe les
plans (N, N'), (N, N"), (N', N"), sont les paraboles                       dont nous avons
déjà parlé, on a        ce théorème        :
   La     développable        (D),   enveloppe     des   plans polaires de m, touche les
droites    N, W, N". aux six          centres     de   courbure principaux de (E), (H')(
(H"),      et touche    les    plans (N        N'), (N, N"), (N', N"),     suivant   les axes

                                        surfaces prises deux à deux.

  On voit bien maintenant pourquoi les axes de courbure de ces
courbes sont tangentes aux paraboles, traces de (D), sur les plans
 (N, N'), (N, N"), (N', N").
   Par N', menons des plans tangents                          (0).

cône de sommet m circonscrit à cette surface suivant les deux généra
trices qui sont dans le plan de la section principale de ce cône, per
pendiculaires à N'. De là résulte que, par rapport à (0), ce plan, qui
n'est autre que le plan (N, N"), est le plan polaire de l'. De même le
plan (N, N') est le plan polaire de l" par rapport à la même surface.
Rapprochons indéfiniment (0) de l'ellipsoïde (E) et nous arrivons à ce
théorème     :
   La normale e» m à l'une des surfaces homofocales a pour polaire, par
rapport à cette surface, l'axe de courbures de la ligne d'intersection des deux
autres surfaces homofocales qui passent en m.
   On retrouve aussi ce théorème connu :
   Les centres de courbure principaux d'une surface du second ordre en m
sont les pôles du plan tangent en ce point à cette surface par rapport aux
deux surfaces Iwmofocales qui passent par m.*

  Le centre      de courbure  filt de la section faite dans (E) par le plan

placé sur N', par rapport à a', b', c'.
   Ce que nous disons pour ce centre de courbure peut se répéter pour
les autres.   De là résultent, pour ces points, différentes constructions
que je ne crois pas nécessaire de développer.
   Des points I, V , l", où l'un des plans polaires de m rencontre N, N', N",
élevons respectivement         des plans perpendiculaires à ces normales.
 Ces trois plans se coupent en un point X..        Puisque les plans polaires
de m déterminent sur N, N', N" des segments proportionnels, nous
voyons que :
  Les points, tels que   \   relatifs   aux plans polaires de m    par rapport aux
surfaces homofocales, sont en ligne droite.
  Nous désignerons cette droite par A ; on peut la construire en

deux plans polaires particuliers de m.

manière sur N'. Les points fit et /t'3 sont alors aussi les projections
sur N et N' d'un même point de la cordo de contact /tj fi\.
      La droite    fi2 fi'2   est donc tangente à la parabole comme nous l'avions

Dr. W. Huggins. On the Photographic [Mar. 16,

Royal Society, were employed which have been described in my paper
on " The Photographic Spectra of Stars." *
    The exposure was limited by the coming up of clouds to forty-five
minutes. The opening of the slit was made wider than during my
work on the stars.
    The photographic plate shows a spectrum of bright lines, and also a
                                                I
narrower continuous spectrum which think must be due to stellar light.
The bright stars forming the trapezium in the " fish's mouth " of the
nebula were kept close to the side of the slit, so that the light from
the adjacent brightest part of the nebula might enter the slit.
     Outside this stronger continuous spectrum             I suspect an exceedingly
faint trace of a continuous spectrum.                In the diagram which accom
panies this paper the spectrum of bright lines only is shown, which is
certainly due to the light of the nebula.
     In my papers on the visible spectrum of the nebula in Orion, and
other nebulae, t      I   found four bright lines.        The brightest line, wave
length 5005, is coincident with the less refrangible component of the
double line which is strongest in the spectrum of nitrogen. The
second      line has a wave-length of 4957 on Angstrom's scale. The
other two lines are coincident with two lines of hydrogen, H/3 or F,
and H7 near G.
     In the photograph these lines which had been observed in the visible
 spectrum are faint, but can be satisfactorily recognised and measured.
 In addition to these known lines the photograph shows a relatively
 strong line in the ultra-violet, which has a wave-length 3730 or nearly
 so.     The wide slit does not permit of quite the same accuracy of
 determination of position as was possible in the case of the spectra of
 stars. For the same reason I cannot be certain whether this new line
is really single, or is double or multiple. In the diagram this line i-
represented broad to indicate its great relative intensity.
     This line appears to correspond to f of the typical spectrum of
 white stars.f        In these stars this line is less strong than the hydrogen
 line near G ; but in the nebula it is much more intense than H7. In
 the nebula the hydrogen lines F and H7 are thin and defined, while in
 the white stars they are broad and winged at the edges.                    The typical
spectrum has been added, for the sake of comparison, to the diagram.
     I cannot say positively that the lines of hydrogen between H7 and
the line at 3730 are absent.                If they exist in the spectrum of the
nebula, they must be relatively very feeble.                 I suspect, indeed, some
very     faint   lines   at  this  part    of the  spectrum, and possibly beyond

III.   " On the Disappearance of some Spectral Lines and the
       Variations of Metallic Spectra due to Mixed Vapours." By
       G. D. Liveing, M.A., F.R.S., Professor of Chemistry, and
       J. Dewar, M.A., F.R.S., Jacksonian Professor, Universit}-
       of Cambridge. Received March 11, 1882.
   The theory of spectral lines most commonly received is that the
   otions of the luminiferous ether producing them are not directly due
to any motion of translation of the molecules of the emitting substance,
but to relative motions of the parts of the same molecule, or in other
words, to vibrations occurring within the molecules            ;and that the
mutual action of the molecules, while       it  may   give  rise  to irregular
vibrations of the ether, affects the regular vibrations producing the
lines only in an indirect manner, by converting part of the motions of
translation into internal vibrations. On this theory the spectral lines
which any given substance can readily take up will in general be
limited to a certain number of fundamental lines and a number of
others harmonically related to them, though not necessarily simple
harmonics of the fundamental lines. And variations of temperature,
by altering the rapidity and the violence of the action of one molecule
on another, will alter the intensities of the several vibrations, but not
their periods, unless the violence should extend to the disintegration
of the molecules, which wonld be equivalent to the formation of new
molecules with new fundamental periods of vibration.              In view of
this theory, the observations on the spectrum of magnesium have                a
special interest, because from the close analogy of magnesium to zinc
and cadmium,   it   isinferred that the molecules of magnesium vapour
are chemical atoms of that substance, that       is to say, they pass appa
rently undivided through all     the chemical changes to which magnesium
may be subjected    ; and it  seems reasonable to suppose that any sub
division of the chemical atoms could not fail in this case to be attended
with a change of chemical qualities, which, in the presence of other
elements, would give rise to new compounds.             No such new com
pounds    have  in fact  been   detected.   We  have   already   described in
detail the differences between the spectra of magnesium as seen in the
flame of the burning metal, the electric arc, and the spark discharge,
and we have now some further observations upon them to place before
the Society, which are confirmatory of the received theory.

1882.]      On   the Disappearance       of some Spectral Lines,      #c.         429
    We have observed the spectrum of a block of magnesia, rendered
incandescent by an oxyhydrogen jet. In the visible part of this spec
trum we found no discontinuity, no lines bright or dark (except the
inevitable D lines), no sign of the blue channelled spectrum of
magnesia.       Drs. Huggins and Reynolds (" Proc. Roy. Soc.," vol. 18,
pp.   547, 551) have recorded the appearance of the 6 group under these
circumstances, but we failed to get sight of it. . In the ultra-violet
region photographs still show a continuous spectrum, extending far
beyond the limit of the solar spectrum, in fact] as far as we have
hitherto observed any lines of magnesium to occur, but on this con
tinuous spectrum one line, and only one, comes out, which is the
strongest line of burning magnesium and of the arc spectrum, at wave
length 2852 (2850 Cornu).           This line shows sometimes bright, some
times reversed, against the continuous background. In this case,
where the appearance of the lines depends on their relative brightness,
as compared with the continuous spectrnm, there is no advantage, so
far as the visible rays are concerned, in the photographic method over
that of observation by the eye ; there may be a disadvantage, as the
photograph presents only the mean result of a certain time. But where
the faint lines of a discontinuous spectrum are in question the photo
graphic method has the advantage, for when the vibrations are too
feeble to produce any sensible impression on the retina, they may yet,
by integration of their effects during a lengthened exposure, produce a
 definite effect on the photographic plate.            In general we have only
-exposed our plates for such times as would give us the best defined
 images, so that very faint lines are not developed in them ; but by
 using a prolonged exposure we find that in many cases the disappear
 ance of lines from the arc or spark is more apparent than real, and is
 attributable to a variation of intensity, not to an absolute cessation of
 the vibrations corresponding to the evanescent lines. Thus of the
quadruple group between wave-lengths 2789 and 2802 in the spark
 spectrum of magnesium only the stronger two lines are usually seen in
 photographs of the arc with short exposure, but the whole four
 produce their impressions on the plate if sufficient time be given.
 Again, the triplet in the arc spectrum at wave-length about 2942 —
 2937'5 is not usually seen in the spectrum of the spark, but when the
 plate has had a lengthened exposure the strongest two lines of this
triplet make their appearance in the spectrum of the spark. Even the
 triplet near M, so strong in the flame of burning magnesium, but
 not before recognised either in the arc or spark in photographs taken
 with short exposure,* comes out in plates of the spectrum of the
 Spottiswoode induction spark (if we may give this name to the method
of stimulating the induction coil by the intermittent cnrrent of a
    • Dr. Huggins has informed us that his old
                                                     photographs of the magnesium
 spark taken with an induction coil in the ordinary way show this triplet distinctly.
                                                                   2l2

 magneto-electric machine, see Proc. Roy. Soc.," vol. 30, p. 175) between
 magnesium electrodes which have had four or five minutes' exposure.
 These observations tend to confirm the theoretical view that alteration-
 of temperature cannot put a stop to any of the fundamental vibrations
 of a molecule ; at the same time we cannot be suro that the impulses
communicated by an electric discharge may not be in some respect-
 different from those resulting from mere increment of temperature.
     There is, however, a further point for consideration, which is,
how far the presence of a mixture of molecules of different elements
 affects the respective vibrations.      This is a condition which obtains in
 most or all of our observations of the arc in crucibles, as well as in
the solar atmosphere, so that it is important to see if any effects can be
traced to such a condition of matter.           Indeed, in order to arrive at
any probable explanation         of  the variations   observed in the spectra
of sun-spots and of the chromosphere, we require to study the pheno
mena produced by such mixtures of vapours as exist in our crucibles,
and not merely the spectra produced by the isolated elements, either in
arc, spark, or flame.
    It is only on some such supposition as that above suggested that we
can acconnt for the absorption lines produced by admixtures of mag
nesium with sodium and potassium respectively (" Proc. Roy. Soc.,"
vol. 27, p. 353) ; and it is possible that the very remarkable effect
of hydrogen in producing the reversal of chromium lines (ib.,
vol. 32, p. 405) and of other lines (ib., vol. 28, p. 472) is a result
of analogous       action.    We have more particularly observed the
effect of a current of hydrogen on the iron lines at wave-lengths
4918, 4919p7, and 4923.         These lines, as seen in the arc in a mag
nesia crucible, usually have about the same relative strengths as are
shown in Angstrom's map of the solar spectrum ; Thalen gives their
intensities as 2, 1,3 respectively.        They are all developed simultane
ously when iron is dropped into the crncible, the first being sometimes
reversed, the second frequently reversed for some time, the third much
strengthened but not reversed.          After a time these effects die out, but
if now a very gentle current of hydrogen is led in through one of the
carbons perforated for the purpose, the line at 4919'7 is again strongly
reversed, that at 4918 expanded, while that at 4923 becomes very
bright but remains sharply defined. These effects of the hydrogen
were observed several times. In all cases the line at wave-length 4923
seemed to maintain about the same relative strength compared with
the other two lines, and never showed any variation at all correspond
ing to the prominence it holds in Young's catalogue of chromospheric
lines, where it has a frequency of forty, while that at 4918 has only
half that frequency, and the strongest line of the three does not figure
at all *

     Some    further observations      on this group of lines are contained             in
 the sequel.
     The effects of mixtures of metallic vapours in developing bright
 lines are equally marked, and in general more easily observed.                       We
  have before noticed (" Proc. Roy. Soc.," vol. 30, p. 97) " that certain
  lines of metals present in the crucible are only seen, or come out with
  especial brilliance, when some other metal is introduced.                  This is the
 case with some groups of calcium lines which are not seen, or barely
  visible, in the arc in a lime crucible, and come out with great brilliance
  on the introduction of a fragment of iron, but are not developed by
  other metals such as tin." Effects of this kind are most frequent in
  the case of metals which produce a large number of lines.                     They are
  specially   noticeable   in   the  case  of  nickel   and   titanium.     Both    these
  metals produce many lines, but a comparatively large quantity of
  nickel may be introduced into a crucible of magnesia, through which
  the arc of a powerful Siemens dynamo-electric machine is passing,
  without the lines of nickel being strongly developed ; they show
  steadily as sharp but not specially bright lines ; but after several other
 metals — iron, chromium, &c. —have been put in in succession, the
  nickel lines frequently come out with great brilliance and considerably
 expanded, and remain so for a long time. The titanium lines are
 generally very persistent when that metal (as cyanide or oxide) has
 been introduced into the crucible, but are subject to continual varia
 tions of intensity ; sometimes8 they are twinkling, at other times
 steady ; but they can frequently be brought out with great brilliance
 by dropping in iron or other metals.               In such cases the metals put
  into the arc can hardly be supposed to increase the resistance or the
  temperature, but they may assist the volatilisation of each other, and
 may also act by reduction, and so by increasing the incandescent
 mass strengthen the weaker lines. Chlorides, however, which seem
 to have the effect of helping the volatilisation and diminishing the
 resistance so that the arc can be drawn out to a greater'length, usually
 sweep out the fainter lines.
     In many cases when a fragment of a metal is dropped into the cruci
 ble brilliant lines, hitherto unrecorded, come out for a short time and
 quickly die out. It is hardly possible in such cases to say without
 prolonged observations whether these lines belong to the newly intro
duced metal or to some of those previously put in and developed by
 the presence of the new metal.           How much remains to be done in the
 study of these lines, and how much light this may throw on the
 phenomena of the solar lines, will be seen from the following account
 of our observations of some very small portions of the spectrum of the
 paper on the spectra of sun-spots showing
                                               " what happens with regard to three ad
 jacent iron lines under different solar and terrestrial conditions," is at variance with
8our observations, in so far as the line at 4923 is represented as absent from the arc.

arc in a magnesia crucible.    The portions selected are of special
interest, because in these regions a remarkable ontburst of broad
Praunhofer lines, not usually visible, is recorded by the Astronomer
Royal as having occurred in a sun-spot (" Monthly Not. Ast. Soc.,"
1881).
      Fig.   1   shows             (not all the) lines which were in the
                         the principal
same field of view when the spectrum of the 4th order produced by
a Rutherford grating (17,296 lines to the inch) was observed, tbe light
being that of the arc of a Siemens machine in a magnesia crucible. A
small piece of copper was first put in and then some nickel, and by
the lines of these metals the portion of the spectrum under examina
tion was identified. The iron lines were as usual also present.      The
symbols affixed to the several lines show those which came out when the
metals indicated were introduced. Thus, when chromium was dropped
in, a very brilliant line came out near the middle of the field, a little
below the iron line wave-length 509084 ; titanium cyanide brought
out a line at about wave-length 5086, cobalt one at 5094, uranic oxide
one at 5087, and cerium (which may have contained lanthanum and
didymium) a number of lines.         These lines were very bright for a
second or two, and soon became much less brilliant, but were revived
when more of the metal was put in.              Lead bronght out a very
evanescent diffuse band represented in the figure by dotted lines.
The distances of the several lines from the extreme nickel lines
were measured hastily by a micrometer, and are here reproduced to
scale.   One line at wave-length 5096, though constantly present, did
not seem to be affected by any of the metals introduced.         An iron
line is indicated on Angstrom's map at this place, but the introduc
tion of iron, which expanded the neighbouring line at wave-length
5097'3, had no effect on it.   It is remarkable that this region in
Angstrom's normal solar spectrum is particularly bare of lines, though
Vogel gives several faint lines between those marked by Angstrom. It
is,however, a region in which many lines have been observed in sun-
spots (Greenwich Spectroscopic and Photographic Results, 1880), and
the most prominent of these lines seem to correspond to lines developed
by cerium, chromium, and cobalt, though more exact measures than
we were able to take at the times that those observations were made
are needed in order to establish an exact coincidence.

434    On   the Disappearance   of some  Spectral Lines, Sfc.   [Mar. 16,
sphere, according to Young and Tacchini, and is assumed to be due
to iron, is so near to lines which come out in our crucibles on the in
troduction of other metals, that we cannot help feeling some doubt as
to its absolute identification with the iron line ; the more so as in
Young's catalogue bright lines are sometimes assigned to two metals,
of which the real lines differ by nearly a unit of Angstrom's scale.
This is the case, for example, with the line at wave-length 5017*6,
which is ascribed to iron and nickel. And where lines are broadened,
as in sun-spots, the identification with either of two very close lines
becomes very difficult.
   Fig. 4 shows the lines which come out in the neighbourhood of
wave-length 4923. A pair of lines are developed by iron close to this
line, and a very bright but evanescent line comes out at about 4923*5,
on the introduction of cerium. This is an exceedingly brilliant line
for the time, and might easily be mistaken for the iron line unless
examined under high dispersion, and it seems to show that metallic
cerium is readily volatile under these conditions. The iron line at
4923 seems to disappear on the addition of titanium, which, on the
other hand, brings out the lines marked titanium in the figure.
Nickel brings out the cerium line strongly. The line which comes
out at 4921*3 on the addition of chromium and titanium is most likely
the line seen by Young in the chromosphere thirty times, which up to
the present time has not been recognised as due to any element but
sulphur.
   Both the nickel line at 5016*5 and the adjacent iron line at 5017*5
are seen in the arc in our crucibles, but the nickel line is much the
stronger and more persistent.       Cerium when put into the crucible
brightens the titanium lines, as well8 as the line at 5017*5. An alloy
of manganese, iron, and titanium had the effect of making the nickel
line broad and diffuse, without strengthening the 5017*5 line.
   These are but samples of the large amount of work which remains
to be done before we can pronounce that any of the solar lines are not
due to terrestrial elements, or can draw any safe inferences from
observed variations in their relative strengths or apparent coincidences ;
and no real scientific advance can be made by attempting generaliza
tions with the knowledge which we at present possess.

   The following Papers were read                :   —
I. " On the Constituent of the Atmosphere that Absorbs Radiant
      Heat. II." By S. A. Hill, Meteorological Reporter, North-
      West Provinces            and Oudh.                   Communicated by General
        Strachey, R.E., C.S.I., F.R.S.                       Received March 10, 1882.
  General Strachey has suggested to me that with the data given in
my first paper we may arrive at a numerical relation between the
absorptive powers of dry air and aqueous vapour, instead of being
content with merely showing that vapour is by far the most active
constituent of the atmosphere in this respect.    The following calcula
tions, worked out on the lines suggested by him, indicate that the dry
air lias a small and, as far as we can judge, invariable effect in the way
of absorption, while the effect of water vapour is large and variable.
In other words, the air probably exercises a feeble absoiption over the
whole range of the spectrum, while the absorption due to water vapour
is selective, and probably varies in amount with the nature of the
radiation from day to day.
    Starting with Pouillet's formula j-=Rxpe, where e stands for the
atmospheric thickness and p for the fraction of the total radiation that
 would penetrate vertically through an atmosphere of unit thickness,
we may take p to be made up of two factors, x and            one of which           /3,
i-epresents  the  diathermancy   of  the dry  air and   the  other  that of
vapour. The masses of dry air and water vapour traversed by the
 rays will be respectively proportional, though not in the same ratio, to
 the barometric pressure* and the vapour tension. Taking the length
of an oblique ray-through any atmospheric stratum to be proportional
 to sec  z,we thus arrive at the formula
                   log =log
                        r         R+   1   sec   z    log   a.   +/sec   z   log   /i,
in which a and     y3   stand   for the fractions of the total heat transmitted
through atmospheres          composed       respectively of dry air and aqueous
  • That     to say, approximately proportional to the total pressure. It will not
              is
do to deduct the vapour tension from the total pressure, because the vapour thins
out as we ascend much more rapidly than the air does.

   The absorption due to dry air of one inch pressure seems therefore to
be almost invariable and equal to only 81445 per cent. of the total
radiation — quantity that could hardly be measured in laboratory
              a

                 ;
between 24 and 30 per cent. (perhaps between much wider limits) and
is equal, on the mean of the two days' observations, to 27-217 per cent.
In an atmosphere of dry air at 30 inches pressure the absorption would
be 1— a80, or about      per cent. of the total radiation. The fraction of
                             is 4£

II.  " On the Influence     of Coal-dust in Colliery Explosions.      No.
       IV."   By W. Galloway.           Communicated by Robert IL
       Scott, F.R.S.      Received December 29, 1881.
   In  the concluding pages of No.    Ill  paper, now in the hands of the
Royal Society,    I described an apparatus the essential parts of which
consist of a wooden gallery about 126 feet long by 2 feet square, and a
sheet iron cylinder about 6 feet long by 2 feet in diameter ; and, at
the same time,      I  gave a short general account of the experiments
that had been made with it up to that date, intending to resume the
subject on some future occasion.         It will be remembered that the
experiment was       made   by mixing together and igniting a small
quantity of fire-damp and air in the sheet iron cylinder called the
" explosion chamber " ; that the resulting explosion burst through a
paper diaphragm which separated the explosion chamber from the
wooden gallery and created an air- wave ; that the air- wave in passing
through the gallery swept up coal-dust from the floor and from certain
shelves placed at given points in it ; and, lastly, that the flame of the
original fire-damp explosion traversed the cloud of coal-dust and air
to a greater or less distance from the origin.
   During the warm dry weather prevailing between the 14th and
21st of July last,    I made sixty-three further experiments, which for
convenience may be separated into the three following well-defined
groups.
   I. Fifteen to ascertain how far the flame of the mixture of fire
damp and air contained in the explosion chamber would extend along
the wooden gallery in the absence of every trace of coal-dust.
   II. Thirty-eight to ascertain how far the flame produced in the
same manner and under the same conditions as in the preceding case
would extend into a cloud of coal-dust and pure air, created by the-
action of the air- wave in its passage through the wooden gallery.
   III. Ten to ascertain the effects due to the explosion of small heaps
of blasting powder placed at given points in the wooden gallery, all
the other conditions being exactly the same as in the last case.
   In each experiment the fire-damp was carefully and accurately
measured     by water displacement in a. special cylinder called the
measuring cylinder in the two preceding papers.        No fire-damp could
enter any part of the apparatus without first passing through the
measuring cylinder, and being thence transferred into the explosion
chamber.     As has been previously stated, also the explosion chamber

 438                            Mr. W. Galloway.                        [Mar. 23,
 was   separated from the wooden gallery by certain sheets of paper
 interposed between them in the form of a diaphragm.                    None but
sheets without visible flaws were employed for this purpose, and they
 were inserted in the joint between the wooden gallery and the
 explosion chamber in such a way that their edges projected into the
open air all round about.          Seven minutes or so elapsed from the time
 the fire-damp was begun to be transferred into the explosion chamber
until its mixture with air was ignited. The largest quantity of fire
damp employed in any one of the sixty- three experiments was l88~6,
or say, 2 cubic feet, and if even one-half of this quantity had escaped
 there could have been no explosion, as the mixture remaining in the
explosion chamber would not have been inflammable.                    Admitting.
however, for the sake of argument, that, in every case, one cubic foot
of fire-damp passed through each sheet of paper in the diaphragm in
succession and found its way into the gallery, then its rate of escape
would be, say, one-seventh of a cubic foot per minute. But, during
the whole time the first forty-two experiments were in progress, there
was a current of fresh air amounting to upwards of 1,000 cubic feet
per minute constantly passing into the gallery immediately behind
the diaphragm and traversing it towards its open end.                  Therefore,
the greatest amount      of  fire-damp   which the  gallery could   possibly have
contained at any moment before one of these explosions was effected,
even in the extreme case I have imagined, and with the further
supposition that all the doors were shut, was about one-fourteenth
part of a cnbic foot, giving a mixture of one of gas to seven thousand
of air, a proportion which is obviously far too small to be of the least
practical account.
    It appears   necessary to give the foregoing explanation, inasmuch as.
in a report on some experiments made with dust from Sea ham
colliery,* Professor Abel has made the following remarks regarding
the experiments conducted with the smaller apparatus described to
the Royal Society in 1879, and whatever applies to those experiments
in this respect, applies with equal force to the present ones, which are
nothing more than their continuation on a larger scale. At page 5,
                             "
Professor Abel says, — The apparatus devised by Mr. Galloway for
the latter experiments was very ingenious, but it appears open to
question whether small quantities of fire-damp did not find their way
before the explosion from that part of the apparatus where the gas-
mixture was prepared and fired into the channel where the coal-dust
was raised, and into which the flame of the explosion was projected."
    The coal-dust employed in this series of experiments came from the
   *
      Report on the result of experiments made with the samples of dust collected at
Scttlmui Colliery in compliance with the request of the Secretary of State for the
Home Department, conveyed by a letter dated November 4, 1880.       By F. A. Abel,

same source    as  that used in most of the former ones. It had been
produced in the operation of grinding coal for coke-making purposes,
and had floated in the air and been deposited in a still atmosphere
-within the building containing the machinery.      I could not obtain the
results described in my previous papers, and in the present one,
with dust taken from screens, or from the roadways of mines ; for, on
 the one hand, the dust from screens seems to have lost its finest
particles before being deposited ; and, on the other hand, the feeble
nature of my explosion prevented me from attempting to perform the
                                  I
 winnowing operation to which imagine the dust in mines is subjected
before it is required to propagate the flame of an explosion.
    It is an indispensable condition that the dust be dry, and have I
found also that the best experimental results can only be obtained in
fine dry weather. For instance, on the 20th of July, when it was
                  I
warm and dry, succeeded in producing flames of coal-dust and pure
air varying in length from 108 to 147 feet ; but on the 22nd, only two
days afterwards, when it rained occasionally, and the air contained
very finely divided moisture in the form of a light and hardly percep
tible mist, I could not produce a flame even 36 feet long.
    In making the series of experiments corresponding to the ones we
are now discussing, which were described in No.         II paper, I  found
that when the gallery was air-tight, or nearly so, the flame could not
be propagated further than 30 or 40 feet from the origin ; whereas,
when the seams between the boards were open, the flame travelled 80
or 90 feet under the same conditions as before. The dry weather
 which had prevailed before the 14th of July last had dried up the
 timber of which the gallery was formed to such an extent as to pro
duce twelve open seams in it longitudinally, varying from J" to \"
 wide ; and it was recognised after the seventeenth experiment had
been made, that this circumstance allowed the force of the fire-damp
explosion to be dissipated, without forming an air-wave of sufficient
energy to raise the coal-dust in the gallery. Accordingly, strips of
wood were nailed along the seams on the top, on the doors, and on the
back, while some of the succeeding experiments were in progress ;
strips of canvas were nailed along the seams on the floor ; the spaces
between the ends of the sections were carefully closed, and canvas
was nailed along the joints between the doors and the gallery, with the
object of making it as air-tight as possible everywhere. This opera
tion was completed as far as the end of the sixth section, when the
thirty-eighth experiment was made. The experience in this case was
that the more air-tight the gallery could be made the better were the
resnlts.
   When the twenty-eighth experiment was made, it first became
evident that the gas and air in the explosion chamber had not been
sufficiently well mixed in the preceding experiments to produce the

440                          Mr. AV. Galloway.                    [Mar. 23,
best possible   results by their explosion. Accordingly, in all the suc
ceeding experiments the driving wheel was turned rapidly 200 times
instead of 100 times as before, the attendants relieving each other at
the work, and, thereafter, the results were much more uniform, and,
consequently, more satisfactory.
    It will be recollected from the account given in No.    Ill  paper, that
the gallery consists    of seven sections, and that each section  has a door
18 feet long by 2 feet 3 inches wide, which constitutes one of its sides
when it is closed (see sections a and b, fig. 3). When all the doors
are open the gallery has only three sides — namely, top, bottom, and
back, and its interior is exposed to view from one end to the other.
The doors then stand out horizontally on a level with the top to
 which they are hinged, while their free edges are supported on
suitable props.       The table given below shows how many doors were
shut, and how many were open when each experiment was made, the
shut ones being, of course, those nearest the explosion chamber.          In
one or two experiments, however, there were three doors next the
explosion chamber closed, the following three open, and the last one
shut. This was the case, for example, in the sixty-third experiment.
 There is no provision in the table for showing this arrangement, and
as the flame did not, on any of these occasions, extend to the last
 section, it was not considered worthy of a special column.         Each of
 the seven sections contained coal-dust in the cases referred to, and
 that is the reason why they are all represented in the table.
    There were sets of three shelves, one above the other, placed trans
 versely in the gallery at the following points, measured from the
 diaphragm towards the open end: 10 feet, 21 feet, 32 feet 6 inches,
 42 feet, 56 feet, 65 feet, 76 feet 4 inches, 87 feet, 96 feet 8 inches.
 107 feet, and 117 feet 6 inches.      The spaces between the shelves of
 each set, and between the highest and lowest shelf and the top and
 bottom of the gallery, were intended to have an approximately equal
 area.    The shelves were about 6 inches wide by £ inch thick.
     Those heaps of powder referred to in the table, whose distances from
 the diaphragm correspond to the position of certain of the sets of
 shelves, were in these instances placed on the top shelf, the others
 were laid on the floor.
     After each experiment the coal-dust was entirely swept out and
 replaced by fresh dust, except in one or two cases which are specially
 mentioned in the table.
     The diaphragm nsually consisted of six single sheets of newspaper,
 but the exceptions are shown in the table.      Where a note of interroga
 tion occurs the number of sheets may be taken as six, although the
 real number was omitted in taking notes at the time.

 hand side of the zero line, and the seven sections of the wooden
 gallery are on its right hand side.                The form of the flames was
 sketched at the instant of their occurrence, with the exception of
 No. 59, which is correct as to length, and approximately correct as to
 its other dimensions, but was not sketched until afterwards. The
 average length of fire-damp flame obtained in the first fifteen experi
 ments is shown on each representation of the apparatus by means of

liad been introduced, several experiments of this class were made. But as it was
found that the fire-damp flame was, if anything, shorter than before, sometimes not
exceeding eight or nine feet in length,    I did not tlunk it necessary to undertake a
new series of experiments, and allowed the original one to remain intact.

   It should again be mentioned that a thick cloud of coal-dust and
air was always created by the air-wave which emanated from the fire
damp explosion and swept through both the closed and open parts of
the gallery, in advance      the flame.  When this cloud emerged into                                                                of

being projected beyond the end of the gallery, it occasionally assumed
large proportions, and the flame, which afterwards shot into it, also
became enlarged until it appeared to have a diameter varying from
5 to 9 feet on different occasions.   It then emitted a loud roaring sound
and exhibited all the phenomena of incipient explosive combustion.
   Crusts of coked coal-dust were found adhering to the edges of the
transverse shelves farthest from the explosion chamber, and their
opposite edges were covered with a thin deposit of soot and dust,
which had a velvety feeling when touched.              These circumstances
seem entirely to corroborate the hypothesis first proposed in No.          I
paper, in connection with Llan Colliery explosion, and afterwards
revived in No.      Ill   paper, in connexion with Penygraig Colliery
explosion, to the effect that the crusts of coked coal-dust are, as a
rule, deposited during the retrograde movement of the air, that is to
say, while it is travelling backwards towards the origin of the explosion.
   The results stated in the foregoing pages strengthen and confirm
               I
the opinions have expressed in each of the three preceding papers
on. the same question,      as to the manner in which the flame of an
explosion  is originated   and  propagated in a dry and dusty mine.     The
experiments described in the first paper seemed to show that a
mixture of air and coal-dust is not inflammable at ordinary pressure
and temperature without the presence of a small proportion of fire
damp ; but those described in this place show conclusively, I think,
that fire-damp is altogether unnecessary, when the scale on which the
 experiments are made is large enough, and when the fineness and dry
ness of the dustr are unquestionable.           It may be objected that,
although the particular kind of dust       I have generally employed may
form an explosive mixture with pure air, it does not follow that other
kinds of coal-dustr will do the same, even under the very same con
ditions as to fineness and dryness.        I am inclined to think, however,
that the objection has8 very little real importance as far as the general
question of colliery explosions is concerned.       Possibly the dust pro
 duced in mines in which very dry or anthracitic qualities of coal are
 worked might not behave in the manner indicated.           But the number
of mines of this class now being worked in this country is far too
small, as compared with the whole, to be of any practical account.
   I may add, in concluding, that the views advocated in these papers,
or similar ones, have been held for many years by a few eminent
French engineers, including MM. Verpilleux, Vital, and others ; and
they now appear to be making rapid progress amongst the practical
mining men of our own country, who, judging by the reports that
have reached me from many sides, are urgently desirous of obtaining
as much information on the subject as they possibly can.

I. " On    the Development of the Ossicula Auditus in the           Higher
       Mammalia." By Alexander Fraser, M.B., &c, Senior
       Demonstrator of Anatomy, the Owens College, Manchester.
       Communicated by Dr. Allen Thomson, F.R.S. Received
       March 16, 1882.
                                (Abstract.)
    The paper begins by a history of the various views held up to the
present date concerning the origin of the Ossicula Auditus.
    The author then describes the methods of • preparation, and the
results of his own observations made upon complete series of sections
from the rat, pig, sheep, dog, rabbit, calf, mouse, and human embryos
at different developmental stages. He gives a short anatomical sketch
of the parts in connexion with the proximal extremities of the first
 two post-oral cartilages, including the ganglion, the maxillary and
 mandibular branches of the fifth nerve, the seventh nerve, and its
 mandibular (chorda tympani) branch (noting the relation which this
 branch bears to the hyoidean cartilage, and the long cms of the
 incus), the auditory vesicle and its capsule with the difference in
 development between the oval and round fenestrae,            the primitive
 jugular   vein, the hyo-mandibular   cleft (and its non- perforation in the
 region of the membrana tympani), and the tympanic annulus.
     The author describes the malleus as having its origin in the
  proximal extremity of the mandibular cartilage, the apex of which,
  growing in a ventral direction, depresses the dorsal wall of the
  meatus anditorius externus upon the ventral, and thus becomes the
  manubrium of the malleus. He further compares the embryonic ossicula
  with their form in the adult, and traces the origin from the mandibular
  cartilage of certain parts in the adult malleus of Mammalia of great
  morphological significance.

 1882.1         Ossicula Auditus in    the Higher Mammalia.               447
    He has ascertained that the head of the incus is the proximal
extremity of the hyoidean cartilage, the long crus forming the con-
necting part between it and the remainder of the cartilage. The short
crus is a later growth backwards from the head of the incus.             This
ossicle agrees in its histological characters with the hyoidean cartilage
and not with the mandibular.        The mandibular branch of the seventh
nerve bears also the same relation to its long crus in the human
embryos as it bears to the hyoidean cartilage.
    The orbicular apophysis is shown to be a part of the long crus,
which turns inwards to accommodate itself to the stapes at right
angles to its former direction ; its constricted pedicle is not formed
 until after birth.
    The cells of the embryonic stapes appear contemporaneously with
 those forming the embryonic cartilage in the arches, or those forming
 the periotic capsule ; they are arranged in a circular form round an
 artery, which may either disappear very early, as in the human em
 bryo, or persist through life, as in the rat. In the former case it is called
 arteria stapedialis, in the latter arteria stapedio-maxillaris.         This
 circnlar ring is at first of equal thickness all round, and is not even in
 contact with the periotic capsule, but is more closely connected with the
 hyoidean cartilage, although its cells cannot be described as con
 tinuous with the cells of that cartilage, their long axes having a
 circular and not an antero-posterior direction.
    Owing chiefly to the growth of the cochlear part of the labyrinth,
the stapes applies itself to the wall of that cavity, forms a depression
 there, the future fenestra ovalis ; the margins of its base and the
head are the last to develop.

of the incus is formed at the same time as that between the malleus
and incus.     The tubercle on its posterior crus bears the same relation
to the stapedius muscle as the processus muscularis of Hyrtl to
the tensor tympani.         The stapedius muscle agrees in its develop
ment with the tensor tympani, or any other muscle in the region of
the head, and the nucleus in its tendon, which has been described as
an inter-hyal, has no connexion with the hyoidean cartilage, in truth,
not being present at all in any of the embryos on which T have
worked ; so that when it is present it must be looked upon as a
development in a tendon similar to that which occurs in many other
muscles of the body.
    The author was anticipated by Salensky in the publication of the
discovery of the peculiar mode of origin of the stapes round an
artery ; but his observation of this fact was made independently of
Salensky's, and before the appearance of that writer's memoir, and
he has been able both to correct and to add considerably to Salensky's
description of the development of this ossicle.

   The author, after referring to the notice of the finding of a molar
tooth of a mastodon, in Australia, by Count Strzelecki, in his
"
   Physical Description of New South Wales," p. 312, proceeds to the
details of the first evidence of a proboscidian mammal which has
reached him from that continent since the date (1845) of the Count's
work. This evidence consists of portions of a tnsk indicative of an
elephantine animal, somewhat less than the existing ones of Asia and
Africa.    The evidences of the ivory nature of the tusk are given in
detail, including the minute characters of that variety of dentine.

III.   " Action of Ethylene Chlorhydrin upon the Bases of the
       Pyridine Series and on Quinoline." By Professor ADOLPH
       WUKTZ, For. Mem. R.S.        Received March 17, 1882.
    According to the constitution which is generally attributed      to the
 bases of the pyridine series, they must be considered as tertiary bases,
 their nitrogen being united to the carbon by three atomicities.        The
 action which alcoholic iodides exert upon these bases, as shown
 by Hofmann, confirms this idea, which is equally applicable to
 quinoline.    I thought that the reaction of glycol chlorhydrin and
 similar compounds upon the pyridine bases and upon quinoline should
 produce oxygenated quaternary bases.       It is known, in fact, that such
 a base, neurine, results from the action of ethylene chlorhydrin upon
 trimethylamine.     The beautiful results •which Ladenburg obtained
 recently by the reaction of chlorhydrin upon secondary bases are
 well known. He is still continuing these researches to the great
 profit of science.  I  myself, entering again on a line of researches
 which   I had formally traced, will describe tho results obtained by in
 vestigations undertaken in the direction indicated, with the pyridine
 bases and quinoline.
     I had two specimens of collidine at my disposal, presenting the

same boiling-point.       One obtained by the distillation of aldol-ammonia
was undoubtedly identical with aldehydine of Baeyer and Ador
 (boiling-point 179 — 182° C.), the other was isolated from the pyridine
bases formed by the distillation of cinchonine with hydrate of potas
sium; this collidine is the a-collidine (boiling-point 179 — 183°).*
The experiments have proved that these two collidines are isomeric.
               Action of Ethylene Chlorhydrin upon Aldehydine.
    A  mixture of these two compounds, in proportion of their molecular
weights, to which a quantity of water weighing as much as the alde
hydine employed was added, was heated during several days in closed
tubes to 100° C.        The oily layer which floated on the mixtnre at the
      O
end of the operation, continually decreased and finally disappeared
 after cooling. The aqueous liquid, which was slightly brown, was ex
tracted with ether, and finally evaporated in the vacuum.                 The ether
had dissolved a small quantity of unattacked aldehydine and chlorhy
 drin.     The chlorohydrate, concentrated by evaporation, was mixed
 with an excess of platinum chloride, and alcohol was added to the
mixture. An abundant crystalline precipitate was obtained, and was
purified by several crystallisations in hot water.                In this manner
magnificent voluminous orange-red crystals of chloroplatinate of
oxethyle-aldehydine were obtained.               Their analyses furnished the
following numbers : —

    The Analysis III, which is the most accurate, was executed with a
salt which had been dried in the vacuum ; when this salt is heated to
100° C. it loses hydrochloric acid, which tends to augment the pro
portion of carbon and of platinum. The Specimen III, after having
been heated to 100° during some time, contains 28'2 per cent. of
platinum.      This alteration, which is more marked in the case of the
chloroplatinate of oxethyl-collidine, will be examined later on. The
results of these analyses lead to the formula (C12H16NOCl)2PtCl4,
which is that of a chloroplatinate of oxethyl-aldehydine —

   This chloroplatinate forms magnificent orange-red crystals of
clinorhombic aspect. It is quite soluble in hot water, and the con
centrated boiling solution, when it cools, becomes cloudy, by depositing
oily drops which finally transform themselves into crystals. Decom
posed in aqueous solutions by sulphuretted hydrogen, it furnishes a
chloride whose solution is colourless, and does not crystallise after
being evaporated during several days in the vacuum.                       Decomposed
by oxide of silver and water it furnishes a caustic soluble base, which
attracts the carbonic acid of the air.
   These reactions permit no doubt as the character of the new base,
which is a sort of aldehydine neurine.
            Action of  the Ethylene     Chlorhydrin vpon a-Collidine.
   In order    to obtain   the a-collidine quaternary base corresponding to
neurine the method        just indicated was employed.               The reaction is.
however, more rapid than in the previous case ; and after heating
for a few hours the oily layer disappears, excepting a few black drops
which still float on the liquid.          The liquid on being extracted with
ether, evaporated in the vacuum, and finally treated by platinum
chloride, furnishes a crystalline orange-yellow precipitate less soluble
in water, and much less stable than the preceding one. The analyses
of this salt, dried over sulphuric acid, gave the following results ; —

   In the preparation of tubes for our experiments      was often noticed      it
that, after the exhaustion had been carried to a certain degree, the
passage of a strong current had the effect of increasing the pressure.
This appeared to be due to an expulsion of gas from the terminals
themselves by the passage of the discharge.      And accordingly the use
of such currents from     time  to time during the process of exhaustion
was adopted for making the vacuum more perfect and more permanent
than otherwise would have been the case. On the other hand,           was                                it
also noticed, that after the tube had been taken off the pump and sealed
in the usual way, the passage of a strong current had in some instances
the effect of decreasing the pressure.      We thus met with two effects,
apparently due to the same cause, but diametrically opposite in
character.
   The fact of the tube being on the pump or off         did not appear to    it
be  at all material  to  the   question, because   the first effect could be
obtained when the tube was temporarily shut off by a stopcock.           Nor
indeed did either the first or  the second effect depend upon    the absolute

pressure, although neither was observed except when the pressure was
such as to approach the stage when Crookes' phosphorescence      was
produced.
   These phenomena also reproduced themselves in another way. Some
tubes, after having been completed and taken off the pump, showed a
decreased pressure after a prolonged passage of a strong current,
others   an increased pressure, but among both classes tubes were not
unfrequently    found which recovered their original pressure after a
period of rest or cessation of discharge.
  Matters remained in this rather confused state until we observed
with more care than before a tube of which the exhaustion was near
the phosphorescent state, and of which both terminals were metallic
cones, and consequently presented large surfaces for any action which
might take place upon them.
    In what may be considered to have been its normal condition, this tube
showed three or four large white striae with a dark space of con
siderable size round the negative terminal.        On passing the discharge
through    the   tube for  some    minutes  the  dark  space increased, the
striae became fewer and feebler in illumination, the green phosphores
cence began to show itself, and the discharge showed the usual signs
of reduced pressure.       On suddenly reversing the current the striae
became again more numerous and more brightly illuminated, precisely
as they would be by an increase of pressure, while the other features
of the discharge in a great measure resumed their original character;
and not only so, but by a comparatively slow process, occupying many
seconds in duration, the indications of increasing pressure continued
still further, until they implied a pressure even beyond that at which
the tube stood when the experiments began, after which the appear
ance slowly changed         as before in a manner indicating reduced
pressure.    This reversal of the discharge was repeated many times
with the same result in every case.             The amount of change in
pressure indicated by the appearance on each reversal was found to
depend within wide limits upon the duration of the previous discharge,
or, what is the same thing, upon the amount of depression below the
normal pressure indicated by the previous discharge.
    The most probable explanation of these phenomena appears to be this,
that the effect of the discharge is actually to alter the pressure in the
tube, not by any modification in the chemical composition of the gas, still
less by anything that could be represented as a destruction of matter,
but simply by driving occluded gas out of one terminal, and by drawing
it in, or occluding     it,
                          at the other.    On reversing the discharge, the
operation  is  reversed, and   the  occluded  contents of one terminal are
thrown along the tube to be occluded at the other.         This view of the
mechanism   whereby the observed phenomena are produced   supported
                                                              is
by the absence of these appearances when the terminals are compara

tively small and the pressure is such that the occluded contents of the
metallic mass forming one terminal would form only a small fraction
of the total mass of gas in the tube ; for in that case the pressure, and
consequently the appearance of the discharge, would be affected only in
an inappreciable degree by the injection of the contents of the ter
minal. It should also be added that, when the terminals are of unequal
size, the effects are unequal, as might have been expected.
   The phenomenon in question appears to have so important a bearing
on the mechanism of the discharge itself, that it becomes a question of
great interest to determine whether the missing gas is to be found in
either of the terminals ; and if so, whether the ejection takes place at the
positive, and the occlusion at the negative, terminal, or vice versd. For
this purpose   I have devised a tube with three terminals, but have not
yet  had  time to complete its construction or to make the experiment.

" The Effects of certain

       Period of Muscle Contraction."             By Gerald F. Yeo, M.D.,
       F.R.C.S., and Theodore Cash, M.D. Communicated by
      Dr. Sanderson, F.R.S. Received June 15. Read June lb',

   Although the labour of many physiologists has been directed to
wards the consideration of Latency, it seemed to us desirable that the
subject should receive a little addition in some of its details, and it
was with the object of thus filling up deficiencies, and at the same
time of studying systematically the effect of some of the agents which
modify the time of latency, that we undertook the investigations, the
results of which we desire to lay before the Society.
   In 18G7 Helmholtz and Baxt* published the results of experiments
they had instituted touching the speed of conduction in motor nerves
as measured by the relative latencies obtained in a nearer and more
distant stimulation of a nerve-trunk (frog) or of the skin above it,
and in publishing their experiments of 1870 they drew attention to
the modifying influeuce of temperature upon such conduction.                      Thus
         * " Monatsbericht d. Berliner Acad.," 1S67,  s. 228,  and 1870,  8. 184.

                     On the Latent Treriod of Muscle Contraction.          403
they saw the speed decreased to a great extent when the nerve was
laid upon ice, and even slight variations in the room temperature
sufficed to produce material changes.   Troitzky* came to the conclu
sion that conduction is the most rapid in the frog's nerve between 10°
and 20° C, and diminishes both by higher and lower temperatures.
The influence of temperature could, however, he concluded, be subor
dinated to a certain extent by increasing the strength of the
stimulation.
   That a powerful shock is more potent to induce rapid conduction
than a weaker one has been upheld by Valentinf and von "Wittich
as well as by Troitzky, but has been denied by Rosenthal^ and
Lautenbach.§    These interesting results would have been still more
valuable had accurate corrections been made for the variations in
the rapidity of the initial changes taking place in the muscle itself
during the latent period, for, as Hermann suggests, changes in the
strength of the stimulus may cause these variations to be con
siderable.
  An instrument, designed by du Bois Reymond — the " Frosch-
             "
Unterbrecher — has made the fact apparent that the period of latent
energy elapsing between stimulation and obvious contraction also
increases if increasing weights, acting as
                                               " after-
                                                        weights," be laid in
the supported pan suspended from the muscle.           Thus, whilst at lever-
tension  — at  which   point  the support was   fixed — the latency may be
less than          second, under a weight of 200 grms. it may be more
than twice as much.       It is evident that whether the muscle be " free-
               or " after-weighted," until it has reached a state of
            "
weighted
counterbalancing tension as regards the weight it is to raise, no ele
vation from the abscissa can be effected.         The free-weighted muscle
is already stretched as regards the greater number of its fibres by a
small weight (30 — 40 grms. for gastrocnemius of frog), whilst tho
after-weighted has to attain a similar state of tension before it can
commence its true lift.      Variations in latency are then to be expected
according to tho connexion in which we place the weight and the
            Place|| and Klunder^f remark that            after a muscle has
muscle.                                                         if,
been powerfully extended, and while              returning, by reason of its
                                                   it    is
elasticity, towards its normal condition, a stimulation be applied, the
latency may become as short as the j-J-g —                  second, a result
which Haidenhain** inclines to attribute to the pernicious effects of
the previous tension.

    The instrument which served ns for registration of the contraction
was a modification      of Fick's pendulum myograph, manufactured by
tho Cambridge Scientific Instrument Company. It was provided with
an extensive arc, having movable catch adjustments, so that the
velocity of the recording surface could be readily modified.           The
primary current was broken by the arm of the swinging pendulum,
and if occasion required a second contact, the relation of which to its
neighbour could be regulated by a micrometer screw, could be em
ployed in conjunction. The recording plate could be elevated so as to
register a series of some 30 — 40 curves, one over the other. The moist
chamber, containing the muscle, &c., was placed on a table which
could be withdrawn or advanced to meet the plate (acting like the
slide-rest of a lathe) without altering the relationship of the writing
point to the recording surface.      Within the moist chamber, and sur
rounding the muscle, passed      several coils of metal tubing, which could
be heated or cooled at pleasure by passing heated or iced water through
it from a system of tubes terminating above in double funnels.
    The temperature was accurately measured by a Centigrade thermo
 meter placed in the moist chamber, its bulb being equidistant from the
 muscle and the tubing.       The lever, designed by one of us, was made
 of two straws separated to the extent of 1^ inch at their union with
 the axis, and converging at the other end to a pointed strip of pla
 tinum foil, which acted as a pen. The weight of this lever, without
 the friction of the pen, was about 1 grm.       The weight was suspended
 round the axis of rotation, except in those cases in which it appeared
 desirable to apply it in the line of traction of the muscle.         Great
 steadiness, absence of appreciable friction, and elimination of the effect
 of the " throw up " sustained by a lever weighted anywhere except at
 its axis, were ensured by this adjustment, and the great lightness of
 the lever arm.
     In view of the fact that the nerve is more rapidly influenced by
 those agents which we proposed to employ in modifying the manifes
  tations of latency, and also because we desired to look chiefly to the
 actual effect such agents produced on the changes necessary to the
  subsequent contraction, rather than to the varying conductivities of
  the nerve, we chose the curarised muscles (the gastrocnemius of the
 frog) for the bulk of our experiments.           We may mention in this
  place that we found the variations between the non-curarised and
  curarised muscles, both stimulated directly and at room temperature
      — 18°
  (17        C.)i so slight that they may be disregarded.
     Maximal stimulation was employed in all cases, except where other
  wise specified.    Our experiments were performed on Rana temp.,
 between the 10th January and the middle of April.
     Though we have thought well to give frequently the measurement
  of a series of curves taken from a8 single muscle, we have done this

                   On the Latent   Period of Muscle Contraction.                  4G5
  only in order to show a sample selected from a large number of carves,
  and presenting in a fair degree the peculiarities which custom has
  taught us to expect from the circumstances of the case.
     The first experiments were directed to contrasting the latencies of
  contractions obtained by stimulating nerve or muscle.
     The length of nerve attached to the preparation which yielded the
  following measurements was 12'5 millims.                 The weighting of the
  muscle was free, and the weights which were suspended sufficiently
  long before stimulation to cause a proportionate extension increased
  from lever weight, i.e., 1 grm., up to 100 grms.
     The duration of the latency and of the contraction is expressed in
  figures indicating the number of double vibrations of the tuning fork
  used to record the time.        Each D.V. corresponds to 8j-J^ of a second,
  which fraction of time therefore forms the unit in the following
  tables.    The altitude of the curve is given in millimetres.

8will be at once appreciated after an examination of the table.                  The

    The greatest difference appears to obtain at the extremes of the
scale, i.e., when the weight is first applied, and when it is beginning
to be too severe for the muscle, whilst in the middle part of the
series the variations are slighter and more uniform in character.          If
we glance at the other two columns in Table I, we see that this middle
part contains the shortest curves exhibiting altitudes midway between
those of the extremes.       The fact established by Marey,* that a muscle
hindered by the weight applied to it from reaching its maximnm of
contraction is slower in its relaxation than its less weighted neigh
bour, accounts for the long low curve under 100 grms.
    As regards the comparison between the muscle stimulated directly
and indirectly, we may state from our results, that which previous con
sideration had convinced us must be the case, viz. : —
    At ordinary room temperature, the increase of latency bears the
same proportion to the increase of free burden in direct as in indirect
stimulation.
    2. It has been alledged that curare increases the latency, and as we
desired to use the curarised muscle in certain of our experiments, we
made comparative observations with the result of convincing ourselves
that as a rule no such prolongation occurs ; but that the course of
latency of the curarised and of the non-corarised muscle, both stimu-

 may exercise upon the curve of contraction, we cannot enter here.

    There are slight variations usually in the second place of decimals
between the two columns,          but if the figures are — as we believe them
to be— true measurements, we still require more extensive proof of a
permanent difference than the occasional variation of a ta*o0".
    Our result then is that at room temperature, the latency of the
curarised and non-curarised muscles directly stimulated is equal for
equal weights.
    3. What is the relationship as to latency of the free-weighted muscle
tensed in proportion to the weight it carries, to the after-weighted
muscle, which has only the same slight initial tension under similar
weights ? As this question seemed to us to be an interesting one, we
made a few observations,         so as to obtain a fair contrast between two
muscles placed     under   these   widely differing circumstances.
   The after-weighted muscle was supported, so that the weight of
10 grms. just rested upon the catch, from which the contracting muscle
raised it. We give a double column of the resulting differences of the
free-weighted and the after- weighted muscles.
   The influence of the support seems to increase the earlier latencies,
and it is in great measure owing to this effect that the variation is so
much greater in the case of the after-weighted than of the free-
weighted muscle.

 parallel to a mechanical support of a heavier weight. If the weight
 i.-an be   lifted without the co-operation of these fibres, the latency is
 short, but should the addition of only 10 grms. require the tension of
 many of them, the latency becomes markedly increased.                      Thus it is
 that the greatest differences lie towards the commencement                      of the
 scale   of weight increment     of a free-weighted muscle, and thus that the
after-weighted muscle shows such greatly prolonged latencies at the
 same period.
     We conclude therefore —
     That the latency of a muscle with supported weight is greater than
 with unsupported weight, and that the greatest variation between the
two occurs under the lighter weights.
     4. We have referred at the commencement of this paper to the
influence of weight upon latency, and we have shown subsequently
that the addition of 100 grms. causes a marked prolongation of this
period. As we desired as far as possible to avoid fatiguing the muscle,
we did not cany our weights, as a rule, beyond 100 grms., though a
few observations on fresh muscle weighted with 200 grms. were made
in order to see in what manner the further weight acted.                          If we
examine the prolongation of the latency caused by increasing the
weight gradually from lever weight to 100 grms. we find that there is an
average increase of about '0003".
     In glancing over a number of observations and preparing their aver-
nges, we found that the greatest influence exercised by any one weight-
difference (of a series of equal increments), was that resulting from
the suspension of the first 10 grms. from the lever ; this might cause an

              On  the   Latent Period of Muscle Contraction.            469
average increase of 81625      D.V. The application of the three succeed
ing  10 grm.   weights    would have a conjoined effect of "3384 D.V. The
                     —
middle weights 40 70 grms., as has been already noticed, have less
influence in prolonging the latency, their value would be about
•284 D.V., whilst the last series of these has again a much larger
effect, equal together to '354 D.V. ; thus the extremes show greater
variations amongst themselves than do the constituents of the inter
mediate series.

    We feel inclined to hazard a corresponding division on mechanical
 grounds as follows :
                         —
    Lever (wt. 1 grm.)=tension of many muscle bundles very incom
 plete.
    10— «40=these bundles brought into action by the added weight.
    40 — 70= all bundles active and unwearied.
    70 — 100= strain of some of bundles, commencing weariness.
    During the suspension of the second 100 grms. the variation in
 latency only amounts to about one-half of that which obtains during
 the first 100 grms.
    Latency is then prolonged by increasing the weight, but it does not
 increase in a definite ratio to the increase of such weight.
    5. Our attention was next turned to the effect of fatigue upon the
 muscle in modifying the latency occurring after stimulation. To
 induce fatigue we delivered to the muscle a certain number of opening
                                           —
 induction shocks — maximal intensity in a given time, or we admitted
 an interrupted current completely tetanizing the muscle for a specified
                                                       for a short interval a
 period. Alter the muscle had remained at rest
 carve was taken, and the comparison of the latency of this curve with
 that taken before the tetanus or induction shocks had been adminis
 tered was supposed to represent the effect of the stimulation which
 had intervened. A weight of 10 grms. only was applied to the lever
  during these experiments, so that injury from undue tension of the

 470                    Dre. G.  F. Yeo   and  T. Cash.
 muscle   fibres might be avoided.      The temperature   of the room was
 from   17° to 18°85  C.
    In  the case of fatiguing by simple indnction shocks, 100 stimula
 tions were delivered (one every 2") from Ludwig's clock between the
 registration of every two stimulations.         The results showed that
 whether in the case of the curarised mnscle or of the healthy muscle
 stimulated indirectly, the first 5 — 700 shocks produced but very
 slight changes, not amounting frequently in all to an increase of over
 T'„ of a double vibration, or '00055".
    A curious result occurring occasionally after a few hundred stimu
lations only had been administered was that the latency became
actually diminished to a slight extent, namely '00027" to '00044", as
 if the moderate amount of exertion through which the muscle had
 passed favoured the more rapid consummation of the changes in the
 muscle preliminary to contraction.       This diminution was followed by
 a return through the original to a more rapidly increasing latency.
 The prolongation after 900 — 1,000 contractions is distinct 800132"
 to '00222", whilst after 1,300 — 1,500 a rapid prolongation associated
 with loss of excitability (as shown by the long shallow curve with
 greatly retarded relaxation) is seen.
    The following figures illustrate the course of such a case.    Gastroc

    When tetanus was used asa means of fatigue the interrupted current
was admitted for 10" to the muscle, and after the fibres had relaxed
so that the lever had regained the original abscissa the comparison
curve was taken.
    We find that the change occurring in the latency is not altogether
dissimilar to that of the muscle stimulated by simple induction shocks,
that is to say, that the increase dnring the first 6 — 8, 10" stimula
tions is not very great ; but that after this point the latency tends to
increase rapidly   till at the 13th, 15th, 10-second  tetanus a much pro

longed latency with an associated low, long curve, showing great
viscosity or slowness of extension, is to be observed.   It differs in this
respect, however,   that the lengthening   of the latency is already well
marked after the muscle has been subjected once or twice to the 10"
tetanus.   It is not unusual after a lengthening of the latency has
occurred for it again to diminish, if not to a point below the original,
at any rate to one distinctly below some of its predecessors.         This
peculiarity does not persist to the point at which the viscosity of the
muscle becomes increased and the curve much prolonged, but coexists
with a strong contraction followed by complete relaxation, and this
point, be it coincidence or not, is worthy of note.

120'' tetanus administered in the course of about 30' at regular in
tervals causes a prolongation of '00666''.   Fatigue is more rapidly
induced by indirect than by direct stimulation.
   Fatigue then increases the latency, at first slowly (500 induction
shocks or 60" tetanus), and then more rapidly             till   the exhaustion of
the muscle (1,500 single contractions or 130" tetanus) when a much
prolonged latency occurs.  Near the commencement of stimulation a
temporary diminution of the latency is occasionally to be recognised.
   6. We have mentioned,   at the commencement     of this paper, that
Helmholtz, Wandt, and others regarded the strength of the shock as
playing an important role in modifying the length of latency, and we
also pointed out that this view had been opposed by Rosenthal and
Lautenbach. As the question appeared of importance, we directed
our attention to      it,
                      in the hope that we might be able to contribute
something  to its elucidation.
 * The muscle   was apparently contracting slightly when stimulation   was delivered.

472                  Drs. G. F. Yeo and T. Cash.
    Our method of procedure was to remove the secondary coil of du
Bois Reymond's induction apparatus to a considerable distance from
the primary and gradually to approximate            it,
                                                testing both directions of
the current in each instance till distinct contraction producing a legible
curve was obtained.      Electrodes were applied to both nerve and
muscle, so that the position of the secondary coil at which direct or
indirect stimulation caused contraction might be noted.           A much
more closely approximated position of the secondary coil to the
primary    is necessary for direct stimulation to be effective than for
indirect. One Daniell was employed in the earlier experiments and in
the later two Grove's elements were introduced into the primary
 circuit.
    A contraction first occurred when the secondary coil (opening
 shock indirect) stood at 28 centims.      No other mode of stimulation
 was effective till an approximation of       centims. was reached, when
                                                9
 an indirect closing shock became operative.         At    centims. direct
                                                                6
 opening shocks prodnced contraction, but the most powerful direct
 closing shocks, of which the apparatus and the single element were
capable, were ineffective.
   The contraction here, though maximal for indirect was submaximal
for direct stimulation.    The shock was at no point exhausting to the
muscle for the altitude and length of the contraction, except in the
case of the first, which  distinctly submaximal, remain remarkably
                               is

or, in other words, the diminution of latency under this increase of
stimulation was only "15, or the'80008", an effect so slight that    may       it
pass almost without notice in ordinary experiments, but      nevertheless
                                                                    is
of sufficient value in showing that an increase of intensity of stimula
 tion, only carried so far as to produce a continuance of healthy re
 action, still modifies the latency to a certain extent. The temperature
 of the room, 17°'5 C. remained constant during this observation.
    In another experiment, two Grove's cells (small) were substituted
 for the Daniell, and thus a much greater potential was available for
 stimulating purposes.     The muscle was uncurarised and the stimula
 tion direct.

 and until it was removed again to 8 centims. from the primary, no
curve produced reached the abscissa during the passage of the
registering plate : there was an alarming viscosity manifested, and we
feared injury to the muscle, but on distancing the induction coil a
pretty fair recovery was made, the latencies rapidly lengthening, till
at the position in which a value of 3-75 was first obtained, 3'8 was
now recorded, the curve meanwhile, though somewhat (3'6 D.V.)
lengthened, approximated to its primal form.
    This experiment was repeated again with curarised muscles, and the
result obtained coincided with our former experience in the abridge
ment which the latency undergoes under increase of stimulation. We
give, in Table V, an illustration of increase of stimulation, ultimately
proving fatal to the muscle.

   Our first latency in this chart commences with the secondary coil,
13'5 centims. from the primary, and has a value of 3'45 D.V., and this
we find at 6 and 7 centims. curtailed to 2-2, the smallest figure recorded.
At this point (6 centims.) the curves which have hitherto been of
fairly equal lengths, though of increasing altitude, show a consider
able elevation after the active phase of contraction is over, the lever
pen failing to reach the abscissa for some time after the plate has
passed.   The stimulation is still increased and the muscle remains
longer contracted, whilst the curve falls in altitude ; a stage of irrita
bility which lasts till the secondary roll has passed l'S centims., and
which is attended with short though varying latencies, passes, and
after a sudden and extensive prolongation of the period, the last shock
                             " home " kills the muscle
delivered with the coil                                          completely, the last
latency being 3'65 D.V. We have here, then, a case in which the
violence of the shock at last employed, kills the muscle and death is
preluded by a distinct lengthening of latency, so that we cannot
ascribe the changes of the earlier part of this series to morbid pro
cesses, any more than the shortening of those of the table last con
sidered, though the strength of the shock when the coils were nearly
approximated was no doubt very great.                 We conclude, then, that the
length of the latency is largely influenced by the strength of stimula-

               On the  Latent Period of Muscle Contraction.         475
tion, and an abridgement of the former of more than the             of a
second is readily produced by strong stimulation, without inflict
ing permanent injury upon the muscle. With stimulation of a much
milder character, more closely related to physiological stimulation, a
very slight shortening of the latency may be observed.
    7. When Helmholtz was investigating the speed of motor nerve con
ductivity, he found that in the case of man this underwent a remark
able change in the summer time, so that its velocity became 60'50
metres per second, or fully twice as much as it had been some time
previously. This acceleration he attributed to the elevation in atmo
spheric temperature occurring at that season, and this conclusion led
him to a theory for the different speeds of conductivity in the upper
arm when the nerve is sheltered and the lower when it is more super
ficial.
    Troitzky, who investigated conduction in the nerve of the frog,
 stated that the speed was greatest between 10° and 20°, and diminished
 both under lower and higher temperatures.
    It will be recollected that our moist chamber was furnished with
 a coil of tubing, which acted as means of producing heat or cold
 according to the temperature of the fluid passed through it ; by means
 of this coil we were able to produce as extensive variations of heat or
 cold as our subject demanded.     Water cooled by a mixture of chipped
 ice and salt in the one funnel, and water heated somewhat above the
 temperature we desired to produce in the other, enabled us by their
 conjoined use to hit the point we needed with precision. The atten
 tion of one of us was fixed upon the thermometer, and at a sign from
 him that the mercury stood at the desired level, the pendulum was
 liberated and the curve registered.
    Some experiments were made to ascertain the effect upon exposed
 nerve of the temperature of the chamber, and with the results of
 these we will begin this section of our subject.
    Our Table (VI) shows the effect of a depression of the tempera
 ture through 12° C. (from 17° to 5°) and of its subsequent elevation
 through 8° (17° to 25°) or of a total excursion through 20°. The
 variation of latency accompanying this change is from -026" (5°) to
  •0127" (25°), or no less than -0133" or the T'T part of a second.
 Having taken a curve at the room temperature (17° C), we rapidly
 cooled down the muscle to 5°, and then permitting it gradually to
 regain its normal a curve was taken at each degree; when 17° was
 reached we began to heat slowly till we had raised the temperature to
 25°.

   From      these     figures we see that the effect of cooling for equal
degrees is greater than is the effect of heating ; that is to say, that
while cooling through 8 degrees adds 1 D.V. to the latency, heating
through 8 degrees takes only '7 P.V. away from it. The average effect
for degree of cold is 800069", that of heat '00048", and could we take
an average of the whole 12° through which cooling was carried,
the figure would rise to 800077", because the addition of every

                 On  the  Latent Period of Munch Contraction.                         477
 degree of cold after 9° and 10° are reached,                 produces    a more     con
 siderable elongation of latency.
    If  we carry the heating much above this point, we find that there is
 a sudden accession of excitability of the nerve as manifested by a
 much elevated and prolonged curve differing also in contour from its
 predecessors.      This condition increases to a certain point, then
 diminishes, and the entire death of the nerve ensues.                The first indica
 tion of danger occurs at about 27°, and death at 30°— 31°. This
 muscle, however, may still be quite capable of responding to direct
 stimulation if the temperature be not further increased, and revives
 eventually. The following Table VII shows this course of events.

   N.B. — The muscle completely recovered.       A series of curves (direct stimulation)
was subsequently taken from it.
    Heating from 17°, at which the latency is 3810 to 27°, reduces the
latency to 2 D.V., and after this point there is again a slight increase
till the death of the nerve at 31° occurs. That there is, however, a
marked diminution of the latency from 20° to 27°, is plainly to be
seen, as the variation is through '0U3", and this result scarcely coincides
with the assumption that conductivity is impaired after 20° in the case
of the frog.
    The curarised muscle is a more fitting subject for the study of the
                                                                       2 h 2

influence of temperature than is the nerve-muscle preparation, as its
mass prevents the extreme influences under which the delicate nerve
suffers,  being felt to such a large extent.              The curve also is the
expression of the actual effect of a certain temperature upon the
muscle only instead of being that on both nerve and muscle.                       A rise
or fall of temperature         through a certain number of degrees has a
magnified    effect on the nerve-muscle preparation compared to what
it has on the muscle.

   We have before us the result of cooling a curarised                   muscle     down
from 19° to     7°, and then     of heating it to 20°, and the figures represent
fairly the changes in the curve and latency.                 The total addition to
the latency is '8 of a double vibration, or 80044" whilst the addition in
the length of the curve is 24 D.V. The interesting fact is well demon
strated in this Table that the greater the influence of cooling through
a given number of degrees has been upon the latency, the greater is
the effect also on the curve, so that whereas between 19° and 17°, the
latency varies the "15 D.V., and the length of the curve increases only
2 D.V.'s between 9° and 7° where the latency increases -2 D.V., the
curve lengthens 13 D.V., but it is necessary to remember that it is
exactly at this point 9—5°, that cold has such a powerful effect in
prolonging the curve. The lengthening or shortening of latency and
curve accompany each other with considerable precision, though it has

 appeared    to us so far impossible to establish a constant and definite
 relationship between them for all temperatures and conditions.
    Another result otained from the curarised muscle by heating to 30°
 after having cooled to 11°, shows the companionship of latency and
 curve in their variations.

   The latency varies through 1*9, the curve through 23'2 D.V. The
extreme prolongation of the curve at 11° and 12° is an illustration of
that which we think we have seen many times, though we have not
found opportunity to work out the point, viz., that if after heating
a muscle, the temperature be reduced below the normal, the effect of
that reduction is greater in prolonging the latency and the curve than
it wonld have been if starting from the normal only. The converse —
for heating after cooling — appears also to hold good.
   If a muscle be heated or cooled to a certain temperature and be
maintained at that temperature for a considerable time, does the pre
paration acclimatize itself, and do latency and curve show a tendency
to return towards the normal ? Our answer is that they do not.
   A muscle kept at 20° for 25' gave a constant latency of 2875 D.V.,
whilst the curve varied in value only through -2 D.V. ; at 25° for 15'
the latency remained at 1*65, the length of contraction varying
only through '3 D.V., the same result obtained on cooling.
   We conclude then that cold lengthens and heat shortens the latency,

 the effect per degree of the former being greater than the latter. The
 shortest latency for the heated frog muscle occurs at 29 — 3085°, and
 closely precedes rigor.
    Muscles maintained for a considerable time at a given elevation or
 depression of temperature, preserve a constant latency.
    Up to the present the gastrocnemius of the frog has been the only
 muscle upon which we have experimented, and our chief object in
 making this communication is to call attention to the changes in the
 duration of the latency brought about by varying conditions of
 stimulation.   We hope to continue our observation by making similar
 experiments   on  different muscles of various animals, and in a future
paper to enter more fully upon the changes occurring in the other
phases of the contraction, for which purpose further use will be made
 of the tables we have the honour of laying before the Royal Society.

  The values of PQRS, P4, S*, P3S2 were calculated                                   in the following
manner         :
   The squares P2, S2, and the products PS and QR, were first formed.
Then P3, S3 were multiplied together, and the square of PS was
formed : the agreement of these two results verified the values of P-,
S2, P3S2.   The expressions for P4 and S4 were then obtained by
squaring P3 and S3 ; these calculations being performed in duplicate.
To obtain PQRS the expressions for PS and QR were multiplied to
gether; and as a verification the product PQ was formed, and this
was multiplied successively by S and R.

   § 4. If k be put equal to unity the cn and dn become identical, and
the formulas, as is well known, assume the simple forms

Putting    n=8    in these formula?, we have

    When   A; is put equal to 1 the formula? in § 3 should reduce to these
expressions : aud we thus obtain au important verification of their
accuracy.
    Since the denominator of sn 8u, cn 8m, dn 8u is of the order 64 in x,
it is evident that a factor of the order 56 is common to the numerator
and denominator of these expressions when k is put equal to unity.
By putting k=l in the formula? of § 3 and dividing the resulting ex
pression for the numerator of sn 8 it by 1 + 7x3 + 7x* + x6 it is found
that this factor is (1— z2)28, as it should be. And it was verified by
division that the expressions for the numerator of cn 8u and the
common denominator were equal to this factor multiplied by 1 —
 + Gz* — 4z« + z8 and 1 + 28z3 + 70x* + 28s6 + z8 respectively.
    § 5. The expressions P2, S2, P4, S* are respectively the numerators
and denominators of sn2u and of sn4ii, and it seems worth while
 to place on record their values, which are as follows :

" On        the Influence of Coal-dust in Colliery  Explosions.
          No. III." By W.   Galloway.  Received May 30, Read
          June 16, 1881* Revised February 10, 1882.
                                        [Plate       4.]
     InSeptember of last year (1880)             I
                                        commenced a new series of ex
periments    with    coal-dust with a larger apparatus than the one
described at p. 416, vol. 28 of the
                                       " Proceedings."   Excepting the
difference of scale,  however, the two sets of apparatus are nearly the
same in construction, and they are identical as far as the experiment
is concerned.
     A photograph accompanying   the paper, and remaining in the hands
of the Royal Society, represents the apparatus as it stands ready for
work at Llwynypia Colliery.     Its principal details may be sufficiently
understood from a verbal description ; they are as follows : —
   A. The explosion chamber, about 6 feet long by 2 feet in diameter ;
lined with thin strips of wood round about its circumference ; with
two openings, a and      a',
                           in its upper side, the first for admitting fire
damp, the second for igniting the mixture a third opening nearly  ;
below       for letting out the air displaced by the fire-damp is not
              a'
visible. Internally     it   provided with a small centrifugal fan, which
                             is
draws the air and gas    from   the farther end of the cylinder through                 a
pipe    inches
          4     in diameter,   and  concentric with the cylinder, and ejects
it  round its periphery at the nearer end, where              situated.  This it
                                                                              is
mixes the air and gas. The cylinder rests on a carriage with wheek.
and can be drawn back from or brought close up to the rectangular
 chamber, B, to which    it  can be fastened by means of four bolts.
    B. The gallery, about 126 feet long by       feet square inside, made of
                                                              2
wood, consisting of seven pieces, each 18 feet long, placed end to end.
 The separate pieces are hooped with iron bands, and one side of each
 can be opened like a door 18 feet long by          feet   inches wide, with
                                                                  2           3
 horizontal hinges.    The iron hoops are so arranged that they consti
tute hinges, hasps,   and  locking-bolts for the doors at the same time.
    C. The measuring cylinder; its upper end             connected with the
                                                                         is
 explosion   chamber,  on   the  one   hand, by means of the india-rubber
 tube attached at the point a, and with the fire-damp pipe on the other
 hand by means of the tube         its lower end
                                   b;               connected to the bottom
                                                                  is
 of the vessel D by means of the flexible pipe                  provided with
                                                                         c;   it   is
 three stop-cocks and a water-gauge.
    D. A vessel that can be raised above or lowered below the level of
 the measuring cylinder by means of a windlass,                          F,
                                                         with a rope passing
 over the pulley,  d, and attached to the bow at its top.

    K. The steam pipe.
    When the vessel D is fall of water and raised to the point it
occupies in the drawing, its contents flow into the measuring vessel C,
and expel the air contained in it. The vessel D is then lowered until
its top is under the level of the bottom of the measuring cylinder, and
the water flows back out of the latter into the former ; and when the
upper end of the measuring cylinder is in communication with the
fire-damp pipe it fills with that gas. By raising the vessel D again to
the position occupied at first, the fire-damp can be expelled and
driven into the explosion chamber at a.
    Following are the various operations that require to be performed
before an experiment is made : — The explosion chamber is drawn
back and several sheets of paper are inserted between it and the
gallery, so as to form a diaphragm between them.         They are then
bolted together, and the quantity of fire8damp required to produce the
most explosive mixture is forced into the explosion chamber from the
measuring cylinder, at the same time that a corresponding quantity of
air is allowed to flow out below. The lower opening is then plugged,
and the wheel G is revolved 100 times. Meanwhile the fan E can be
supplying heated air to the gallery through the channel which con
nects them ; but in my later experiments I have not found that this
affects the result to an appreciable extent.     The side which consti
tutes the door of each section of the gallery is raised in succession,
and coal-dust is strewed on the floor to a thickness of ^ to     \ inch ;
some is also laid on shelves, which are placed in sets of three, one
above the other, at distances varying from 10 to 20 feet apart.
   When the floor is made damp with water, so as to fix every particle
 of dust that cannot be swept out with a brush, the flame of the fire
damp explosion travels along the gallery to a distance of 12 feet on
the average.    When the gallery contains coal-dust, on the other hand,
the explosion of the fire-damp raises it in a cloud, and the flame
appears to travel as far as the cloud contains more than a certain
minimum amount of dust, and then to die out for want of fuel. A
fair average distance is 70 feet, but it occasionally reaches 80 and
85 feet, and on one occasion it extended to 104 feet.       The natural
supply of fire-damp is too limited to admit of the creation of an
atmosphere with an appreciable proportion of fire-damp in the interior
of the gallery, so that all the experiments have been made with pure
air hitherto ; and, further, as I have already mentioned, I do not find

that heating the air to a temperature of 70° or 80° Fahr. makes any
difference in the result, so that       I have discontinued to do so in the
more recent experiments.
    With this apparatus, as with the smaller one described in my pre
vious paper, of which it is a copy, the inertia and frictional resistance
of the air filling the gallery appears to be a factor of considerable
importance.       For instance, if the whole of the sections are closed,
making the gallery continuous throughout its whole length of 126
feet, the flame of the coal-dust does not reach further than 50 or 60
feet from the origin ; but if the sides of the fourth and fifth sections
are open, making the closed portion only 54 feet long, and leaving
36 feet with only three sides, the flame will, as a rule, be 70 feet and
sometimes 80 and 90 feet long.          The flame of the coal-dust appears to
be self-supporting     in  pure  air, but it cannot keep up the disturbance
necessary to supply itself with fuel on this small scale, and, conse
quently, it cannot get much beyond the point to which the more
energetic action- of the fire-damp explosion has extended.             I will not
pursue this subject further at present, as it is my intention to continue
the experiments, and        I hope to have another opportnnity of stating
the results.
    Three great colliery explosions took place during the year 1880,
namely, Risca on the 15th of July, with a loss of 120 lives ; Seaham
on the 8th of September, with a loss of 164 lives ; and Penygraig on
the 10th of December, with a loss of 101 lives.               For the purpose of
the present paper I visited Risca Colliery on the 24th of October, and
 Seaham Colliery on the 24th of November of the same year.                  I had
also an excellent opportunity of acquiring an intimate knowledge of
the details of Penygraig explosion, having been* entrusted with the
 direction of the exploring operations, and having visited the workings
 twice within the first twenty-four honrs after its occurrence, and
 several times at a later period.        The workings of each of these mines
 were dry, and their roadways were covered with dry coal-dust, from
 the faces at which the coal was worked to the bottom of the upcast
 and downcast shafts ; but, with the exception of making this general
 remark regarding them,         I  do not propose, in this place, further to
 refer to the Risca or Seaham explosions.
                                I
     At Penygraig Colliery made three principal sets of observations
 which have not, I believe, been made in any previous case of the kind,
 and they appear to throw a considerable amount of light on the nature
 of the accident.      They were as follows : —
     1. The flame of the explosion had passed through or penetrated into
 every part of the workings with the exception of one wet heading d
  (see the accompanying plan) at the bottom of the downcast shaft.
    *  It should be mentioned in this place that I  had no connexion with or know
 ledge of Penjgraig Colliery before the explosion took place.

                              of^Coal-dust
     Four of the five men who escaped with their lives were in the
 heading d at the time of the explosion. They saw the flash, but were
 not burnt.       The fifth, who was working in a cul de sac at e, was
 slightly burnt, and remained unconscious for many hours.               The
 unshaded      galleries on the plan, except d, show the universal
 distribution of the flame, which must also be supposed to have passed
 over the ground covered by falls of roof due to the explosion.        The
 shaded patches show the points at which the evidence of a high
 temperature, such as really charred timber and thick deposits of
 coked coal-dust, were strongest.        It will be seen that each of these
 points  was    either  in a cul de sac,   or was approachable from two
 opposite directions.
    2. Five or six of the seventeen bodies found between the points
 6 and e in the main heading were in a kneeling posture, their mouths
 were covered with their hands, and their faces were pressed into the dust
 on the floor.     One body in the roadway I was in the same position;
 another near him was lying on his side with his coat drawn closely over
 his mouth and nose, and held tightly with one hand ; and a third, lying
 at the opposite sideof the roadway, had his mouth pressed on the ground,
 his head having been twisted round to some extent so as to admit of
 this. I observed that two of the first group and the three constituting
the last group had been burnt after they had assumed these positions,
 but unfortunately     I  did not particularly examine the others, as they
had been removed before the true significance of these circumstances
 had dawned upon me.
    3. There were deposits, or crusts, of coked coal-dust in every
working place in the mine (from the district with the two small arrow
heads above the upcast shaft to the district g above the downcast
shaft at the opposite extremity), that is to say, where the coal-dust was
comparatively free from impurities, and capable of adhering to the
timber and other objects when thrown against them in a' fluid or
semi-fluid state. On the other hand, the same kind of deposits were
very rare, and for the most part entirely absent, in the main roadways
through which the flame must necessarily have passed in travelling
from one district to another, that is to say, where tlte coal-dust was
largely mixed with shale-dust and other impurities, and consequently
incapable of cohering when heated.
    The following table of analyses which the late Professor A. Freire-
Marreco, of Newcastle-on-Tyne, kindly prepared for me, shows the
composition of the coal itself, that of the dost from the floor, &c.,
and that of the so-called coked coal-dust.
     Each number on the table corresponds to the same number on the
plan, which indicates the spot at which the sample in question wa?
collected.

   The small black single-headed arrows show the direction in which
the deposits of coked coal-dust were thrown against the objects to
which they were found adhering. The double-headed arrows show
that it had been thrown against the same objects from two sides,
probably first from one side and then from the other.                      It should be
carefully noted that, as a rule, the arrows point away from the solid
ground, and consequently in a direction contrary to that in which the
blast must of necessity have travelled in passing through or into
every working place in the colliery, except the one in which the
explosion originated.        It must, therefore, have been deposited during
the retrograde movement of the air, and this corresponds to the observa
       I
tion had previously made at Llan Colliery in regard to the same
phenomenon (" Proc. Roy. Soc.," vol. 24, p. 359). If these deposits
were to be found everywhere in the workings, and if the currents
which produced them were not liable to baffling and reversal from
local circumstances, it is obvious that the arrows showing the direc
tion in which they had been thrown would nearly all point backwards
to the spot at which the explosion had originated. Although differences
of opinion were expressed as to the causes of the explosion in the case
before us, it was admitted on all hands that it had probably originated
somewhere in the neighbourhood of the point o.
    Lastly, although the existence of accumulations of explosive gas
appears to have been almost unknown in the mine, there could be no
doubt that a very large amount of fire-damp was being constantly

given off at a more or less uniform Tate along the face of the solid
coal.   From observations made at the time I estimated that the air-
current, which would receive a certain proportion of gas from each
working place through which it passed in succession, would, on leaving
the last working place nearest the upcast shaft, always contain rather
more than 2 per cent, of fire-damp ; and     I  have no doubt whatever
that this latent fire-damp, acting in conjunction with the coal-dust, was
a most important factor in promoting and intensifying the explosion.
