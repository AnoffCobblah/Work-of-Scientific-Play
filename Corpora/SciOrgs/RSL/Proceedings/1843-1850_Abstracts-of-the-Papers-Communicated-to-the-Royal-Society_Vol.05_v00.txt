 the water taken thence: in a letter to S. H. Christie, Sec. R.S.,
 from Lieut. Manley Dixon, R.A.
    The letter is as follows :—
       DEAR SIR,                              V\'oolwich, October 6th, 1843.
    Captain F. Eardley Wilmot, on his voyage home from the Cape of
 Good Hope in the spring of this year, observed one night a remark
 able, though not very uncommon appearance of the sea.               This was
 a large and very luminous spot, which was clearly de<U+FB01>ned by a
 sharp edge. He thus describes the appearance, and also the steps

                                               4'76
 which he took to obtain some of the water for the purpose of
 bringing it home to England and submitting it to a chemical test.
    “ The sea was covered with so brilliant a surface of silver light
 that we could see to read, and the shadows of ropes, &c. were
 strongly marked.    We sailed through it for about four hours. In
 one place it had an edge; and we sailed out of it for nearly half an
 hour, when we again entered it as abruptly, and         left    when          it,
                                                 <U+FB01>nally. The water
 the edge of the illuminated part was strongly de<U+FB01>ne
 was taken up in      clean bucket and put into
                            a                       carefully cleaned
                                                                 a

 bottle; about 10° north latitude."
r
    As Captain Wilmot’s time in England was limited, he left the
 bottle of sea water with me, and took the <U+FB01>rst opportunity of show
                                              I

     “ DEAR SIR,-—I have examined the water, and           peculiar in
                                                                     it   is
 some points.          It
                   contained much sulphuretted hydrogen, and also a
 portion of solid deposit, which was about one half sulphur and the
 other half organic matter.    There has no doubt been considerable
 change in the contents of the water, and      cannot now recognise
                                                           I
 Organic forms; but the presence of the animal matter, the sulphur,
 and the sulphuretted hydrogen, all agree with the idea that the water,
 When taken up, was rich in animals or animalculae.

       GENTLEMEN,
In   addressing you on the present recurrence of our Anniversary,        I
have to make the same acknowledgment to the Council which has
assisted me during the past year, that 1 have had to make to their
predecessors.    If your affairs have proceeded prosperously, it has
been mainly owing to their unremitted exertions.            Since our last
Anniversary, there are not many events to which it will be my duty
to refer.    The <U+FB01>rst that I shall bring under your notice is one of
the most gratifying description—the return of Captain James Clark
Ross, and the vessels under his orders, from the Antarctic regions of

                                      4-78
the globe.      This expedition, undertaken by the Government in a
great degree on the recommendation of the Royal Society, has re
turned after almost entire success. 1 trust that the account of this
most interesting voyage will be given to the public by its gallant
commander, who has approached to both limits of the world.              A
portion of its valuable scienti<U+FB01>c details has been already given to
our Society ; and the magnetic observations made by Captain Ross
and his of<U+FB01>cers, with so much assiduity and ability, will be the
enduring monument of their fame, as long as industry and science
are held in honour by mankind.           The magnetic maps of the South
Polar regions will be a result which all philosophers must hail with
delight, while the geographer will rejoice in the advancement of our
knowledge so far to the southward of all former navigation, and in
our acquaintance with a new polar volcano, compared to which
 Hecla sinks into insigni<U+FB01>cance.
     It is a great addition to our pleasure on this occasion, that so few
 casualties have happened during the three years’ absence of Captain
Ross and Captain Crozier from England, and that no o<U+FB02>icer or sailor
has been a victim to disease, except one seaman who died on the
homeward passage.         This, when we re<U+FB02>ect on the length of time to
 which the expedition extended, and the severity of the climate that
 it had to face, is no small tribute to the care of the commander of the
two vessels employed, and the skill of the surgeon, to whom the
 health of those on board was committed.           When we advert to the
 dangers that the vessels were exposed to, from the icy barriers of these
 new-found regions of the earth, we cannot be suf<U+FB01>ciently grateful
 to Divine Providence for having preserved lives so valuable to their
 country, and so dear to every lover of science.
     During the last year the Society has lost few of its members.
 Only one of its foreign ornaments has it lost, M. Bouvard, a distin
 guished astronomer.       The number of those who contribute to our
 Transactions is not at all lessened. We have, however, to lament
 the death of an illustrious Prince, who for several years presided
 over our body, and whose regard for us remained undiminished to
 the last. On this occasion we felt it our duty to lay before the
 throne the expression of our respectful condolence with our Royal
 Patroness, on the death of her illustrious uncle; and we also sus
 pended our Meetings, to mark our sense of the loss that we, as
 well as the public, had sustained.
     The Council, in pursuance of its duty, has awarded the Royal
 Medals to Professor Forbes of Edinburgh and Professor Wheat
 stone of King’s College, and the Copley Medal to Professor Dumas.
 I  regret extremely that I cannot bestow the latter on our illustrious
  colleague in person. His presence to-day would be truly gratifying
 to us all.    I  still more regret the absence of Mr. Forbes, as it is
 owing to ill health that he is still on the continent.      I must there
  fore request Mr. Christie to transmit the Medal to his friend.
        Mr. CHRIsTIE,
     In the absence of Professor Forbes,     I must request you to receive

                                        4-79
for him this Medal, which is the second that has been given to him
by the Royal Society.    In awarding it to his researches on the law
of extinction of the solar ra s, the Council have not alone been
guided by their own sense         of’
                               the author's merits, but also by  de         rt

     Sir John Herschel's report, above referred to,   as follows :—" Mr.
                                                           is
Forbes’s paper, as far as my knowledge extends, records the <U+FB01>rst at
tempt, and that in no slight degree successful and satisfactory (consider
ing the very great complexity of the physical considerations      involves
and the di<U+FB01>culty of the experiments themselves), to obtain           a it
                                                                   positive
measure of the extinction of solar heat (as distinguished from light), in
traversing a measured portion of the atmosphere, and that one, of which
 the meteorological    conditions have been carefully ascertained at the two
 extremes, and therefore in which the nature and density of the medium
 traversed within their limits have been determined by direct observation as
 well as such data can be ascertained at all on the great scale. For this
 purpose, simultaneous observations are indispensable;       and in the choice of
 a coadjutor, Mr. Forbes must be allowed to have been highly fortunate.
 The rarity of opportunities for such observations to be made with any
 prospect of    a dependable result,I     am satis<U+FB01>ed, from my own experience,
is   by  no  means   overstated   by  Mr.  Forbes.   That of which he availed
himself seems to have been as nearly unexceptionable as could have oc
 curred, and to have been used with all regard to the obtaining        a  precise
 knowledge of the meteorological particulars capable of in<U+FB02>uencing the
 result.   In such casesa   single series under unexceptionable circumstances
thoroughly worked out may and must afford results far more valuable than
any number of series obtained on less select occasions.
    "The mode in which Mr. Forbes has analysed his own and M. Kiimtz's
observations on the Fsulhorn and at Brientz, as well as the conclusions
he deduces from them, are both in many respects remarkable. The method
of graphical interpolation  is   resorted to throughout, and curves so deduced
expressing at once to the eye and to the reason the simultaneous variations
of all the meteorological elements at both stations, as well as the march
of the actinometer.      The comparison of these last curves leaves no room
to doubt either the practical e<U+FB02>iciency of the method of observation pur
sued, or the nature of the causes in action which give rise to the many
remarkable and corresponding        peculiarities which their forms exhibit, and
which, as general affections of the actinomelric curve, Mr. Forbes has
examined and traced up to their origin in the combination of the sun's
varying altitude, and the hygrometric changes induced on the column of
air traversed by his rays, by the heat already developed.       lt   is
                                                                     a   curious
and complex case of causation in which the direct and immediate cffect of
the cause  is   modi<U+FB01>ed by an indirect one of   a    cumulative kind, resulting
from the totality of its action from its commencement to the time of
observation.
    " The comparison of the hygrometric curves with the actinometric leads
to no very distinct conclusion, though this    is
                                               a     point on which Mr. Forbes
has bestowed great attention.      A     general but not very precise analogy    is
pointed out between the curve of mean dampness and that of relative
extinction; but on the whole, no distinct relation    is    pointed out between
that dampness zrhich a<U+FB02>ects the hygrometer and that which disturbs the
merely aerial extinction of solar heat—(if indeed simple dampness, as such,
be the only or the principal disturbing cause).

not, by anything that   I might say, add to its effect on your minds.
I must, however, be allowed to congratulate_ Mr. Forbes on these
researches, as one of the fruits of his arduous and meritorious la
bours amid the eternal ice and snows of the loftiest region of Europe.
Mr. Forbes now fairly enlisted in that enterprising scienti<U+FB01>c band

Majesty, for your paper entitled “ An account of several new Instru

of acknowledging, on the part of the Royal Society, the great inge
nuity as well as knowledge that you bring to the increase of science.
You not only add to our store of knowledge, but you give to others
the means of doing so too.       You not only set the example of

in question, concludes an extinction of 31.} per cent. of the incident heat

of mean barometric pressure, and         dampness such as prevailed on the

average during the day of observation,       thus appearing to afford       cona

  therefore the greatest satisfaction in being the channel of this award

         Mr. DANIELL,
      I have to request that you will take charge of this Coplcy Medal,
  and transmit it to M. Jean Baptiste Dumas, for his late valuable re
  searches in Organic Chemistry, and more                      those contained
  in a series of memoirs on chemical types and    especially
                                                       the octrine of substi
 tution, and also for his elaborate investigations of the atomic weights
 of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, and other elements. In be
 stowing this Medal, as awarded by the Council of the Royal Society
 for scienti<U+FB01>c labours so important, I may well feel the highest grati
  <U+FB01>cation*.
 the total incident heat at least, and may be even much greater; so that the
 absolute intensity of the solar ray, or such as it has exterior to our at
 mosphere, would appear to have been considerably under-rated.
     “ 2nd. The extinction of heat in a mechanically pure atmosphere has a
 limit, and beyond which it might traverse any, at least a very great additional
 thickness, without further loss.
     “ These conclusions are, however, only so far results of direct observation
 as that they are concluded from it by following out an empirical curve be
 yond its observed limits. Yet when we examine the amount of deviations
 the curve itself exhibits within those limits, and take into consideration
 the very simple apparent law of its curvature and course, it will be allowed
 that the conclusions partake at least of a very high probability, amply suf
 <U+FB01>cient to warrant further research.
     " Besides the simultaneous observations on the Faulhorn and at Brientz,
 Mr. Forbes has stated in this paper the results of a great many other acti
 nometric days’ work, which go to show—lst, that the instmment really is
 one which (its use being fully understood) gives highly consistent and de
 pendable results; 2ndly, that its indications     are in a most remarkable
manner, and instantaneously attfected by changes in the opacity of the at
 mosphere;     3rdly, that in a great number of comparisons between its
 indications on the summit of the Faulhorn with those simultaneously, or
nearly so, at a variety of lower stations, there occurs not one in which the
loss of heat between the stations is not a very large, distinct and easily
measurable quantity.
    “ Mr. Forbes says nothing in this paper of the
                                                           qualities as distinct
from the quantities and chromatic properties or indices of transmissibility
of the heat stopped in the upper regions of the air.       But independent of
any considerations of this nature (which however may materially affect
the relations of vegetation to altitude in mountainous districts), I am dis
posed to regard this paper as marking a considerable epoch in that depart
ment of meteorology which relates to the introduction and distribution of
heat among the strata of our atmosphere, and as likely to be the fore
runner of very extensive and elaborate researches in further prosecution of
the subject."
    * After the classi<U+FB01>cation of organic substances under compound radicals,
no feature in the recent progress of chemistry is more remarkable than the

                                         482
      Having now performed this, the most agreeable duty of a Presi
r
dent, I have the satisfaction to inform you, that Mr. Dollond has
been so kind as to favour us with a bust of his grandfather, John
Dollond. This memorial of one to whose ingenuity astronomy has
been so deeply indebted, will form a valuable addition to our gallery
of illustrious men. I am also able to congratulate the Society on
the acquisition made this day of a bust of the justly celebrated
James Watt, for which we have to give our most grateful thanks to
his son. When we contemplate the features represented with so
much spirit by a Chantrey, and copied so faithfully by a Hoffernan,
vast additions of new compounds produced by the application of arti<U+FB01>cial
 agencies to existing organic products.          To this progress M. Dumas has
 greatly contributed by <U+FB01>xing attention on the removal of one element by
 another, which occurs in these reactions, and in particular to the equiva
 lent substitution of chlorine for hydrogen, which has been successfully
 executed in a variety of substances by M. Dumas himself, and by others
 whom his discoveries and speculations have drawn into this fruitful <U+FB01>eld
 of research.       The preservation of certain fundamental properties in the
 new compounds thus produced, he has referred to the existence of a pecu
  liar arrangement of the constituent atoms in 0. compound, which arrange
  ment is supposed to be preserved on the removal of one atom, or success
  ive removal of several atoms, and their replacement by an equal number
  of atoms of a different element, and is expressed by the “ chemical type."
       In M. Dumas’s <U+FB01>rst memoir on Chemical Types, his views are illustrated
   by the discovery of chloro-acetic acid, a remarkable substance, and highly
   interesting in its composition, being an acetic acid (vinegar), of which the
  whole hydrogen has disappeared, but is replaced by an equivalent quantity
   of chlorine.     In this paper, also, he <U+FB01>rst forms “ marsh gas " by an arti
  <U+FB01>cial process, and shows its relation to the acetates. He also forms a series
   of compounds by the action of chlorine upon marsh gas or “ the gas of the
   acetates."
       The second memoir of the series makes known the action of hydrated
   potass upon the alcohols, and furnishes a new and simple method of pro
   cunng the acid equivalent to a given alcohol.        Thus acetic acid is alcohol,
   in Wl]lCl'I two atoms of hydrogen are replaced by two atoms of oxygen, and
                                                     '
   that acid i s s h own l:o b e produced by the action of hydrate of potass upon
    alcohol at a high temperature, with the evolution of hydrogen gas.           To
    estimate the value of these discoveries, it is necessary to bear in mind the
    importance lately acquired by the bodies of which common alcohol is the
    type. To discover or characterize a body as an alcohol, is to enrich organic
    chemistry with a series of products analogous to those which are presented
    in mineral chemistry by the discovery of a new metal.          M. Dumas then
    applies this new method to other alcohols, and obtains by it formic acid
    from wood-spirit, ethalic acid from the ethol of spermaceti, and valerianic
    acid from the oil of potatoes.
        In the third memoir, M. Dumas, in conjunction with E. Pelégat, de
    scribes certain new compound ethers, containing carbonic acid, one of
     which is remarkable for its analogy to sugar in its composition.
        In addition to this series, M. Dumas, in conjunction with M. Hasfone,
     one of his numerous pupils, has given to the world the results of an elabo
     rate investigation of the atomic weight of carbon, in which, independently
     of the importance of the analytical result obtained, certain defects of the
     method of organic analysis universally practised are <U+FB01>rst pointed out, and
     a degree of exactness and precision communicated to the process which it

                                        4-83
we shall remember a man who by his talents conferred the greatest
bene<U+FB01>ts on the civilized world,—who endowed inanimate machinery
with the means of rapidly passing over the greatest distances by
land, and of overcoming the force of adverse winds upon the ocean,
—who brought to perfection the most important mechanical power
with which man is yet acquainted, if indeed we are ever to see it
surpassed: <U+FB01>nally, a man who united the science of the profound
philosopher to the ingenuity of the original inventor.
     I am sure that the Society will unite with me in the expression
has ncver before possessed. The Council consider these researches relating
 to atomic weights, which hc has since- extended to other elements besides
 carbon, as highly interesting and as greatly enhancing the claim of M.
 Dumas, derived from his memoirs on chemical types, to the distinction of
 the Society's Copley Medal.       That claim he has again increased by the
 more recent investigations he has undertaken of the most delicate and im
 portsnt nature, in the two several departments of inorganic and organic
 chemistry.
     The <U+FB01>rst of these embraces the analysis of air, and the composition of
 water ; inquiries remarkable for the novelty and exactness of the methods
 of analysis, the time and pains bestowed upon them, and the minute accu
 racy of the results.    These new analyses now form the most fundamental
 determinations     in the science.    The superior accuracy of M. Dumss’s
  analysis of water may be estimated from the circumstance, that while, by
  the last determinations lately received, namely, those of Bcrzelius and of
  Dnlong, the proportion of oxygen to 1000 parts of hydrogen was ascer
  tained only between the limits of 7936 and 8042, the new determinations
  limit the proportion of oxygen betwen 8000 and 8003.           While the old
  determinations also were deduced from no more than three analyses, the
  new determinations are deduced from nineteen separate operations.        The
  exactness introduced by M. Dumas into the analysis of air is equally rc
  markable, and the ultimate result is deduced from not less than one hundred
  elaborate analyses of air made by that chemist and his pupils during various
  seasons of the year and in ditferent quarters of the globe.
      In the same inquiry, the object of which is to furnish chemists with
  analytical constants of the highest attainable numerical accuracy, are in
  cluded new determinations of the atomic weights of several other elements
   besides oxygen, hydrogen and nitrogen, the elements of air and water;
   particularly of carbon, to which reference has already been made. These
   results possess peculiar interest, from con<U+FB01>rming a theory which was pro
   mulgated many years ago by Dr. Prout, and uniformly supported since its
   publication by several chemists of this country, although not assented to
   abroad ; namely, that the atomic weights of all other elements are whole
   numbers, or are multiples of hydrogen.       This law M. Dumas has lately
   extended to chlorine, silver, lead, calcium, potassium and sodium.
      The new researches of the same chemist in the department of organic
   chemistry have reference to the composition of the great alimentary prin
   ciples of the animal economy; namely, albumen, <U+FB01>brin, casein and gelatin,
   with their origin in plants, and also the origin of the fat of animals. The
   memoir which contains these inquiries is a model of chemical research,
   equally remarkable for its extent, accuracy and completeness.
      The recent discoveries of M. Dumas have procured for their author, in
   his own country, the high distinction of President of the French Academy,
   and of being the successor of Lacroix as Dean of the Faculty of Sciences
   in the University of Paris.

                                    484'
   of heartfelt sorrow that the services of Mr. Roberton have been lost
   to us by his sudden and lamented death. His attention to his duties,
   his zeal for the honour and interest of our Society must have been
   apparent to you all, and especially to those who have formed part
  of our Council; but his merits were of course still better known to
  the more permanent of<U+FB01>cers of your body, and they entirely concur
  with me in this inadequate testimony of our regret.
      Turning our attention to the obituary of the last year, I shall now
  proceed to read it to you, premising that we have been too recently
  acquainted with the death of M. Bouvard, Jun. to enable us at
  present to give any account of his life and labours.
      HIs ROYAL Hroimsss PruneE Auousrus FREDERICK, DUKE
  or Sussex, Earl of Inverness, and Baron of Arklow, Knight of the
  Garter, and Grand Master of the Order of the Bath, was born on
  the 27th of January, 1773.
      In early life he joined the Whig party in politics, and adhered to
  it till his death. N0 one doubted the sincerity of his opinions;
  indeed, he must have made personal sacri<U+FB01>ces that would forbid
  the possibility of any one's doubting that they were the real con
  victions of his mind. . The decided nature of his sentiments was
  unaccompanied and unobscured by any shade of bitterness, and he
  gave that charitable interpretation to the motives of those with
  whom he differed, that he expected for his own.         The eulogiums
  pronounced upon him, after his death, by the Duke of Wellington
  and Sir Robert Peel, are, indeed, as honourable to them as it is to
 him of whom they spoke. The active part of his life, however,
  was little occupied by the concerns of party; it was rather dedi
 cated to those interests, where happily there is in this country no
 party, or rather, where all are more or less of the same party. It was
 in increasing the funds by which the wants of the orphan and widow
 are relieved, by which the sick are cured, and the ignorant are in
 structed, and by which comfort is given to every species of desti
 tution, that his late Royal Highness seems chie<U+FB02>y to have delighted.
 Next to this was his interest in intellectual pursuits: he collected a
 noble library, especially rich in Biblical Literature, which was the
 more prized by him from his acquaintance with the Hebrew
language.
     He was fond of mechanics, and left at his decease a large collec
tion of clocks and time-pieces, a taste for which he apparently
inherited from his father, George the Third.         He was for many
years President of the Society for the Encouragement            of Arts,
Manufactures and Commerce, a Society that has done much to
encourage mechanical ingenuity.        Finally, he evinced his regard
for natural science, by presiding for several years over our Society,
in whose concerns he would probably have taken a more active
part but for the affection of his eyes, by which he was for some
years deprived partially or wholly of the blessing of sight; a blessing,
which was, however, in a great degree, restored to him by the skill
of Mr. Alexander.         Those Fellows of the Society who are Free

                                   485
masons, would not be satis<U+FB01>ed did I not allude to His Royal High
ness's connexion with that body, of which he was during the latter
portion of his life Grand Master.       In private society, the Duke of
Sussex was kind and affable, and fonder of du|na--lic happiness than
of the state and pomp of his exalted rank. ()n this point, how
ever, I shall not dilate, as the address of a President of a public
body has more to do with the public conduct than with the private
virtues of those about whom he speaks. Sutiice it to say, that when
His Royal Highness departed this life, having many public and
private friends, there probably was no one who was his enemy. He
died on the 21st day of April, at the age of seventy.
    WiLLi.\M Loan FITzGERALD AND VEsi.:v died on the llth day
of last .\Iay. His father was the Right llonouruble James Fitz
gerald, Prime Serjcant of Ireland. lle passed a great part of his
life in the public service of his country.      In 1809, he was a Lord
of the Treasury and a Privy Councillor in Ireland. In I812, he
became Chancellor of the Iixchequer and Pint Lord of the Trea
sury iu Ireland.     He was subsequently sent by the British Govern
ment on a diplomatic mission to Sweden.         At still later periods of
his life, he held the o<U+FB01>iccs of Puyinaster-general     of the Forces, of
 President of the Board of Trade, and of Treasurer of the Navy.
 On the appointment of Lord lillenborough as (iovernor-general of
 India, Lord Fitzgerald succeeded to the situation of President of
 the Board of Control. These various employments left him little
 time for other than political pursuits; but his acceptance of the
 Presidentship    of the Institute of Irish Architects, proves his
 attachment to that branch of the <U+FB01>ne arts which is most intimately
 connected with science.      He was a man of agreeable manners and
 cultivated understanding, and an impressive and able, if not a very
 frequent speaker in Parliament.     He was in delicate health when
 he accepted his last public employment, and it is to be feared that
 the harassing fatigues of of<U+FB01>ce shortened his valuable life.
    DR. Jonn LATHAM was born in the year 1761. Early in life
 he was appointed Physician to the In<U+FB01>rmary at Manchester, where
 he remained three years; and afterwards removed to Oxford, and
 succeeded Dr. Austin as Physician to the County Hospital.             He
 <U+FB01>nally  settled in London,   and obtained,  in succession,  the appoint
 ments of Physician to the Magdalen Hospital, the Middlesex Hos
 pital, and lastly to St. Bartholomew's Hospital.     I-Ie rapidly rose to
 eminence in his profession; but the labours by which he earned
 these successes had undermined his constitution; and, at the age
 of 46, his career was arrested by serious threatenings of consump
 tion, which compelled him, for n time, to abstain from exertion and
 to seek health in the retirement of the country. Contrary to all ex
 pectation he recovered, and was enabled to resume his practice in
 London, which he continued for twenty years longer.
    Dr. Latham did not contribute any paper to the Philosophical
  Transactions; but was the author of several memoirs on practical

                                    486
  subjects in the Medical Transactions of the College.      In 1809, he
   wrote a small volume, entitled “ Facts and Opinions concerning
   Diabetes."   In 1814, he was chosen President of the College of
   Physicians.   The Medical Benevolent Society was founded by him
  in 1816.
     In 1829, having reached his 68th year, Dr. Latham <U+FB01>nally left
  London: he died in April last, in his 82nd year, worn out by
  severe and protracted suffering.
     CHARLEs MACINTOsH, an eminent chemist, was born at Glasgow
  in the year 1766. His father, George Macintosh, a native of Ross
 shire, was a merchant in that city; and his mother was Mary
 Moore, daughter of the Rev. Charles Moore, minister of Stirling.
 Mr. George Macintosh <U+FB01>rst introduced the process of dyeing the
 Turkey, or Adrianople red into Britain, and was much esteemed by
 his fellow citizens for his charitable disposition and active benevo
 lence.     Charles Macintosh’s paternal uncle, William Macintosh,
 obtained some notoriety about the year 1782, by the publication of
 Travels in the East, in which he <U+FB01>rst propounded the greater part of
 those principles of legislation which have since been adopted in the
 government of our Indian Empire; and his maternal uncle was
 Dr. John Moore, the well-known author of 'Zeluco’ and other
literary works of eminence, and father of the celebrated General
Sir John Moore.
     Charles Macintosh received the rudiments of his education at the
Grammar-school of Glasgow, where he was distinguished for docility
of disposition and quickness of parts. From Glasgow he was re
moved to a school at Catterick in Yorkshire; but, being destined for
mercantile life, he was early placed in the counting-house of Mr.
Glasford at Glasgow, then one of the <U+FB01>rst merchants of the day,
where he probably acquired that accuracy in the transaction of
business details for which he was in after-life remarkable.     From a
strong bent towards the pursuit of science, he also about this time,
1782, became a student in the University of Glasgow, and for
several sessions attended the chemical lectures of the celebrated
Dr. Black. It would appear that Black had remarked his assiduity
and aptitude for the study of chemistry, for he was accustomed to
detain young Macintosh after the dismissal of the evening classes,
and, walking with him to and fro in the cloisters of the old court of
the University, he examined him strictly on the subject of his pre
vious prelections; directing his attention to points of importance,
and explaining those of dif<U+FB01>culty in the science as it then stood.
VVhen Dr. Black was removed to Edinburgh, Macintosh became the
pupil of his successor Irvine, with whom he soon became as great
a favourite as he had been with Black.      Whilst as yet a mere boy
he contributed to Curtis’s ' Flora Londinensis’ the account of some
experiments on the culture of woad and madder, and on the mode
of dyeing with the same.       He seems at this time to have been also
a botanical student of the University, and to have made many ex
cursions in the neighbourhood of Glasgow in search of specimens;

                                     -$87
but it was in the branch         of chemical investigation that he was
destined to become     more   conspicuous.      The experiments which he
afterwards made in the application        of  incinerated  Algaw, as a ma.
nure, and which are related by Dr. Greville in his account of the
British Algae, come more under the head of chemical than of
botanical research. In order to perfect hi|n in a knowledge of the
French language, the subject of this notice was afterwards removed
to the house of a Catholic clergyman in Champagne, with whom he
resided for some time, and acquired a facility in speaking and
writing French, which he retained through life.
     Before he returned to Scotland he visited Brussels, and was much
 noticed by Count Lockhart, the Austrian Viceroy of the Nether
 lands.     From Brussels he ascended the Rhine in company with
 an English artist named Green, who was making a professional tour,
 and who afterwards acquired some celebrity as a landscape painter
 in water-colours, an art then in its infancy.         At \\'eimar he made
 the acquaintance of the illustrious Goethe; and, having visited
  Berlin, he came to Paris shortly before the breaking out of the Re
 volution in 1789.
      As Mr. Macintosh's pecuniary circumstances did not admit of his
  continuing unemployed, at the time of his return to Scotland several
  schemes for his future career in life appear to have attracted his at
  tention.    He was at one period upon the point of embarking as a
  planter for the West Indies, and had actually entered upon ne
  gociations with the Hudson's Bay Company to retrace the steps of
  the adventurous Hearne to the shores of the polar ocean, with the
  view of extending the Company's fur trade beyond the Rocky
  Mountains. His love for chemistry induced him, however, to relin-
  quish these schemes, and, as the result, his establishment of various
  branches of chemical manufacture, including those of acetate of lead,
  hitherto in Britain altogether an import from Holland; of acetate of
  alumina, so extensively employed by our calico-printers; of alum,
  before his time unknown as a manufacture in Scotland, and whereby
  he converted the exhausted and deserted coal-works in the neigh
  bourhood of Campsie and Hurlet, near Glasgow, into a scene of
  great and active commercial enterprise; of Prussian blue, and of
  prussiate of potash, as the mode of dyeing woollen, cotton and silk
  (with which latter salt he was also the sole inventor), followed each
  other in rapid succession.      He was also the inventor of the process
   for manufacturing the dry chloride of lime, which effected an entire
   revolution in the process of bleaching, and which gave origin to the
   stupendous chemical works at St. Rollox, near Glasgow, which have
   since become so celebrated under the energetic management of the
   Messrs. Tennants.
      It had been known to chemists that naphtha, or petroleum, was
   a solvent for caoutehouc, or the coagulated juice of the Iatropa
   Elastica, the Urceola Elastica, and other tropical plants. The
   liquid varnish, however, thus formed, although elastic, continued
   clammy and viscid when exposed to the air of the atmosphere.          Mr.
   Macintosh overcame    this dif<U+FB01>culty by  the  formation of double fabrics,
   having the varnish as an adhesive waterproof <U+FB01>lm or medium in the

                                   488
centre. It is unnecessary to enlarge upon the great utility of this
invention, followed as it has been by the removal of many of the
dif<U+FB01>culties which had rendered caoutehouc a substance imprac
ticable to manage, so as now to admit of its application to many
useful purposes in the arts. Mr. Macintosh was also the inventor
of a mode of converting iron into steel by the application of coal-gas
in hermetically closed and heated vessels; a beautiful process, by
which much time and labour is saved.
   The desire of acquiring useful information continued with Mr.
Macintosh to be a ruling passion ; in instance of which it may be men
tioned, that when he placed his sons as students at the University of
Glasgow in the year 1805, he again re-entered himself as a student,
and regularly attended the lectures in Natural Philosophy of the now
venerable Professor Meikleham; and still later in life, when his friend
Dr. Thomas Thomson was appointed Professor of Chemistry at
Glasgow, in 1818, Mr. Macintosh again became a student, and
regularly attended two courses of the Professor's lectures. Latterly,
Mr. Macintosh had resided for the most part in comparative retire
ment in the country, where he took much interest and pleasure in
planting and improving his estate of Campsie.         For several years
his heaith had been gradually declining, and he at length expired at
his house at Dunchattan, near Glasgow, on the 25th day of July,
1843. ‘His end, for which he was quite prepared, was characterized
by the most perfect resignation, fortitude and composure, and in
unison with the virtuous and useful life which he had led.
   Mr. Macintosh married, in l789, Miss Mary Fisher, the daughter
of Alexander Fisher, Esq., merchant in Glasgow, and whose ances
tors were the possessors of the Barony of Cowden Knows, in Sel
kirkshire, renowned in Scottish song, and commemorated in the
pages of Rousseau.
   ROBERT ALaxaunna, Esq., was born at Halifax, in Yorkshire,
on the 18th of January, 1795, and was the son of Lewis Alexander,
Esq., of Hopwood, near that town.           He was educated at the
flourishing Grammar-school of Hipperholm, and in due time was
entered as a student at Lincoln’s-inn.     In Michaelmas Term, 1820,
he was called to the bar, and immediately <U+FB01>xed on the Northern
 Circuit as the scene of his future professional career. Here he
greatly distinguished himself, though surrounded by rivals of the
highest talents and eminence, and gradually attained, by his ability,
his industry, and his perseverance, the highest station.    At the un
usually early age of 40, he was raised to the rank of King’s
 Counsel, and, had his life been spared, would probably at some
future time have enjoyed the still higher honours of his profession.
 Unhappily his labours appear to have undermined his constitution,
 and he died on the 21st of last February, at the age of 48. He
 was married in 1829 to Miss Legard, but left no children. In 1835,
 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, an honour of which
 he always spoke with the greatest pride, and to which he alluded
 with pleasure to the latest period of his life.

the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty.
   At 6 o'clock, A.M. on the 21st of June, the water was found to be
6 inches above the average height, and continued so till 6%-,when it
rose to 18 inches, and in a few minutes sank to 3 fect 6 inches below
the average; which oscillations continued till 8% A.M., when it re
sumed its usual level.    On the 25th, a rise to the extent of 2 feet 6
inches above, followed by a fall of 3 feet below, the average, was
observed; these alternations in height recurring four several times
on that day. The author was unable to assign any particular cause

   A paper was read, entitled, “Researches into the Structure and
Development of a newly-discovered Parasitic Animalculc of the
Human Skin, the Emozoon folliculorum."              By Erasmus Wilson,
Esq., Lecturer on Anatomy and                     in the Middlesex Hos
pital.  Communicated by R. B. Todd, Physiologg

   The animalcules which are the subject of this paper were disco
vered above a year ago by Dr. Simon, who published a description

                                   496
of their structure in the number of Miiller's 'Archiv,’ &c. for June
1842.     This description was found by Mr. Wilson, who devoted to
the investigation six months of exclusive labour, to be, in many essen
tial particulars, exceedingly inaccurate and erroneous. The present
paper contains the principal results of the author's researches on
these singular animalcules, which inhabit the sebaceous follicles of
the human skin, and feed on the secretions that surround them. The
author enters into minute anatomical details of the structure of the
various organs, and more particularly of the apparatus by which
the head is retracted within the thorax, of the eyes, of the ova, and
the remarkable embryonic forms which are presented in the progress
of development of the young animal. He applies to this animalcule
the term entozoon, merely as signifying an inhabitant of the interior
of the body, and until a better and more appropriate appellation shall
have been assigned to it.

      JAMES WALKER,            Esq., Vice-President, in the Chair.
    The reading of Dr. Davy’s paper, entitled, “ Miscellaneous Ob
servations on Animal Heat," was resumed and concluded.
    The author, in the <U+FB01>rst section of this paper, after adverting to
the commonly received opinion that all <U+FB01>shes are cold-blooded, and
noticing an exception, as he believes, in the instance of certain <U+FB01>shes
of the genus Thynnus and of the Scomber family, describes the ob
servations which he made whilst at Constantinople, on the tempe
rature of the Pelamys Sarda, when, in three di<U+FB01>erent examples, he
found its heat to exceed that of the surface-water by 7°, and of the
 deep water probably by 12°.
    He adduces some observations and remarks on peculiarities in the
 blood of the same <U+FB01>sh, of the sword-<U+FB01>sh and of the common tunny,
 which he supposes may be connected with their temperature; and
throws out the conjecture, that the constitution of their blood-globule,
 formed of a containing and contained part, namely the globule and
 its nucleus, may be to each other in the electrical relation of posi
 tive and negative, and may thereby act with greater energy in sepa
                                                                  '
 rating oxygen in respiration.
    In the second section, on the temperature of man in advanced old
 age, he relates a number of observations made for the purpose of
 determining the actual heat of persons exceeding eighty years of age;
 the result of which, contrary to the commonly received opinion, is,
 that the temperature of old persons, as ascertained by a thermome

                                      497
ter placed under the tongue, is rather above than below that of per
sons of middle age; and this he thinks may he explained by the cir
cumstance, that most of the food n.-|-t.l by uhl persons is expemh-d in
administering to the function of r\'.-piration.
    In the third section, on the in<U+FB02>uence of air of ditli-rent t|-|upern
tures on animal heat, after alluding to what he had \\ itines.-u~d of the
rise and fall of the temperature of man on entering the tropie.-,, and,
within the tropics, on descending from a cool mountainous region to
a low hot country, he adduces certain Ub.~o|'vi\llt)n5 to show that i||
this country similar changes of temperature take place in a few
hours in breathing the air of buildings arti<U+FB01>cially heated; and, in
con<U+FB01>rmation, he describes the results of many observations made on
an individual in the very variable climate of Constantinople, where,
between March and July, in 184-l, the thermometer ranged from
31° to 94-°.
    In the fourth section, he describes the observations which he made
to determine the effect of moderate exercise, such as that of walk
ing, on the temperature of the body, tending to prove, that while it
promotes the diffusion of temperature and produces its exaltation in
the extremities, it augments very little, if at all, the heat of the cen
tral and deep-seated parts.
    A                                          “ On the Thermal
       paper was also in part read, entitled,                    Changes
accompanying Basic Substitutions."         By Thomas Andrews, M.D.,
 M.R.I.A., Professor of Chemistry in the Royal Belfast Institution.
 Communicated by M. Faraday, Esq., D.C.L., F.R.S., &c.
     The author gives an account of a series of experiments which he
 made on the heat evolved during the mutual reaction of acids and
 bases upon one another, from which he draws the general conclusion
 that when the in<U+FB02>uence of all extraneous circumstances is eliminated
 from the result, the change of temperature is determined by the na
 ture of the base, and not by the acid element of the combination.
 Hence he deduces the general law that, when one base displaces
 another from any of its neutral combinations with an acid, the heat
 evolved or abstracted is always the same, whatever the acid element
 may be, provided the bases are the same.          The base employed in
 the <U+FB01>rst set of experiments for displacing others was the hydrate of
 potash in a state of dilute solution of known strength; this was
 rapidly mixed, in a suitable apparatus, with an equivalent solution
 of the salt to be decomposed; the change of temperature which re
 sulted was uccurately determined, and the due corrections for the
 in<U+FB02>uence of the vessels and the speci<U+FB01>c heats of the solutions and of
 the precipitates produced, were applied.        The experimental results
  are stated in various tables, from which it appears that the changes

   The differences in the results of experiments with different acids,
the author observes, are not greater than usually occur in chemical
reactions, in consequence of the uncertainty that exists with regard
to the accurate proportions of chemical equivalents.              He points out
various circumstances in experiments of this nature, which tend to
affect the results and lead to inaccurate conclusions, if care be not
taken to guard against these sources of error. One of the principal
of these is the heat which is generally evolved by the separation of
a base, or new compound, in a solid form: and the author discusses
the in<U+FB02>uence of this change on the results deduced from his experi
ments. He considers that these experiments su<U+FB02>iciently establish the
general principle announced in the beginning of his paper.
   A supplementary note is added on the determination of the Spe
ci<U+FB01>c Heat of Fluids.

   “An Account of a slight Shock of an Earthquake felt in the
Channel Islands." By J. Elliott Hoskins, M.D., F.R.S.: in a Letter
to P. M. Roget, M.D., Sec. R.S., &c. Communicated by Dr. Roget.
   The phenomena described in this letter occurred simultaneously in
                                                      J
Jersey, Guernsey, Alderney, Serk, Herne, and ethore. On Friday, the
22nd of December, at seven minutes before 4‘ P.M., a noise resembling
a distant thunder-clap was heard ; this was immediately followed by
sounds as of a railroad carriage rumbling over an irregular metallic
surface; it was accompanied by distinct uudulatory motion. ~This
again was succeeded by a shock; the whole lasting from 10 to 15
seconds.     The barometer was unin<U+FB02>uenced, standing at 301354: a
light wind prevailed, varying from S.S.E. to S.S.W. During the
 whole of the month the air had been peculiarly still, and the baro
meter uniformly high; the maximum, up to the above date, having
 been 30'518, the minimum 80042.               The thermometer had ranged
throughout the month, from 47° to 52° during the day, and from
45° to 49° during the night.

                                              499
    Hundreds of persons agree as to having experienced a distinct
shock, their impressions varying according to the positions occupied
by the observers.    Those inhabiting the solid granite structures of
the lower town conceived that heavy masses of furniture were over
turned and moved in the apartments above or below them: they
were not, however, so conscious of vibratory motion as those in the
less substantial houses of the upper part of the town, or as those in
the open air. In many houses, this vibratory motion was so violent as
to cause much alarm, and was accompanied by crashing sounds, as
though roofs and chimneys were falling ; in some instances, chimney
pots were thrown down; suspended lamps were observed to wave;
bells rang spontaneously; the vane of the town church waved, and
one of its bells struck twice.
    Persons in the open air were sensible of an undulatory motion,
tending from the S.\\'., which occasioned uusteadiness of footing,
and in some cases a transient feeling of nausea. A steam-engine in
 the Serk mines was remarked to suspend one out of its usual <U+FB01>ve
 strokes per minute; the engineer was alarmed lest this should be a
 precursor of bursting of the boiler.     The massive granite works of
 St. Sampson's quay were so shaken, that glass vessels situated on
 various parts were thrown off. Two gentlemen engaged in Daguer
 reotype experiments on the ramparts of a forti<U+FB01>cation founded on a
 solid granite rock, felt the whole to vibrate.    The crews of sailing
 vessels beating up in the
                             “ roads," also felt the shock; those below
 rushing on deck under the impression that the vessels had struck on
a rock.
   The testimony of a great number of witnesses leaves no doubt as
to the distinctness and strength of the shock. It was also felt, though
in a slighter degree, in the neighbourhood of St. Malo, and near
Brixham in Devonshire.

tions    of the symbol D, which, for the             sake   of simplicity, is written in
place    of    -5;.   This the author calls the exponential               form of the
equation; and         he,    in like manner, designates the analogous forms
of partial and of simultaneous equations. What he conceives to                       be
the great and peculiar advantage of the exponential form, both                       as
respects the solution of linear differential equations, and the theory
of generating functions,       that the necessary developments, trans
                                       is
formations and reductions are immediately effected by theorems the
expression of which        independent of the forms of the functions
                                 is
fo  (D),f, (D),    &c.  Accordingly      may be shown that various for
                                                it
mulae which have been given for the solution of linear differential
equations, with those in which Laplace's theory of generating func
tions     comprised, interpreted into the language of the author, are
         is
but special cases of theorems dependent on the exponential form
above stated, and which are susceptible of universal application.
    The common method of effecting the integration of linear differ
ential equations in series fails when the equation determining the
lowest index of the development has equal or imaginary roots.           In
a particular class of such equations of the second order, Euler has
shown that log.m       involved in the expression of the complete inte
                            is
gral: but this appears to be merely          successful assumption; and
                                                     a
the rule of integration demonstrated in the present paper admits of
no such cases of exception whatever.
    The <U+FB01>nite solution of linear di<U+FB02>erential equations may be attempted
by resolution of the proposed equation into        system of equations of
                                                               a
an inferior order. This method applied to the linear equation under
its usual forms leads to the well-known solution of equations with
constant coe<U+FB02>icients: and when applied to the same equation under
the exponential form,        givesit  result embracing the solution not
                                            a

     A Description of an extensive Series of the Water Battery; with
an account of some Experiments made in order to test the relation
of electrical and chemical action which takes place before and after
completion of the Voltaic Circuit." By John P. Gassiot, Esq., F.R.S.
   In a former paper, which was printed in the Philosophical Trans
actions for 1839, the author described    series of experiments made
                                                      a

                                    50l
with some powerful voltaic batteries, for the purpose of determining
the possibility of obtaining a spark before the completion of the cir
cuit. This anticipated effect was not, however, produced.          A short
time after, Mr. Cross stated that he had succeeded in procuring a
spark from a battery of 1626 cells of copper and zinc, acted upon by
river water. The author, pursuing his researches, constructed a bat
tery consisting of 3520 pairs of copper and zinc cylinders, each pair
being placed in a separate glass vessel, well covered with a coating
of lac varnish, and insulated by being placed on slips of glass covered
on both sides with a thick coating of lac. The cells were placed on
4--it separate oaken boards, also covered with lac varnish, each board
            80 cells, and sliding into a wooden frame, when: they are
carging
furt er insulated by resting on pieces of thick plate-glass, similarly
varnished.
     In describing the effects which this apparatus has produced, the
author endeavours to draw a distinction between the static and the
dynamic effects of the developed                   and treats of each Se
parately.     The conclusions to whichelectricity,
                                          he is ed from the series of ex
periments narrated in this paper, are the following :
     1. The elements                the voltaic battery assume polar ten
sion before the circuitconstituting
                          is comp eted, even in a single cell; this polar
state being shown to exist by the action exerted on the electroscopc
being different at each polar extremity of the battery.
     2. The tension, so produced, when exalted by a succession of series,
is such, that a succession of sparks passes between the polar extre
 mities of the battery before their actual contact.
     3. The static effects precede, and are independent of the com
 pletion of the voltaic circuit, as well as of any perceptible develop
 ment of chemical or dynamic action.
     4-. When the current is established, either by actual contact of the
extremities, or merely by their approximation, so as to admit of a
succession of sparks, its dynamic effects on the galvanometer are the
same in both cases; each spark producing a constant de<U+FB02>ection of
the needle. It is hence inferred that the current, even when the
circuit is closed, may be regarded as a series of discharges of elec
tricity of tension, succeeding each other with in<U+FB01>nite rapidity.
     5. In a battery, of which the chemical elements have but a feeble
mutual a<U+FB02>inity, as is the case with the water battery, the tension rises
very slowly.
     6. In order to produce static effects in the voltaic battery, it is an
indispensable requisite that the elements be such as are capable of
combining by their chemical a<U+FB02>initics: and the higher those a<U+FB02>ini
ties are exalted, the smaller is the number of parts composing the
series requisite to exhibit the effects of tension.      The static effects
elicited from a voltaic series, afford, therefore, direct evidence of the
<U+FB01>rst step towards chemical combination, or dynamic action.
     The author observes, in conclusion, that the chemical effects, when
obtained in most of the experiments he has described in this paper,
are very feeble; but are precisely the same in character as those ex
hibited by the more powerful voltaic combinations;          and he thinks

                                 ii,
it may fairly be concluded that the rationale of each is the same, and
that they differ only in the amount of action.

    “ Some further Observations and Experiments illustrative of the
Cause of the Ascent and continued Motion of the Sap," in continua
tion of a Paper presented to the Royal Society in November 1842.
By G. Rainey, Esq. Communicated by P. M. Roget, M.D., Sec. R.S.
    The author here gives an account of some experiments which he
has lately made, tending, in his opinion, to corroborate the opinions
he advanced in his former paper; namely, that the ascending sap is
situated in the intercellular and intervascular spaces of the plant, and
that its passage into the cells is effected by the action of endosmose,
which the intervening membranes, whether living, or deprived of
vitality, exert upon that <U+FB02>uid. He found that portions of many plants,
such as Anthriscus vulgaris, and the Lapsana communis, absorb a
much larger quantity of <U+FB02>uid when they are immersed in pure
water, than when similarly immersed in a solution of gum--arabic;
and that, in the latter case, the remaining portion' of the solution is
of the same speci<U+FB01>c gravity as before any part has been absorbed by
the plant. By a similar process, the author conceives, the <U+FB02>uid which
is derived from the earth, and has passed into the intercellular spaces
of the cotyledons, are imbibed by its cells by endosmose; while at
the same time a <U+FB02>uid containing sugar is passing, by exosmose, out
of these cells into the intercellular and intervascular tissue, and thence
into the corresponding tissue of the peduncle and young stem; it
there meets with, and is diluted by the water ascending in the same
tissue from the roots, and the mixture is afterwards distributed over
every part of the plant.

    “ On the Temperature of the Springs, Wells and Rivers of India
 and Egypt, and of the Sea and Table Lands within the Tropics;
 with a few Remarks on M. B0ussingault’s mode of ascertaining the
 mean temperature of Equinoctial Regions."         By Lieut. Newbold, of
 the Madras Army, F.R.S.
    The author adverts to the de<U+FB01>ciency of information which has
 hitherto existed as to the temperature and chemical composition of
 the springs and rivers both of India and of Egypt; and also as to
 their geographical and geological relations. He gives, in the present
 paper, the details of a great number of observations which he has
 made on these subjects, and which he thinks may prove a useful con
 tribution to Indian hydrography, as well as afford more exact data
 for philosophical inquiry. The observations extend, at irregular in

                                     503
tervals, from Alexandria to Malacca, or from 51° IS’ of northern
latitude to within 2° 14-’ of the Equator, and between the meridians
of 27° and 103° of east longitude. ln the columns of the register,
the date of the observation, the latitude, longitude, approximate
height above the sea, nature of the surrounding geological formation,
depth to the surface of the water, depth of the water itself, tempera
ture of the air, and approximate annual mean of the climate in which
the wells, &c. occur, are, as far as practicable, speci<U+FB01>ed. A column
of remarks is added, containing observations on the chemical nature
of the water, and on the size of the wells and springs, and the result
obtained by other observers.
     It was found, in general, that in low latitudes the temperature of
the deepest wells and springs is a little higher than the mean tempe
rature of the air; although there occur a few exceptions, especially
in the neighbourhood of a high range of hills, whence there probably
arise cold springs, having their source at an elevation considerably
above that of the plain where the water makes its appearance.
 Springs which are strongly saline and sulphureous, have, on the
average, a higher temperature than those of pure water. Both saline
and cold springs are found occurring within a few feet from thermal
and freshwater springs: a fact which the author is disposed to ascribe
 to their rising through different seams of the subjaeent strata, often
 much inclined; and to the different depths and heights, above and
 below the crust of the earth, from which the supply of water is de
 rived. Wells, and particularly those having a small surface, which
 are much used for purposes of irrigation, thereby acquire an arti<U+FB01>cial
 increase of temperature.      The temperature of shallow exposed wells,
 springs   and rivers, especially those which have sandy beds, is subject
 to diurnal <U+FB02>uctuation from the more powerful in<U+FB02>uence of the atmo
 sphere: and the surface water of deep wells partakes of these vicis
 situdes to a depth varying according to the transparency of the water,
 the extent of surface, degree of exposure and clearness of the sky.
 In muddy water, the surface is heated to a greater extent; but at the
 depth of a foot or two, it is less affected by the heat of the solar rays
 than clear water.
     With regard to Boussingault's proposal of an expeditious mode of
 ascertaining the approximate mean temperature of equinoctial re
 gions, which consists in sinking a thermometer in the soil, perforated
  to the depth of about a foot beneath the surface, in a situation shel
  tered from the direct rays of the sun, from nocturnal radiation, and
  from the in<U+FB01>ltration of water, the author found that the application
  of this method gave the following results, namely, that the soil at the
  depth of a foot is subject to an annual, and, in light soils, to a diurnal
  variation, regulated in its amount by the relative intensity of the solar
  rays, and the quantity of radiation, depending, of course, on the state
  of the atmosphere, and the degree of shelter afforded to the sur

     “On the Electrolysis of Secondary Compounds."           By John Fre
  deric Daniell, Esq., D.C.L., For. Sec. R.S., and Professor of Chemistry
  in King's College, London; and W. A. Miller, M.D., Demonstrator
  of Chemistry in the same College.
     The authors of this paper have further prosecuted the inquiry into
  the phenomena of electrolysis, commencing from the point to which
  it had been carried by Professor Daniell in his papers published in
  the Philosophical Transactions for 1889 and 1840. He had there
  shown, that in the electrolysis of neutral saline solutions, if the metal
  is one of those which do not decompose water at ordinary tempera
  tures, it is precipitated in the metallic state at the platinode; but if
  it belong to the class of those which, at ordinary temperatures, do
  decompose water, then an equivalent of the oxide is liberated at the
 platinode, while an equivalent of hydrogen makes its escape in the
  gaseous form from the same electrode; the acid, in both cases, being,
 at the same time, liberated at the zincode, accompanied by an equi
 valent proportion of oxygen. On comparing these results with those
 of an independent voltameter included in the same circuit, it was
 found that a certain de<U+FB01>nite proportion of the force which resolves
 a single equivalent of a simple electrolyte into its anion and cation,
 produces the resolution of a full equivalent of a complex electrolyte
 into asimple metallic cation and a compound anion. When ammonia
 cal salts in solution were thus decomposed, ammonia, with an equiva
 lent of hydrogen, was liberated at the platinode; while the acid, with
 an equivalent of oxygen, was evolved, as before, at the zincode. .
     Experimental evidence was thus obtained in support of two im
 portant theories; namely, the ammonium theory advanced by Ber
 zelius ; and the binary theory of salts propounded by Davy ; in which
 latter theory, all saline compounds are regarded as being formed on
 the type of the salts of the hydro-acids.     This binary composition of
salts is, in the present paper, proved to exist, not only when the salts,
previously held in solution by water, are decomposed by the voltaic
current, but also when the fused anhydrous salt is electrolysed: for
example, metallic silver in crystals is deposited upon the platinode,
when fused nitrate of silver is included in the circuit.
     On examining, by the current, the monobasic, dibasic, and tri
basic phosphates, the authors found that there were three distinct
modi<U+FB01>cations of the acid transferred.        From the monobasic phos
phates there was obtained the metaphosphoric acid; from the dibasic
salts, pyrophosphoric acid; and from the tribasic salts, the ordinary
phosphoric acid was set free at the zincode.        The acids were trans
ferred into weak alkaline solutions and recognised by their appro
priate tests.     The view entertained by Professor Graham of the
composition of these salts is therefore completely con<U+FB01>rmed.
    On the other hand, the authors found, by similar experiments made
with the yellow and the red prussiates of potash, that only one com

                                   505
pound of cyanogen and iron, or ferrocynnogen as it exists in the
yellow salt, is evolved at the zincode; and they not only converted
the yellow into the red salt by electrolytic action, but, conversely,
reproduced the yellow from the red.
   In pursuing their researches on double salts, a new order of facts
was brought to light, which clearly proved that although the two ions
of the electrolyte are always evolved in equivalent proportions, yet
that they are not transferred in equivalent proportions to the re
spective electrodes; that some bases, such as copper, zine, iron and
alumina, do not travel at all towards the platinode; that some, as
magnesium, do so in small proportion only; and that others, as
barium and potassium, are transferred in greater abundance; those
whose oxides are most soluble appearing to travel moat easily.       On
the other hand, the acids, whether forming soluble hydrates or not,
seem all to travel towards the zincode, in proportions dependent prin
cipally on the nature of the base with which they are united.
   The curious phenomena which have thus been brought to light,
concur in establishing the general fact, that the disengagemicnt of the
cation and anion of an electrolyte in equivalent proportion is not
always affected, as is commonly represented, by their simultaneous
transfer in opposite directions to their respective electrodes, in the
exact proportion of half an equivalent of each; but that it is somc
times brought about by the transfer of :1 whole equivalent of the anion
to the zincode, whereby a whole equivalent of the cation is left un
combined at the platinode, or by the transfer of unequivalent portions
of each in opposite directions, making together u whole equivalent
of matter transferred either to one electrode or to the other; or, in
other words, by the transfer of a quantity of matter capable of ex
ercising one equivalent of chemical force: so that when the anion
transferred to the zincode exceeds half an equivalent, the cation trans
ferred to the platinode is, in an equal proportion, less than half an
equivalent, and vice versd ; the anion and cation set free being always
in equivalent proportions.     In no case, however, has there been ob
served the transfer of a whole equivalent of the cation to the exclu
sion of the anion.
   These facts, the authors conceive, are irreconcileable with any of
the molecular hypotheses which have been hitherto imagined to ex
plain the phenomena of electrolysis.

   “A   description of certain Belemnites, preserved, with a great pro
portion of their soft parts, in the Oxford clay at Christian Malford,
Wilts."    By Richard Owen, Esq., F.R.S., &c., Hunterian Professor
of Anatomy and Physiology in the Royal College of Surgeons.
   The author describes, in the present paper,specimens of Belemnite,
discovered in the Oxford-clay at Christian Malford, Wilts, and

                                     506
 which are remarkable for the preservation of many of the soft parts
 of the animal. After alluding to the various opinions promulgated
 by different authors respecting the nature and a<U+FB02>inities of this ex
 tinct animal, he adverts more especially to the discovery of the ink
 bag of the Belemnite, which was published in the Zoological Trans
 actions, vol. ii., and in the Cyclopaedia of Anatomy and Physiology
 (Art. Cephalopoda).       This discovery led him, on the strength of
 deductions from the physiological relations of this organ, to re
 move the Belemnite from the Polythalamacea of De Blainville, and
 place it in the higher order of the naked Cephalopods.
    The structure of the shell is next discussed, and the spathose dart,
 or guard, is proved to be the result of original organization, both
by its microscopic structure and by the fact that the chambers of
 the phragmocone have not been in<U+FB01>ltrated by mineral substance in
 any of the specimens described: the name phmgmocone being applied
 to the chambered and siphonated conical division of the compound
 shell of the Belemnite; and the term alveolus being restricted, in
 the present paper, to the socket or cavity at the base of the guard,
in which the phragmocone is lodged. A detailed description is given
 of the sheath of the phragmocone and of the structure of the cham
bers. The state of preservation of the present specimens has enabled
 the author to describe the form and extent of the mantle—its con
tinuation over the exterior of the shell, and the arrangement of its
muscular <U+FB01>bres.        The animal is provided with two lateral <U+FB01>ns of a
semi-oval <U+FB01>gure, which are attached to the middle of the mantle, in
advance of the spathose dart.
    The muscular <U+FB01>bres of the <U+FB01>ns, the infundibulum and its muscles
are next described; and also the head, the eyes, which are large and
sessile, and the cephalic arms, which are eight in number; together
with traces of two slender superadded tentacula. The ordinary arms
are furnished with a double alternate row of sharp horny hooks, as in
some existing species of Onyclwteutkis, but the arms are relatively
longer.    Their muscular structure is traced in the fossil specimens,
and compared with that in the recent Decapoda.         The ultimate, or
primitive   <U+FB01>bres   of the muscles of  the Belemnite agree in size with
those in the Onychoteuthis; but the character of the transverse striae,
which is feebly developed in the primitive muscular <U+FB01>bre of the Ce
phalopods, is not preserved in the fossil.       Of the interior organs
of the Belemnite, besides the ink-bag and duct, which had been be
fore discovered by Drs. Buckland and Agassiz, the remains of the
                                                                      r
horny lining of the gizzard are preserved in the present fossils.
    Thus the deduction that the higher, or dibranchiate type of Ce
phalopodal organization is necessarily associated with the presence
of the atramental apparatus, is established by the demonstration, in
these fossil Belemnites, of a <U+FB02>eshy mantle, inclosing the shell, and
provided with a pair of muscular <U+FB01>ns, of large and sessile eyes, and
of few, but large and complex cephalic arms.
    The author concludes by pointing out the more immediate a<U+FB02>ini
ties of the Belemnites, and showing that it combines characteristics
which are now divided amongst distinct genera: as, for example,

                                    507
<U+FB02>rst, a complex internal shell, divisible into the same principal parts
as that of the Sepia, but one of which has, secondly, the same essen
tial chambered structure as the shell of the Spirula; thirdly, unci
nated cephalic arms, as in the Oraycholeiallais;          and lastly, an atb
vanced position of rounded     <U+FB01>ns,  as  in  the  Spinda and Rania.
    The paper is illustrated by drawings       of  the specimens described,
with microscopic views of the      shell   and   muscular   tissue, and a rc
storation of the Belemnite according to the data afforded by the pre
sent fossils.

 fessor Shoenbein, in a letter to Michael Faraday, Esq., 6.C.L.,
 F.R.S. Communicated by Dr. Faraday.
     The author conceives that of the two gaseous principles which
 are simultaneously produced during the slow action of phosphorus
 upon atmospheric air, and which have opposite voltaic characters,
 that which exerts electro-positive properties is composed of vapo
 rized phosphorus, conjoined with particles of phosphatic acid; and
  the other, which is electro-negative, is identical with ozone, or the
  odoriferous principle which is disengaged at the positive elec
  trode during the electrolysis of water.        His opinion is founded on
  the odour   of the  one  not  being distinguishable from that of the
  other.
     3. “Contributions to Terrestrial Magnetism." No. VI. By Lieut.
  Colonel Sabine, R.A., F.R.S.
     This portion of the series consists of observations made on board
  Her Majesty's ships Erebus and Terror, from June 18rl-l to August
  1842, in the Antarctic Expedition under the command of Captain
  Sir James Clark Ross, R.N., F.R.S. It comprises the result of the
  operations conducted during the second year of the expedition, when
  it proceeded early in July 1841, from Hobarton to Sydney, and
  thence to the Bay of Islands in New Zealand, remaining there till
  November, and reaching, in February 1842, in latitude 78°, the icy
  barrier which had stopped their progress in the preceding year.
  Quitting the antarctic circle in March, and keeping nearly in the
  60th parallel, they crossed the whole breadth of the Southern
  Paci<U+FB01>c Ocean to the Falkland Islands, where they arrived in April
   184-2.
      On a general review of the magnetic declination in the southern

                                   508
 nemisphere, the phenomena are found to present the same obvious
 and decided features of a duplicate system as those of the northern.
 Particular attention is given to those lines traversed by the ship’s
 course where the needle attains its maximum declination, whether
 easterly or westerly, as affording valuable data for the estimation of
secular variations.    The results obtained by the present expedition
 con<U+FB01>rm the conclusion deducible from those of previous navigators;
namely, that the spaces in the Southern Paci<U+FB01>c, distinguished by
 certain magnetic characters, undergo a movement of translation, of
which the general direction is from east to west; a direction which
is the opposite to that in which a similar change takes place in the
corresponding regions of the northern hemisphere ; namely, in the
 Siberian quarter, where the secular movement is from west to east.

    1. “ On the production of Ozone by Chemical Means."           By C.
F. Shoenbein, Professor of Chemistry at Basle, in a second letter to
Michael Faraday, Esq., D.C.L., F.R.S.          Communicatedby Dr.
Faraday.
    The author adduces further evidence in support of the opinions
he advanced in his former communication relative to the identity
of the odoriferous principles which are disengaged during electric
discharges in common air, during the electrolysis of water, and
during the slow action of phosphorus upon atmospheric air. This
principle, termed Ozone, he regards as being a simple body, and a
constituent of azote, which he believes to be a compound of hydro
gen and ozone; and he explains the disengagement of this latter
element, which he considers as analogous in its chemical character
to chlorine, by the partial decomposition of azote, in consequence
of its hydrogen combining with oxygen, in the several processes
above-mentioned during which ozone makes its appearance.
    2. “On the existence of Phosphoric Acid in Rocks of igneous
origin." By George Fownes, Esq., Ph. D., Chemical Lecturer in
the Middlesex Hospital Medical School. Communicated by Thomas
Graham, Esq., F.R.S.
    The author has, by careful analysis, ascertained the presence of
phosphoric acid in various rocks of igneous origin. Those which
he examined were principally the following; namely, 1. The <U+FB01>ne
white porcelain clay of Dartmoor, resulting from the disintegration
of the felspar of the granite of that district.    2. Dark grey vesi
cular lava from the Rhine, used at Cologne as a building-stone.
3. White trachyte from the Draehenfels,         near Bonn. 4'. Dark
red, spongy, scoriaceous lava from Vesuvius.        5. Compact, dark
green basalt, or toadstone from Cavedale, Derbyshire.          6. Dark
blackish-green basalt from the neighbourhood of Dudley, termed

                                       509
Rowley-mgg.        7.  Ancient porphyritic lava. containing             numerous
crystals   of hornblende, from Vesuvius.           6.   A specimen of tufa, or
volcanic mud, also from Vesuvius.
    The author infers from his analysis that phosphoric acid is a very
usual component part of volcanic rocks. and is a principal source of
the remarkable fertility possessed by soils derived from their disin
tegration.

with an account     of some new combinations of Copper, Oxygen and
 Chlorine." By John Christian Bowring, Esq. Communicated by
 S. Hunter Christie, Esq., Sec. R.S.
    The process employed in Mexico for amalgamating ores con
taining sulphurets of silver, and which consists in adding to them a
solution of bichloride of copper with chloride of sodium, is explained
 by Sonneschmidt, Humboldt, and Boussingault, on the supposition
that a chloride of silver is formed at the same time that the sulphur
combines with the copper.           The author calls in question the truth
 of this theory, and proposes certain modi<U+FB01>cations of the process by
the employment of a combination of deutoxide of copper with the
 bichloride, until an oxy-chloride is formed, and then adding <U+FB01>nely
precipitated copper, by which a salt of a brick-red colour is ob
tained, insoluble in water, and at a temperature of 200° Fahr.
speedily reducing sulphuret of silver to the metallic state.
    3. “ Experimental evidence in support of the secretion of Carbon
 by animals."     By Robert Rigg, Esq., F.R.S.
     The author <U+FB01>nds that the mean of the results of different experi
 mentalists as to the quantity of carbon excreted by respiration from
 adults, during twenty-four hours, is 5968 grains; whereas the
 weight of the carbon contained in the whole of the food, both solid
 and liquid, received into the body during the same period,as ascer
 tained by the analysis of each article of diet, made by the author,
 falls very short of that quantity; varying in di<U+FB01>erent cases from
 3002 to 4-800 grains.      The same inference is drawn from experi
 ments made on a mouse, weighing 181 grains, con<U+FB01>ned in a wire
 trap for twenty-eight da s; during which time it consumed food
 containing 54-4'5 grains of carbon, and gave out, in the respired air,

                                          510
74d'2 grains of carbon, being l96'7 grains more than it had re
ceived; and it had also gained in absolute weight 27 grains. The
conclusion which the author deduces from these experiments   that              is,
carbon    actually
         is        formed or secreted by animals.

Edmund Bowman, Esq., C.E. Communicated by S. Hunter Christie,
Esq., Sec. R.S.
  The method proposed by the author for determining distances by
means of    telescope, consists in placing, at the spot of which the
             is a
distance     required,   graduated staff, and observing the number of
                            a
its divisions comprehended in the <U+FB01>eld of the telescope, or included
between <U+FB01>xed points in       diaphragm placed in the focus of the eye
                                a
glass.    He <U+FB01>nds that the number of these divisions, apparent in the
<U+FB01>eld of view, are directly as the distance of the staff, plus     certain  a
constant, which depends on the construction of the instrument.       The
author investigates the value of this constant, and illustrates the prac
tical applications of his method, which he thinks might be employed
with great advantage in surveying, when, from irregularities of
ground or di<U+FB02>'-iculties of access, the direct measurement by the chain
would be inconvenient or impossible.

The effects of this power are seen in the poailinn of lhc <U+FB02>uid cun

into the stream issuing from the open ori<U+FB01>ce of a rcwrvoir, while
the other end is immersed in a coloured <U+FB02>uid. The author accounts
for the intermitting or pulsatory character of the jet is~uing from an
open horizontal pipe, having   a small hole on the upper side, by the
introduction of air, which, accumulating from time to time, forms a
bubble, which when it has attained a certain size, occasions an
0bstruction.to the free passage of the liquid, until the obstacle is
overcome by increased pressure from behind, and the jet then re
                               -ii
sumes its former velocity.    These changes occurring periodically,

and resinous, or positive and negative electricities, is derived alto
gether from the direction of its motion and the circumstances under
which it is presented ; and, according as it is found on a conducting
or non-conducting body, it is positive in the former case and nega

when aided, and not interrupted, will always be found positive, or

     1. “On the Action of the Sun’s Rays on Lithic Acid." By John
  Davy, M.D., F.R.S. Lond. and Edinb.
     The author, after adverting to the composition of guano, and re
 marking that its nitrogenous part di<U+FB01>"ers from the urine of the sea
 fowl, from which it is derived, chie<U+FB02>y in containing little or no
 lithateof ammonia, but a large proportion of the oxalate, describes
 an experiment made for the purpose of determining whether the
 oxalic acid existing in guano may not be formed from the lithic
 acid of the urine, in consequence of the operation of the sun's rays.
 The result of a comparative trial made with the urine of the white
 headed Sea-Eagle, in one instance kept in darkness, in the other
 exposed to bright sunshine for many successive days, afforded an
 answer in the af<U+FB01>rmative.     Whilst the urine of the Sea-Eagle, con
 sisting chie<U+FB02>y of lithate of ammonia, kept in the dark, underwent
 no change, that exposed to light was materially changed, most of
 the lithate of ammonia had disappeared, its place was supplied by
 oxalate of ammonia, the peculiar odour of guano was acquired, and
in part its brownish hue.
    From considering the composition of the lithic and oxalic acids,
the author infers, that in the conversion of the one into the other,
 oxygen is absorbed; and, in con<U+FB01>rmation, he mentions that although
no change takes place when moist lithate of ammonia is exposed
alone to a temperature of about 212°, it is otherwise if so treated
when mixed with black oxide of manganese, in which case oxalate
of ammonia is formed, and also some brown colouring matter, not
unlike that of guano; and this colouring matter, he supposes, may
appropriate to itself the excess of carbon and hydrogen, that is,
such proportions of these substances in the lithic acid as are more
than those required to form oxalic acid and ammonia.

                                        5l3
      Having always found in the South American guano more distinct
  traces    of lithate of ammonia than in the African, he inquires
  whether the difference may not be owing to di<U+FB02>i-rent states of
  atmosphere in the two regions ;—in the one, the clouded state of the
  air impeding the sun's rays; in the other, the usually unelouded
 state interposing no obstacle to their full etii ct.       lle inquires too,
 whether the circumstance of the comparatively rapid conversion of
 lithic acid into the oxalic under the in<U+FB02>uence of light, as witnessed
 in the experiment detailed, may not account for even recently
 formed guano being destitute of lithate of ammonia; and he men
 tions an example in point, namely. a specimen he had received from
 the island of Ichabor being found with a large quantity of oxalate
 of ammonia, to contain no lithate of ammonia,—a specimen described
 as “ having been scraped off a rock, where it was in a thin layer,
 and much exposed to the sun."

             in a letter to the President."    Ry the Rev. Charles Turnor,
 iociety,
    .R.S.
      The dial here described was taken down in the early part of the
 present year from the south wall of the Manor-house of \\'ools
 thorpe, a hamlet to Colsterworth           in the county of Lincoln, the
 birth-place of Newton.         It was marked on a large stone at the angle
 of the building, and about six feet from the ground. The name of
 Nawrox, with the exception of the <U+FB01>rst two letters, which have
 been obliterated, are inscribed under the dial in wide and capital
 letters.      The gnomon has disappeared many years ago.
      3. “ On the Non-coincidence of the Focus of the Photogenic Rays
 with that of the Visual Rays of the Solar Spectrum."              By M. A.
 Claudet. Communicated by S. Hunter Christie, Esq., Sec. R.S., &c.
     After detailing the dif<U+FB01>culties he had met with in obtaining per
 fect pictures when a lens, accurately corrected for spherical and
 chromatic aberration, was employed in the Daguerreotype process,
the author states that in order to obtain a clear and well-de<U+FB01>ned
 image of any object on the Daguerreotype plate. he generally found
 it necessary to adjust the focus on the ground glass by another ob
ject brought considerably nearer to the camera than the object
 whose picture was required.           When this adjustment is made, he
proceeds      to apply   the principle practically to the taking of portraits.
 He <U+FB01>nds that in achromatic object-glasses the focus of photogenic
 action is not coincident with the visual focus; and the distance be
tween these two foci varies according to the nature of the combina
 tion of the glasses, to their different dispersive powers, and to the
 degree of intensity of the light. By attention to these circumstances
 in accurately adjusting the Daguerreotype plate to the situation of
 the focus of the photogenic rays, the author has succeeded in ob
 taining the most perfect delineations of objects.

         “ Observations on some of the Nebulai." By the Earl of Rosse,
  FR.S.

                                    514
    The nebulae, of which an account is given in this paper, were ob
served with the speculum of three feet aperture described in the
 Philosophical Transactions for 1840: and the object of the observa
 tions was rather to test its powers and to decide the merits of pro
 gressive experiments than to seek for astronomical results. Sketehes
 are given of the actual appearance of <U+FB01>ve of the nebulae observed,
 namely those numbered 88, 81, 26, 29 and 4-7 in Sir John Herschel's
 catalogue.     The author observes, in conclusion, that all that he has
 seen con<U+FB01>rms the accuracy of Sir John Herschel’s judgment in
selecting the nebulae which he places in the class designated as re
 solvable; and that every increase of instrumental power still con
tinues to add to the number of the clusters at the expense of the
 nebulae, properly so called.    It would still, however, be unsafe, he
'further remarks, to conclude, that such will always be the case, and
                                 ii.
 thence to draw the obvious inference that all nebulosity is but the
 glare of stars too remote to be separated by the utmost power of
 our instruments.

             JAMES WALKER,           Esq.,  V.P., in the Chair.
    1.  “On    the Structure of the Ultimate Fibril of the Muscle of
 Animal Life." By Erasmus Wilson, Esq., Lecturer on Anatomy
 and Physiology in the Middlesex Hospital; in a Letter addressed
 to Peter Mark Roget, M;D., Sec. R.S.            Communicated by Dr.
 Roget.
    By resorting to peculiar methods of manipulation, and employing
 a microscope of more than ordinary power, the author, with the
 assistance of Mr. Lealand, has succeeded in discovering the real
 structure of the ultimate muscular <U+FB01>bril, in a specimen taken from
 the arm of a strong healthy man immediately after its amputation.
 He <U+FB01>nds each <U+FB01>bril to be composed of minute cells, disposed in a
 linear series, <U+FB02>attened at their surfaces of apposition, and so com
 pressed in the longitudinal direction as to leave no marginal in
 dentation on the surface; thus constituting a uniform cylinder,
 divided into minute subdivisions by transverse septa, which are
 formed by the adherent surfaces of contiguous cells. The diameter
 of the <U+FB01>bril, in the state of relaxation, is the 20,000th part of an
 inch.    The cells are <U+FB01>lled with a transparent substance, to which
 the author gives the name of Myoline, and which differs in its re
 fractive density in different cells.    In. four consecutive cells the
 myoline is of greater density than in the four succeeding cells, and
 this alternation is repeated throughout the whole course of the <U+FB01>bril.
 In consequence of all the <U+FB01>brils composing the ultimate fasciculus
having the same structure, and the cells, which are in lateral juxta
position, containing myoline of the same density, they act similarly
on light, and the whole presents, to the eye of the microscopic ob
server, a succession of striae or bands, dark and luminous alternately,
and transverse to the direction of the fasciculus; an appearance

                                      5l5
which   has been noticed by preceding observers, but of which the
cause had not hitherto been ascertained.       A dark stris may occa
sionally appear   as a luminous   one, and rice rend, when Vlr\\'ct.l by
light transmitted  at different degrees of obliquity.
   The structure here described, the author remarks, reduces the
muscular <U+FB01>bre to the simple type of organization exhibited in the
combination of a series of cells, associating it with other tissues of
cell formation, and will probably, he thinks, open new sources of
explanation of the immediate agency of muscular action, a power
hitherto involved in the deepest mystery.
  2. "On the Comparative Anatomy of the Thyroid Gland."    B
John Simon, Esq, Assistant Surgeon to King's College Hospitai:
and Demonstrator of Anatomy in King's College.                   Communicated
by Joseph Henry Green, Esq., F.R.S.
   The author, considering that the careful dissections of Meckel
and Cuvier have fully established the universal existence of a thyroid
gland in the whole of the class Mamimalia, proceeds to consider the
comparative anatomy of this organ in the remaining classes of ver
tebrated animals.      His dissections of birds have included all the
orders, and, in most instances, several families from each: he has
never failed to <U+FB01>nd in them a thyroid gland, and, with the aid of the
microscope, to recognise its peculiar structure; he presumes, there
fore, that it is universally present in that class of animals.             llc has
also  detected  the  presence   of this   organ   in  reptiles  of   every order;
although generally     either wholly   overlooked      by  anatomists,     or mis
taken   for the thymus. Descriptions       are  here  given   of  its appearance,
position and structure in different families of Chelonia,                  Sauria,
 Ophidia and    Batrachia.    In  the   class  of  Fishes,   it is  by no means
universally or even generally present. The author has found it in
the carp, anableps, pike, exocetus, cod, haddock, whiting, eel, stur
geon, callorhynchus, shark and skate, and perhaps in the lamprey.
On the other hand, it appears to be absent in the perch, mullet,
gurnard, mackerel, tench, salmon, trout, herring, plaice, halibut,
turbot, sole, cyclopterus, gymnotus and balistes.
   The general conclusion which the author deduces from his re
searches      that the distribution of the thyroid gland
            is,                                                 is   regulated by
a simple and uniform law being dependent on the existence or non
                              ;
existence of another organ with which its presence alternates, and
 which, in many <U+FB01>shes, assumes the form of minute supplementary
                                                    a
gill, the vessels of which communicate, on the one hand, with the
systemic veins about the base of the cranium, and on the other, by
 a single long trunk with the <U+FB01>rst branchial vein.
    Although the thyroid gland occupies various situations in differ
 ent animals,     always maintains an intimate relation with the vas
                  it
 cular supply of the brain, and          is always so nourished as to be
 capable of a greater or less nutrition according to the activity or
 repose of that nervous centre.

        “ On the Reproduction of lost parts in Myriapoda and Insecta."
By George Newport, Esq., F.R.C.S., President of the Entomo
logical Society of London, and Corresponding Member of the Phi
lomathic Society of Paris.       Communicated by P. M. Roget, M.D.,
Sec. R.S.
    It has long been known that the limbs of Crustacea and Arach
nida, accidentally lost or designedly removed, are, in course of time,
replaced by the growth of new limbs ; and the same power of re
production has been stated to have been observed in the Phasmae,
insects which undergo neither metamorphosis nor any change of
habits.     But.whether such a power exists in those insects, such as
the Lepidoptera, which undergo a complete metamorphosis, changing
not only their form, but also their food and mode of life, in passing
from the larva to the adult state, has been considered as very doubt
ful. The instances in which the reproduction of lost parts appeared
to have occurred in some of the Myriapoda, were attributed to im
perfect or arrested development.        With a view to determine these
unsettled points, the author commenced, in the summer of 1844 and
 1842, a series of direct experiments on this subject in the Myri
 apoda; and in the present summer he has extended them to the
Lepidoptera.       The results of his labours are given in the present
                                                r
memoir.
    In some specimens of Iulus, from which he had removed the an
 tennae and some of the legs, the lost organs were found to be com
 pletely reproduced after the next change of integument; differing
 from the original organs only in their smaller size, and the incom
plete development of some of their minuter parts. The same results
 followed from similar experiments made on the Lithobris during the
 earlier periods of its growth.     One individual of this genus, which
 had already acquired the tenth pair of legs, was by accident deprived
 of the eighth, ninth and tenth pair; at the next change of skin it
 not only developed two additional pair of legs, but also reproduced
 the three pair which had been lost.        Some time after this it again
 lost one   of the  legs of the twelfth  pair; a loss which was repaired
 at the   next change by    the growth of a new leg, while those pre
 viously reproduced acquired an increase of size.
     The <U+FB01>rst observation which led the author to believe that true in
 sects might possess the power of reproducing lost parts, was that of
 a specimen of Phasma in the collection at the British Museum, in
 which the right anterior leg had evidently been reproduced.           He
 then instituted a series of experiments on the larva of the Vanessa
 urticre, or common nettle butter<U+FB02>y, which belongs to the order
 Lepidoptera, and undergoes complete metamorphosis.            He removed
 some of the true legs of the larva, sometimes in their tibial portion,

                                      517
and sometimes at their base : in the <U+FB01>rst case, pans similar to those
removed were invariably reproduced in different states of develop
ment, and in the latter, entire new limbs were formed; in some in
stances, at the second change of the larva, when it passed into the
pupa state ; but in two or three instances no reproduction took
place.    At   <U+FB01>rst view, this difference in the results might appear to
favour the opinion that this reproduction of limbs depends on the
existence of parts especially adapted to perform this function, and
which, in those experiments that had failed to exhibit the pheno
menon, had been themselves removed.             But the author found that
in every instance of the mutilations thus practised, the perfect in
sect possessed a coxa, or basilar part of the limb; and this was the
case even in those in which a new organ was not reproduced.          From
this fact, taken in conjunction with the formation of new entire limbs
in the Iulidae after the removal of every portion of the previous
ones, the author infers that the power of reproduction resides in the
whole of the organized tissues.
    The author found that each newly produced limb is, in every
 case, composed of all its essential parts, namely coxa, femur, tibia,
tarsus and claw; but its development is scarcely ever entirely nor
 mal, being either de<U+FB01>cient in some of the tarsal joints, or irregular
 in the development of its armature.
    The following are the general conclusions which the author de
 duces from his investigations.      Slight wounds in the larvae of insects
 always   heal, except  when   the  viscera  have protruded, or excessive
 hemorrhage     has  occurred:   severe   wounds,  such as those attending
 the excision of a limb, also frequently heal.       lt is when the wound
 is in the line of action of the principal muscles of the body that pro
 trusion of the viscera takes place. For the healing of wounds, the
 <U+FB01>rst requisite is the arrest of the hemorrhage; and this is effected,
 as in the higher animals, by the coagulation of the blood, and the
 formation of a clot; and then a complete union of the separated
 parts takes place beneath the eschar formed by the clot.        After this
 union, the reparation of the injury is commenced by a development,
 from the injured surface, of parts corresponding to those that had
 been removed.       For the production of a new limb, one change of
 skin, at least, is necessary. The healing of the wound after the
 removal of a part, and the subsequent reproduction, although they
 do not prevent, yet certainly retard the natural changes.          Lastly,
 the author has established the fact, that reproduction of lost parts
 takes place in metabolic as well as in the ametabolic articulata.
     The paper is accompanied with drawings of reproduced parts.
    5. “ On the Changes of Temperature produced by the Rarefaction
 and Condensation of Air."        By James Prescott Joule, Esq. Com
 municated by P. M. Roget, M.D., Sec. R.S.
    In order to estimate with greater accuracy than has hitherto been
  done the quantities of heat evolved or absorbed during the conden
 sation or rarefaction of atmospheric air, the author contrived an
  apparatus where both the condensing pump and the receiver were

                                 518
immersed in a large quantity of water, the changes in the tempe
rature of which were ascertained by a thermometer of extreme sen
sibility. By comparing the amount of force expended in condensing
air in the receiver with the quantity of heat evolved, after deducting
that which was the effect of friction, it was found that a mechanical
force, capable of raising 823 pounds to the height of one foot, must
be applied in the condensation of air, in order to raise the tempe
rature of one pound of water one degree of Fahrenheit’s scale. In
another experiment, when air condensed in one vessel was allowed
to pass into another vessel from which the air had been exhausted,
both vessels being immersed in a large receiver full of water, no
change of temperature took place, no mechanical power having been
developed.     The author considers these results as strongly corro
borating  the  dynamical theory of the nature of heat, in opposition
to that which ascribes to it materiality; but he reserves the further
discussion of this question to a future communication, which he
hopes soon to present to the Royal Society.
   The Society then adjourned over the long vacation, to meet again
on the 21st   Nov. next.

 THE time     has again come round for my addressing you, and for ex
 pressing my own gratitude, as well as yours, to your Council for their
  constant and zealous attention to the interests of the Royal Society.
 We have been compelled during several late years to have recourse to
 legal proceedings on the subject of the great tithes of Mablethorp,
 a portion of the Society's property, and I rejoice to say with success.
 In my last address, I was required to give our thanks to Mr. Watt
  and to Mr. Dollond for the valuable busts which they had kindly
 presented to us.      That of Mr. Dollond is placed at the commence
 ment of the staircase leading to our apartments, and serves to indi

 scopes have been so many steps to the acquisition of higher and
 higher knowledge of the great universe of which this globe forms
 so insigni<U+FB01>cant a part.      By the liberality of Mr. Watt we shall soon
  be furnished   with  handsome    pedestals for the busts of his father and
  of Sir Isaac    Newton,   the   two   great lights of British mechanical
  genius and British philosophical science.         Mr. Gilbert ha kindly
 undertaken to furnish a similar pedestal for the bust of his father,
  and we have thought it right to provide one for that of Sir Joseph
  Banks. These will shortly form a conspicuous ornament of our
  place of meeting.

                                    521
    The magnetical observatories are still carrying on their observa
tions, both in Her Majesty"a dominions and in foreign countries, and
another naval o<U+FB02>icer, Lieut. .\luore, lnis proceeiled to the Antarctic
 Seas to complete a portion of the survey of ('uptnin Sir .lunn-- lines,
which was interrupted by stress of wentlu-r. That gallant nod enter
prising o<U+FB02>icer will, l hope, ere long give to us and to the public his
own narrative of his important discoveries.        Detailed accounts of
the botany and zoology of the regions Visits-d by him are preparing
under the patronage of the (iovermnent, while Colonel Sabine is
proceeding with the magnetical observations, which were the more
immediate objects of this, one of the most important voyages of
discovery ever undertaken.
   During the course of the year just expired, the presence in lin
gltmd of the King of Saxony gave us the opportunity of obtaining
the honour of his accession to the list of the Royal .\len|ben4 of our
Society,—a circumstance the more gratifying, as llis Majesty is n
follower as well as a patron of science.
   The cordial co-operation of llis Imperial .\l1lje.\'i)' the Empcror of
Russia in the magnetical inquiries carrying on by our own and other
governments, mainly at the request of the lloyal Society, makes us
the more to regret that the shortness of his stay in England rendered
it impossible for us to obtain his signature in our Charter-book in
addition to those of so man other sovereigns.          The absence from
London of the King of the Iiiench during his late short stay in En
gland, as well as our own vacation, precluded us from taking any
steps for the election of that monarch. This we must all lament when
we advert to the proximity of the two nations, and to the eminent
services that so many men of the greatest genius, industry and talent
on the other side of the Channel have rendered to science.
   In thus udverting to the visits of these royal strangers to our
sovereign, I trust that I shall neither be accused of adulation nor of
introducing politics whcre they would be peculiarly uusensonnblc.
In m opinion, science is herself so illustrious, that she can receive
no additional wreath from any follower or patron, however exalted
in rank or power, but, on the contrary, that she will confer honour
on them.     But though this be true of science in the abstract, yet a
society like ours must gain by such additions to its ranks; and though
the powerful of the earth cannot make the cause of science more
intrinsically honourable, yet they can make her progress more easy
and more rapid.      As long as rwe feel that hcr advancement must
promote all the best interests of humanity, so long we must rejoice
to see the sovereigns of nations, differing in their language. their
polity and their religion, nevertheless uniting to increase our know
ledge of the wonderful works of the Author of Nature, and to aug
ment our capability of employing that knowledge in the service of
mankind.       -
   The  two  Medals   placed at our disposal by Her Majesty have been
adjudged by your Council to Mr. Boole and Dr. Andrews, and the
Copley Medal to Signor Matteucci of Pisa.        l regret that the latter
distinguished  foreign philosopher,   whom   I and many     of yourselves,

                                      522
Gentlemen, had the pleasure of seeing this autumn in England,
should not be still among us, that I might have the opportunity of
bestowing it in person.
        Mr. DANIELL,
    I beg to present to you the Copley Medal for your friend Signor
Matteucci, which has been awarded to him by the Council of
the Royal Society for his important discoveries in the magnetic
electricity of animal nature.
    These discoveries, so singular and so new in themselves, appear to
promise results of the highest importance, not only in theoretical
science, but also in its practical application to the relief of pain and
the cure or alleviation of disease. Whatever may, however, be their
ultimate result, the scienti<U+FB01>c world must ever retain the liveliest
sense of the merits of Signor Matteucci, and must ever consider him
as adding new lustre to the glory that a Galvani has already given
to their common country.
        Mr. Crmrsrra,                                    r
    I  have to beg that you will take charge of the Medal for Mr.
Boole, awarded to him for his important papers on a General Method
of Analysis, published in our Transactions for the present year, con
taining matter as useful as it is original, and classifying and com
prehending analytical operations *. That Mr. Boole will continue
    * The object which the author
                                       proposes in this paper is to illustrate
the importance of conducting processes of reduction through the medium
of separation of symbols by the assumption of an exponential form for the
principal quantity operated on. The method, therefore, consists in the
transformation of given forms, from    .2ato 0, by means of the relation .1a= s”
and operating on the results by certain re<U+FB01>ned processes.         Although the
facilities which the exponential form a<U+FB02>°ords, under certain circumstances,
have long been known to analysts, in no investigation does the importance
of this form appear in the manner in which it is exhibited in this paper.
Here the author has shown a method which classi<U+FB01>es and comprehends
operations, and which has the advantage (in some cases at least) of show
ing their limits.
    The author applies his method to the solution of ditferential equations
and of equations of differences.    In the <U+FB01>nite solution of differential equa
tions, the beauty and utility of the method are strikingly exhibited. Certain
forms of equations, the solutions of which have been e<U+FB01>ected by transfor
mations or by a happy assumption, are made, by the author's method, to
exhibit their solutions in dependence on a law. Both the processes by
which the transformations are eifected and the results obtained by them are
of the highest interest and importance; and this part of the paper is so
valuable, that, alone, it would entitle the author to honorary distinction.
    In the application to equations of differences, under which head are in
 cluded generating functions, series, and the author's miscellaneous theorems,
the advantages of a general method must likewise be fully recognised ; and
the Council are satis<U+FB01>ed that the author has done good service in the appli
cations which he has made of his method in this branch of analysis.
    Anticipating that Mr. Boole’s method will<U+FB01>nd a permanent place in the
 science, the Council have not hesitated to award to him the Royal Medal.

                                      528
his mathematical       pursuits  must be the wish       of every friend of
science.
       Dr. A.\'nnsws,
   I have the honour of presenting to you one of the Royal hleduls,
which has been adjudged to you for your valuable paper on the
Thermal Changes accompanying Basic Substitutions0.               l hope this
will not   be the last on chemical      subjects that we shall receive at
your hands.
    Since our last Anniversary we have lost many distinguished mem
bers   of our Society, of whom the usual obituary will contain a short
account; among these we have to regret the death of Sir Henry
Halford, who for so long n period presided over the College of Phy
sicians; and of Dr. Hope, who for very many years was Professor of
Chemistry in the University of Edinburgh.              We have still more
immediate reason to lament the decease of one of our ablest and
most zealous colleagues,—of that distinguished astronomer the late
Mr. Baily, who has always taken an active share in the business
as well as in the scienti<U+FB01>c pursuits of the Royal Society.          \Vc have
also to deplore the death, at a venerable age, of Dr. Dalton of Man
chester, whose eminent discoveries         have so largely contributed     to
   0 The
           Royal Medal in Chemistry is awarded to Dr. Andrews of Belfast,
a chemical investigator of acknowledged ability and accuracy.      lle may be
said to have <U+FB01>rst opened the subject of the Heat evolved in Chemical Com
binations, by a valuable paper published three years ago in the Transactions
of the Royal Irish Academy, which was followed by a second, and attracted
to the inquiry the attention of the French Academy, who lately proposed
it as the subject of the great Monthyon prize, with special reference to the
experiments of Dr. Andrews contained in these papers.
   One of the most important general results of the former papers was, that
the heat on uniting a particular base or metallic oxide with an acid is con
stant, although the acid be varied.    This result was brought out by using
dilute solutions, and is certainly established in a considerable number of
acids within that degree of accuracy which thermal experiments appear to
admit of.
   In such neutralizations of an acid by a base, it is well known that what
really happens is not the simple and direct combination of the acid and
base, but the displacement of the basic water of the acid by a more power
ful base. Hence Dr. Andrews is led, in the paper in our Transactions
which is rewarded by the Medal, to inquire, whether, in the displacement of
other bases than water, such as lime, oxide of copper, &c., the same law
holds. He employed potash as the displacing base, and found that the
sulphate, nitrate, acetate and chloride of copper, when decomposed by that
base, all evolve the same heat; or that the heat is determined by the base,
and not by the acid.    The experiments are very numerous, embracing the
principal magnesian oxides, also soda, ammonia and peroxide of iron; and
the results accord with the general conclusion.
   This extension or generalization of his former law is possessed of much
chemical interest, and is the <U+FB01>rst great step in a line of inquiry of which
the further pursuit is greatly to be desired, from the light which it may be
expected to throw upon the fundamental laws of chemical combination.

   SIR HENRY HALFORD, Bart., G.C.H., was the son of Dr. James
Vaughan of Leicester, and was born on the 2nd of October 1766.
He received his preliminary education at Rugby, and graduated at
Christ Church College, Oxford, in the year 1794-. He established
himself as physician in London, and quickly rose to great emi
nence in his profession.    Distinguished no less by the elegance of
his manners than by the extent of his classical acquirements, his
practice rapidly increased, and he soon became the favourite phy
sician of the court and of the elevated circles of rank and fashion.
In 1809 he came into possession of an ample fortune on the death of
Sir Charles Halford, a cousin of his mother, who was a daughter of
Lord St. John, and in consequence of this acquisition he changed
his name from Vaughan to Halford, a baronetey being at the same
time conferred upon him by George the Third, who had previously
appointed him his physician.      He continued to hold a similar ap
pointment   under  George   the  Fourth,   William the Fourth, and her
present Majesty,   and   thus enjoyed    the  remarkable distinction of
having possessed   the con<U+FB01>dence    of  four   successive sovereigns, and
of having attended professionally almost every member of the Royal
 Famil .
   To    {he
           honours thus emanatin       from royal favour were added
                                       otg
the highest which the members         his own profession could confer.
Sir Henry Halford was elected President of the College of Phy
sicians in the year 1820, and held this of<U+FB01>ce till his death, which
happened in the month of March of the present year.           His consti
tution was naturally robust, and its vigour was sustained unimpaired
to an advanced period of life; but in later years the advance of age
had become perceptible, his activity declined, and his constitution
at last sank, in the 78th year of his age, under -the exhaustion con
sequent on     neural ic affection.

                                                                     .
    He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1810; he con
tributed no paper to our Transactions, but has enriched those of
the College of Physicians with numerous valuable essays on pro
fessional subjects.   His orations pronounced before the College are
remarkable for the classical purity and elegance of their latinity.
  FRANCIs BAILY, Esq.—It       with feeling of sorrow, in which
                                  is         a
know that every Fellow of the Royal Society will participate, that     I I
have to notice the irreparable loss of our distinguished colleague
Mr. Francis Baily.
  The memoir of Mr. Baily, which has been drawn up by Sir J.
Herschel, and which     now
                         is    the press, will contain so full an ac
                                 in
count of his personal history and so elaborate an analysis of his
various scienti<U+FB01>c labours, that feel that should do injustice to my

racteristic accuracy of outline and detail; and     only with refer

                                    525
 ence to his connexion with the Royal Society that I will venture to
 say a very few words.
     Mr. Baily was for several years Treasurer of our Society, and
 generally held a seat in our Council, and was rarely absent from its
 meetings.    We are greatly indebted to him for much of the order
 and system which prevail in our <U+FB01>nances; and upon every subject
 connected with our administration his opinion was always listened
 to with the respect and attention which was due to his excellent
 temper, good sense andjudgement.      On questions of science he never
spoke when his knowledge of the subject did not entitle him to
 speak with authority, and various as were the scienti<U+FB01>c researches
 in which he was engaged, he never undertook a task which he did
 not execute with extraordinary promptitude, completeness and accu
 racy; so correct was the estimate which he had formed of the extent
of his own powers; so persevering and systematic was his industry.
    Da. THOMAs CnsnLas Hora was the son of Dr. John Hope,
 Professor of Botany in the University of Edinburgh, and was born
at Edinburgh on the 21st of July 1766-.
    His devotion to chemical science and his recognition as a chemist
date from an early period of his life; for he was, on the death of Dr.
Irvine, appointed Lecturer on Chemistry at Glasgow on the lOth of
 October 1787, while yet in his twenty-<U+FB01>rst year. lle was farther,
in 1789, appointed Professor of Medicine in the same university,
 conjointly with his uncle Dr. Stevenson.     It does not appear, how
ever, that he had actually delivered lectures on either subject in
 Glasgow until 1793; he most probably passed the interval in study
 ing at home and abroad, for we are informicd that he returned from
 France in 1791, and he thereal'te'r continued to lecture at Glasgow
until 1795. At this period, he received the distinguished compliment
of being recommended by Dr. Black as his as'istant and successor
in the chemical chair at Edinburgh. Accordingly, in 1795, Dr. Hope
entered on his new duties by delivering a course conjointly with
 Dr. Black, whose decaying powers permitted him only to deliver the
lectures on Caloric.    In this, as well as in the courses of chemistry
which he delivered in Glasgow, Dr. Hope taught the then recent
doctrines of Lavoisier, which had not yet entirely overthrown the
doctrine of phlogiston, and had not previously been publicly taught
by any professor in Britain.
   Dr. Hope's exertions during his residence at Glasgow had not
been limited to writing and improving his lectures.       On the 4-th of
November 1793, he read to the Royal Society of Edinburgh his
well-known paper, “On a mineral from Strontian," in which he
pointed out the existence of an undescribed earth, distinct from
barytes, with which it had been confounded, and to which he gave
the name of Strontites.
    In 1803, in the 6th volume of Nicholson's Journal, a brief notice
was published of the instrument with which Dr. Hope employed a
solution of sulphuret of potassium for eudiometrical purposes; and
in 1804-, he laid before the Royal Society of Edinburgh the careful

                                    526
  and elegant experiments, by which he demonstrated that the pro
  position laid down by Dr. Croune in 1683 regarding the expansion
   of water by cold is really correct; and that the phenomena observed
   do not depend, as Hooke and others had maintained, on changes
   occurring in the capacity of the vessel in which the experiment is
1  conducted.    From these researches, Dr. Hope concluded that the
   maximum density of water isat 39%° or 40° Fahr.; a result con
   <U+FB01>rmed by the more recent and very accurate experiments of Hall
   striim, who estimates its point of greatest density at 39'39° Fahr.
   This, his favourite subject, received a still further elucidation from
   him at a later period of his life. In 1839 he read to the Royal
   Society of Edinburgh a paper, in which he showed that this law held
   true with regard to water only in its pure state; and that when it
   contains saline matters in solution, as in sea-water, it follows the
   ordinary law of regularly progressive expansion by heat and con
  traction by cold.
      The last communication which Dr. Hope made to the chemical
   world was in 1848, when he read two papers on the colouring mat
   ter of the Camellia japonica, Magnolia 1/randg'<U+FB02>ora, and Chrysan
   themum leucanthemum.       In these communications, he asserted the
   existence of three new proximate organic bodies, to which he gave
  the names of Camelline, Magnoline and Leucantkemine, but which
   he did not obtain in a separate form.
      Dr. Hope’s claims on the gratitude of the chemical world are not
  to be estimated by his merits as an observer. He seems, from the <U+FB01>rst,
  to have resolved to devote himself rather to the business of teaching
   than of research. He spared no pains to make his lectures attractive
  to the student; his style of writing was elegant and concise, and his
  delivery easy but impressive. The great charm of his lectures, how
   ever, consisted in the elegant experiments with which he illustrated
  them: these were so well-devised, so skilfully arranged and so neatly
  performed, that a failure on his lecture-table was an occurrence
  almost unknown.      One other circumstance which contributed to his
  success as a lecturer was the excellent health which he enjoyed.
  During a period of nearly sixty years, in which he was engaged in
  studying or teaching medicine and chemistry, he was not more than
  six days in all prevented by illness from discharging his duties.    He
  retained his vigour and his faculties with little diminution till within
  a short period of his death; but in 184-3, <U+FB01>nding himself unequal to
  the duties of his class, he arranged with his colleague Dr. Traill to
  deliver the lectures for him, and shortly after resigned the appoint
  ment into the hands of the patrons.
      Dr. Gregory was appointed to the vacant chair, and before he had
  entered on its duties his veteran predecessor died at Edinburgh on
  the 13th of June 1844-, in the 78th yearof his age.
      CAPTAIN BAsu. HALL, R.N., was one ofthe younger sons of the
  late Sir James Hall of Dunglass.
      Sir James was himself a man of very active mind, and is well
  known to all geologists for the experiments instituted by him in cor

                                     a
                                   527
roboration of the opinion of his illustrious fricnd Professor Playfair,
and his ingenious speculations on the origin of pointed architecture
must be equally well known to the medievul antiquary.        Sir James
was for some years President of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and
it may well be supposed that our late fellow inherited his father':
love for science in general, and more especially for those sciences
with which the naval profession has so much to do. He was born
on the last day of the year 1788, and entered on his professional
career in the month of June 180‘). He commanded the Lyra at the
time when Lord Amherst was sent on a mission to the court of
Pekin, and published an interesting account of his visit to Loo-Chou.
He was author of observations on a comet at the time when he was
on the South American station, and of a paper on the geology of
the Cape of Good Hope at an early period of his life. His rfavourite
science was astronomy; but geology could not be indifferent to the
son of Sir James Hall. He was always most anxious to serve science
by receiving the instructions of distinguished philosophers, and re
cording for their use observations made by him in the distant parts
of the world which he had the opportunity of visiting.       He was an
able observer and practical astronomer, and had occasion to turn
 these qualities to excellent account as a naval o<U+FB02>icer.       He was
author of many works of great interest, chie<U+FB02>y connected with what
he had himself seen in different parts of the globe.       He married
 Miss Hunter on the lst of March 1825, and left a family at his
 death.
     AomnnL Sm Roszar Baarow was born in the year I758,
 and attained the rank of captain in the Royal Navy in June I798.
 His naval career was distinguished by eminent services; and on the
 '24-th of January 1823, he was promoted to the rank of rear ad
 miral on the retired list, by reason of his holding the situation of
 Commissioner of the Navy, to which he had been appointed in the
 year 1808. He had the honour of being made a Knight Commander
 of the Bath on the <U+FB01>rst establishment of that order in its present
 shape, and received a Grand Cross by seniority the year before his
 death.    He expired on the llth of May 184-3, at the advanced age
 of 85. By an accidental omission, his name was not mentioned in
 the obituary of last year.
     Sm Gone OUsELEY, G.C.H., was born in 1770, and was second
  son of Ralph Ouseley, Esq., by his <U+FB01>rst wife, the daughter of Henry
  Holland, Esq., of Limerick. He went to India in early life, and there
  displayed that aptitude for the acquirement of Eastern languages to
  which he was mainly indebted for his subsequent political advance
  ment.    After his return, he married, in 1806, Miss Whitelock, by
  whom he left the son who has succeeded him in his hereditary
  honours.     His useful services as a Persian linguist at the time
  when a Persian envoy had visited our shores, procured for him the
  post of ambassador at the court of Persia in 1810. He afterwards
  proceeded to St. Petersburg. He was created a privy councillor

                                   528
and a baronet, and he was also invested with the Russian order of
Alexander, and the Persian order of the Lion and Sun. His gentle
manly address and the agreeableness of his manners rendered him a
general favourite in society.    He died at his seat, Hall Barn Park,
on the 18th day of the present month, in the 75th year of hi age, and
is succeeded in his title and estates by his son Frederick Arthur
Gore, the present baronet, who was born in the year 1825.
   Jorm DALTON      was born on the 5th of September, 1766, at Eagles
<U+FB01>eld,  near Cockermouth,     in the Cumberland Lake district.        He
passed  some  years  as teacher of  mathematics   in a school at Kendal,
and removed in 1793 to Manchester, where he continued to reside
during the whole of his after-life.
   It was doubtless his long residence among the lakes and mountains
of Cumberland, and his consequent early familiarity with the ever.
varying conditions of the atmosphere observable in that district,
that gave the <U+FB01>rst impulse to his genius, and materially in<U+FB02>uenced
his subsequent scienti<U+FB01>c career.     His earliest important publication
was a Treatise  on Meteorology, which furnished a clear compendium
of all the facts then ascertained, and made known various original
views, especially on the altitude of the Aurora Borealis.      From ob
serving and recording the sensible atmospheric changes, the pheno
mena of dew, of clouds and of temperature, he was naturally impelled
to inquire into the constitution of the atmosphere, and more gene
rally of mixed elastic <U+FB02>uids, and into the theory of evaporation and
the laws of heat.     On these questions he made public, through the
 Transactions of the Manchester Society, a series of experimental
memoirs, of which it is impossible to over-estimate the importance.
His <U+FB01>rst conception of the mutual relations of mixed gases was, that
each gas stood in the relation of a vacuum to the particles of all other
gases; but in his New System of Chemical Philosophy he subse
quently relaxed the strictnes of this original proposition, by con
ceding that the particles presented some mechanical impediment to
commingling.     He ascertained the form of the vapours of water and
some other liquids at different temperatures, and dispelled by these
experiments and others of equal importance the obscurity in which
the theory of vaporization had been left by De Luc and Saussure.
 He <U+FB01>rst showed that a given space, whether void or <U+FB01>lled with any
gas, in contact with water, contains precisely the same amount of
aqueous vapour, and thus established the non-existence of chemical
a<U+FB02>inity between the gas and the steam of water. It is impossible not
to be impressed with the beautiful simplicity of the instruments by
which these important results were wrought out. Four barometric
tubes, <U+FB01>lled with mercury, over which were admitted small columns
 of water, alcohol, ether and sulphuret of carbon, were the means
 employed for the admeasurement of the comparative forms of the
 vapours at different atmospheric or arti<U+FB01>cial temperatures.     Among
these successive memoirs is one of great merit on the heat evolved
during the entrance of air into a vacuum.         He showed the inade
 quacy  of the thermometer to serve as a measure of this evanescent

                                      529
elevation of temperature, and by an ingenious contrivance obtained
a much closer approximation to the true hcst.
    The <U+FB01>rst part of his New System of Chemical Philosophy will pro
bably constitute the most durable monument of his scienti<U+FB01>c genius;
in this small volume are condensed the results of many yennf patient
thinking and of much laborious research ; those larger portions,
which are devoted to the measure of temperature and the theory of
speci<U+FB01>c heat, may still be studied with advantage. though they were
deemed by Dr. Dalton himself to have been in great part superseded
by the labours of hIhI. Petit and Dulong. The short concluding
chapter contains the <U+FB01>rst announcement of the atomic doctrine of
chemical combination.
    He has often expressly stated that the tables of chemical equiva
lents constructed by Wenzel and ltichter <U+FB01>rst suggested to him the
conception that che|nical combination must have place between the
ultimate particles or indivisiblc atoms of bodies.          The tabulated
differences of weight of the different bases required to neutralise n
given weight of acid would, on this hypothesis, represent the respec
tive weights of their ultimate atoms. Further evidence of more
decisive character presented itself in the instances in which one body
 combines with another in more than one proportion.         The successive
 combining quantities were ascertained to be represented by numbers
that were simple multiples of the smallest or lowest quantity.          Dr.
 Dalton's earliest illustration of his law of multiple proportions was
 derived from the gaseous compounds of oxygen and nitrogen.             Dr.
 Wollaston afterwards discovered other examples of the law in the
 tartrates and oxalates, and U. Gay Lussac's precise experiments on
 gaseous combination completed the chain of evidence.          All the phe
 nomena of inorganic chemistry have been since shown to be in strict
 accordance with the atomic hypothesis, which has banished the un
 certainty of con<U+FB02>icting results, by enabling the cxperiinentalist to
 anticipate and correct his analyses, and has thus raised chemistry, as
 respects numerical precision, almost to the rank of a mathematical
 science.
    It would be inconsistent with the principles of logical induction to
 claim for the atomic doctrine higher rank than that of the most con
 venient form of expressing and recording chemical phenomena, and
 of the most probable hypothesis that has been hitherto proposed for
 interpreting chemical combination.        In the <U+FB01>eld of organic analysis,
 which has of late years been laboured with signal success, rules of
 combination seem to obtain which are diiiicultly reconcileable with
 the doctrine of Dalton.      It is scarcely possible to conceive the me
 chanical juxtaposition of so large a number of elementary atoms as
 would appear to constitute one compound organic atom; there are
 consequently many among the cultivators of this branch of chemical
 science who refuse to accept the atomic hypothesis as now consti
 tuting a suiiicient generalization of established facts.      Yet even in
 the chemistry   of vegetable    substances,  the remarkable changes dis
 covered by Mitscherlich, which he conceives best explained by the
 union of propejacent atoms of hydrogen and oxygen, and their elimi

                                   530
nation in the form of water, minister strong support to the theory of
atomic combination.      Without venturing to anticipate the future
destinies of the hypothesis of Dalton, it is suf<U+FB01>cient for the fame of
its author to acknowledge the mighty impulse it has given to the
progress of chemical knowledge.        .
   Dr. Dalton died on the 27th of July last.
   THOMAs HENDERsON, Professor of Practical Astronomy in the
 University of Edinburgh, and Her Majesty’s Astronomer for Scot
land, was born at Dundee on the 28th of December 1798, and re
ceived a competent classical and mathematical education at the excel
lent public schools of that town.    He was intended for the legal pro
fession, and at the age of <U+FB01>fteen was placed in the of<U+FB01>ce of a solicitor
in Dundee, where he continued six years. During this period he
began, without any other assistance than such as he could derive from
books, to devote his leisure time to the study of astronomy, and
being gifted with a quick apprehension and extraordinary powers of
memory, he very soon made himself acquainted with the practical
parts of the science, and acquired great dexterity in astronomical
computations.     At the age of twenty-one he removed to Edinburgh,
for the purpose of completing his legal education, and some time
afterwards he was employed as private secretary to the Earl of Lau
derdale.   In Edinburgh his knowledge of astronomy procured him
the acquaintance of some of the most eminent professors and scien
ti<U+FB01>c characters of that metropolis, whose encouragement no doubt
tended to stimulate his efforts and con<U+FB01>rm his tastes; and in the small
observatory belonging to the Astronomical Institution he had an
opportunity of becoming acquainted with the use of instruments.
That he used his opportunities to good purpose is apparent from the
communications he now began to make to the Royal Astronomical
Society, both of observations made by him at Edinburgh and of
various useful calculations, relating chie<U+FB02>y to moon-culminating
stars, but extending also to other phenomena; and at the anniver
sary meeting of that body in 1830 he received their thanks for “ the
very valuable assistance which he had rendered to the cause of
astronomy in his various computations presented to the Society."
His connexion with Lord Lauderdale brought him occasionally to
London, where his contributions to the Astronomical Society secured
him a favourable reception from astronomers, and the high opinion
which had been formed of his talents was con<U+FB01>rmed by personal in
tercourse and observation of the extent and remarkable accuracy of
his astronomical knowledge.      In October 1831 he was appointed to
succeed Mr. Fallows as astronomer at the Cape of Good Hope.
Causes of a nature entirely personal led to his resignation of this
appointment at the end of about a year after he had entered on its
duties; but though the time of his residence at the Cape was short,
it was most diligently employed, and su<U+FB02>iced for accumulating a
mass of important observations, from which he afterwards deduced
results of great value to astronomy.       In August 1834 he was ap
pointed,  on the recommendation     of the Royal Astronomical Society

                                   531
(whose advice had been requested by the Secretary of State), to the
Professorship of Practical Astronomy in the University of Edinburgh,
with which of<U+FB01>ce was conjoined the superintendence of the Edin
burgh observatory, then taken under the protection of the Govern
ment.     This appointment he continued to hold till his death, which
took place after a short illness, in consequence of an affection of the
heart, on the 23rd of November ISM, before he had quite completed
his 4-6th year.
    Professor Henderson's reputation as an astronomer stood high;
he was a careful and accurate observer, an expert and resolute cal
culator, was profoundly skilled in the theory of instruments, and
possessed great knowledge of methods, and an acquaintance with the
history and literature of his science, which for extent and minute
accuracy has rarely been surpassed. The results of his labours
were for the most part communicated to the Royal Astronomical
Society, and have been printed in their Memoirs: they embrace a
considerable range of subjects, but the most important perhaps, in
point of permanent value, is his Catalogue of the Declinations and
Right Ascensions of 172 principal Fixed Stars (chie<U+FB02>y in the south
ern hemisphere), observed by himself and his assistant during his
residence at the Cape; and the most remarkable of the single results
he obtained is a sensible parallax of the double star a Centauri,
amounting to about one second of space: this result, which he <U+FB01>rst
detected on a comparison of his reduced observations of declination,
was partially con<U+FB01>rmed by the subsequent reduction of the observa
tions of the star's right ascensions; and it afterwards received from
him a further con<U+FB01>rmation by a discussion of the observations made
by his successor Mr. Maclear, expressly with a view to the determi
nation of the question.     Having regard to the history of this subject,
it would perhaps be unsafe at present to a<U+FB02>irm that he has done
more than establish a strong probability in favour of the measure
able parallax of this system (already remarkable for its great proper
motion) ; but should further observations change the probability into
a certainty, Mr. Henderson's name will descend to posterity asso
ciated with a discovery which has so long been the desire of astro
nomers, and so often baffled their efforts.    His whole astronomical
 career was marked by an activity and energy which continued un
 abated to the last. Nor were his labours con<U+FB01>ned to the routine of
 his of<U+FB01>cial duties.   On more than one occasion he cheerfully under
 took the heavy task of giving lectures for his colleagues in the Uni
 versity; much of his time was consumed in the reduction of his Cape
 observations; he superintended the reduction and arrangement of
 La Caille's Catalogue for the British Association; and if a comet
 was anywhere observed, he was always one of the <U+FB01>rst to compute
 and communicate its orbit.
    In his private character Mr. Henderson was distinguished by great
 kindness of disposition, amiable manners, and warmth of affection;
 he was an enthusiastic admirer of excellence of every kind, and a
 person on whose integrity, honour and high principles, every one
who had the good fortune to enjoy his acquaintance felt that the

                                   532
most implicit con<U+FB01>dence might be placed.         He was a Fellow of the
Royal    Astronomical  Society and  of  the Royal Society of Edinburgh,
and was elected into this Society on the 9th of April 184-0.
   WILLIAM ALLEN was the son of Mr. Job Allen, a silk-manufac
turer of Spital<U+FB01>elds, and was born in London on the 29th of August
1770.     His father being of the Society of Friends, he was strictly
educated in the principles of that religious community, of which he
continued till his death an exemplary and distinguished member.
The early preference evinced by him for chemistry induced his
father to place him in an establishment of high repute, of which,
some years after, he became the proprietor.        But happily for suffer
ing humanity, neither commercial gains nor the love of science itself
could hold exclusive possession of his mind.       From an early period
of his life he cooperated with Clarkson, Wilberforce and other philan
thropists in their efforts for the abolition of the African slave
trade, which were -happily at length successful.
   Mr. Allen's connexion with the schools of chemistry and natural
philosophy in Guy's Hospital commenced in 1803, and continued till
 1826: Mr. Allen’s ability and <U+FB01>tness as a teacher of science were
there amply attested.           '
   In l804', Mr. Allen read his <U+FB01>rst course of lectures on natural phi
losophy in the Royal Institution. The valuable researches on carbon,
carbonic acid, and the changes effected in atmospheric air by respi
ration, made by Mr. Allen in conjunction with Mr. Pepys, are too
well known to require remark.       The results are to be found in our
Transactions for 1807, 1808, 1809. Mr. Allen was in 1807 admitted
a Fellow of the Royal Society.      He also became a member of other
scienti<U+FB01>c bodies of this country and of the continent.
    It was, however, to other objects of public utility that the greater
 part of Mr. Allen's life was devoted.      The education of the poor on
 christian principles, and the circulation of the holy scriptures, were
 among the <U+FB01>rst to which he directed his efforts; and wherever he
 went the moral improvement of his fellow-creatures occupied his at
 tention.    He was at all times ready to cooperate with the good of
 every creed whose aim was the happiness of mankind, and probably
 no man of his generation lived to see nobler fruits of his labours.
    Having been one of the founders of the British and Foreign School
 Society, he was, in 1808, elected its <U+FB01>rst treasurer, an o<U+FB02>ice which he
 held until his death.   To this institution he liberally contributed not
 only his time, but also large pecuniary assistance.      At Lind<U+FB01>eld, in
 Sussex, he expended large sums in building schools of industry, and
laboured assiduously by other plans for bettering the condition of
 the poor.    Among these the system of allotments of land found him
 a zealous patron.
    In 1818—19 Mr. Allen visited Russia, where, in the reign of the
 Emperor Alexander, he, in conjunction with two friends, compiled a
 volume of scriptural selections, for the instruction of youth in the
 military and other schools of that empire. Mr. Allen made several
 other journeys for benevolent objects to the continent, and he. greatly

                                                      .
                                     558
exerted himself in behalf      of the Greeks and of the Waldenses of
Piedmont.
    The source of Mr. Allen's extraordinary in<U+FB02>uence was to be found
in that singleness of purpose, which, breaking down the obstacles of
party, gave him access to those in power, and carried him as by n
royal road to the con<U+FB01>dence and fsvour of princes.            At home we
<U+FB01>nd him enjoying the marked consideration of their late Royal High
nesses the Dukes of Kent and Sussex, the former appointing him
one of his executors; and abroad he was in frequent communication
with the Emperor Alexander.
     Mr. Allen possessed in an uncommon degree the power of giving
his mind to n great variety of subjects. and this, together with his
activity, economy of time and early habits, enabled him to accom
plish a prodigious amount of good.          His correspondence alone was
a labour from which most men would have shrunk.
     In addition to subscriptions and donations to public charities, the
 casual calls on Mr. Allen's benevolence were very heavy; he also
 gave cheerfully, and there are perhaps few great works which he
 did not at some period of his life assist.      The extent of .\lr. Allen's
 charity   seems  to  have  been widely   known,   for we <U+FB01>nd the Emperor
 Alexander urging it as a reason for his undertaking the supply of
 drugs for the Russian armies, an offer which he gratefully but <U+FB01>rmly
 refused, and to his honour be it spoken, he resi.-ted a temptation the
 value of which it would be dif<U+FB01>cult to estimate.          At the end of n
 long life he could say that he had never compromised his public use
 fulness for private interests.
     During the last fourteen      ears of his active life, Mr. Allen had
 passed about half his time at   iind<U+FB01>eld,   diffusing happiness and doing
 good to those about him. The review of a well-spent life gave com
 fort to the evening of his days, and that gospel which had been his
  rule through life was his stay in death, sustaining his mind in sere
  nity and peace.
      He died at Lind<U+FB01>eld on the 30th of December, I843, aged 73.
      The thanks of the Meeting were given to the President for his
  Address, with a request that he would allow it to be printed.
      The Statutes relating to the election of Council and O<U+FB02>icers having

   “ On the Laws of the Tides on the ('oust of In-land, as infern-d
from an extensive scrics of observations nnulc in connexion with the
Ordnance Survey of Ireland." By (icorgc lliddell Airy, Esq., F.ll.S.,
Astronomer Royal.
   The elaborate investigations of which the results are comnmni
cated    in the present paper, were suggested by the iicm-ssity of
adopting some standard mean height of the sen, as a line of refer
ence for the elevations ascertained in the opcrntions of the Ordnance
Survey of Ireland. Colonel Colby, R.E, who conducted that survey,
had with this view determined to institute a series of observations
on the height of the water in different states of tlic tide; and con
ceiving that these observations might be made subservient to im
provement in the theory of the tides, rcqucstcd the assistance of the
author in laying down the plan of observation lNs|. calculated to
e<U+FB01>ect that object.      The suggestions which wcrc, in conscqucncc,
made by the author were adopted in their utmost extent by Coloncl
Colby; and the collection of observations was placed in the author's
hands in the winter of 184-2.      The whole number of observations
exceeds two hundred thousand ; and they derive extraordinary value
from the circumstance of the localities, of their simultaneity, their
extensive range, and the uniformity of plan on which they were con
ducted. Their reduction was made by the computers at the Royal
Observatory, Greenwich, under the supcrintendence of the author,
and with the authority of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury.
The nature of the different branches of the inquiry may be gathered
from the titles of the several sections into which the paper is divided,
and which are as follows :—
    Section I.—Account of the stations, levellings, times and methods
of observation.
    Section II.—Methods of extracting from the observations the
times of high and low water; of supplying de<U+FB01>cient times and
heights; and of correcting the times <U+FB01>rst determined.
    Section lII.—'l'heory of diurnal tide as related to observations
only; and deduction of the principal results for diurnal tide given
immediately by these observations.
    Section IV.—Theory of diurnal tide as referred to the actions of
 the sun and moon.
    Section V.—Discussion of the height of apparent mean water, as
 deduced from the heights of high and low water only, corrected for
 diurnal tide ; with reference to difference of station, and to variations
 of the phase of the moon, and of the declination of the moon.
    Section VI.—Discussion of the range of the tide, and of semi
 menstrual inequality in height, apparent proportion of solar and
 lunar effects as shown by heights, and age of tide as shown by
 heights, from high water and from low water.
    Section VII.—Establishment of each port, and progress of semi
 diurnal tide round the island.

                                   540
    Section VIII.—Semimenstrual inequality in time, proportion of
solar and lunar e<U+FB02>ects as shown by times, and apparent age of tide
as shown by times, from high water and from low water.
    Section IX.—Formation of the time of diurnal high water; pro
gress of the diurnal tide-wave round the island; comparison of its
progress and range with those of the semidiurnal tide.
    Section X.—Method of expressing the height of the water through
out every individual tide, by sines and cosines of arcs; and expres
sions in this form for every tide in the whole series of observations,
except those at Courtown.
    Section XI.—Discussion of the height of mean water deduced from
the anal sis of individual tides; with reference to difference of sta
tion, anrl to variations of the phase of the moon, and of the declina
tion of the moon.
    Section XII.—Discussion of range of tide, or coe<U+FB02>icient of <U+FB01>rst
arc, in the analysis of individual tides; and of seinimenstrual inequa
lity in range, apparent proportion of solar and lunar effects, and age
of tide as deduced from range.                                         .
    Section XIII.—Establishment of each port, as deduced from the
time of maximum of the <U+FB01>rst periodical term in the analysis of indi
vidual tides.
    Section XIV.—Semimenstrual inequality in time, proportion of
solar and lunar effects from times, and apparent age of tide as shown
by times, deduced from the time of maximum of the <U+FB01>rst periodical
term.
    Section XV.—C0mparison of the results as to mean height, range,
semimenstrual inequality in height, age of tide obtained from height,
establishment, semimenstrual inequality in time, and age of tide ob
tained from time, deduced from high and low waters only, in Sec
tions V., VI., VII., VIII., with those deduced from the analysis of
individual tides in Sections XL, XIL, XIlI., XIV.
    Section XVI.—Remarks on the succeeding terms of the expres
sions for individual tides, as related to the magnitude of the tide, to
the position on the sea-coast, to the position on the river, &c.; com

the quarto-diurnal tides.
    Section XVII.—Separate discussion of the tidal observations at

          SIR JAMES CLARK ROSS, V.P.,              in the Chair.
    “On the Liquefaction and Solidi<U+FB01>cation of Bodies generally ex
isting as Gases."     By Michael Faraday, Esq., F.R.S., D.C.L., &c.
    The method employed by the author for examining the capability
of gases to assume the liquid or solid form, consisted in combining
the condensing powers of mechanical compression with that of very

                                       541
  considerable depressions of temperature.         The <U+FB01>rst object was ob
  tained by the successive action of two air-pumps; the tirst having a
  piston of one inch in diameter. by which the gas to be condensed
  was forced into the cylinder of the second pump, the diameter of
  whose piston was only halfan inch.        The tubes into which the air,
  thus further condensed, was made to pass, were of grccn bottle
  glass, from one-sixth to one-quarter of an inch in external diameter,
  and had a curvature at one portion of their length adapted to im
  mersion in a cooling mixture: they were provided with suitable
 stop-cocks, screws, connecting pieces, and terminal caps, all very
  carefully made, and rendered sutiicicntly air-tight to retain their
 gaseous contents under the circumstances of the experiments, and
 when they were sustaining a pnssurc of <U+FB01>fty atmospheres, as ascer
 tained by mercurial gauges connccted with the apparatus. Cold was
 applied to the curved portions of the tube by their immersion in a
 bath of Thilorier's mixture of solid carbonic acid and cthcr.         The
 degree of cold thus produced, when the mixturc was surrounded by
  the air, estimated by an ulcohol lllt’rnnt)lIIeler, was a temperature of
  —l06° Fahr. But on placing the mixture under an air-pump, and
 removing the atmospheric pressure, leaving only that of thc va our
 of carbonic acid, which amounted only to 1-'.2rtth of the former, dihat
 is to the pressure of a column of 1'2 inch of mercury,) the ther
 mometer indicated a temperature of 166" below zero of Fahrenheit’a
 scale.    In this state, the ether was very <U+FB02>uid; and the bath could
 be kept in good order for a quarter of an hour at n time.
     The author found that there were many gases which, on being sub
jected to cold of this extreme intensity, condensed into liquids, even
 without a greater condensation than that arising from the ordinary at
 mosphcric pressure, and that they could then be preserved, sealed up
 in glass tubes, in this liquid state.    Such was the case with chlorine,
cyanogen, ammonia, sulphuretted hydrogen, arseniuretted hydrogen,
 hydroiodic acid, hydrobromic acid, carbonic acid, and euchlorine.
 With respect to some other gases, such as nitric oxide, <U+FB02>uosilicon,
and ole<U+FB01>ant gas, it was di<U+FB02>icult to retain them for any length of
 time in the tubes, in consequence of the chemical action they exerted
 on the cements used in the joinings of caps and other parts of the
 apparatus.     Hydroiodic and hydrobromic acids could be obtained
 either in the solid or liquid state.     Muriatic acid gas did not freeze
at the lowest temperature to which it could be subjected.          Sulphu
 rous acid froze into transparent and colourless crystals, of greater
 speci<U+FB01>c gravity than the liquid out of which they were formed.
 Sulphuretted hydrogen solidi<U+FB01>ed in masses of confused crystals of a
 white colour, at a temperature of —l22° Fahr.             Euchlorine was
 easily converted from the gascnus state into a solid crystalline body,
 which, by a slight increase of temperature, melted into an orange
 red <U+FB02>uid. Nitrous oxide was obtained solid at the temperature of
 the carbonic acid bath in vacuo, and then appeared as a beautifully
 clear and colourless crystalline body.      The author conceives that in
 this state it might, in certain cases, be substituted with advantage
for carbonic acid in frigori<U+FB01>c processes, for arriving at degrees of

                                       '
                                      in   14>
cold far below those hitherto attained by the employment of the
latter substance.   Ammonia was obtained in the state of solid white
crystals, and retained this form at a temperature of —lO3°.
   The following liquids could not be made to freeze at —l66°;
namely, chlorine, ether, alcohol, sulphuret of carbon, caoutehoucine,
camphine, and recti<U+FB01>ed oil of turpentine.
    The following gases showed no signs of liquefaction when cooled
by the carbonic acid bath, even when subjected to great pressure;
namely,
      Hydrogen, Oxygen, at pressure of . . . . 27 atmospheres.
                                 a

Esq., Colonial Surgeon of British Guiana.     Communicated by the
Right Honourable Lord Stanley.
   The earthquake here described commenced at twenty-seven mi
nutes past three o'clock, a.m. on the 30th of August, and continued
during two or three minutes.       appeared to be composed of two
                                      It
waves or pulsations quickly succeeding each other, and producing
gyratory movements of the earth.     Though the alarm    occasioned        it
was very great, no serious damage seems to have resulted from it.

   The author, having observed that       peculiar principle, in many
                                              a

atmospheric air. He <U+FB01>nds, that besides well-known compounds, such

  other in<U+FB02>ammable bodies when burning under certain conditions.
  The author is hence led to the conclusion that this peculiar oxidizing

  taking place in atmospheric air, and that its production is therefore
  independent of 'the nature of the substance which is burnt.
     “ On the Structure and Development of the Blood.—First Series.
  The development of the Blood-Corpuscle in Insects and other In
 vertebrate, and its comparison with that of Man and the Vertebrata."
 By George Newport, Esq., F.R.C.S., President of the Entomological
  Society, &c.    Communicated by P. M. Roget, M.D., Sec. R.S.
     The author commences his paper by remarking, that he was led
 to the present inquiry by some curious facts relating to the blood of
 insects, which attracted his notice while engaged on the last paper
 he presented to the Royal Society, on the reproduction of lost parts
 in insects and myriapoda.       Some of these facts he is desirous of
 making     known  at  once  to the Society, preparatory to his offering
 them more extended researches on the blood of the invertebrata, and
 its comparison with that of the higher animals.
     The chief purpose of the author in the present paper, is to show
 the analogy which exists between the different corpuscles in the
 blood of insects and of the vertebrata, to trace the changes which
 the former undergo as compared with those of the latter, and to
 show that in development and function they are analogous to secre
 ting cells.                                     .
    In pursuance of this object, he premises a brief notice of what
little was already known respecting the corpuscle in the articulata,
 and of the different-descriptions given of it by Carus, Spence, Wag
Iler, Bowerbank, Edwards, Baly and some later observers, all of
whom have described it differently, one only, Mr. Bowerbank, ha
ving correctly indicated its form.
    He then proceeds to state, that while engaged on other observa
          J
tions in une last, he found that the oat-shaped                which are
so abundant in the caterpillar state of the insect,corpuscles,
                                                     a most entirely dis
appear before the insect has arrived at the perfect, or butter<U+FB02>y state,
in which, a few days after the insect is fully developed, scarcely a
single oat-shaped corpuscle is to be found; but in the place of these,
there are numerous very minute rounded bodies, spherules, and also
many <U+FB02>attened, obtusely oval or barrel-shaped, double concave discs.
Both these forms of corpuscle have molecular movements. which are
most energetic in the spherules.
    He next makes some general observations on the composition ofthe
blood of the invertebrata, and calls in question the accuracy of Pro
fessor Wagner's view in regarding the blood of these animals as ana
logous only to the chyle of the vertebrata, at the same time stating
his belief that it is not only analogous to true blood, but that it un
dergoes a continued succession of changes through the agency of
the corpuscles.     These minute bodies <U+FB01>rst derive nourishment and

                                    54-5
the means of growth and increase from the <U+FB02>uid portion of the blood;
and afterwards, when they have become fully developed, undergo
dissolution, and help to supply the waste of the <U+FB02>uid that has been
expended on the nourishment of the diffcrent structures, leaving
other little bodies, which also undergo development, to assist in the
further elaboration of this <U+FB02>uid.       He states also, that the develop
ment of these latter bodies appears to have n certain relation to the
type of each particular class of animals; and remarks that in the
vertebrata the size of the corpuscle is perhaps in a ratio inverse to
that of the activity and extent of the function of respiration.
    The author states that he has been led to these views, which ap
pear to him to apply to animals generally, by an examination of the
corpuscles, and by watehing the changes which take place in the
blood in lepidopterous insects; and he points out their accordance
with those of Wagner, llenle, and Wharton Jones, with regard to
the function of the corpuscles; but proposes to give the details on
which his own view respecting the size of the corpuscle is founded
on a future occasion.
    He then enters more particularly on the consideration of the forms
of corpuscle in the blood in the Articulate, which he marks as four;
although, he observes, they are in reality              so many stages of
development of one ultimate structure. These      onlyorms arc,—tirst, the
molecules, which he regards as comparable to the molecules observed
in the chyle of Vertebrata by Mr. Gulliver; secondly, the mlclealed
or oat-shaped corpuscle, which he believes with Wagner are analo
gous to the white, or chyle corpuscles of Vertebrate; thirdly, the
spllerules, or minute rounded bodies developed from the oat-shaped
corpuscle, and which he believes are analogous to the free nucleoli
of Valentin, and probably to the very minute white, opake granules
constantly observed in the blood of vertebrate; and lastly, the discs,
which are further developments of the sphcrules, and analogous to
the true red blood-discs of the higher animals, and which, as he
states in a subsequent part of his paper, in his examination of the
 blood of the human fa'-|tus, he believes that he has also traced from
 the white, opake granules or spherules.
    The author then proceeds to describe these forms of the corpuscle
 in insects more minutely, and cnters into considerable detail with
 reference to the out-shaped corpuscle, tracing it from its earliest
 distinct form, before any nucleus is perceptible in it; and shows that
 the nucleoli which constitute this body are gradually increased in
 number, until the corpuscle has attained its full size, when it <U+FB01>rst
 changes its form and becomes shorter, then rounded, and afterwards
 entirely breaks up and liberates the nucleoli that have been deve
 loped within it.     This change of form he shows always takes place
 very rapidly   in all the oat-shaped corpuscles, large and small, when
 out of the body, and to this circumstance he attributes the diversity
 in the descriptions that have been given by various observers of the
 form of the corpuscle.       He shows also, that, with reference to the
 function  of  this  body,  the corpuscles are usually found in greatest
 number during the act of breaking up, immediately before the larva

                                   546
is preparing to change its skin, at which time the blood is extremely
coagulable; and that there are fewest corpuscles, or that there is the
greatest number of small corpuscles of this kind, soon after the cater
pillar has again begun to feed. \Vhen the insect has assumed the
pupa state, nearly the whole of these corpuscles are broken up. The
greatest abundance of them is found in the act of changing on the
third or fourth day of the pupa, after which the number of these
 corpuscles is gradually lessened, until, when the insect has entered
the perfect rstate, very fewremain.     When the change to the perfect
insect occurs, there is another opportunity of watehing the function
 of this corpuscle.     When the wings are being expanded and still
 soft, a few oat-shaped corpuscles circulate through them; but as the
 wings become consolidated, these corpuscles appear to be arrested,
 and break down in the circulatory passages, supplying directly the
 material for the consolidation of these structures; as appears from
 the entire arrest of circulation in these parts, and from the granular
 remains of the corpuscles which may be seen by transmitted light in
 a wing completely denuded of its scales on the upper and under sur-'7
 faces. The spherules and discs of the perfect lepidopterous insect
 are then noticed; and some peculiar clavate or <U+FB01>ddle-shaped bodies,
 which appear to be the transition forms between spherules and discs,
 are pointed out as occurring in the blood of one of the night moths,
 Xylophasia polyodon, and also in the butter<U+FB02>y soon after it has left
 the pupa state.     These facts are regarded as proofs, derived from
 direct observation, of the function of the corpuscle, and of its ana
 logy, both in function and development, to the secreting cells of
 glands.
     In the second division of his paper, the author draws some com
 parisons between the blood-corpuscles of insects and the vertebrata,
 and gives the details of a series of observations on the blood of a
 human fcetus that was born alive at the end of the sixth month.
  He examined the blood of the parent, and of the placenta, and also
 of different parts of the body of the foetus a few hours after death,
 and found in general that the blood of the parent contained a very
 large quantity of white chyle corpuscles, and was extremely coagu
 lable: the blood of the placenta contained, beside an abundance of
  chyle corpuscles, red blood-discs of extremely variable sizes, the
  largest being one-third or one-fourth larger than those of the
  mother, and the smallest scarcely more than one-fourth as large as
  the largest.   There were also an immense abundance of molecules
  and nucleoli, from which latter the red blood-discs appeared to be
  developed.    The blood of the vein and lungs presented a similar ir
  regular condition as to size of the corpuscles, while that of the left
  auricle of the heart, aorta and arteries of the cord was more uniform
  in its character.    From these observations the author concludes,
  that the blood of the vertebrata is analogous in its mode of develop
   ment to that of the insects and other invertebrata, and that the red
   blood-discs are the ultimate developments of the opake white gra
   nules or nucleoli of the blood.

   “ Additional Remarks respecting the Condensation of Gases." By
Michael Faraday, Esq., F.R.S. &c.
   The author, suspecting the presence of nitrogen in the nitrous
oxide on which he had operated, repeated his experiments with this
gas, very carefully prepared from pure nitrate of ammonia, but the
results still indicated the presence of more volatile gas mixed with
                                                a
another less volatile.    He found that ole<U+FB01>ant gas         readily soluble

more volatile  a  body is, the more rapidly does the force of its vapour
increase by an augmentation of temperature, the increase of elasti
city being directly as the volatility of the substance. By further and
more accurate investigation,        ageneral law may be established for
 deducing, from only    a single observation of the force of any given

   “An Account of     Compact Aluminum." By Professor F. Wiihler
of Giittingen, in  a Letter to Thomas Graham, Esq. Communicated
by Thomas Graham, Esq., F.R.S.
   The author has lately found, contrary to the results of his former
researches on aluminum made eighteen years ago, that this metal is
readily fusible, and that in its reduction from the chloride of alu
 minum by means of potassium, it presents itself in the form of fused
globules, generally so small that their shape is not distinguishable
under the microscope, although occasionally they are met with
having a sensible diameter.     He effects the reduction at once in a
clay  crucible, the bottom   of which  he covers with pellets of pure
potassium, and places upon these the chloride of ammonium, covering
the whole with chloride of potassium in powder. The crucible being“
then closed up, and heated in a coal <U+FB01>re, the reduction is instantly
effected.
   Fused aluminum has the colour and lustre of polished tin; it con
tinues perfectly white in the air; it is fully malleable, and the glo
bules may be beaten out into the thinnest plates without cracking
at the edges. It is entirely unmagnetic.        In other respects the
metal in this compact state has the properties which the author for
merly ascribed to it.

   “ Essays on Hygrometry and Barometry."       By Captain Shortrede,
F.R.A.S., First Assistant in the General Trigonometrical Survey of
India. Communicated by Lieut.-Col. W. H.'Sykes, F.R.S.
   This paper commences with an account of the various investiga
tions of the author on subjects relating to the elasticity of aqueous
vapour at different temperatures and under different circumstances.
He <U+FB01>rst discusses the tables given by different esperimentalists of
the force of vapour at various temperatures, and endeavours to de
duce an analytical formula giving the nearest approximation to the
results recorded. He then proceeds to the consideration of what he
terms “the moist bulb problem," or the point of maximum depres
sion attained by a thermometer with a moistened bulb exposed to
evaporation in air: he deduces formulae which he compares with the
results of actual observation, and points out the probable sources of
error in the cases in which he <U+FB01>nds disagreements between them.
In the miscellaneous remarks which form the next section of the
paper, the author states his reasons for dissenting altogether from
the views taken by Dalton of the constitution of mixed gases, or of

                                 54-9
mixtures of aqueous vapour with any of the gases, according to
which, each gaseous body is uniformly diffused throughout the
whole space, its particles repelling those of its own kind, but exert
ing no pressure on the particles of any other kind.      lle considers
the fact that a given portion of air has its volume expanded by the
addition of aqueous vapour, as being of itself a su<U+FB02>icient refutation
of that theory. The author then takes occasion to discuss the ques
tion, whether aqueous vapour exists in the atmosphere in the state
of mechanical mixture or of chemical solution, and argues in favour
of the latter view of the subject.
   In the concluding section, the author enters at large into the in
vestigation of the method of ascertaining licights by barometric ob
servations, and gives various tables to be used for that purpose.

John Frederick William Herschel, Bart., F.R.S. &c.
    The author inquires whether the peculiar coloured dispersion of
white light intromitted into a solution of sulphate of quinine, is the
result of an analysis of the incident light into two distinct species,
or merely of a simple subdivision analogous to that which takes
place in partial refiexion, as exempli<U+FB01>ed in the colours of thin plates.
He endeavours to ascertain the laws which regulate this singular
mode of dispersion, which for brevity he terms epipolic, on account
of the proximity of the seat of dispersion to the intromitting surface
of the <U+FB02>uid. It might have been expected that by passing the same
incident beam successively through many such dispersive surfaces,
the whole of the blue rays would at length be separated from     it,and
an orange, or red residual beam be left: but theauthor establishes,
by numerous experiments, the general fact, that an cpipolical beam
of light, meaning thereby a beam which has been once transmitted
through a quiniferous solution, and undergone its dispersing action,
is  incapable of farther undergoing epipolic dispersion.
     There were only two liquids, out of all those examined by the
 author, namely oil of turpentine and pyroxylic spirit, which, when
 interposed in the incident beam, act like the solutions of quinine in
 preventing the formation of the blue <U+FB01>lm: and the only solid in
 which the author discovered a similar power of epipolic dispersion,
is  the green <U+FB02>uor of Alston Moor, and which by this action exhibits
 at its surface
              a  <U+FB01>ne deep blue colour.

burgh.
   The author adduces some new experiments in con<U+FB01>rmation of his
theory of the nature and causes of the motion of glaciers, and which
present an analogy with the phenomena exhibited by the <U+FB02>ow of
masses of semi<U+FB01>uid or viscous matter contained in a narrow channel,
along which they move by the force of gravity ; and also with the
ripple marks on the surface of a stream of water when its course is
impeded by obstacles.     These latter phenomena, he remarks, were
noticed and accurately described by Leonardo da Vinci.       Analogies
of a still more striking nature are presented by the appearance of
streams of lava in their <U+FB02>ow from volcanos and in the progress of
their descent, which illustrate a great number of the phenomena of
glacier motion, and corroborate the views of the author as to their
nature and as to the laws they obey.      Various quotations are given
from authors who have been struck with this analogy, and who have
pointed it out more or less circumstantially in the narratives of their
travels in the neighbourhood of Etna and Vesuvius; to which the
author,adds some of his own observations on the lava from these
mountains, which throw further light on the subject.

    “ Memoir on the Rotation of Crops, and on the Quantity of In
organic Matters abstracted from the Soil by various plants under
different circumstances."     By Charles G. B. Daubeny, M.D., F.R.S.,
 Professor of Rural Economy, &c. in the University of Oxford.
   The author was <U+FB01>rst led to undertake the researches of which an
account is given in the present memoir, by the expectation of verify
ing the theory of De Candolle, in which the deterioration experienced
by most crops on their repetition was attributed to the deleterious
in<U+FB02>uence of their root-excretions.         For this purpose he set apart,
ten years ago,   a number   of  plots of  ground in the Botanic Garden
at  Oxford,  uniform   as to quality    and  richness, one-half of which
was planted each year, up to the present time, with the same species
of crop, and the other half with the same kinds, succeeding each
other in such a manner that no one plot should receive the same
crop twice during the time of the continuance of the experiments,
or at least not within a short period of one another. The difference
in the produce obtained in the two crops, under these circumstances,
would, the author conceived, represent the degree of in<U+FB02>uence
ascribable to the root-excretions.
   The results obtained during the <U+FB01>rst few years from these experi
ments, as well as from the researches which had, in the mean time,
been communicated to the world by M. Braconnot and others on
the same subject, led him in a great measure to abandon this theory,
and to seek for some other mode of explaining the falling-off of crops
on repetition.    In order to clear up the matter, he determined to
ascertain, for a series of years, not only the amount of crop which
would be obtained from each of the plants tried under these two
systems, but also the quantity of inorganic matters extracted in each
case from the soil, and the chemical constitution of the latter, which
had furnished these ingredients.       The chemical examination of the
crops, however, on account of the labour it involved, was con<U+FB01>ned
to six out of the number of the plants cultivated; and of these, three

                                         552
 samples were analysed; the <U+FB01>rst being the permanent one, viz. that
  cultivated for nine or ten successive years in the same plot of
 ground; the second, the shifting one, obtained from a plot which
  had borne different crops in the preceding years; and the third, the
  standard, derived from a sample of average quality, grown under
 natural circumstances, either in the Botanic Garden itself, or in the
 neighbourhood of Oxford.            These analyses were performed by Mr.
  Way formerly       assistant to  Professor  Graham, of University College,
  London, and now attached to the Agricultural College near Circu
  cester.
     The examination of the soils was carried on in two ways; the
 <U+FB01>rst, with the view of estimating the entire amount of their avail
 able ingredients; and the second, with that of ascertaining the quan
 tity in a state to be taken up at once by plants, the available ingre
 dients being those which are soluble in muriatic acid; the active
 ones, those which are taken up by water impregnated with carbonic
 acid gas.      This portion of the investigation was conducted in part
  by  the  author,   and in part by Mr. Way, and has reference to three
 subjects   ;  <U+FB01>rst, to the amount of produce obtained from the de<U+FB01>cient
 crops; secondly, to their chemical constitution; and thirdly, to the
 nature of the soil in which the crops were severally grown.
     The plants experimented upon were spurge, potatoes, barley, tur
 nips, hemp, <U+FB02>ax, beans, tobacco, poppies, buckwheat, clover, oats,
 beet, mint, endive, and parsley.           The only crop which seemed to
 show the in<U+FB02>uence of root-excretions was Eup/wrbia Lathyris, which
would not grow in the same ground three years successively, al
though the soil was found afterwards <U+FB01>tted for rearing several other
species of plants.        In the nemaining cases, there was in general a
marked      difference   between   the permanent and the shifting crop, to
the disadvantage of the former; and where exceptions occurred to
this rule, they seemed capable of being accounted for by accidental
causes. The amount of each year's crop is given in a tabular form,
and their differences illustrated by diagrams showing the relation
 between the two crops of each vegetable.
     The second part of the memoir commences with an account of the
 method of analysis pursued by the author for determining the nature
 and proportions of the ingredients present in the ashes of the crops
 submitted to examination.           This method was, in general, similar to
that    recommended       by  Will  and  Fresenius in their paper published
 in the 'Philosophical Magazine,’ No. 169; but in determining the
amount of phosphoric acid, the following mode was adopted in pre
ference to the one therein given.
    As the phosphoric acid would seize upon the iron in preference
to any other base, the amount of peroxide of iron present in the ash
was <U+FB01>rst determined‘ by precipitating it from a muriatic solution by
means of acetate of ammonia.            The weight of the precipitate gives
that of phosphate of        iron, from which that of the peroxide of iron
may be readily calculated.           This being ascertained, he proceeds to
determine the phosphoric acid by operating on a fresh portion of
the solution of the ash, into which a certain known weight of iron

                                      558
  dissolved in muriatic acid is introduced, in quantity more than suf<U+FB01>
  cient to unite with the whole of the phosphoric acid present. This
 done, acetate of ammonia is added and the mixture boiled, when all
  the peroxide of iron, whether combined with phosphoric acid or not,
 is thrown down.       From the weight of tho precipitate, that of the
 phosphoric acid present may be calculated, as both the amount of
 peroxide of iron present in the ash, and that which was added sub
 sequently, are known.
     A report is then given of the analysis of the ashes of barley, of
 the tubers of potatoes, of the bulbs of turnips, of hemp, of <U+FB02>ax, and
 of beans, all cultivated in the Botanic Garden; and from the data
 thus obtained, the quantity of inorganic matters abstracted from the
 soil in ten years by the above crops is deduced; and a table is given
 showing the relation between the permanent and shifting crops, with
 respect to their produce, the amount of inorganic matters, that of
 alkali, and that of phosphates, contained in them.
     In the third part of his paper, the author considers the chemical
 composition of the soil in which the above-mentioned crops were
 grown. He states, in the <U+FB01>rst place, the method he adopted for de
 termining the amount of phosphoric acid present in the soil.
     An analysis is then given of the soil taken from a portion of the
 garden contiguous to that in which the experiments were carried on,
 and from one of the plots of the garden itself; and from these data
 a calculation is made, that the ground at prment contains enough
 phosphoric acid for nineteen crops of barley of the same amount us
 the average of those of the permanent crops, and of the same quality
 as that obtained in 184-4-. It was also found, that there was a supply
of potass su<U+FB02>icient for <U+FB01>fteen crops of barley; of soda, for forty-<U+FB01>ve;
and of magnesia, for thirty-four. When, however, we examine how
 much of these ingredients is taken up by water containing carbonic
 acid, the proportion of each is found to be much smaller; and a
striking difference exists, in this respect, between the soil which had
 been recently manured and that which had been drawn upon by a
succession of crops.       In the <U+FB01>rst case, the quantity of alkaline sul
phate    obtained in the pound was 3'4 grs.; in the latter it varied from
0'7   to 0'07;  and  of phosphate, the quantity in the former was about
0'3, whilst in the latter it varied from 0'18 to 0'05.
    From these facts th'e author concludes, <U+FB01>rst, that the falling-off of
a crop after repetition depends, in some degree, on the less ready
supply of certain of the inorganic ingredients which it requires for
its constitution; but that two crops equally well supplied by the soil
with these ingredients may take up different quantities of them, ac
cording as their own development is more or less favoured by the
presence of organic matter in the soil in a state of decomposition.
    Secondly, that it is very possible that a <U+FB01>eld may beun product
ive, although possessing abundance of all the ingredients required
by the crop, owing to their not being in a su<U+FB02>iciently soluble form,
and therefore not directly available for the purposes of vegetation:
so that, in such a case, the agriculturist has his choice of three
methods; the <U+FB01>rst, that of imparting to the soil, by the aid of manure,

                                    554
a  su<U+FB02>icicnt quantity of these ingredients in a state to be immedi
ately taken up; the second, that of waiting until the action of de
composing agents disengages a fresh portion of those ingredients
from the soil (as by letting the land remain fallow); and the third,
that of accelerating this decomposition by                  and chemical
                                                mechanical
means.
    T hirdly, that it is probable that in most districts a suf<U+FB01>cient
supply of phosphoric acid and of alkali for the purpose of agricul
ture lies locked up within the bowels of the earth, which might be
set at liberty and rendered available by the application of the arti
<U+FB01>cial means above alluded to.
     Fourthly, that the aim of nature seems to be to bring into this
soluble, and therefore available condition, these inorganic substances
by animal and vegetable decomposition, and therefore that we are
 counteracting her bene<U+FB01>cial efforts when we waste the products of
 this decomposition by a want of due care in the preservation of the
various excrementitious matters at our disposal.
     Fifthly, that although we cannot deny that plants possess the
 power of substituting certain mineral ingredients for others, yet that
 the limits of this faculty are still imperfectly known, and the degree
 in which their healthy condition is affected by the change is stillia
 matter for further investigation.
     Lastly, that the composition of various plants, as given in this
 paper, differs so widely from that reported by Sprengel and others,
 that we are supplied with an additional argument in favour of the
 importance of having the subject of ash-analysis taken up by a
 public body, such as the Royal Agricultural Society of England,
 possessed of competent means and facilities for deciding between
 the con<U+FB02>icting authorities, and supplying us with a more secure
 basis for future calculations.                              .

      “ On the Ashes of \Vheat." By William Sharp, Esq., F.R.S.
      The experiments recorded in this paper were undertaken princi
  pally with the ultimate view of ascertaining with exactness what
  quantity of inorganic matter is removed from the soil by the seeds
  of a crop of wheat. The author <U+FB01>rst inquires what is the average
  amount of the inorganic or incombustible portion. of a given quan
  tity of wheat; a question to which no satisfactory answer has yet
  been given.     The result of the author's experiments is, that wheat
  yields,  by slow combustion, a residue of from 1% to 1% per cent. He
  then proceeds to determine by experiment the degree in which this
  result is in<U+FB02>uenced by previous drying at different temperatures,
  varying from 230° to 260° Fahr., and <U+FB01>nds that a heat of 245° is
  not su<U+FB02>icient to expel all the moisture contained in wheat; for while

                                     555
  the loss of weight is then about 8 per cent. by n heat of 260°, the
  amount of this loss is l0 per cent. When the heat is so great as to
  occasion decomposition, the saline matter contained in the wheat
  fuses, and a portion of the carbon becomes so entangled or <U+FB01>rmly
 adherent to it, as to be incapable of separation by burning.     llcncc
 he recommends, in order to obtain greater uniformity in the results,
 that the' wheat subjected to these experiments should be dried at a
 low temperature, such as that of a room in summer, and be allowed
 to remain a few days under its in<U+FB02>uence.          The author tried thc
 e<U+FB02>'ect of the addition of nitric acid, with a view to save time by ac
 celerating the combustion; but found that the results could not lm
 relied upon when this plan was adopted, and he was therefore obliged
 to relinquish it. He next directed his inquiries to the ascertaining
 whether the quantity of inorganic matter was in proportion to the
 speci<U+FB01>c gravity of the grain, that is, to its weight per bushel; and
 this he found in general to bethe case. The conclusion he deduces
 from this investigation is, that the mean amount of inorganic matter
removed from the soil by the grain of a crop of wheat is exactly one
pound per acre.
     “On   Benzoline, a new organic Salt-base obtained from Oil of
 Bitter Almonds."      By George Fownes, Esq., F.R.S.
     Pure oil of bitter almonds is converted, by the action of a strong
solution of ammonia, into a solid white substance having a crystalline
form, and which was termed by M. Laurent hydrobenzamide.            The
 author found that this substance, by the further action of alkalics,
became harder and less <U+FB02>rsible than before, and not differing in che
mical composition from the original substance, but exhibiting the
properties of an organic salt-base. To this substance the author
gives the name of benzoline.      He <U+FB01>nds that the salts which it forms
by combination with acids are, in general, remarkable for their spa
ring solubility; and that many of them, as the hydrochlorate, the
nitrate and the sulphate, are crystallizable.      Of the properties of
these salts the author gives a detailed account.

    The author describes several arrangements by which he was en
abled to make new experiments in con<U+FB01>rmation of the laws of mus
cular currents, of which he has given an account in his recent work,
entitled “Traité des Phéuoménes Electro-Physiologiques des Ani
maux." He <U+FB01>nds that, in these experiments, the employment of a gal
vanometer is unnecessary, as the sensibility of the electroscopic frog

                                                   556                               ,
    of Galvani gives suf<U+FB01>cient indications of the electric current without
    the use of that instrument.
       The general results obtained from thme experiments are the fol
    lowin    .
      In         lfrhe
                 <U+FB01>rst place, the intensity and duration of the muscular cur
    rent
         is is
              independent of the nature of the gas in which the muscular
    pile     immersed.       Secondly,       italtogether independent of the ce
                                                   is
    rebro-spinal portion        of  the  nervous   system.     Thirdly, the circum
    stances which exercise           marked in<U+FB02>uence on its intensity are the

    conditions of the respiratory and circulatory systems. Fourthly, those
    poisons which seem to act directly on the nervous system, such as hy
    drocyanic acid, morphia and strychnine, have no in<U+FB02>uence on the ner

    in diminishing the intensity of the muscular current. Sixthly, the in
    tensity of this current in frogs varies according to the temperature in
    which the frogs have been kept for certain time during life;
                                                        a                       result
                                                                                 a
    which, of course,          not obtainable with animals which do not take
                              is
    the temperature of the surrounding medium.                  Lastly, the intensity
    of the muscular current in animals increases in proportion to the
    rank they occupy in the scale of beings; and on the other hand, its
    duration after death           exactly in an inverse ratio to its original in
                                   is
    tensity.      The   author    concludes   by stating his belief, that the pro
    perty   of  the  muscles    immediately connected with their electric cur
    rents,       identical with that which was long ago denominated by
                 is
    Haller irritability, but which           at present more usually designated
                                              is
    by the term contractility.            He  ascribes the development of this
    muscular electricity       to  the  chemical  actions which are attendant on
r   the process      of nutrition   of  the  muscles,  and result from the contact
    of arterial    blood  with   the  muscular   <U+FB01>bre.     He conceives that in the
    natural    state  of the   muscle,   the two   electricities thus evolved neu
    tralise each other at the same points at which they are generated;
    while in the muscular pile contrived by the author,                portion of this

miles, by ranges of hills, rising on each side to a considerable eleva
tion. Within this space, the ordinary winds follow the course of the
river; and in almost every instance when they approach from wind
ward, the barometer rises with them; and when, on the other hand,
the wind approaches from leeward, the barometer not only falls be
fore the arrival of the wind, but continues to fall until it has sub
sided.
    An appendix is subjoined containing extracts from the tabular re
gister of the barometer and winds at various points in the valley of
the River St. Lawrence, during the years 1834- and i885, accompa
nied by remarks on different points deserving notice in particular
cases.
    “ On the Elliptic Polarization of Light by re<U+FB02>exion from Metallic
 Surfaces."    By the Rev. Baden Powell, M.A., F.R.S., Savilian Pro
 fessor of Geometry in the University of Oxford.
    In a former paper, published in the Philosophical Transactions
 for 1848, the author gave an account of the observations he had
 made on the phaenomena of elliptic polarization by re<U+FB02>exion from
 certain metallic surfaces, but with reference only to one class of
 comparative results.    He has since pursued the inquiry into other
 relations besides those at <U+FB01>rst contemplated, and the present paper
 is devoted to the details of these new observations, obtained by va
 rying the inclination of the incident rays, and the position of the
 plane of analysation, and by employing different metals as the rc
 <U+FB02>eeting surfaces.    By the application of the undulatory theory of
 light to the circumstances of the experiments and the resulting phas
 nomena, the law of metallic retardation is made the subject of ana
 lytic investigation. A polariscope of peculiar construction, of which
 a description is given at the conclusion of the paper, was employed
 in the experiments: and tables are subjoined of the numerical re
 sults of the observations.
     “On the Gas Voltaic Battery.       Voltaic Action of Phosphorus,
  Sulphur,   and Hydrocarbons." By William Robert Grove, Esq.,
  M.A.,  F.R.S., V.P.R.l., Professor of Experimental Philosophy at
  the London Institution.
     The author, referring to a paper of his published in the Philoso
  phical Transactions for 184-3, states, that in repeating and verifying
  some of the experiments therein contained, he was led to those which

                                     558
 form the subject of the present memoir. With the form of gas bat
 tery last described in that paper, by which the interfering action of
 the external air is excluded, he <U+FB01>nds that deutoxide of nitrogen as
 sociated with oxygen gives a continuous voltaic current; and that
 the volumes respectively absorbed by the electrolyte are as four to
 one, indicating the formation of hyponitrous acid.
    Passing to the more immediate object of the present paper, he states
 that having observed nitrogen procured by the combustion of phos
 phorus to give rise, in the gas battery, to a temporary voltaic cur
 rent, he was led to believe that phosphorus, although an insoluble
 non-conductor, might, by means of the gas battery, be made the
 excitant of a continuous voltaic current, analogous to the zinc ele
 ment of an ordinary voltaic combination.       This expectation was ve
 ri<U+FB01>ed by experiments, a series of which is given; phosphorus being
 suspended in various gases and voltaically associated with oxygen.
 The experiments were continued during several months, and the
 results indicated the same consumption of phosphorus with reference
 to the oxygen, as would occur by the formation of phosphorous acid;
 the phosphorus being thus burned by oxygen at a distance. Phos
 phorns and iodine, both non-conducting solids, being each suspended
 in nitrogen in the associated tubes of a gas battery, give a continu
 ous voltaic current, and are consumed in equivalent ratios. Sulphur,r
 suspended in nitrogen and associated with oxygen, gives a voltaic
 current when fused.      Other volatile electro-positive bodies, such as
 camphor,   essential oils, aether and alcohol, when placed in nitrogen
 and associated with oxygen, gave a continuous voltaic current.
    The author observes that the gas battery, which in his former ex
 periments introduced gases, by the present experiments renders solid
 and liquid insoluble non-conductors the exciting constituents of vol
 taic combinations, and enables us to ascertain their electro-chemical
 relations: it also introduces the galvanometer as a test of vaporiza
 tion.
    A new form of gas battery is described, in which an inde<U+FB01>nite
 number of cells are charged by the hydrogen evolved from a single
 piece of zinc ; the oxygen of the atmosphere supplying the electro
 negative element.     The charge of the battery is self-sustained, in a
 manner somewhat similar to the Doebereiner light apparatus.

lopment in the Animal Series."        By Thomas Wharton Jones, Esq.,
F.R.S., Lecturer on Anatomy, Physiology and Pathology, at the
Charing Cross Hospital.
    This paper is divided into three parts: the <U+FB01>rst relating to the
blood-corpuscles of the Vertebrata; the second to those of the In
vertebrata; and the last to a comparison between the two.         He <U+FB01>rst
describes the microscopic appearances of these corpuscles in differ
ent classes of vertebrate animals, beginning with the skate and the
frog, and proceeding to birds and mammifera; <U+FB01>rst in their early
embryonic state, and next in the subsequent periods of their growth.
He <U+FB01>nds in oviparous vertebrata generally, four principal forms of

                                  559
corpuscles. These he distinguishes as the phases, <U+FB01>rst of the gra
nule blood-cell, which he describes as a cell <U+FB01>lled with granules, dis
closing by the solvent action of dilute acetic acid on these granules
                                                         "
a vesicular, or as the author terms     it,
                                          a
                                            “rellrr<U+FB01>n-vn   nucleus. These
granule cells appear under two stages of development, namely, the
coarsely granulous stage and the <U+FB01>nely granulous stage.            The sc
cond phase    is that of the nucleolated blood-cell, oval in shape, con
taining  a  vesicular (or “ celleform")   nucleus, and red-coloured mat
ter. These cells likewise appear under two stages of development;
colourless in the <U+FB01>rst and coloured in the second, in which last stage
it constitutes the red corpuscle.    In the early mammifcrous embryo,
he <U+FB01>nds, in addition to the former, a third phase, that of free vesicu
lar nucleus, exhibiting, like the nucleolated cell, the colourless and
the coloured stages.
     On examining the corpusclcs of the lymph of vertebrate animals,
the author <U+FB01>nds them in all the classes to be identical in structure
with their blood-corpuscles, and differing only in the inferior degree
of coloration attending their last stage. In the oviparous classes, he
observes that the nucleolated are more numerous than the granule
cells, while in the mammifera the latter are predominant, which        is
the reverse of the proportion in which they exist in the blood of
these animals.    He <U+FB01>nds that some of the nucleolated cells of the
contents of the thoracic duct exhibit a marked degree of coloration,
and have an oval shape; thus offering         resemblance to the blood
                                              s
of the early embryonic state.
    The blood-corpuscles of all the invertebrate animals in which the
author examined them, present the same phases of granule and
nucleolated cells as in the higher classes, except that in the last
stage of the latter phase the c0loration'is very slight, but the vesi
cular nucleus      isfrequently distinctly coloured.    As in the higher
classes, corpuscles exist in different states of transition from the gra
nular to the nucleolated form of cell. In some of the invertebrate,
corpuscles are found which appear to be the nuclei of some of the
nucleolated cells become free; and these the author considers to be
abortions, rather than examples, of cells having attained their third
phase of free cells. Corpuscles are also met with in these animals,
 in greater or less abundance, belonging to the lowest forms of or
 ganic elements, namely, elementary granules.
    The comparison which the author institutes between the blood
 corpuscles of the vertebrate and invertebrate divisions of the animal
 kingdom, tends to show that they in all cases pass through similar
 phases of development, except with respect to the last, or coloured
 stage of the nucleolated cell, which they do not attain in the lower
 classes of animals.    He <U+FB01>nds that the blood-corpuscles of the crab,
 according to an analysis made by Professor Graham, contain a sen
 sible quantity of iron, perhaps as much as red corpuscles.      He con
 siders the corpuscles of the blood of the invertebrata, in as far as re
                                                  '
 lates to the absence of nucleated cells, as resembling those of the
 lymph of vertebrate animals.

  reference to the forms and structure of Clouds, Films and Mem
   branes.” By William Addison, Esq., F.L.S. Communicated by P.
   M. Roget, M.D., Sec. R.S.
      In the course of his researches into the nature and origin of tu
  bercles in the lungs, and into the physical properties of the secre
  tions of the human structure, the author had occasion to notice va
  rious <U+FB01>brous and membranous forms arising solely from physical
  agencies. On pursuing the inquiry, he observed a class of pheno
  mena indicating some peculiar modi<U+FB01>cations of the force of cohesion.
  Thus he found that transparent liquid streams are visible when va
  pours or <U+FB02>uids mingle with one another, and also when solids are
  dissolving in a <U+FB02>uid; and that opake deposits, assuming the appear
  ance of clouds, form on those streams, rendering visible the lines
  of junction of two <U+FB02>uid or gaseous surfaces. A great number of
  experiments are described illustrating these general facts, which are
  afterwards applied to explain various phenomena of clouds, <U+FB01>lms
  and membranous formations, resulting from the operation of the
  different cohesive forces which are called into action, under a diver
  sity of circumstances, when liquid or gaseous bodies are brought
  into mutual contact.                       -
     “On the formation or secretion of Alkaline and Earthy Bodies
 by Animals."      By Robert Rigg, Esq., F.R.S.
     From the results of a comparison made by the author of the
 weight of the ashes obtained from a quantity of bread, equal to that
 which was the sole food of two mice during thirty-eight days, with
 the weight of the ashes of their excretions during the same period,
 it appeared that the latter exceeded the former in the proportion of
  1884a to 934.    The amount of soluble salts was also found to be
 greater in the latter than in the former.       From these data, the
 author infers that both alkaline and earthy bodies are formed out
 of their elements by the animal system, and found in their excre
 tions.

down to the year I84-1. and a comparison drawn with those of the

of future inquiry, in what he terms “ the nascent science of Meteo

  “ Contributions to the Chemistry of the Urine;            on the variations
in the Alkaline and Earthy Phosphates in the healthy state, and on
the Allmlescence of the Urine from <U+FB01>xed Alkali." By Henry Hence
Jones, M.A. Cantab., Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians.
   The author, having observed that in some states of disease there
occurs in the urine a great excess of the earthy phosphates, was in
duced to investigate the subject; and as s preliminary inquiry. to
ascertain the variations in the amount of these phosphates at differ
ent times in the some person in s state of health, and to trace the
causes which determine an excess or s de<U+FB01>ciency of these salts in the
urine; noting, st the same time, the variations in the quantity of
the alkaline phosphates contained in        it,
                                             with    view of discovering
                                                       s
 whether  these variations  are in<U+FB02>uenced   by  the same, or by different
causes.    The principal   results to which  his  experiments have con
ducted him are the following. The quantity of the earthy phos
phates in the urine voided soon after taking food             considerably
                                                             is
greater than in that voided at other times; and this happens whether
the meal consists of animal food or of bread only.         After long fast
ing, the proportion of earthy phosphates         considerably diminished.
                                                  is
On the other hand, the alkaline phosphates are present in greatest
quantity when the food consist-1 of bread alone: when meat alone            is
taken, the de<U+FB01>ciency in those salts         still more marked than the
                                           is
excess in the former case.       Exercise occasions no change in the
quantity of the earthy phosphates, but causes an increase of nearly
one-third in the amount of alkaline phosphates but its in<U+FB02>uence
                                                        ;                  is,
on the whole, less than that of diet.      The earthy phosphates are in
creased in quantity by chloride of calcium, sulphate of magnesia,
and calcined magnesia taken into the stomach.
    The author next examines the conditions in which the urine             is
alkalescent, and which he considers to be of two kinds; the one, long
known as ammoniacal, and arising from the presence of carbonate of
 ammonia; and the other, which has not hitherto been distinctly re
cognised, arising from <U+FB01>xed alkali, and appearing most frequently
in urine secreted during period of from two to four hours after
                            a
 breakfast, in persons suffering only from defective digestion. Under
 these circumstances,  it   may be, when voided, either turbid from
 amorphous sediment, or clear and alkaline when tested, or free from
 deposit and slightly acid.   if in either of these last cases be heated,
                                                                  it

                        a
 urine may at any time be made to yield a precipitate of earthy phos
 phates by heat, even though    it  be acid, by having      portion of this

acid neutralised by any alkali, or by phosphate of soda, the <U+FB02>uid
becoming more acid when boiled.           A solution of earthy phosphates
in biphosphate of soda also gives a precipitate on boiling, if some of
its acid reaction is removed by any alkali.         The <U+FB02>uid when boiled
becomes more acid to test-paper, indicating the formation of a more
basic earthy phosphate.        A result precisely similar is.obtained when
common phosphate of soda, phosphate of lime, and a little biphos
phate of soda exist together in solution ; and by varying the quan
tities of each of these substances, the various phenomena which the
urine occasionally presents may be imitated.         The time at which the
alkalescence of the urine from <U+FB01>xed alkali generally occurs, indi
cates the existence of some alkaline phosphate, or of some carbonated
alkali in the food.
    “ On the Nerves of the Uterus."
                                              By Thomas S. Beck, Esq.
Communicated by Sir Benjamin C. Brodie, Bart., F.R.S.
    The object of the author in this communication is to record the
results of his dissections of the nerves of the uterus, both in the unim
pregnated and gravid states, with a view to determine if any changes
are observable in them in these two conditions.         He enters minutely
into  the anatomical   details  of the  formation  of the great splanchnic
nerve, the composition of the semilunar ganglion, and the distribu
tion of the branches proceeding from it to the different abdominal
viscera.    His conclusions are, that while the ovaria derive their
nerves from the renal, the fallopian tubes from the hypogastric, and
the bladder, rectum and vagina from the pelvic plexus, the nerves
supplying the uterus are continuations of the hypogastric plexus,
and that they undergo, during pregnancy, no further change, either
in size or position, except that which is the simple consequence of
the enlargement of the organ over which they are distributed, and
that they undergo no other change‘ during a second pregnancy. He
thinks it probable, moreover, that the vessels of the uterus do not
decrease in size after parturition, but are only contracted in their
cavity.    He notices several points relating to these subjects, which
are still open to further investigation.       The paper is accompanied
by highly <U+FB01>nished drawings of the appearance of the dissected parts.
    “ On a Peculiar Source of Deterioration of the Magnetic Powers

    The author concludes, from various experiments on the changes
in the magnetic force of steel magnets produced by subjecting them
to blows with a wooden mallet, or other modes of creating tremors
or vibrations among their particles, that the most apparently tri<U+FB02>ing
mechanical agitation is suf<U+FB01>cient to occasion a considerable diminu
tion of magnetic power; that this loss, when it has taken place from
such a cause, is permanent; and that in every case, after reaching a
certain point, it attains its maximum, a fact which implies, in every
magnet, the possession of a speci<U+FB01>c retentive force, of which it can
not be deprived by any further mechanical commotion of its parti

    “ Observations on the Growth and Development of the Epider
mis." By Erasmus Wilson, Esq., F.R.S., Lecturer on Anatomy and
Physiology in the Middlesex Hospital.
    The author adduces evidence derived from his microscopic obser
vations, in con<U+FB01>rmation of the commonly received doctrine respect
ing the origin of the cells of the epidermis and epithelium generally,
from the materials furnished by the liquor sanguinis or plasma of
the blood; which <U+FB02>uid, passing by endosmosis through the walls of
the capillary vessels and peripheral boundary of the surface, deve
lopes granules by a vital process, analogous to coagulation.          On a
careful examination of the inner surface of the epidermis with the
aid of the microscope, he <U+FB01>nds it to be composed of four kinds of
elements, arranged in such a manner as to constitute an irregular
plane, similar to a tesselated or mosaic pavement.        These elements
are,—1. Granules, which the author terms primitive, of a globular
 form, solid and apparently homogeneous, and measuring about
 1-20,000th part of an inch in diameter. 2. Aggregated granules,
 having about double the diameter of the former and apparently com
 posed of as many of these as can be aggregated together without
leaving an unoccupied space in the centre of the mass. 8. Nia.-Ieated
granules measuring in diameter from the 6000th to the 4-000th part
 of an inch, each being composed of an aggregated granule as a
 nucleus, enveloped by a single layer of aggregated granules, giving
 to the whole mass an oval or circular, and at the same time <U+FB02>at
 tened shape. 'I'heir constituent granules have acquired, during this
 aggregation, greater density, and are separated from each other by
 distinct interstitial spaces <U+FB01>lled with a transparent homogeneous sub
  stance. 4‘. Nuclcolo-nucleolated cells pervading the deep stratum of
  the epidermis, and of which the longer diameter measures from the
  3000th to the 2500th part of an inch. These cells, which constitute
  the principal portion, and may be regarded as the chief constituent
  of the epidermis, are formed from the nucleolated granules, on the ex
 terior of which there is superposed a transparent layer, bounded by a
  well-de<U+FB01>ned outline, by the dark interstitial substance of the wall of the
  cell; the nucleolated granule being the nucleus, and the aggregated
 granule the nucleolus of these primitive cells of the epidermis. The
  author is of opinion that the nuclei, up to a certain point, grow with
 the cells, by the separation of the original granules from the deposi

                                        564
  tion between them of interstitial matter, and also by the cleavage of
  the latter and the consequent multiplication of the granules.            This
  peripheral growth     of  the cells is totally diffe1-ent  from  the mode  of
  growth    described  by  Schwann,   and explains   the  disappearance  of the
  nucleus in the scales of the epidermis.           The observations of the
  author lead him to believe that the same process of development and
  of growth is followed in the epithelium as in the epidermis; and he
  offers evidence, showing that similar arrangements take place in the
  cells of melanosis, in the pigment cells of the choroid membrane of
  the eye, and in those of the skin of the negro.
     “ On the Temperature       of Man."      By John Davy, M.D., F.R.S.
  L.  &  E.
     Having in     a former paper shown that, contrary         to a commonly
  received opinion, the temperature of the human body, as mea
  sured by a thermometer placed under the tongue, is not a constant
  one, the author has resumed the inquiry, and gives, in the present
  paper, the results of numerous observations made with a particular
  instrument constructed for the purpose, admitting of minute accu
  racy (each degree of the scale being divided into ten parts), and
  when used with the precautions pointed out, affording satisfactory
  indications in .many problems which may be proposed relative to the
  temperature of man, &c., and con<U+FB01>nes himself to a small number,
  offering the information he brings forward only as a preliminary
  contribution in aid of their solution.
     The paper is divided into seven sections.
     The <U+FB01>rst treats of variations of temperature during the twenty-four
 hours. The author <U+FB01>nds from his observations, that the temperature

     The second, of variations during the different seasons.         These, he
 <U+FB01>nds, bear some relation to the temperature of the air, but less than
 might be expected; which he attributes to the majority of the ob
 servations having been made within doors, under circumstances pe
 culiarly favourable to uniformity.

 The effect of this, when not carried to the length of exhausting fa

 a certain limit, proportional to the degree of muscular exertion.
     The fourth, of passive, such as carriage exercise. The effect of
this in a cool air, contrary to that of quick walking or riding, would
appear to be lowering.
    The <U+FB01>fth, of abstinence from all exercise in a cold atmosphere.
This he <U+FB01>nds to be depressing in a still greater degree; sitting in a
cold church has occasioned a reduction of temperature from 1° to
2°, the air of the church being from 42° to 32°.
    The sixth, of sustained attention or exertion of mind. This would
appear to have the effect of raising the temperature, but in a much
less degree than bodily exercise.

                                   565
   The seventh, of taking food. It would appear that a light meal,
such as breakfast, alters very little the temperature, whilst a heavy
meal, such as dinner with wine, tends to lower it.
   The conclusion drawn by the author from his observations, con
sidered in their greatest generality,    is,  that the temperature of man
is             <U+FB02>uctuating    within    a   certain  limit; regularly during
theconstantly
     twenty-  our hours;   and    irregularly according to the operation
of certain disturbing circumstances.
   Should multiplied observations give similar results, he infers that
they will admit of many applications, both as regards the regulation
of clothing, the warming of apartments, and possibly the preven
tion and cure of diseases,—conducive alike to increase of comforts
and health.
   Tables are appended, containing       a   series of observations extend

body  is noticed, but also  the  frequency     of  the pulse and of respira
tion, and the temperature    of  the  air.

   Different properties have been assigned by different authors (as
Sir Humphry Davy, Gay-Lussac, Boullay and Rammelsberg) to                 a
combination of tin with iodine.  With a view to explain these dis
cordances, the author instituted the series of experiments detailed
in this paper, and which have led him to the conclusion that the
substance obtained by heating tin with twice its weight of iodine         is
a mixture of two salts, differing from each other in their composition.

                                  566
 One of these is soluble in water to a slight extent without su<U+FB02>ering
 decomposition, while the other is immediately decomposed on coming
 into contact with water; the former being the real proto-iodide de
 scribed by Boullay, and the latter being a biniodide, a salt of which
 no particular description had hitherto been given, but which was
probably the compound noticed by Sir Humphry Davy as being of
 a brilliant orange colour.   The author found that this biniodide sub
 limes at a temperature of 356° F., while the proto-iodide, if protected
from the contact of air, may be heated to redness without subliming.
The author did not succeed in obtaining a combination of tin and
iodine corresponding to the sesquioxide, although Boullay supposes
that such was the composition of some yellow crystals which were
formed by the mixture of solutions of proto-chloride of tin and of
iodide of potassium.    A more detailed account of the properties of
the iodides of tin is reserved for a future communication.

     “ Experimental Researches in Electricity." By Michael Faraday,
Esq., D.C.L., F.R.S., &c. Nineteenth Series. Section 25: On tho
                  of Light, and the Illumination of Magnetic Lines of
glagnetization
   orce.
     For a long time past the author had felt  a strong   persuasion, de
rived from philosophical considerations, that among the several
powers of nature which in their various forms of operation on mat
ter produce different classes of effects, there exists an intimate rela
tion; that they are connected by a common origin, have a reciprocal
dependence on one another, and are capable, under certain condi
 tions, of being converted the one into the other. Already have elec
 tricity and magnetism afforded evidence of this mutual convertibility ;
 and in extending his views to a wider sphere, the author became con
vinced that these powers must have relations with light also. Until
lately his endeavours to detect these relations were unsuccessful;
 but at length, on instituting a more searching interrogation of na
 ture, he arrived at the discovery recorded in the present paper,
 namely, that a ray of light may be electri<U+FB01>ed and magnetized; and
that lines of magnetic force may be rendered luminous.
     The fundamental experiment revealing this new and important
 fact, which establishes a link of connexion between two great de
 partments of nature, is the following.    A ray of light issuing from
 an Argand lamp is <U+FB01>rst polarized in the horizontal plane by re<U+FB01>exion
‘from a glass mirror, and then made to pass, for a certain space,
 through glass composed of silicated borate of lead, on its emergence
 from which it is viewed through a Nichol's eye-piece, capable of rc
 volving on a horizontal axis, so as to intercept the ray, or allow it
 to be transmitted, alternately, in the different phases of its revolu
 tion. The glass through which the ray passes, and which the author
 terms the diamagnetic, is placed between the two poles of a powerful
 electro-magnet, arranged in such a position as that the line of mag
 netic forces resulting from their combined action shall coincide with,

                                    568
  or differ but little from the course of the ray in its passage through
  the glass. It was then found that if the eye-piece had been so turned
  as to render the ray invisible t0 the observer looking through the
  eye-piece before the electric current had been established, it be
  comes visible whenever, by the completion of the circuit, the mag
  netic force is in operation; but instantly becomes again invisible on
  the cessation of that force by the interruption of the circuit.      Fur
  ther investigation showed that the magnetic action causes       the plane
  of polarization of the polarized ray to rotate, for the ray is again
  rendered visible by turning the eye-piece to a certain extent; and
  that the direction of the rotation impressed upon the ray, when the
  magnetic in<U+FB02>uence is issuing from the south pole, and proceeding
  in the same direction as the polarized ray, is right-handed, or si
  milar to that of the motion of the hands of a wateh, as estimated by
  an observer at the eye-piece.     The direction in which the rotation
  takes place will, of course, be reversed by reversing either the
  course of the ray or the poles of the magnet.      Hence it follows that
 the polarized ray is made to rotate in the same direction as the cur
  rents of positive electricity are circulating, both in the helices com
 posing the electro-magnet, and also in the same direction as the
 hypothetical currents, which, according to Ampere’s theory, circu
 late in the substance of a steel magnet. The rotatory action was
 found to be always directly proportional to the intensity of the
 magnetic force, but not to that of the electric current; and also to
 be proportional to the length of that portion of the ray which re
 ceives the in<U+FB02>uence.      The interposition of substances which occa
 sion no disturbance of the magnetic forces, produces no change in
 these effects.    Magnetsrconsisting    only of electric helices act with
 less power than when armed with iron, and in which magnetic ac
 tion is consequently more strongly developed.
     The author pursues the inquiry by varying in a great number of
 ways the circumstances in which this newly-discovered in<U+FB02>uence is
 exerted; and <U+FB01>nds that the modi<U+FB01>cations thus introduced in the re
 sults are all explicable by reference to the general law above stated.
 Thus the effect is produced, though in a less degree, when the po
 larized ray is subjected to the action of an ordinary magnet, instead
 of one that derives its power from a voltaic current; and it is also
 weaker when a single pole only is employed.           It is, on the other
 hand, increased by the addition of a hollow cylinder of iron, placed
 within the helix, the polarized ray traversing its axis being then
 acted upon with great energy.        Helices act with equal power in
 any part of the cylindric space which they enclose. The heavy glass
 used in these experiments was found to posses in itself, no speci<U+FB01>c
 magneto-inductive action.
    Di<U+FB02>erent media differ extremely in the degree in which they are
 capable of exerting the rotatory power over a polarized ray of light.
 It is a power which has no apparent relation to the other physical
properties, whether chemical or mechanical, of these bodies.           Yet,
however it may differ in its degree, it is always the same in kind;
the rotation it effects is invariably in one direction, dependent, how

                                    569
ever, on the directions of the ray and of the msgnetic force.         In
this respect it differs essentially from the rotatory power naturally
possessed by many bodies, such as quartz, sugar, oil of turpentine,
&c., which exhibit the phenomena of circular polarization; for in
some of these the rotation takes place to the right, and in others to
the left. When, therefore, such substances are employed ss dinmsg
netics, the natural and the superinduced powers tend to produce
either the same or opposite rotations; and the resulting e<U+FB02>ects are
modi<U+FB01>ed according as they are cumulative in the former case, sud
differential in the latter.
    In the concluding section of the paper, the author enters into ge
neral considerations on the nature of the newly-discovered in<U+FB02>uence
of electricity and magnetism over light, and remarks that all thcse
powers posses in common a duality of character which constitutes
them a peculiar class, and affords an opening which before was
wanting for the appliance of these powers to the investigation of
this and other radiant agencies. The phenomena thus brought to
light con<U+FB01>rm the views entertained by the author relative to the con
stitution of matter as being spheres of power, for the operation of
which the conception of a solid nucleus is not                and leads
to the presumption that the in<U+FB02>uence of magnetism necessary;
                                                       on odies which
exhibit no magnetic properties consists in producing in them a state
of electric tension tending to a current; while on iron, nickel, and
other bodies susceptible of magnetism, currents are actually esta
blished by the same in<U+FB02>uence.
    The author states that he is still engaged in the prosecution of
these inquiries.
    “ On the Action of the Rays of the Spectrum on Vegetable
Juices :" being an Extract from a Letter by Mrs. M. Somervillc to
Sir John F. W. Herschel, Bart., dated Rome, September 20, 1845.
Communicated by Sir John F. W. Herschel, Bsrt., F.R.S.
    In the experiments of which the results are here recorded, the solar
spectrum was condensed by a lens of <U+FB02>int glass of seven inches and
a half focus, maintained in the same part of the screen by keeping a
pin-hole or pencil-mark constantly at the corner of the red rays,
which were sharply de<U+FB01>ned by being viewed through blue spec
tacles; and the apparatus was covered with black cloth in order to
exclude extraneous light. Thick white letter-paper, moistened with
the liquid to be examined, was exposed wet to the spectrum, as it
 was found that the action of the coloured light was thus rendered
 more immediate and more intense, than when the surface of the
paper was dry.
    The action of the spectrum at the junction of the lavender with
 the violet rays was found in some cases to be different from what it
 is with either of these colours separately, indicating a break in the
 continuity of action, and suggesting the idea of a secondary spec
trum.     In many instances the yellow and green rays exert a power
 ful in<U+FB02>uence on vegetable substances, an in<U+FB02>uence apparently un
 connected with heat; for the darkening is generally least under

                                     570
the red rays and immediately below them, where the calori<U+FB01>c rays
are most abundant.       The action, in a great number of cases, pro
duces insulated spots in different parts of the spectrum, but more
especially in the region of the rays of mean refrangibility, in which
neither the calori<U+FB01>c nor the chemical powers are the greatest.         The
point of maximum intensity is sometimes altered by the addition
of acids, alkalies, or diluted alcohol. But altogether, as the author
states, the action of the different parts of the spectrum seems to be
very capricious, the changes of colour produced being exceedingly
irregular and unaccountable.

     The President then addressed the Meeting           as follows :
       GsurLEsiax,
 I  nanny regret that I have to commence my address to you by
 lamenting, in common with the whole Society, that after many years
 of the most valuable services, Sir John Lubbock has resigned the
 situation of your Treasurer. As he is now not generally resident
 in London, he feels the inconvenience of the necessary attendance
 on your business so great, that we cannot further urge his retention
 of that important o<U+FB02>ice. I am quite sure that I shall be no unfaith
 ful interpreter of your feelings when I thus publicly express your
 thanks and regrets, as well as my own, and those of your Council.
     The practice which has been recently introduced of stating as far
 as possible at the conclusion of one meeting, the subjects of papers
 to be read on the following Thursday, will,I have no doubt, be
 found most useful, and can, I think, be accompanied by no draw
 backs.    I  am aware that the introduction of discussion on papers
 after they have been read can hardly be expected to meet with uni
 versal concurrence.      It may certainly be attended with some incon
  venience.    It therefore appears to me to be indispensably necessary
  that the  President,  or the Vice-President in the Chair, should have,
  and exercise the absolute power, both of abstaining from an invitation
  to discuss papers, which from their abstract nature, or from any other
  cause are little calculated for discussion, and also of checking con
  versation when it becomes either intemperate and personal, incon
  veniently long, or in any other manner not desirable to be con
  tinued.    So checked and guarded,         I  believe that it will give our

                                    572
                                                              \
  meetings more spirit and more interet, and will at the same time
 promote the investigation of physical truth, and so most e<U+FB02>iciently
  ful<U+FB01>l the objects for which the Society itself was instituted.
     It appears to me, and your present Council have concurred in the
 opinion, that the period of our Anniversary, in the gloomy month of
 November, and at a time when London is comparatively deserted, is
  extremely inconvenient.    It is very inconvenient for your Council
 itself, which is obliged more than once to assemble for the purpose
 of preliminary arrangements before the commencement of our au
 tumnal evening meetings.      It is also very inconvenient to the body
 at large, and in truth has a tendency to restrict the assembly of our
 members on the important day of the election of the new Council
 to those who are resident in London.         At the time when St. An
 drew's day was selected, the London season commenced much
 earlier than it now does, and it was probably the best <U+FB01>tted for
 securing a large attendance.                          I
                                  I shall certainly, if again occupy the
 honourable situation of your President, bring the question before
 your new Council, but it is not yet clear how this inconvenience
 can be obviated.
     The magnetic observations that have now for several years been
 carried on simultaneously at different establishments by our own
 and other governments, were not undertaken by Her Majesty’s
 Government for a longer period than the termination of the present
 year.    It was therefore deemed advisable to invite the conductors
 of those observations in foreign countries, to communicate their
 opinions in writing, and after doing so, to come over to England at
 the time of the meeting of the British Association.         It was pro
posed then to hold a congress for the consideration of the propriety
of continuing the magnetic observations. Such a congress met at
 Cambridge last summer, probably the largest combination of men
 of the highest attainments in science from every part of Europe
 that ever met together in a scienti<U+FB01>c parliament, whose object was
 the solution of some of the most interesting problems in natural
 philosoph . There were to be seen together the Astronomers
 Royal of England and Ireland, Dr. Lloyd, and Colonel Sabine, who
 had taken the most active part in arranging and combining the
joint magnetic operations, Sir John Herschel, the President of the
 British Association, his immediate predecessors the Dean of Ely, and
 Lord Rosse, and many other gentlemen whom the Royal Socicty is
 proud to name among her Fellows, together with the representatives
 of the highest science of the continent.      That, as your President, I
 should have had the opportunity of taking even the humblest part in
 such a meeting will ever be esteemed by me one of the highest honours
 to which your too favourable consideration has raised me. After
 anxious deliberation, the Congress recommended to the British Go
 vernment and to the East India Company the continuation of the
 observations on a modi<U+FB01>ed, and in some respects a reduced scale.
  To the Council of the Royal Society, some of whose members had
  already taken an active part in the deliberations of the Congress,    I
  reported the resolutions adopted at Cambridge, and the Council

                                    678
unanimously agreed to recommend them also to Sir Robert Peel.
I therefore signi<U+FB01>ed our wishes to the Prime Minister and to the Di
rectors of the East India Company; I rejoice to say that they have
both given their consent to the adoption of the united recommen
dation of the Royal Society and the British Association, and it only
remains for me to express to them the gratitude of the world of
science.    Ihave strong reasons to believe that the other govern
ments who have carried on joint observations with us, will also con
tinue them with some modi<U+FB01>cation, and thus that we shall continue
to see the world united by important scienti<U+FB01>c inquiries carried on
in common,—a pledge of peace and friendship, and a proof of the
growing conviction that it is the real interest of every civilised go
vernment to promote physical science.
   I am happy to be able to announce the safe return to the Cape of
Good Hope of the vessel which, at the request of the Royal Society,
was sent by Her Majesty's Government under the direction of Lieut.
T. E. L. Moore of the Royal Navy, and Lieut. Henry Clerk of the
Royal Artillery, to complete the magnetic survey of the high lati
tudes of the southern hemisphere, of which three-fourths had pre
viously been accomplished by the expedition under Sir James Clark
Ross. The Pagoda left the Cape of Good Hope in January last,
making a course to the southward in the meridian of Greenwich,
until her further progress in that direction was stopped by the ice
in the vicinity ofthe Antarctic Circle. Thence she proceeded to the
eastward, keeping as near the edge of the ice as circumstances would
permit, until the close of the season of navigation in those latitudes,
when she had passed the meridian of 120° E. and had connected
her survey with that of Sir James Rosa's expedition.      Lieutenants
Moore and Clerk are on their way to England with their magnetic
observations, of which the results will eventually be presented to
the Royal Society.      I am happy to add, that this service has been
performed without accident or loss of life.
   Since our last Anniversary, Sir John Franklin and Captain Crosier
have left the shores of England for the purposes of discovery in the
other cold regions of the globe.        As the Government previously
consulted the Council of the Royal Society on the importance of
such an expedition to the cause of geographical science, we must
naturally feel a deep interest in its success. It would be pre
sumptuous to speculate on the solution of the problem of a North
west Passage.     Barriers of ice may prove insurmountable, but we
may con<U+FB01>dently trust that every thing will be done that energy and
experienced skill can effect, by an expedition which goes out with
mechanical advantages that attended none of the former attempts of
a Parry and a Ross.
   The year that has now elapsed has had thrown over it a dark
gloom by a most melancholy and awful event.       I need not say that I
allude to the deeply lamented death of our late Foreign Secretary,
Mr. Daniell. That a soldier should fall in the battle-<U+FB01>eld, or that a
sailor should meet with a glorious death on the deck of a man-of
war, or lose his life in the storms that have wrecked so many gallant

                                  . 574
vessels, seems a natural as well     as honourable termination to the
career of each. Professor Daniell’s valuable life came to a close as
sudden, while he was engaged in performing his duty as a man of
science—his duty as one of our ofiicers—in his attendance on one
of our Councils—an awful proof of the uncertainty of human life,
even while no danger seems to impend.         We propose, in the room
of Mr. Daniell, Colonel Sabine as your Foreign Secretary; a gen
tleman not only ardently zealous for science in general, but also one
of those who have taken the most active share in those magnetical
inquiries to which I have already adverted, and which are so in
teresting to the Royal Society from our part in them since their
commencement.        These magnetical inquiries have occasioned much
necessary intercourse between Colonel Sabine and the scienti<U+FB01>c
men of the continent, and therefore form an additional recommen
dation of that gentleman as our Foreign Secretary.
     In recommending an engineer so eminent as Mr. Rennie to the
 o<U+FB02>ice of Treasurer, I need hardly advert to the scienti<U+FB01>c acquire
ments indispensable in his profession.       Nor is it necessary for me
to remark, that it is an of<U+FB01>ce that should be held by one that is a
 man of business as well as a philosopher, an union of qualities not
found in all, though so happily united in a Baily and a Lubbock;
 but it is right in mentioning that profession for me to express my
regret that gentlemen should have been publicly advertised as Fel
lows of this Society who do not possess that honour; at the same
time it is but fair to say, that in all probability the misstatement
 arose from mistake alone in the Secretaries of the advertising com
panies, and   I  entertain no doubt that greater care will be taken for
 the future to avoid similar errors.
     Your Assistant Secretary, in his capacity of Librarian, has com
 piled a Catalogue of the Maps, Charts and Surveys, in the possession
 of the Society, which have been accumulating for many years.
 These amount to several thousands, and they are now arranged in
 such a manner as to be immediately accessible to the Fellows.        Ca
 talogues have also been made of the miscellaneous drawings and en
 gravings of scienti<U+FB01>c subjects, and likewise of the valuable and in
teresting collection of portraits of the distinguished deceased Fel
lows of the Society.
     The Library has been enriched during the past Session by a very
                                                                '
 perfect copy, on vellum, of the magni<U+FB01>cent work, entitled Déscrip
 tion de l'Egypte,’ consisting of nine volumes of letter-press, and four
teen.imperial folio volumes containing 930 engravings, illustrative
 of the antiquities and natural history of Egypt. It has also received
 the valuable present of a considerable number of Chinese books
 from Mr. \Valker of Preston; at present the Chinese language is so
 little known that these are likely to be useful to very few of our Fel
lows.     The increased facilities, however, now existing for communi
 cation with the great kingdom of China, will probably lead to much
 greater study of its di<U+FB02>icult language, so that these works may be
 come a very valuable and interesting portion of our Library.

        Mr. AarnoNouzn ROYAL,
     It  is now my duty to announce to you that n Royal Medal has
been adjudged to you by the Council for your important inquiry
into the Tides on the Coast of lrchind. lt is agreat grati<U+FB01>cation to
me to give a medal, conferred by his sovereign, to one to whom is
committed the charge of the great scienti<U+FB01>c cstablishment of lin
gland, for investigations carried on with consummate scienti<U+FB01>c abi
lity, connected with the mighty clement on which his country has
reaped so much glory, and to which she owes so much of hcr wealth
and of her safety.          If the day of necessity should cvcr arrive, I
doubt not that her sons will emulate the achievements of their pre
decessors.       Now, in the happier times of peace, it is gratifying to
see British skill and British science gathering bloodless, but unpcrish
ing laurels on the same <U+FB01>eld, and by so doing ministering with no
unsel<U+FB01>sh hand to the safety of all who pursue the uvocations of
commerce.
         Mr. BECK,
      A Royal Medal has been adjudged to you by the Council of the
 Royal Society, complying thereby with the recommendation of the
 Committee of Physiology, for your researches into one of the most
 important subjects of anatomical inquiry’. ln presenting it to you,
     0 The
             report of the Committee of Physiology on the claims of Mr. Beck's
 paper to the award of the Medal, is as follows :
      " The paper of Mr. Beck contains the result of an elaborate anatomical
 investigation of the Nerves of the Uterus, together with observations on
 the structure and connexions of the sympathetic nerve.
     " By his researches the author has cleared up various points concerning
 the nerves of the uterus which have hitherto been doubtful or misunder
 stood.      He has determined more precisely than heretofore the source and
 mode of distribution of these nerves, and the real extent to which the organ
 is supplied with them. The true nature of the nervous ganglia at the neck
 of the uterus, and of the plexuses formed by the sympathetic and sacral
 nerves in the same situation, is also satisfactorily made out, as wcll as the
  fact that the branches derived from the sacral nerves are not destined for
 the utenis, but are distributed to adjacent organs.
     "With regard to the sympathetic nerve, it is shown that there are both
  grey and white separate branches of communication between that nerve and
  the spinal nerves.     This important fact has, it is true, been already pointed
  out in the recently published work of Tedd and Bowman, but the author
  of the paper has nevertheless the merit of arriving at it independently, by
  his own observations.      He has further shown that the white and grey con
  stituents of the nerve keep distinct from each other, not only in the so
  called trunk of the sympathetic, but also in its primary branches, as far as
  the visceral ganglia, beyond which the white and grey parts become inter
   mixed in the nerves distributed to the viscera.      The precise mode of con
  nexion of the white and grey communicating           branches with the spinal
  nerves is also carefully investigated.   These observations appear important
   as tending to throw light on the constitution of the sympathetic nerve and
  its relation to the rest of the nervous system.
      "The Committee consider the paper of Mr. Beck as a most valuable
  contribution to the Anatomy of the nervous system, and as a<U+FB02>brding addi

                                   576
I  may be allowed to express my hope that you will continue your
researches, and that others of 'your profession may be encouraged
to do so likewise, so that in the result our information may become
more perfect and full than we yet possess on points of very di<U+FB02>icult
solution.     .
   I trust that the consequence of discoveries thus made will be a
diminution of those dangers, and an alleviation of those pains which
are the price paid for the entry into the world of every human
being.
  ‘The purpose for which the Royal Society was established was
indeed the improvement of natural knowledge for its own sake; but
we can never forget that the privilege of acquiring that knowledge
entails the duty of employing it to the utmost of our power, not only
to the glory of Him who has given us our reasoning powers, but
also to the service, as far as may be, of those who are His creatures.
        Mr. OWEN,
    Ihave the pleasure of requesting you to transmit the Copley Me
dal to your friend Mr. Schwann, for his valuable work on the Ana
logies of Vegetables and Animals. This subject is one of the deepest
interest to the natural philosopher, for what can be more important
than to trace those analogies by which the two great kingdoms of
nature are united, and which show that the same wisdom has di
rected every portion of the creation ? It is also a large and not easily
exhausted <U+FB01>eld of               and being so,  I trust that he who has
                     inquipy, it may reap from it still larger harvests
already so ably cultivate
of scienti<U+FB01>c discovery.
    Inow proceed to the biographical notices of some of our deceased
members.
   DR. WILLIAM Hamznnnu, the son of the eminent and accom
                        ' Commentaries on
plished author of the                       the History and Cure of
Diseases,’ was born in London in the year 1767. At the early age
of seven, he was sent to school at the Charter House, and ap ears to
have there made rapid progress in the elementary branches        olp
                                                               educa
tion.  His academical studies were pursued in St. John's College,
Cambridge, where he highly distinguished himself both by his ma
thematical and his classical acquirements. Under his f'ather's tuition
he applied himself with great diligence to his profession as     pupil
                                                                  a
of St. George's Hospital, to which, at subsequent period, he was
                                          a
appointed one of the Physicians.      He was elected a Fellow of this
Society in the year 1791    : and in 1797, became      Fellow of the
                                                       a
College of Physicians.     His practice soon became tolerably exten
sive.  On the death of Sir George Baker in 1809, he succeeded him
tional and more precise data for physiological reasoning respecting the
nerves to which it  refers. On these grounds, as well as.on account of the
consummate skill and devoted perseverance displayed by the author in his
arduous investigations, they have recommended that his paper be rewarded
with the Royal Medal."

                                   577
in the appointment of physician to the King, whose favour he soon
conciliated, and by whom he was more than once offered a baronetey
and a pension, distinctions which his high-minded aversion to de
pendence and ostentation always induced him to decline.              The
ambition of great professional success appears to have been super
seded by his fondness for literary pursuits, diverting him by degrees
 from the laborious exertions and exclusive devotion which are ever
requisite for rising to the higher eminences in medicine ; for we <U+FB01>nd
him, in 1812, when suddenly left n widower with a family of nine
young children, gradually relinquishing practice, and retiring from
active life to the village of Datehet, in liuckinghamshire, where for
the ensuing fourteen years, he devoted himself to the superintend
 ence of his children's education, to the cultivation of letters, and the
 enjoyment of a select society.      It was during this period that he
 amused himself with translating Cicero's Letters to Atticus, which
 he subsequently published.       He was also the author of a short
 Treatise on General Education; a subject which, from the peculiar
 circumstances in which he was placed, had anxiously oocupied his
mind. This was followed by a translation of that part of the Mo
ralia of Plutarch that relates to brotherly love, which he dedicated
to his children.
     In the year 1826, he again came to reside in London, principally
 with the view of contributing by his instructions to advance his son
 in those professional studies which he was pursuing in the same
 hospital, from which he had himself derived a large portion of his
 practical knowledge.     But in this, his fondest hope, he was doomed
 to suffer the most cruel disappointment; for the brilliant career of
 which that favourite son was giving auspicious promise, was sud
 denly closed in death, occasioned by the reception of poisonous
 matter during a post-mortem examination.          Other domestic cala
 mities followed in quick succession: the loss of another son, and of
 his eldest daughter, overshadowed his declining years with the deepest
 gloom, which found relief only in religious contemplation, and the
 composition of various Works illustrative of the Scriptures.         He
 died on the 19th of February, 1845, aged 77.
      His contributions to the Philosophical Transactions consist of two
 papers; the <U+FB01>rst in 1796. on the in<U+FB02>uence of cold on the health of
 the inhabitants of London; in which he shows, in opposition to the
 popular prejudices then prevalent, that a severe winter is attended
  with greatly increased mortality.       The second paper is entitled
  “ On the heat of July 1825, together with some remarks on sensible
  cold," in which he points out the causes which in<U+FB02>uence our sensa
  tions of temperature, and more especially the powerful effeet of wind
  in increasing the rate of cooling, and consequently of creating the
  sensation of cold in the human body, independently of any actual
  depression in the temperature of the air.
     JQHN Fnnnxruc DANIELL was born in Essex Street, Strand,
  12th of March, 1790. His father, George Daniell, Esq., Bencher
  of the Inner Temple, provided him with a good classical education

                                   578
under his own roof.      At an early age he showed fondness for tne
pursuits of science, and was placed in the sugar re<U+FB01>ning establish
ment of a relative, where he introduced important improvements in
the manufacture.      The pursuits of business, however, were uncon
genial to his tastes, and he soon relinquished this occupation.       In
1813 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, of which body
he continued till the day of his death a zealous and active member.
    The services he rendered to more than one branch of science
were of no ordinary description.      From an early period of his life
his mind was directed to the study of meteorology, at a time when it
consisted of little more than a vast accumulation of facts and ob
servations.
    In the year 1823 he published the <U+FB01>rst edition of his ' Meteoro
logical Essays,’ which constituted a new epoch in the science, and
still continues the standard work of reference, the third edition of
which he had nearly completed at the time of his death. This was
the <U+FB01>rst attempt to embrace in a general view the scattered facts of
the science, and by synthetically applying the known laws which re
gulate the constitution of gases and vapours, the principles of their
equilibrium, and the distribution of heat among them, to give a con
 nected account of the main phenomena of the earth’s atmosphere.
 He insisted on the paramount importance of extreme accuracy in
 the construction of the instruments employed for such inquiries, and
 gave directions by which the needful accuracy could with certainty
 and facility be obtained.   By the invention of the hygrometer, which
 bears his   name, he <U+FB01>rst conferred precision on the means of ascer
 taining the moisture or dryness of the atmosphere, a point of cardi
 nal importance in all investigations of this nature; his instrument
 still continues that which can be best depended upon for this pur
 pose.    With these accurate instruments, he for three years kept a
 faithful register of the various atmospheric changes; he organized
 the plan adopted by the Horticultural Society in their annual me
 teorological reports, a plan which formed the model to the admirable
 and more extended series of meteorological observations now issued
 weekly from the Greenwich Observatory under the superintendence
 of the Astronomer Royal.
     In the year 18% he communicated to the Horticultural Society
 an essay ' On Arti<U+FB01>cial Climate,’ which appeared in their Transactions
 for that year. In this paper among other subjects he insisted on
 the absolute necessity of attention to the moisture of the atmosphere,
 as well as of that of maintaining in our hot-houses the moisture as
 well as the temperature of a tropical climate, if We would produce
 a vegetation of tropical luxuriance.     The publication of this essay
 caused a complete change in the methods adopted for the culture of
 plants in general, and particularly of those contained in green
 houses and hot-houses, which upon the new plans speedily outgrew
 the houses provided for their reception.     The Society immediately
 awarded him their silver medal to mark their sense of the import
  ance of his views, and now after an experience of more than twenty
 years, Dr. Lindley, Professor of Botany in University College, not

                                   579
a fortnight     before his death, in an article in the Gardener's
Chronicle, tracing the origin of the improvements in this branch of
horticulture, ascribes the rapid advance in the practice of the
art, mainly to the sound and original views promulgated in this
essa
    Fryer the purpose of making more minute and accurate observa
tions upon variations in the atmospheric pressure, Mr. Daniell pro
posed to the Royal Society, in I880, to construct a barometer in
which water should be the <U+FB02>uid used instead of mercury.           He was
in consequence requested to superintend the construction of such an
instrument.      Great practical di<U+FB02>iculties attended the undertaking,
but these he happily surmounted, and the instrument now stands in
the Hall of the Apartments of the Royal Society; he was engaged
in re-adjusting it within a few weeks of his deceasc.    ()n occasion of
the late Antarctic Expedition under the command of Captain Sir
James Ross, and the establishment by Government of the Magnetic
and Meteorological observations, founded a few years since in dif
ferent parts of the British Empire, when the Admiralty applied to the
Royal Society tor instructions as to the nature and extent of the ob
servations to be made, Mr. Daniell was requested by the Committee
of Physics of the Royal Society, to draw up the Meteorological por
tion of these directions.     The paper which he then prepared fur
nished the basis of that part of the Report of the Committee, pub
lished in the year 184-0, under the sanction of the Royal Society.
     But it was not alone to meteorology, and its practical applications,
 that his labours were con<U+FB01>ned ; his researches upon various chemical
subjects were not less numerous or important.          More than forty
original papers, including thirteen on meteorology, were communi
 cated by him to various scienti<U+FB01>c publications; among others he
 published several memoirs on Crystallization, and its attendant plic
 nomena.      Between the years 1830 and 184-4-, the Transactions of
 this Society were enriched by twelve papers on important subjects
 from his pen. He invented a process for making gas from resin for
 the purposes of illumination,      which the streets of New York are
 lighted at the present time. by or this improvement he received no
 other acknowledgment than a vote of a few pounds' worth of books.
 In the year 1830, he described in the Philosophical Transactions, a
 new instrument for measuring high degrees of heat, such as the
 temperature of furnaces, and the melting-points         of metals. By
 means of this, his pyrometer, he ascertained numerous facts of great
 interest both in a scienti<U+FB01>c and in a practical point of view.        For
 the invention of this instrument, which is still the best for the objects
  intended, the Royal Society awarded him the Rumford Medal.
  r
     After his appointment as Professor of Chemistry in King's College,
  his researches were turned principally to the phenomena presented
  by Voltaic Electricity, and they led to the invention of his constant
  battery; for this the Royal Society conferred upon him the highest
  honour in their gift, the Copley Medal for the year 1836. The
  possibility of maintaining powerful and equable currents of electri
  city for any required period, was established by this invention.

                                    580
 The impulse thus given to the progress of electrical research cannot
 he too highly estimated, and to it must be traced the numerous ap
plications of electricity, to the blasting of rocks, the working of
mines, and to submarine operations, and to the arts of electro-plating,
gilding, zincing, &c., which have recently acquired such magnitude.
 His subsequent researches in the       same <U+FB01>eld    are contained in the
 Philosophical Transactions, and were honoured by the Society in
 the year 1842 by one of the Royal Medals.             In 1839 Professor
 Daniell was placed on the Commission appointed by the Admiralty
to inquire into the best method of defending the ships in the Royal
 Navy from lightning, and the same year the Royal Society honoured
 him with the o<U+FB02>ice of Foreign Secretary to their body.           His “In
troduction to Chemical Philosophy," published during the course of
 this year, contributed still further to increase his reputation, and in
 184-2 he received from the University of Oxford the honorary degree
 of D.C.L. In consequence of the rapid corrosion of the copper
sheathing of the vessels employed upon the African stations, thge
 Admiralty requested him to examine the damaged sheets of metal
 and the waters taken up from the localities where the corrosion was
the greatest; he detected the cause of this decay, showing that sul
phuretted hydrogen was abundantly generated in the ocean at these
spots, and succeeded in extracting from the metal plates the sulphur
 which had occasioned their corrosion.      It is a remarkable proof of
the variety and extent of Mr. Daniell’s acquirements, that he received
at different times all the medals in the gift of the Royal Society.
    The circumstances which attended the sudden and lamented ter
 mination of his valuable life, are known to most of the Fellows of
this Society.    On the 13th of March 184-5, after delivering his usual
lecture at King's College, apparently in perfect health, he attended
the Council Meeting of this Society, and shortly after making some
observation upon the business of the meeting, was seized with sym
ptoms indicating an attack of apoplexy.        Several medical men who
were present hastened to his relief, and he was immediately bled;
 not the slightest bene<U+FB01>t, however, attended this measure, and in <U+FB01>ve
minutes he was a corpse. The shock occasioned by this melancholy
event, may be easier imagined than described, and cast a wide
spread gloom over the extensive circle of his friends and acquaint
ance.    As a mark of respect to his memory, the Noble President
postponed the ordinary meeting of the Society, which was to have
 been held that evening.      His remains were interred at Norwood,
 Surrey,  where  during  the last ten years of his life he had resided.
    Mr. Dauiell survived his wife eleven years, and left a family of
two sons and <U+FB01>ve daughters to deplore his loss.         High as were his
scienti<U+FB01>c attainments, he possessed others of     a still loftier and more
enduring character; to the sterling qualities of a vigorous under
standing, and a kind and benevolent heart, he united the humble
and unobtrusive piety of a sincere christian.
    THOMAs PHILLIPs, R.A., F.R.S., F.S.A., was a native of Dud
ley in Warwickshire, where he was born on the 18th of October,

                                         581
 1770.     He evinced s love of art st      n very early age; and alter some
 provincial   instruction,    at   Birmingham,      in an inferior branch of
 painting,  he  directed   his   steps  to London,     where he arrived in the
 year 1790-     He   soon   placed     himself   before the public; for in the
second year after      his  establishment      in  London   his name is found
 among the exhibitors      at  the  Royal Academy of Arts. In the earlier
 part of Mr. Phillipifs career, he appeared as n painter of historical
 and fancy subjects; but he seems soon to have relinquished this
 branch of his art for that in which he afterwards became so deser
vedly eminent; namely, portraiture.               In the autumn of l80-L, the
 members of the Royal Academy elected Mr. Phillips an Associate
 of that Society: four years after, in I808, he received his full di
 ploma as a Royal Academician.             IIc was elected a Fellow of the
 Royal Society in 1820. After the decease of Mr. Fuseli, in 1824-,
 he became Professor of Painting in the Royal Academy.                 Before
delivering the customary course of lectures, Mr. Phillips proceeded
to Italy 10 contemplate the works of the great masters preserved at
 Rome, Florence, Puma, and in other continental collections.               On
 his return to London, the Professor prepared his lectures, which
 were delivered to the students of the Royal Academy; and they
 were subsequently printed by him in 1883. These discourses, of
 which his brother academicians have shown their appreciation by
 making them part of the prizes bestowed on successful students in
 the schools of painting, display the intimate acquaintance possessed
 by their author with the principles and practice of his art.            Four
 of the series are on the History of Painting; others on Invention,
 Design, Composition, Colouring, Chiaroscuro, and the application
 of the principles of painting. They form altogether an admirable
treatise on the art; they abound with sound philosophical views and
just criticism, united with excellent practical advice and instruc
 tion, conveyed in clear and unaffected language.            They are a highly
 valuable contribution to the class of literature to which they belong,
 and are most honourable to the ability and taste of their lamented
 writer.
    For above forty years of his life Mr. Phillips was in full practice
 as a  portrait-painter; and among his sitters were many of the most
 exalted and eminent men of his age. It is unnecessary to attempt
 to notice all the works which proceeded from his constantly cm
 ployed pencil; but a few of his more important pictures may with
 propriety be referred to. Among the most interesting subjects
 whose likenesses are preserved to us by his skill, may <U+FB01>rst be classed
 those Presidents of the Royal Society whose portraits now decorate
 the walls of the room in which our ordinary meetings are held,
 namely, His Royal Highness the Duke of Sussex, Sir Joseph Banks,
 and Mr. Davies Gilbert.           Among those of scienti<U+FB01>c and literary
 characters, it is gratifying to refer to pictures of the present Dean
 of Westminster (Dr. Buckland), Dr. Dalton, Professor Sedgwick,
 Mrs. Somerville, Francis Baily, and Professor Faraday; as well as
 those of Byron, Scott, Southey, Coleridge, Campbell and Hallam.
 These are but a few,—but they are among the best of his works,-

                                      582
out of the large number of portraits in which Mr. Phillips has
shown his just comprehension of character, his taste in arrangement,
truth to nature, and a <U+FB01>ne eye for colour.
    Mr. Phillips’s health had long been declining.          His death oc
curred on Sunday the 20th of April, 184‘5, in his seventy-<U+FB01>fth year.
He was greatly and most deservedly respected and esteemed by a
large circle of friends, whom his high talents, amiable disposition,
and gentlemanlike feelings and manners had drawn around him;
and his lossrwill long be sensibly felt; especially in that profession
of which he was so distinguished a member. He married early in
life; and has left, besides other children, a son who is following the
same profession as himself.
    The arts have sustained a serious loss by the melancholy death
of Mr. Gnonon BAsEVI,           an architect of distinguished    reputation
and of still greater promise.
    Mr. Basevi began his professional education under Sir John
 Soane, and subsequently prosecuted it with great diligence and suc
cess in Greece and Italy; he was passionately attached to his art,
and there was no accomplishment or branch of knowledge bearing
upon it which he failed to cultivate or acquire.          His Fitzwilliam
Museum at Cambridge, and the New Conservative Club House in
 St. James’s Street, not to mention his other works, will be durable
monuments of his genius and taste. He was a man of excellent
sense and judgment,        a scrupulous lover of truth, and singularly
upright    in all  his  dealings:   though his manners to some persons
 might appear   cold   and  unimpassioned,   he was ardent in his affections
and exemplary in all the relations rof domestic life.      He was inspect
ing   the works   in   progress  in the  western tower  of  Ely Cathedral,
and whilst stepping backwards upon abroad beam, from the sides of
which the <U+FB02>ooring for a short distance had been removed, his foot
tripped and he fell through the opening upon the timbers of the vault
beneath, and was killed on the spot. He was buried in Ely Cathedral
with every mark of respect, which was equally due to his private
virtues and to the affecting circumstances attending his death.
    JAQUEs DoiumroUn CAssINI, Compte du Thury, was elected a
 Foreign Member of this Society in 1789, and at the time of his
death had attained the extraordinary age of 97 years: he was the
fourth in direct descent of a family which, during a period of nearly
two centuries, has been singularly illustrious in the history of the
sciences, and more particularly of astronomy.           His great grand
father, Jaques Dominique Cassini, one of the greatest astronomers
of his age, was born in 1625, and was invited by Louis XIV.
from Italy to France, to preside over the magni<U+FB01>cent Observatory
 of Paris, which was built under his directions : his <U+FB01>rst successor in
the direction of this establishment was his son Jean Jaques, an
astronomer not less eminent than himself; the second his grandson,
 more commonly designated as Cassini de Thury, so well known by
 his great Geodetical Survey and Map of France; and the third his

                                      583
 great grandson, the subject of the present nolim-. who was displaced
 from it by the troubles of fhc llcvolution, which involved him, at
 least for a time, in the common proscription of the nri‘l0CrllC)' of
 France. The shock of these sad events sw|ns to have diverted his
mind from scienti<U+FB01>c pursuits, for we <U+FB01>nd his name connected with
 no research in astronomy or geodesy durin         the last half-century.
    The Comte de Cassini completed the celzebrated map of France
which had been begun by his father. He published an account of
voyages which he made in 1768 and 1709, for the trial of the
marine chronometers of Le Roy, and a Inonn0ir “ Sur l'intlucncc do
l'équinoxe du printemps et du solstice d'éu'.' sur les déclinaisons et
les variations de l'aiguille aimantée|" he sU|.)urlnttrI]dod and pub
lished an account of the observations which were made in 1789, by
a commission appointed for that purpose, for the junction of the
Observatories of Paris and Greenwich, with a special reference to
the connection of the (ieodetical Survey of France which had been
made by his father, with the corresponding Survey of England which
was at that time in progress under General Roy: he was the author
likewise of “ Mémoires pour servir à l'Hi~toirc des Sciences et it
celle de l'Observatoire Royal de Paris, suivis de la Vic de Jaques
Dominique Cassini, premier du nom."
    With him have terminated the honours of the house of Cussini,
though he was not the last of his race who distinguished himself in
the career of the sciences; his son, Henri Cassini, an upright and
enlightened judge in the Cour Royale and the Cour de Cassation,
and one of the most learned botanists of his age, fell a victim to the
cholera in 1883; and with him died the last stay of the old age of
his father: he was the <U+FB01>fth of his family who had been elected a
member of the Académie des Sciences. He was a boy at the break
ing out of the Revolution, and was compelled, from a regard to his
personal safety, to live in the strictest retirement at his father's domain
of Thury; a circumstance which turned his attention to the cultiva
tion of Natural History and Botany, and diverted him, as he was
accustomed to lament, from those studies and pursuits which formed,
as it were, the proper and hereditary honours of his family.
    Tnéonoas nE Saussvns was born in Geneva the 14-th of Octo
ber, l767. His father, known throughout the civilized world as the
geological explorer of the Alps, who <U+FB01>rst reared observatories on
heights almost inaccessible, and who inscribed his name on the
eternal snows of the loftiest mountain in Europe, was by profession
a physician.    Being animated with an ardent love for science, which
he cultivated mostrassiduously, it is not a matter of surprise that after
entrusting his son for a short time to a private tutor, he should have
undertaken personally his education, so far as to enable him to enter
the Academy of Geneva, where young De Saussure soon distin
guished himself.      Previously to this period, his father had caused
him to study medicine, mineralogy, and natural history; and had
also inspired him with a taste for experimental chemistry, which he

                                  584
 constantly required for the analyses of minerals.     By degrees the
son became associated with the scienti<U+FB01>c labours of his father, who
 records that when he resolved upon attempting the ascent of Mont
 Blane, in August 1787, his son, then nineteen years of age, expressed
the strongest desire to accompany him; but being apprehensive
that he was not suf<U+FB01>ciently strong, he was unwillingly obliged to
leave him at the Priory at Chamouni, where he made with great
 care meteorological observations, simultaneously with those carried
 on at the summit of Mont Blane.        In the month of June of the
 following year, Théodore de Saussure accompanied his father in
 the laborious and hazardous expedition to the Col du Géant, where
 they remained for seventeen days, during which time young De Saus
 sure rose every morning at four o'clock, to commence the meteorolo
 gical observations, which he continued with unremitting diligence
 until ten o'clock each night; and so thoroughly did he enter into the
scienti<U+FB01>c pursuits of his parent, that he almost importuned the latter
 to extend the period of his sojourn amidst those splendid scenes;
 which was however effectually prevented by the guides, who, alarmed
 at the idea of a longer stay amidst those icy heights, destroyed all
 the remaining provisions, necessarily compelling the De Saussures
to descend to Cormayeur.
    From this period we <U+FB01>nd Théodore De Saussure always accom
 panying his father, who was not slow in availing himself of the great
 advantages derivable from his son’s labours.      In 1789, they made
the very di<U+FB02>icult tour of Monte Rosa, it being the <U+FB01>rst time that
 the gold mines of Macugnaga were visited by men of science.         It
 was during this excursion that young De Saussure restored by experi
 ments that con<U+FB01>dence in the accuracy of the barometer for measu
 ring heights, which the assertion of Bouguer had tended to weaken.
 He made seventy experiments at different heights, and in calculating
 the rresults, was always careful to make the necessary corrections
 for temperature and humidity, which Bouguer appears to have neg
 lected.   The enthusiasm and physical energy of young De Saussure
 were almost too great for his father, who was now aged, and weak
 ened by various illnesses, and consequently we often <U+FB01>nd the latter
compelled to resist his son’s desire to prolong their arduous excur
sions.
    The storms of the Revolution, more powerful than those of the
Alps, at length put an effectual stop to these useful scienti<U+FB01>c excur
sions, which had been continued for so many years.        Théodore de
Saussure, in common with many men of his age, was compelled to
leave his country.    He visited this country with Alexander Marcet,
who many years afterwards became his colleague in the Academy at
Geneva.      After travelling over England and Scotland, he returned
to Geneva, and resolved henceforth to devote his life to scienti<U+FB01>c
pursuits.    The taste which he had acquired for chemistry under his
father's tuition, had been strengthened in England and in France,
where that science was eagerly cultivated; and on his return to
Geneva, he determined to select the vegetable kingdom for the <U+FB01>eld

                                     585
of his researches, and zealously spplied himself to discover by em
periments the in<U+FB02>uence of the atmosphere and of soils upon plants,
and the various chemical changes which they undergo.            With the
exception   of  some   few  accessory  labours, M. de  Saussure  spent 1
long life upon this branch of science; and it may be truly said that
he has done more to advance the knowledge of vegetable physio
logy than any other person. It is worthy of remark that he laboured
seven years silently, before publishing the results of his investiga
tions.   These were comprised in his work entitled “ Recherche:
Chimiques sur la Végétation," which n pcared in 1804-. He sub
sequently published in the Annales de ghysique et de Chimie, the
results of his investigations into the action of the petals of <U+FB02>owers
upon the atmosphere. The great importance which he attached
to'the nutritive power of carbonic acid upon plants, directed his
attention to the proportion of this gas in the atmosphere.      In 1816,
he published, in the <U+FB01>rst volume of the llibliothéque Universelle,
some researches on this subject, which being greatly extended,
formed afterwards 0. paper which was published in 1880 in the
Mémoires de la Société de Physique et d llistoire Naturelle de Ge
néve, under the title of “ De laction des huiles sur le gas oxygéna
5 la température ntmosphérique."         After examining the action of
the green portions of plants, roots and <U+FB02>owers upon the atmosphere,
M. de Saussure carried his investigation to the same parts of fruits.
The result was a long paper published in l82l, in the Memoirs of
the same Society, entitled “ In<U+FB02>uence des fruits verts sur l'air, nvant
leur maturité."    He shows in this paper, that unripe fruit exercises
the same in<U+FB02>uence as leaves upon the air.
   Independently     of his vegcto-physiological    researches, M. de
Saussure published some papers descriptive of minerals in the Jour
nal de Physique.        These are entitled, “ Analyse du Sappare,"
“ Sur une hydrophane imbibée de cire," “ Analyse de la Dolomic,"
and “ Sur le Sappare dur."
    M. de Saussure was of a most reserved habit, the result probably
of his solitary education : it is recorded of him that he seldom de
sired to converse with his friends on the scienti<U+FB01>c subjects occupy
ing his attention ; and so far did he carry this reserve, that even his
most intimate acquaintances were generally ignorant of the nature
of the papers which he proposed reading before the Society of
Natural History.      The same disposition prevented him from acting
as Professor in the Academy of Geneva, though appointed to the
 Chair of Mineralogy and Geology in the year 1802. It was found
impossible to overcome his repugnance to give the usual courses of
lectures, though at the same time he gave evidence of his warm
interest in the Academy by constantly attending its meetings.         In
 1814-, he was elected s member of the Legislative Council of the
Republic of Geneva, but he was too timid to take an active part in
the debates of this body.       In 1790 he became a member of the
Agricultural   Section   of the  Society of Arts, and always continued
one of its most zealous supporters.       He was a Foreign Member of

                                       586
 the French Institute, of the Royal Academies of Naples, Turin and
 Munich ; of the Institute of Fine Arts and Sciences at Amsterdam;
 of the Linnean Societies of Paris and London; the Wernerian Society
 of Edinburgh; and was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal
 Society in 1820. In 184-2, M. de Saussure was unanimously elected
 President of the Scienti<U+FB01>c Congress, which met that year at Lyons,
 thus marking the high esteem in which he was held as a man of
 science.    Having preserved throughout life the best health, M. de
 Saussure died on the 18th of April 1845, at the advanced age of 78,
 leaving behind him the reputation of a long life passed in severe
 and patient study, interrupted only when he came before the world
 with the results of his laborious experiments and researches.
     The thanks of the Meeting were given to the President for his
 Address, with a request that he would allow it to be printed.

The   MARQUIS OF NORTHAMPTON,                    President, in the Chair.
    The following paper was read :—              .
    " Experimental Researches in Electricity."      By Michael Faraday,
Esq., D.C.L., F.R.S. &c.       Twentieth Series. Section 26th. “ On
New Magnetic Actions; and on the Magnetic Condition of all
Matter."
    The following   is the order in which the several divisions of the
subject treated of in this section of the author's researches in elec
tricity succeed one another:—1. Apparatus required. 2. Action
of magnets on heavy glass. 3. Action of magnets on other sub
stances acting magnetically on light. 4. Action of magnets on the
metals generally. 5. Action of magnets on the magnetic metals and
their compounds.       6. Action of magnets on air and gases.     7. Ge
neral considerations.
    In giving an account of the contents of this paper, any attempt to
follow the track of the author in the precise order in which he re
lates the consecutive steps of his progress in this new path of dis'
covery, would fail of accomplishing its object; for, by adhering to
such a course, it would scarcely be possible to comprise within the
requisite limits of an abstract the substance of a memoir extending,
as the present one does, to so great a length, and of which so large
a portion is occupied with minute and circumstantial details of ex
periments; or to succeed in conveying any clear and distinct idea of
the extraordinary law of nature brought to light by the author, and
of the important conclusions which he has deduced.
    One of the simplest forms of experiment in which the operation
of this newly-discovered law of magnetic action is manifested, is the
following :—A bar of glass, composed of silicated borate of lead,
 two inches in length, and half an inch in width and in thickness, is
 suspended at its centre by a long thread, formed of several <U+FB01>bres of
 silk cocoon, so as to turn freely, by the slightest force, in a hori
 zontal plane, and is secured from the agitation of currents of air by
 being enclosed in a glass jar. The two poles of a powerful electro
 magnet are placed one on each side of the glass bar, so that the
 centre of the bar shall be in the line connecting the poles, which is
 the line of magnetic force.     If, previous to the establishment of the
 magnetic   action,  the position  of the bar be such that its axis is in
 clined at half a right angle to that line, then, on completing the
 circuit of the battery so as to bring the magnetic power into opera
 tion, the bar will turn soas to take a position at right angles to the
 same line; and, if disturbed, will return to that position.     A bar of
 bismuth, substituted for the glass bar, exhibits the same pheno
 menon, but in a still more marked manner. lt is well known that a
 bar of iron, placed in the same circumstances, takes a position co
 incident with the direction of the magnetic forces ; and therefore at
 right angles with the position taken by the bar of bismuth subjected
 to the ame in<U+FB02>uence.       These two directions are termed by the au

                                    593
thor axial and equatorial; the former being that taken by the iron,
the latter that taken by the bismuth.
-   Thus it appears that different bodies are acted upon by the mag
netic forces in two different and opposite modes ; and they may ac
cordingly be arranged ln two classes; the one, of which iron is the
type, constituting those usually denominated nuryrsetiu; the other,
of which bismuth may be taken as the type, obeying a contrary law,
and therefore coming under the generic ap llation of dimnagm-tire.
The author has examined a vast variety olpiiubstances, both simple
and compound, and in a solid, liquid, origaseous form, with a view
to ascertain their respective places and relative order with reference
 to this classi<U+FB01>cation.    The number of simple bodies which belong
to the class of magnetica is extremely limited, consisting only of
 iron, which possesses the magnetic property in an eminent degree,
 nickel, cobalt, manganme, chromium, cerium, titanium, palladium,
platinum and osmium, All other bodies, when either solid or liquid,
are diamagnetic; that is, obey the same law, with regard to mag
 netic action, as bismuth, but with various degrees of intensity :
 arsenic is one of those that give the feeblest indications of possess
 ing this property.     The following exhibit it in increasing degrees,
 according to the order in which they are here enumerated ; namely,
 ether, alcohol, gold. water, mercury, <U+FB02>int glass, tin, lead, zinc, an
 timony, phosphorus, bismuth.       On the other hand, no guseous body
 of any kind, or in any stats of rarefaction or condensation, affords
 the slightest trace of being affected by magnetic forces. Gases may
 therefore be considered as occupying the neutral point in the mag
 netic scale, intermediate between magnetic and diamagnetic bodies.
    The magnetic properties of compound bodies depend on those of
 their elements; and the bodies are rendered either magnetic or dia
 inagnetic according to the predominance of one or other of these
 conditions among their constituent parts. Thus iron is found to re
 tain its magnetic power when it has enteied into combination with
 other bodies of the diamagnetic class; the two forces acting in op
 position to one another, and the resulting effect being only that due
 to the difference in their power.    Hence the oxides and the salts of
 iron are still in a certain degree magnetic, and the latter even when
 they are held in solution by water; but the water may be present
 in such a proportion as that neither shall prevail ; and the solution,
 as far as respects its magnetic properties, will then be exactly neu
 tralized.   These saline solutions, prepared of various degrees of
 strength, also afford a convenient method of comparing the relative
 degrees of force, both magnetic and diamagnetio, of different bodies,
 whether solid or <U+FB02>uid, but more especially the latter, as they admit
 of the body under examination being suspended in another liquid,
 when its position of equilibrium will indicate which of the two sub
stances has the strongest magnetic power.
    In one respect, indeed, the diamagnetic action presents a remark
 able eontrast with the magnetic; and the difference is not merely one
 of degree, but of kind. The magnetism of iron and other magnetics
 is characterized by polarity; that of diamagnetios is devoid of any

                                  594
trace of polarity; the particles of two bodies of tl1e latter class,
when jointly under the in<U+FB02>uence of the magnetic forces, manifest
towards each other no action whatever, either of attraction or re
pulsion.    It has long been known that the magnetism of iron is im
paired by heat; and it has been generally believed that a certain
degree of heat destroys it entirely. The author <U+FB01>nds, however, that
this opinion is not correct; for he shows that, by. applying more
powerful tests than those which had been formerly con<U+FB01>ded in,
iron, nickel and cobalt, however high their temperature may be
raised, still retain u certain amount of magnetic power, of the same
character as that which they ordinarily possess.    From the different
temperatures at which the magnetic metals appear to lose their pe
culiar power, it had formerly been surmised by the author that all the
metals would probably be found to possess the same character of mag
netism, if their temperature could be lowered suf<U+FB01>ciently ; but the re
sults of the present investigation have convinced him that this is not
the case, for bismuth, tin, &c. are in a condition very different from
that of heated iron, nickel or cobalt.
   The magnetic phenomena presented by copper and a few other
metals are of a peculiar character, differing exceedingly from those
exhibited by either iron or bismuth, in consequence of their being
complicated with other agencies, arising from the gradual acquisi
tion and loss of magnetic power by the iron core of the electro
magnet, the great conducting power of copper for electric currents,
and its susceptibility of being acted upon by induced currents of
magneto-electricity, as described by the author in the <U+FB01>rst and se
cond series of these researches. The resulting phenomena are to
all appearance exceedingly singular and anomalous, and would seem
to be explicable only on the principles referred to by the author.
   Pursuing his inductive inquiries with a view to discover the pri
mary law of magnetic action from which the general phenomena
result, the author noticed the modi<U+FB01>cations produced by different
forms given to the bodies subjected to experiment.        In order that
these bodies may set either axially or equatorially, it is necessary
that their section, with reference to the plane of revolution, be of an
elongated shape: when in the form of a cube or sphere they have
no disposition to turn in any direction: but the whole mass, if mag
netic, is attracted towards either magnetic pole; if diamagnetic, is
repelled from them. Substances divided into minute fragments, or
reduced to a <U+FB01>ne powder, obey the same law as the aggregate masses,
moving in lines, which may be termed diamdgnetic curves, in con
tradistinction to the ordinary magnetic curves, which they every
where intersect at right angles. These movements may be beauti
fully seen by sprinkling bismuth in -very <U+FB01>ne powder on paper, and
tapping on the paper while subjected to the action of a magnet.
   The whole of these facts, when carefully considered, are resolva
ble, by induction, into the general and simple law, that while every
particle of a magnetic body is attracted, every particle of a diamag
netic body is repelled, by either pole of a magnet.       These forces
continue to be exerted as long as the magnetic power is sustained,

                                      595
and immediately cease on the cessation of that power. Thus do
these two modes of action stand in the same general antithetical re
lation to one another as the positive and negative conditions of elec
tricity, the northern and southern polarities of ordinary magnetism,
or the lines of electric and of magnetic force in magneto-electricity.
Of   these phenomena, the diamagnetic are the most important,          from
their extending largely, and in a new direction, that character of
duality which the magnetic force was already known, in a certain
degree, to possess.    All matter, indeed, appears to be subject to the
magnetic force    as universally as it is to the gravitating, the electric,
the cohesive and the chemical forces.        Small as the magnetic force
appears to be in the limited <U+FB01>eld of our experiments, yet when
estimated by its dynamic effects on masses of matter, it is found to
be vastly more energetic than even the mighty power of gravitation,
which binds together the whole universe: and there can be no
doubt that it acts a most important part in nature, and conduces to
some great purpose of utility to the system of the earth and of its
 inhabitants.
    Towards the conclusion of the paper, the author enters on theo
 retical considerations suggested to him by the facts thus brought to
 light. An explanation of all the motions and other dynamic phe
 nomena consequent on the action of magnets on diamagnetic bodies
 might, he thinks, be offered on the supposition that magnetic induc
 tion causes in them a state the reverse of that which it produces in
 magnetic matter: that is, if a particle of each kind of matter were
 placed in the magnetic <U+FB01>eld, both would become magnetic, and each
 would have its axis parallel to the resultant of magnetic force pass
 ing through it; but the particle of magnetic matter would have its
 north and south poles opposite to, or facing the contrary poles of
 the inducing magnet; whereas, with the diamagnetic particles, the
 reverse would obtain; and hence there would result, in the one
 substance, approximation; in the other, recession.           On Ampére's
 theory, this  view  would    be  equivalent  to  the  supposition that, as
currents are   induced  in iron  and  magnetics, parallel to those existing
 in the inducing magnet or battery wire, so, in bismuth and other
 diamagnetics, the currents induced are in the contrary direction.
  As far as experiment yet bears upon such a notion, the inductive
 effects on masses of magnetic and diamagnetic metals are the same.

   .                               596
    The <U+FB01>rst two sections of the present memoir are occupied with a
critical examination of the theory advanced by De Saussure to ac
count for the progressive motion of glaciers, which he considered as
formed of masses of rigid and in<U+FB02>exible ice, and with the further
explanations of that theory given by Ramaud, Bischoff, Agassiz, and
Studer.    The author, on the other hand,                 these masses as
possessing a considerable degree    of       regarding
                                       plasticity, exp  ains  on that sup
position the phenomena they present; and, in the third section of
the paper, he relates a series of experiments which he carried on in
the Mer de Glace, near Chamouni, in the summer of 1844, with a
view to determine by direct measurement the relative motion of
different parts of, the glacier.  This he accomplished by selecting a
spot on the western side of the Mer de Glace, between Trelaporte
and l’Angle, where the ice was compact and free from <U+FB01>ssures, and
erecting on the surface a row of posts at short distances from one
another, in a line transverse to the general direction of the moving
mass.    He was thus enabled to discover by trigonometrical observa
tions the movements of different points in this line; and he ascer

   “On the Supra-renal, Thymus and Thyroid Bodies." By John
Goodsir, Esq. Communicated by Richard Owen, Esq., F.R.S. &c.
   In this paper, the author enters on the developement of the theory
he advanced two years ago with regard to the origin and nature of

                                    .597
the supra-renal, thymus and thyroid bodies, and the correctness of
which, with certainr modi<U+FB01>cations, he has been enabled to con<U+FB01>rm by
subsequent observation and re<U+FB02>ection.        His hypothesis was that the
three organs in question are the remains of the blastoderma; the
thyroid being the developement of a portion of the original cellular
substance of the germinal membrane grouped around the two
 branches of the omphalo-mesenteric vein; the supra-renal capsules,
the developements of other portions grouped around the omphalo
 mmenteric arteries; and the thymus, the developement of the inter
 mediate portion of the membrane an-anged along the sides of the
 embryonic visceral cavity.     He has since ascertained, however, that
 the thyroid body derives its origin in a portion of the included mem
 bruna intermedia remaining in connexion with anastomosing vessels
 between the <U+FB01>rst and second aortic arches, or carotid and subelavian
 vessels.    He considers these organs as essentially similar intheir
 structure, as well as in their origin in continuous portions of the
 blastoderma situated along each side of the spine, and extending
 from the Wol<U+FB01>an bodies to the base of the cranium: the develope
 ment of the supra-renal capsules having relation to the omphalo
 mesenteric vessels; the thymus, to the jugular and cardinal veins and
 ductus Cuvieri ; and the thyroid gland, to the anastomosing branches
 of the <U+FB01>rst and second aortic arches. The functions of these organs
 he regards as being analogous to those of the blastoderma; with this
 difference, however, that as the blastoderma not only elaborates
 nourishment for the embryo, but absorbs it also from without, that
 is, from the yolk, the developed organs only elaborate the matter
 which has already been absorbed by the other parts, and is now cir
 culating in the vessels of the more perfect individual.

      “ On the Use of the Barometric Thermometer for the determina
  tion of Relative Heights." By James R. Christie, Esq. Communi
  cated by S. Hunter Christie, Esq., Sec. R.S., &c.
      The objects of this communication, as stated by the author, are,
  <U+FB01>rst, to show the theoretical foundation of the very simple law
  pointed out by Professor Forbes, according to which the di<U+FB02>erence
  of the boiling temperature of water at two stations is connected with
  their difference of level; and next, to test the accuracy of this law
  by a comparison of results deduced from his own observations on the
  boiling-point ofwater at different stations among the Alps of Savoy,
   Piedmont and Switzerland, with the heights of the same stations as
  determined by other observers and by di<U+FB02>'erent means; and thus to

                                    598
arrive at ajust conclusion with respect to the value of the barometric
thermometer as an instrument for determining differences of level.

where b is the variable boiling-point on Fahrenheit’s scale and [5 the
corresponding barometric pressure, with the formula of Laplace for
the determination of the difference in level of two stations from ba
rometric observations, he obtains the formula
          H =   547-99 (b   _ 1;)
                                    {

where b and b’ are the boiling~-points     on Fahrenheit’s scale at the
two stations, t the mean temperature of the air at the stations, and
 H their difference of level in English feet.
    The author describes the particular instrument he employed in
his observations, and his mode of determining the correction which
 it required: he then gives, in a table, the observations he made on
the boiling-poi-nt of water at thirty-eight different stations in the
Alps, the heights of the corresponding stations above the sea level,
deduced from these observations, and, for the purpose of compari
son, the heights of the same stations deduced by other observers.
The difference between these and some of the author's results are
considerable; but as they are not greater than would probably arise
from ordinary barometric measurements, and as there is a close ac
cordance between his results and the determinations on which the
greatest reliance can be placed, he concludes that the results are on
the whole satisfactory.    Considering           it,
                                            however, desirable to obtain
some test of the accuracy of each observation independently of the
rest of the series, the author avails himself of the barometric ob
servations made at the Observatory at Geneva and at the Convent
of the Great St. Bernard; and determining from these the corre
sponding temperature of boiling water, deduces the difference of
level between each of his stations and these two places considered
as <U+FB01>xed points: the sum of the height above Geneva and the de
pression below the Great St. Bernard should in all cases be the dif
ference of level between the two <U+FB01>xed stations. Although there are
here again considerable discrepancies, yet in most cases where the
height of the station may be considered as well-established, the height
deduced from the observations agrees with         in a very remarkable
                                                           it
                                                             r
manner.
    In another table, the author gives the difference of level between
the Observatory at Geneva and the Great St. Bernard, deduced from
the recorded observations at those places simultaneous with his own
at his various stations; and then remarks that the differences of height
determined by the two methods do not differ from one another, in
any single case, by so large  a  quantity as do the greatest and least
differences  of height   deduced  from the barometric observations       ;
while in many cases the accordance        almost perfect.
                                             is
    The conclusion drawn from the comparisons in these tables is,
that the barometric thermometer         capable of affording highly ac
                                        is

                                    599
curate and satisfactory results, perhaps even more so than the com
mon form of barometer, but that there is considerable uncertainty
attached to its indications.     This uncertainty, far from being wholly
attributable to the imperfections of the instrument as a measure of
the atmospheric pressure, might, the author thinks, arise from an
extreme susceptibility to rapid changes in that pressure, which re
main unindicated by the more sluggish barometer.
     “ On the Decomposition and Analysis of the Com          unds of Am
monia and Cyanogen."        By Robert Smith, Esq., Pkg). Communi
cated by Captain William Henry Smyth, R.N., F.R.S.
     This paper is divided into four parts; the <U+FB01>rst relates to the de
composition of ammonia and its compounds by the compounds of
chlorine, and the collection and measurement of the nitrogen gas
which is disengaged, the amount of which the author considers as
furnishing a ready and accurate mode of estimating the quantity of
ammonia in the solution subjected to analysis. The chloride of lime
was the salt usually employed for this purpose: this Iilell]0d is re
garded by the author as being peculiarly applicable to the analysis
of organic substances.
     The second part treats of the decomposition and estimation of
hydrocyanic acid and its                   by means of chloride of lime,
yielding nitrogen gas andcompiunds
                              car   nate of lime; a process which occu
pies but a few seconds.      In some cases, the employment of chloride
of soda is preferable to that of chloride of lime, on account of the
solubility of all the compounds that are formed. The author found
the same method applicable also to the analysis of the salts of cya
nogen; for the cyanides of the alkalims are decomposed by it as
rapidly as the pure acid itself. The ferro-cyanides are also very
readily decomposed.
     The author, in the third part of his paper, relates the results of
his trials of the hypochlorites as agents for the decomposition of uric
 acid, which proved so satisfactory as to induce him to believe that
these salts might be advantageously used as solvents of uric calculi
 in the living bladder.   He also proposes the employment of chloride
 of lime as a ready and accurate mode of estimating the quantity of
 nitrogen contained in urine, from the amount of gas disengaged by
 its action on the nitrogenous compounds.        ln the last part, the ap
 paratus   used in the experiments   is described.

 merous Committee of gentlemen of df<U+FB02>irrent natiorw, appointed by
 the Royal Society for that purpose," appeared to be at variance with
 the list of the Committee as it was appointed on the 6th of March,
  1711-12, and which only contains the names of Arbuthnot, Hill,

position to those of Mr. Kiernan on this subject; and particularly
with regard to the absence of real tubercular ducts from the interior
of the lobules.   He concludes that the secreting process commences
in the rows of epithelial cells surrounding the central axis of the
lobule, and that the <U+FB02>uid there secreted is transmitted to the cells
forming the margin of the lobule, where it is further elaborated,
and, by the bursting of these cells, is conveyed into the cavity of the
surrounding duet.      A few diagrams are annexed, illustrative    of the
descriptions  of microscopic structure given in the paper.

 1844--4-5, which there appeared on the 20th of December 184-4 and
disappeared on the 30th of January following, having been visible
forty-two days. Its most remarkable feature was, that during its
greatest brilliancy, the nucleus was not surrounded by the nebulous
matter, but was situated at the very extremity       of the head, and at
times even appeared quite detached.

   “ On the Mechanism of Respiration." By Francis Sibson. Com
municated by Thomas Bell, Esq., F.R.S.
   This paper is almost entirely occupied with anatomical details,
collected from an extensive series of dissections of the muscles and

                                  602
bones concerned in the act of respiration in man and the lower ani
mals, for the purpose of elucidating the mechanism of their action
both in inspiration and in expiration; accompanied by a great num
ber of illustrative diagrams and drawings.      The author commences
with the serpent tribes, which present the simplest form of ribs,
being attached only at their vertebral ends, while their anterior ends
are free. When these ribs are brought forwards by the action of
the levatores costarum and external intercostal muscles, the chest is
expanded; and when drawn backwards by the long depressors, in
ternal intercostals and transversales, expiration is effected. In birds
there are added to the former apparatus a sternum, and a series of
sternal ribs, the respiratory movements of which are performed in
directions the reverse of those of the vertebral ribs.    During inspi
ration, the angles between the vertebral and sternal ribs become
more open; the sternum moves forwards, and the spinal column
slightly backwards, by the combined action of the scaleni and
sterno-costal muscles on the <U+FB01>rst vertebral and <U+FB01>rst sternal ribs re
spectively; of the levatores costarum and external intercostal on all
the lower vertebral ribs, and of the sternal intercostals on all the
lower sternal ribs.   On expiration these movements are reversed by
the action of the internal intercostals, the external and internal
oblique, recti, transveraales and other muscles.    The mechanism in
the Mammalia is further assisted and modi<U+FB01>ed by the addition of at
large and powerful diaphragm.       The thoracic ribs are articulated
with the sternum by the medium of cartilages corresponding to the
sternal ribs of birds: those ribs which are connected with the infe
rior curve of the dorsal arch have <U+FB02>oating cartilages, and may be
considered as a diaphragmatic set of ribs. When raised, the former
approach each other, and ‘the latter recede from each other ante
riorly. Intermediate to these are the longer ribs connected with the
dorsal arch, having their cartilages united, and articulated with the
lower end of the sternum. The scaleni muscles invariably act during
the whole time of inspiration.     The external intercostals between
the thoracic ribs are also throughout inspiratory; but those portions
which are situated between their cartilages are expiratory; and
those between the diaphragmatic ribs are inspiratory behind, expi
ratory to the side, and in front, and inspiratory between their carti
lages. Between the intermediate ribs, they are for the most part
slightly inspiratory between the ribs, and expiratory in front, be
tween the cartilages.    The external intercostals o<U+FB02> the thoracic ribs
are expiratory behind, and inspiratory in front, if the ribs approach
these, and are inspiratory between their costal cartilages.     Between
the diaphragmatic and intermediate sets of ribs, and between their
cartilages they are throughout expiratory.      The levatores costarum
draw the posterior portion of the lower ribs backwards.       In the ass
and the dog, the upper fasciculi of the serratus magnns are expira
tory, the lower inspiratory, and the intermediate neutral.       In man,
the greater part of the fasciculi of this muscle is expiratory.    In the
ass, the lower <U+FB01>bres of the serratus posticus inferior are inspiratory,
and the upper <U+FB01>bres expiratory.       In the dog and in man, all are
throughout expiratory.

   “Illustrations of the Viscous Theory of Glaciers."             By James
David Forbes, Esq., F.R.S. &c. Part Ill.
   The author inquires, in this part of his paper, into the motion of
those comparatively small isolated glacial masses, rcposing in the
cavities of high mountains or on ooh, and called by De Saussure
glacier: of the second order. A glacier of this description in the
neighbourhood of the Hospice du Simplon, lodged in a niche on the
northern face of the Schmnhorn, immediately behind the Hospice,
and at an elevation of about 8000 feet above the sea, was selected
for observation.      The average velocity of its descent was found to
be about one inch and a half in twenty-four hours: those parts in
which the slope was 20° moving with a velocity about one-third
greater than those in which the slope was 10°.             The author next
enters into general views on the annual motion of glaciers, and on
the in<U+FB02>uence of seasons; and gives tabular details of the observa
tions made with reference to these questions at two stations; the
one on the Glacier des Bossons, and the other at the Glacier des
Bois, which is the outlet of the Mer de Glace towards the valley of
Chamouni.       In both these glaciers, the motion in summer exceeds
that in winter in a greater proportion as the station is lower, and
consequently exposed to more violent alternations of heat and cold.
He also found that the variations of velocity due to season are
greatest where the variations in the temperature of the air are
greatest, as in the lower valleys; excepting that variations of tem
perature below the freezing-point produce scarcely any appreciable
change in the rate of motion of the ice.          He concludes with some
general  illustrations  of the plastic  or viscous   theory of glacier mo
tion. A glacier, he contends, is not a mass of fragments or parallel
opipedons; neither is it a rigidly solid body; and although it may
be extensivelyaintersected     by crevices, these
                                                      “ crevasses" are com

                                   604
paratively super<U+FB01>cial, and do not disturb the general continuity of
the mass in which they occur.       The water contained in these cre
vices is only the principal vehicle of the force which acts upon it:
and the irresistible energy with which the whole icy mass descends
from hour to hour with a slow but continuous motion bespeaks of
itself the operation of a <U+FB02>uid pressure acting on a ductile or plastic
material.

 elastic Molecules in a state of Motion."       By J. J. Waterson, Esq.
 Communicated by Captain Beaufort, R.N., F.R.S.
    This memoir contains the enunciation of a new theory of heat,
 capable of explaining the phenomena of its radiation and polariza
 tion, and the elasticity of various bodies, founded on the hypothesis
 of a medium consisting of a vast multitude of minute particles of
 matter endowed with perfect elasticity, and enclosed in elastic walls,
 but moving in all directions within that space, with perfect freedom,
 and in every possible direction.    In the course of these motions, the
 particles must be supposed to encounter one another in every pos
 sible manner, during an interval of time so small as to allow of their
 being considered in<U+FB01>nitesimal in respect to any sensible period;
 still, however, preserving the molecular vis viva constant and un
 diminished.                            .
     The author then enters into extensive analytical investigations;
 <U+FB01>rst, of the conditions that determine the equilibrium of such a
 homogeneous medium, as is implied by the hypothesis, and of the
 laws of its elasticity; secondly, of the physical relations of media
 that differ from each other in the speci<U+FB01>c weight of their molecules;
 thirdly, of the phenomena that attend the condensing and dilating
 of media, and of the mechanical value of their molecular vis viva ;
  fourthly, of the resistance of media to a moving surface; <U+FB01>fthly, of
 the vertical equilibrium of a medium surrounding a planet and con
  stituting its atmosphere; and lastly, of the velocity with which lnl
  pulses are transmitted through a medium so constituted.
     In an Appendix, the author enters into a full explanation of a
  table of gases and vapours, drawn up with reference to the subjects
  discussed in his paper.

      “ On the Blow-hole of the Porpoise."
                                                By Francis Sibson, Esq.
   Communicated by Thomas Bell, Esq., F.R.S.
      The external opening of the air-passage of the porpoise is so

                                    605
situated at the upper part of the head ns to admit of the animal's
breathing while only a small portion of its head is above the water.
In   its descent through the skull, between the cranial and facial bones,
the tube is divided by a thin plate of bone into two nasal Qnnls,
which form, below this partition, n single muscular tube opemng at
its lower part into the pharynx by a constricted aperture, through
which the larynx projects upwards quite through the pharynx, di
viding it into two channels.        A series of pouches, <U+FB01>ve in number,
capable of great dilatation, and provided with a muscular apparatus
for retaining or expelling their contents, communicate by large ori
<U+FB01>ces with the nasal canals, and appear to correspond in situation
with the antra, frontal sinuses and ethmoid cells. The author gives
a minute anatomical description of these muscles, and an account of
their modes of action; the adjustments of the apparatus being such
 that the outer passage may be closed or opened above or below the
 anterior pouches. When the outer passage is closed, the posterior
 pouches can be distended and the anterior emptied; while the con
 verse may be effected when the passage is open. The use of the
 pouches appears to be to buoy up the head, so that on the porpoise
 rising from deep water, the opening for breathing comes <U+FB01>rst to the
 surface and admits of the animal's sleeping in that position, while its
 whole body remains immersed in the water.
     “ On Motion in the.Lumbar Division of the Spine in Birds." By
 George Oakley Fleming, M.D., F.L.S. Communicated by Thomas
 Bell, Esq., F.R.S.
     The author gives quotations from the works of Cuvier, Blumen
 bach, Tiedemann, Mscartney, Vicq d'Azyr, Carus, Earle, and Roget,
 in proof of its being the prevalent opinion among comparative phy
 siologists that the dorsal and lumbar portions of the spine form alto
  gether a rigid structure, not admitting of the least perceptible <U+FB02>exion.
  But from his observations of the form of the articulating surfaces of
  the lumbar vertebrae, which appear to be adapted to lateral motion,
  the author was led to conclude that, although <U+FB02>exion in the mesial
  plane is effectually prevented, some degree of lateral <U+FB02>exion actually
  takes place.    The number of articulations in this part of the spine,
  he observes, varies in different birds: thus in the sea-gull, there are
  several articulations in the dorsal and lumbar portions; while, in the
  peacock, there is only one moveable vertebra; the remaining dorsal
  being united together, and all the lumbar vertebraa being consoli
 dated and anchylosed with the sacrum; thus forming two <U+FB01>rm and
  immoveable pieces between which the moveable vertebra is placed.
  The <U+FB01>exion of the spine forwards is prevented by the great breadth
  of the spinous processes and their projections at right angles to the
  bodies of the vertebraa; and frequently also by the addition of a
  number of thin, <U+FB02>at long bones which are applied by their <U+FB02>at sur
  faces on each side of the spinous processes; and also by strong <U+FB02>at
  ligaments, situated between each spinons process, like the ligamen
  tum nuchae of herbivorous quadrupeds.        For the purpose of guard
  ing against pressure on the spinal cord during the lateral <U+FB02>exion of

                                     606
                                  is
this part of the spine, the spinal canal is enlarged laterally at the
centres of motion. The paper is illustrated by drawings of the parts
described.

    “                 of the Power consumed in overcoming the Inertia
       Investigation
 of Railway Trains, and of the Resistance of the Air to the motion
 of Railway Trains at high velocities."         By P. W. Barlow, Esq.,
 F.R.S., M.I.C.E.
    The object of the author in this inquiry     is to obtain a more cor
 rect knowledge than has hitherto been possessed of the resistances
 which the air opposes to the motion of locomotive engines at great
 velocities, and of the loss of force arising from increased back pres
 sure and the imperfect action of the steam. For this purpose he
 institutes a comparison between the velocities actually acquired by
 railway trains with those which the theory of accelerated motion
 would have assigned; and his experiments are made not only on
trains propelled by a locomotive engine, but also on those moving
 on the atmospheric railway, which latter affords valuable results,
 inasmuch as the tractive force is not subject to the losses at high
 velocities necessarily incident to locomotive engines.         A table is
given of the theoretical velocities resulting from calculation founded
 on the dynamical law of constant accelerating.forces, in the case of
trains of various weights, impelled by different tractive forces, moving
from a state of rest; and is followed by another table of the ob
served velocities in Mr. Stephenson's experiment on the Dalkey
line; the result of the comparison being that in a distance of one
mile and a quarter, the loss of velocity is about one-half of the ob
served velocity.
    A series of experiments on .locomotive lines is next related; but
 the comparison is less satisfactory than in the former case, because
the tractive force cannot be so accurately estimated; it is however
su<U+FB02>-iciently so to establish the fact, that the power lost by the loco
motive engine below the speed of thirty miles per hour is so small
as to be scarcely appreciable, and that the time and power which
are absorbed in putting a railway train in motion is almost entirely
required to overcome the inertia of the train, and does not arise
from any loss or imperfection of the engine.        It appears, from these
experiments,     that above  one-<U+FB01>fth  of the whole  power exerted is con
sumed in putting the train in motion at the observed velocity.        The
author then enters into some general remarks on the effects arising
from this source of loss of power, and the practical application of
the knowledge thus obtained.         In the atmospheric railway, he <U+FB01>nds
that the tractive force of a <U+FB01>fteen-inch pipe is so small (being less
than half that of a locomotive engine), that the time of overcoming
the inertia must limit the amount of tra<U+FB02>ic which can be carried on

                                  607
a single line, especially with numerous stations. When a great velo
city is obtained, the tractive force of the locomotive is much re
duced, and therefore a much greater velocity can be attained on an
atmospheric railway.
    The inquiries of the author into the amount of resistance exerted
by the air on railway trains lead him to the conclusion that in the
atmospheric railway the loss of tractive power of the piston from
friction, &c. is very inconsiderable; and that the resistance of the
air is less than had been hitherto estimated, not exceeding, on an
average, ten pounds per ton on the average weight of trains.
    A tabular statement is then given of the results of the experi
ments made by the British Association, for the purpose of com
paring them with those obtained by the author from his own ob
servations, and more particularly from his experiments on the (Troy
don Atmospheric Railway.       The general conclusion which he draws
from this investigation is that the resistance of the air in a qui
escent state is less than had been previously estimated, and that the
ordinary atmospheric resistance in railway progression arises from
the air being generally itself in motion, and as the direction of the
current is almost always oblique, from its producing increased fric
tion in the carriages themselves.     This kind of resistance will not
increase as the square of the velocity; and as it is the principal one,
it follows that the resistance to railway trains increases in a ratio
not much higher than the velocity, and that the practical limit to
the speed of railway travelling isa question, not of force, but of
safety.

    “ On the Muscularity of the Iris." By Professor Maunoir, of
Geneva.     Communicated by P. M. Roget, M.D., Sec. R.S.
    The author has satis<U+FB01>ed himself, from the result of his own dis
sections, as well as from the concurrent testimony of a great number
of anatomists, that the iris is provided with two sets of muscular
<U+FB01>bres, the one orbicular, immediately surrounding the pupillary
margin and acting as a sphincter; the other, extending in a radiated
direction from the exterior circumference of the former to their in
sertions into the ciliary ligament, their action being to enlarge the
pupil.    One-fourth of the disc of the iris is occupied by the orbi
cular, and the remaining three-fourths by the radiated muscle.     The
author has examined the structure of the iris in a great number of
animals, and states the results obtained by M. Lebertfwhom he
applied to on this occasion, from numerous dissections of the eyes
of animals belonging to each class of vertebrata.     He also refers to
a work which he published in the year 1812, entitled “ Mémoire sur

                                   608
l’Organisation de l'Iris," for evidence of the muscularity of the iris
which he obtained by applying galvanism to the human eye imme
diately after decapitation; and he concludes with the narrative of
the case of a woman in whose iris there had been formed, by an
accidental wound with the point of a knife, a triangular aperture
below the pupil. This aperture became dilated when the pupil was
contracted, and vice versd; thus furnishinga proof that its move
ments were effected by muscular action.

    Contributions to the Chemistry of the Urine. Part II. “ On the
Variations in the Alkaline and Earthy Phosphates in Disease."         By
Henry Bence Jones, M.D., Fellow of the Royal College of Physi
cians.    Communicated    by Thomas Graham, Esq.,      F.R.S” &c.
    The analyses, of which the results are given in   a series of tables,
were made by the     author, chie<U+FB02>y from   the urine of patients labour
ing under different diseases in St. George's Hospital, and therefore
nearly under the same circumstances as far as exercise was cou
cerned.     He found that the variations in the earthy phosphates were
in general independent of the nature of the disease. In fractures of
the spine and paraplegia, however, the total amount of these salts
was slightly above the healthy standard during the early period,
 and when in<U+FB02>ammatory action might-be considered as prevailing;
 but when this action had subsided, and the affection had become
 chronic, the total quantity of phosphatic salts was less than natural.
 In chronic diseases of the brain, and in chronic and even in acute
 diseases of the membranes, no increase of these salts was observed.
 In fractures of the bones of the skull, when in<U+FB02>ammation of the
 brain supervened, there was a slight increase of- the total amount of
 phosphates; but no such increase occurred when the head was not
 affected, even although acute in<U+FB02>ammation of other organs existed.
 In acute in<U+FB02>ammation of the brain there was an excessive secretion
 of phosphates, which returned to the natural quantity as soon as
 the in<U+FB02>ammation passed into the chronic state.      In some functional
 diseases of the brain, attended with delirium, the secretion of the
 salts was excessive; but the excess ceased with the disappearance
'of that symptom.     In other functional diseases, as in fevers, no ex
 cess was observable.      In delirium tremens, when food could be
 taken, there was neither excess nor de<U+FB01>ciency; but in the most
 violent cases, where no food could be taken, the quantity of the
 phosphates was diminished in a most remarkable degree.           In the
 general paralysis of the insane, no increase of phosphates was ob
 served.   One case of acute paroxysm of mania showed a small in

                                       609
crease during the paroxysm; in two other cases of mania there was
a diminution of phosphates approaching to that occurring in delirium
tremens.       Bright's disease, even attended with acute in<U+FB02>ammation,
showed no increase.          When only a few ounces of urine were se
creted, as     in dropsy,  no  increase was observed; and none also in a
very extreme case         of  exostosis.    In the case of mollities ossium,
there was a decided increase of          the  earthy phosphates; and st last,
the alkaline phosphates were also          in  excess, although there was no
 indication of affections of the nervous structures.
      The following are the general conclusions which the author draws
 from his inquiries: <U+FB01>rst, that acute affections of the nervous sub
 stance, organic and functional, are the only diseases in which an
 excess of phosphatic salts appears in the urine; and in acute in
 <U+FB02>ammation of the brain, its amount is proportional to the intensity
 of the in<U+FB02>ammation; secondly, that in a large class of functional
 diseases of the brain, of which delirium tremens presents the most
  marked example, the secretion of phosphates is most remarkably
  diminished; and lastly, that no chronic disease exhibits any marked
  excess in the total quantity of phosphatic salts secreted, at least as
  far as the mode of analysis employed by the author can be regarded
  as conclusive.
       “ On the effects produced by Poisonous Fish on the Human
  Frame."       By Sir \Villiam Burnett, M.D., K.C.H., Vice-President of
  the Royal Society.
       The author communicates a report which he lately received from
   Mr. Jameson, the                 of the <U+FB02>ag shjp at the Cape of Good
   Hope, of the rapidly  surgeon
                              atal consequences ensuing from eating small
  portions of the liver of a <U+FB01>sh, known at the Cape by the name of
   the Bhzdder or Toad <U+FB01>sh, the Aptodactylus punetalus, or Tetrodon
   of Cuvier. The symptoms were chie<U+FB02>y pain and burning sensation
   at the epigastrium, constriction and spasm of the fauces and mus
   cles of deglutition, rigidity of the tendons, coma, paralysis and con
   vulsions, following one another in quick succession, and terminating
   in death within twenty minutes after the poisonous food had been
   taken.     Several other instances of the same kind are next related;
   and a narrative is subjoined of the case of a seaman who lost his
   life, with similar symptoms, from the bite of a water snake in Madras
   roads; the Coluber laticazulatus of Linnaeus (Hydnw colub11'nu.r of
    Shaw); and also of a ship's company who were all severely affected
    by eating portions of a large Banacmlu (Pcrca ntqjor).
        The author ascribes the symptoms induced by these deleterious
    substances to their action on the nervous system alone, there being
    evidence of congestion only, but not of in<U+FB02>ammation, in the sto
    mach and other viscera.

    Robert Lee, M.D., F.R.S., Fellow of the Royal College of Phy
    sicians.
        The author  states, that on the 8th     of April 1838,  he discovered,

                                                         .
                                  610
 in dissecting a gravid uterus, structures which had a striking re
 semblance to ganglionic plexuses of nerves; and, in the following
 December, he traced, in another gravid uterus, the sympathetic and
 spinal nerves into these new structures.    He requested several di
 stinguished anatomists to examine these dissections, and to compare
 them with similar dissections of the unimpregnated uterus, which
 he had made in the course of the same year. He then quotes, at
 some length, the opinions given by these several referees after their
 examination; and which appear, for the most part, to be favour
 able to the views of the author, namely, that the structures in ques
 tion are not mere <U+FB01>brous tissues, but that they possess the character
of nerves, and that they augment in size with the enlargement of the
uterus during pregnancy.      Among those to whom the preparations
were submitted for examination, however, two persons declared it
to be their opinion, which they founded on observations with the
microscope, that the <U+FB01>laments regarded by the author as nerves, are
bands of elastic tissue only, and not plexuses of nerves; and the
author, on receiving this intimation, withdrew the paper which he
had presented to the Royal Society, and which had been read on
the 12th of December 1839, in which paper the appearances dis
played in his dissections were minutely described and delineated.
    The author next proceeds to give the history of his subsequent
researches on the same subject, which he extended to the corre
sponding parts in some of the larger quadrupeds; and from all these
he obtained accumulated evidence of the truth of his original opi
nions.    He also adduces the testimony of various observers, in addi
tion to those he had before cited, which are all in accordance with
his own views, as they are expressed in his paper, printed in the
Philosophical Transactions for l84-l, an Appendix to which was
published in the volume of the same work for 1842. Later obser
vations and dissections have served only to con<U+FB01>rm him in his opi
nions; and he considers them as establishing the fact that the nerves
of the uterus are considerably enlarged during the gravid state of
that organ.
    The author concludes his paper by giving a report, drawn up by
Mr. John Dalrymple, of the results of his microscopic examination
of the uterine nerves in preparations furnished by the author, which
                                                                '

   " History of the Mace given to the Royal Society by King Charles
the Second." By Charles Richard Weld, Esq., Banister at Law,
Aaiistant Secretary and Librarian to the Royal Society.          Com

   The Second Charter of the Royal Society passed the Great Seal
on the 22nd of April I663, and in August following, Charles the
Second presented the Society with the Mace at present in their pos
session.
   It is probable that His Majesty resolved some time before to
honour the Society with this mark of his esteem, for, in the above
Charter, permission is given to have two Sergeants-at-Mace      to at
tend upon the President (duos servientes ad clavas, qui de temporc in
tempus super Pnesidem attendant).    The Council-Book of the Society
records, that “on the 3rd of August I663, the President (Lord
Brouncker) informed the Society, that Sir Gilbert Talbot, Master of
the Jewell House, had sent to him, without taking any fees, the Mace
                                               "
bestowed by His Majesty upon the Society;        and that he, the said
President, had “in the Book of His Majesty's Jewell House, ac
knowledged the receipt thereof for the Society*."
   This Mace, which <U+FB01>lls so important an o<U+FB02>ice in the Royal Society,
as without it no Meeting can be held, is made of silver, richly gilt,
and weighs 190 oz. avoirdupois.    It consists of a Stem. handsomely
chased, with a running pattern of the Thistle, terminated at the
upper end by an urn-shaped head, surmounted by a Crown, Ball,
and Cross.   Upon the head are embossed <U+FB01>gures of a Rose, Harp,
Thistle, and Fleur-de-Lys, emblematic of England, Ireland, Scot
land, and France, on each side of which are the letters C. R.

     To this Mace attaches         a celebrity,   which has long caused it to be
regarded with extraordinary             interest.    It is almost super<U+FB02>uous to
state, that this arises from the belief of its being the identical Mace
turned out of the House of Commons by Oliver Cromwell when he
dissolved the Long Parliament.               So general has been this credence,
that numberless         visitors   have  come    purposely to the Apartments of
the Society to see the Mace, having read, or been assured, that it is
the famous “Bauble;" and after minutely examining it, have de
parted, <U+FB01>rmly persuaded that they have seen the Mace so rudely
 dealt with by the Protector.                                                  . f
     Nor has its fame been con<U+FB01>ned to oral tradition.                  Books, profess
ing to be authentic histories, have chronicled, that the Bauble Mace
is in the possession of the Royal Society; and I may mention that
 a few months ago, the proprietors of the Abbotsford Edition of the
Waverley Novels applied for permission to make a drawing of the
 Mace to illustrate " VVoodstock," an engraving of which appears in
 the above work, accompanied by a statement, “ that it is a repre
 sentation of the 'Bauble Mace’ formerly belonging to the Long
Parliament, and now in the possession of the Royal Society."
 ' *
        The Arms of the Society and the Inscription were engraved on the Mace
 by the Society's directions in the year 1663; it was cleaned and regilt in 1756 at
the expense of Lord Maccles<U+FB01>eld, who was at that period President of the Society,
 as           by the following entry in the Council Minutes under the date of July
       175 :—
 29, uppeaérs
     “ The President having declared by letter to Mr. Watson, that he intended
                                                                                   that
rthe Mace shall he cleaned and repaired at his expense, it was
     “ Ordered, that Mr. Hawksbee do deliver the Mace to Messrs.
                                                                           Wyckes and
 Netherton, Silversmiths in Panton Street, for that purpose."
     The Mace accordingly was put into thorough repair, regilt, and registered in
 the Excise o<U+FB01>ice as weighing 190 oz.' At a Meeting of the Society on the 25th
 of November 1756, the thanks of the Society were unanimously voted to the Pre
 sident “for this obliging mark of his regard for them?"
     In 1828 the Mace was again regilt and repaired, at an expense of £23 10a. It
 isr now in excellent condition.
     By the obliging kindness of l\'lr. Cadell, I am enabled to annex a very beautiful
 and accurate representation     of the Mace, printed from the block used in the Ab
 hotsford Edition of the Waverley Novels.                            .

    I   am entirely       at a loss to conceive how this belief originated,    and
the more so, as there is not the slightest historical evidence in its
favour; but, on the contrary, many facts which prove most indis
putably. that the Mace in question has no pretension whatever to
the designation of the " Bauble

now call       it,
            was imparted to me,     conceived a strong desire to learn

on what historical grounds the matter rested.     As an o<U+FB02>icer of the

   It however frequently occurred to me, that the Mace now before
the Society could not be the Mace used in the House of Commons
during the reign of Charles the First, and subsequently turned out
by the Commonwealth Parliament; for when               thought of the de
                                                                l
mocratic whirlwind that uprooted and swept away every vestigc of
royalty,       appeared to me, that nothing short of
              it                                             miracle could
                                                                      a
account for the preservation of so conspicuous and decisive an em
blem of sovereignty as the Mace presented to the ltoyal Society by
Charles the Second.                           ~
   Researches connected with a history of the Society, upon which
I am engaged, led me, in the <U+FB01>rst place, to investigate the history of
the famous “ Bauble                ;"
                            and secondly, that of the Mace of the Royal
Society,    in  order to ascertain whether the latter and former are
identical.
   The result of these researches, which were far more laborious than
I  anticipated,      now lay before the Society; and though they will
                     l
have the effect of destroying a pleasing and long-cherished illusion,
lam sure the Royal Society will not be displeased by having the
real truth set before them.
   On the 30th of January 1649, Charles the First was beheaded;
and on the lst of February following, the Journal-Books of the
House of Commons inform us*, that “a Committee appointed for
securing the Crown Jewells, and other things, late the King's, re
ported that they have disposed them in         room under several doors
                                                       a
now locked upf."
   It    isprobable that the Royal Mace was among the articles of
plate  thus   disposed of, as on the 17th of March, the Journal-Books
of the House state, that " It he referred to the Committee for alter
ation of Seals to consider of       new form of Mace, and the special
                                        a
care thereof       committed to Mr. Lovei."
                     is
   On the 13th of April 1649,            recorded, that “ Mr. Love re
                                         it   is
ported several forms of a new     Mace,"  upon which      was “ Resolved,
                                                                     it

Instead of a design appear a number of asterisks as above, but
fortunately the Parliamentary History and Whitelock’s Memorials
enable us to <U+FB01>ll the blank in the most satisfactory manner.          The
Journal-Books of the House of Commons state, that on the 6th of
June, “ It was ordered that the new Mace, made by Thomas Maunfly
of London, Goldsmith, be delivered unto the charge of the Sergeant
at-Arms attending the Parliament; and that the said Mace be car
ried before the Speaker; and that all the Maces to be used in this
 Commonwealth be made according to the same form and pattern ;
and that the said Thomas Maundy have the making thereof, and
 none other*."
    Now, according to the Parliamentary History, on the 6th of June
 (the same day, it will be observed, that the Journal-Books of the
 House of Commons state the new Mace was ordered to be deli
 vered to the Sergeant-at-Arms) “ a new Mace was brought into the
 House, ornamented with <U+FB02>owers, instead of the Cross and Ball on
 the top, with the Arms of England and Ireland, instead of the late
 King’sT." Whitelock also states in his Memorials, that “on the
 6th of June 1649, a new Mace with the Arms of England and Ire
 land instead of the King's Arms was approv'd and deliver'd to Ser
 geant Birkhead, to be used for the House; and all other Maces for
 the Commonwealth to be of that formi."         It is thus evident that a
 new Mace was provided for the Commonwealth Parliament, differing
 essentially in form from that used in the time of Charles the First.
 The Journals of the Commons further inform us, that on the llth
 of June 1649, " the Committee of Revenue was authorized and re
 quired to pay forthwith, unto Thomas Maundy of London, the sum
 of £137 ls. 8d., in discharge of his bill of charges for making the
 new Mace for the service of this House§."        There appears to have
 been some error in this amount, as on the 7th of August 1649, it
 was “ Ordered, that it be referred to the Committee of Revenue, to
 examine the particulars touching the charge for making the Mace
 for this House; and if they <U+FB01>nd the same was miscast, and that the
 sum of £9 10s. remaineth yet due and unpaid for the same, that
 they forthwith make payment of the same unto Thomas Maundy ll."
     Thus we have additional evidence, not only of the manufacture of
                                                                        r
 a new Mace for the House, but even of its cost.
     On the 9th of August 1649, the Journals of the Commons state
 that it was “ Ordered, that those gentlemen who were appointed by
  this House to have the custody of the Regalia, do deliver them over
 unto the Trustees for sale of the goods of the late King, who are to
 cause the same to be totally broken; and that they melt down all the
                             J
 gold and silver, and sell the ewells to the best advantage of the Com
 monwealth, and to take the like care of them that are in the Tower<U+FB02>l."
  .
     There is every reason to believe that this order was executed, and
 that not only the Regalia, but all gold and silver articles (among
  which would be included the Royal Mace) were melted down and
  sold.  A curious MS., giving an account of the preparations for the

Coronation of Charles the Second, by Sir Edward Walker, Knt.,
Garter Principal King-at-Arms, published in 1820, informs us, " that
because through the rapine of the then late unhappy times, all the
Royal Ornaments and Regalia theretofore preserved from age to age
in the treasury of the Church of Westminster had been taken away,
sold, or destroyed, the Committee (appointed to order the ceremony)
met divers times, not only to direct the re-making such Royal Or
naments and Regalia, but even to settle the form and fashion of
each particular, all which did then retain the old names and fashion,
although they had been newly made and prepared, by orders given
to the Earl of Sandwich, Master of the Great Wardrobe, and Sir
 Gilbert Talbot, Knt., Master of the Jewell House."
      The MS. then proceeds to enumerate the various articles ordered
 to be made for the Coronation of the King. which makes it evident
 that the former Regalia had been destroyed0.
     The singular and fortunate discovery of the receipt of Sir Robert
 Vyner for £5500, being part payment of £81,978 9a. l ld., the charge
 for making the Regalia and different gold and silver ornaments,
 destined as presents at the Coronation of Charles the Second, lends
 additional and powerful weight to the presumption, that all the plate
 belonging to Charles the First was destroyed.
      The receipt speci<U+FB01>es the various articles made, among which are
 no less than “ Eighteen Mares, and divers other parcells of guilt and
 white plate."        It is worthy of mention, that this receipt was found
 by Mr. Robert Cole among the documents sold in l838 by the then
 Lords of the Treasury as waste paper! ! It forms the subject of                    I
 short communication made to the Society of Antiquaries in 1841,
 and printed in the 29th volume of the Archaeologist.

     You are but too right in your ides of the modern character of our Rcgslis.
  Whether as an Englishman, a Royalist, an Historian, or as a Gentlenmn, or in all
  these capacities, you must grieve over the wicked snnihilstion of its ancient me
  morials. The barbarous spirit which descended on the French rcvolutionists,
  when they destroyed even the tombs and the bones of their ancient monarchy,
  actuated our Puritans to break up and sell the old Crown Jewels of England.
     The two Jewel Houses (for then there were two, the upper and the lower) were
  betrayed by my predecessors, Sir Henry and Mr. Carew Mildmsy, in 1649, snd
  their precious contents transferred to the Usurpcr.     The most shsmcful psrt of
  this a<U+FB02>iicting transaction was the breaking up of King Alfred's wirework gold
  <U+FB01>llagree crown, and selling it for the weight of the metal and what the stones
  would feteh.
      A new Regalia was ordered st the Restoration, to which additions or alterations
  have been made as requisite, constituting that which is now in my charge.

     Between the period when the new Commonwealth Mace was <U+FB01>rst
 used and the 23rd of April 1653, the date of the celebrated dissolu
 tion, the Journals of the Commons frequently allude to the new Mace ;
and as there is no record whatever of any other Mace having been
 ordered, we can arrive at no other conclusion, than that this was
the celebrated Mace mentioned in all histories of this period as the
 " Bauble," so called by Cromwell when he dissolved the Parliament.
That the Mace was turned out of the House of Commons admits of
no doubt, as all historians agree on the point, the only discrepancyr
being, that some say Cromwell ordered a musketeer to take away
that “ fool's Bauble," pointing to the Mace; and others, that when
all the Members had left the House, the doors were locked, and the
Key with the Mace carried away by Colonel Otley.
     It will not be out of place to mention here, that West's famous
picture of the Dissolution of the Long Parliament represents Crom
well in the act of pointing to the Mace as he uttered the words,
“ Take away that foo1’s Bauble ; " and it is important to state, that
the Mace, which occupies a most prominent position in the centre of
the picture, agrees perfectly in its appearance with the description
given of it in the Parliamentary History and Whitelock's Memorials,
being nearly destitute of ornament, and without the Crown and
Cross.
     Had we no further evidence, the foregoing extracts from authentic
documents would su<U+FB02>ice to prove that the Mace turned out of the
House of Commons by Cromwell was not that subsequently given
to the Royal Society by Charles the Second, which di<U+FB02>ers totally in
i-ts appearance from the Mace made for the Commonwealth Parlia
ment, and, as we have seen, used by the House of Commons from
1649 to 1653.         And when we re<U+FB02>ect, that immediately after the
King's    execution,   orders were issued to pull down, erase, and de
stroy every vestige of Royalty throughout the length and breadth of
the land*, it is absurd to imagine that the individuals giving such
orders, and exacting their most rigid execution, should, for a period
of upwards of four years, have sat around a table on which lay a
Mace, bearing not only the Royal Arms in the most conspicuous
manner, but also a Crown and the letters C. R. four times re
peated; and this they must have done to make the story true, that
the Mace given to the Royal Society by Charles the Second is
the famous “ Bauble."
     “The sacred Mace," as it has been called by some historians,
though so rudely expelled from the House of Commons, was, strange
as it may seem, preserved and soon restored to its high o<U+FB02>ice ; for on
the 7th of July 1653, only three days after the assembling of Crom
well's <U+FB01>rst Parliament, the Journals of the Commons state, that the
                             “
Sergeant-at-Arms was Ordered to repair to Lieut.-Col. Worseley
for the Mace, and to bring it to this House ; and on the same day it
    * The Journals of the Commons state, that the King's Arms over the Speaker's
Chair were taken down, and those of the Commonwealth substituted, immediately
after the execution of Charles the First.

                                         - -¢\|
was referred to a Committee to consider the use of the Mace, and
with whom it shall remain, and report their opinion to the House'."
   On the l2th of July the above Committee reported, that "the
                                           "
Mace should be made use of as formerly;      upon which the House
resolved, " That the Mace shall be used in the House as formerly;
and it was ordered that the Mace be brought in, which was done
accordinglyf."
  From this period to the Restoration, there is no record of a new
Mace having been ordered; and hy the Journals of the Commons it
appears that the Mace was used on all occasions as heretofore, and
sometimes even carried before the Speaker, when he went at the
head of the House to attend service at St. Margaret's Church, on
the days appointed for solemn fasts.
    The Restoration, which put an end to every outward manifesta
tion of republicanism, terminated the existence of the Common
wealth Mace; indeed as much haste was shown to get rid of it, as
was evinced after the execution of the late King in the ejection of
the Royal Mace.
    On the 27th of April l660, the Journals of the Commons state,
that E. Birkhead, Esq., late Sergeant-at-Mace, was " Ordered forth
with to deliver the Keys of the House, and the Mace belonging to
                                      " and
the House to Sergeant Northfolk ;            on the 21st of May it was
resolved},   "  That two new Maces be forthwith provided, one for this
 House, and the other for the Council of State, with the Cross and
 King's Majesty's Arms, and such other ornaments as were formerly
 usual; and it was referred to the Council of State to take care that
 the same be provided accordingly§."
     Here we have additional evidence that the Royal Society's Mace
 and the
           " Bauble " are not identical, for we <U+FB01>nd the House of Com
 mons ordering, a month before the Restoration, a new Mace, which
 is to be decorated "with the King's Arms, Cross, and other orna
 ments as were formerly usual."
     Having thns clearly ascertained that the Mace presented to the
 Royal Society by Charles the Second is not that expelled from the
 House of Commons by Cromwell, I turned my attention to discover,
 if possible, the history of the Mace belonging to the Royal Society.
     It will be remembered that the Archives of the Society throw no
 light whatever upon this important point, nor is the Mace even de
 scribed      It merely stated, that was sent from the Jewel House
              1|.    is                       it

     5 The Mace at present in the House of Commons corresponds in appearance to
the above description, and is,    I  have every reason to believe, that made at the
Restoration;        it very much like the Mace in the possession of the Royal Society,
                         is
with the exception that the chasing and ornaments are executed in       a much coarser

 my friend Sir Henry Ellis, I addressed a letter to Edmund Lenthal
 Swifte, Esq., Keeper of H. M. Jewel House, requesting permission
 to search the Archives, which I presumed were kept in that o<U+FB02>ice.
 In reply l received the following letter :—
                                                   Her Majesty's Jewel House,
                                                         March 13, 1846.
       Dana SIR,
    It would have much grati<U+FB01>ed me to aid the wishes of any friend
 of Sir Henry Ellis.
    On your account too, your name and o<U+FB02>ice would have been more
 than su<U+FB02>icient to claim attention.           But I can only regret my in
 ability in this matter. Since Edmund Burke's Bill, the Jewel House
 has undergone a radical change in its duties and functions.              Pre
 viously, its Chief had the charge and presentation of the Royal-gifts,
 whereof he had of course the accounts. Whatever entries there may
 be concerning the Mace, which was certainly given by Charles the
 Second to Lord Brouncker, as President of the Royal Society, in the
 old books of the Jewel House, they are most probably to be found
 in the Lord Chamberlain’s Of<U+FB01>ce, to whom the control of the Jewel
 House was transferred in (I believe) 1782.           Not a single record is,
 or ever was, in my hands.         Otherwise, to have accorded you fullest
 and freest access would have been to me an especial pleasure.
                                 I am, my dear Sir,
                                          Very faithfully yours,
                                                 Emumn LENTHAL Swrrra.
 C. R. Weld, Esq.
    The receipt of this letter caused me to write to the Lord Cham
berlain for permission to examine the Archives under his charge.
This was immediately granted, and with the kind assistance of the
 chief clerks in Lord Delawarr's O<U+FB02>ice, Ifortunately, after a long
 search in a gloomy and damp apartment, which was formerly a
 stable, found the original Warrant, ordering a Mace to be made for
 the Royal Society.
    The following is a copy of this most important and valuable docu
ment.     The book in which it exists is entitled, “ The Book of War
rants of the Lord Chamberlain, Edward, Earl of Manchester, of I.-Iis
Majesty’s Household, for the Years 1663, 4, 5, 6 & 7," and the
                                                                 "
Warrant is entered under the head of “ Jewell House :—
    “ A Warrant to prepare and deliver to the Rt. Hon. William
Lord Viscount Brouncker, President of the Royall Society of London,
for the improving of naturnll knowledge by experiments; one guilt
Mace, of one hundred and <U+FB01>fty oz.*, being a guift from His Ma"°
to the said Society."

Evelyn, presented the Society with a velvet cushion, whereon the Mace was laid
when placed before the President.

   This Wanant is among those issued in 1663, and as several pre
vious warrants exist, bearing the dates of January, February, March,
and April, and others entered subsequently are dated May, June,
and July. we may reasonably conclude, that the Warrant for making
the Society's Mace was issued early in I668; and this is strength
ened by the fact, that the Society received the Mace in the month
of August in the same year0.
   This discovery not only destroys the long-entertained belief, that
the Mace belonging to the Royal Society and the " Bauble" are
identical, but also affords conclusive evidence that the former was
made expressly for the Royal Society.
   On a minute examination of the Society's Mace, in order to de
tect, if possible. the maker's name or a date, neither of which exist,
I observed that the chasing on the stem consists entirely of Thistle
leaves and <U+FB02>owers: at the time this fact passed unnoticed, but it is
now evident that the Thistle was employed as the principal ornament
on account of its being symbolical of St. Andrew, the patron saint
of the Society, in whose honour the Fellows of the Society were
accustomed, at the early anniversary Meetings, to wear a St. An
drew's Cross in their hats                1'.
   This use of the Thistle          another proof that the Mace was made
                                          is
for the Society.
   In conclusion,       cannot forbear observing, that although the Mace
                        I
may not be as curious as before to the antiquary, divested as              now
                                                                            it
is of its <U+FB01>ctitious historical interest, yet           much more to be re
                                                      it   is
spected; for surely a Mace designated               "Bauble," and spurned
                                                      a
from the House of Commons by a Republican, would scarcely be an
appropriate gift from         Sovereign to the Royal Society.
                                 a
   The Mace in its possession was expressly made for the Society,
and given to       it by its Royal Founder; and the associations apper
taining   to  it, embracing the remembrance, that around           have been
                                                                    it

of science and truth.
     * Sincethe reading of this paper before the Society, Mr. Browell, the Chief
Clerk in the Lord Chamberlain's O<U+FB01>ice, has been so obliging as to inform me, that
the foregoing warrant      entered in another book of warrants, apparently
                            is                                              a  dupli
cite of that which  I saw.    The words of the warrant are similar to the above, but
there    the important addition of the date, May 23, 1663; thus con<U+FB01>rming my
          is
idea that the Warrant was issued in the early part of the latter year.

   “ On the Anatomy and Physiology of the Vascular Fringes in
Joints, and the Sheaths of Tendons."          By George Raincy, Esq.,
M.R.C.S. Communicated by John Simon, Esq., F.R.S., Assistant
Surgeon to the King's College Hospital, and Demonstrator of Ana
tomy in King's College, London.
   It has been generally believed that the folds of synovial me|n
brane which project into the articular cavities in the form of fringes,
contain merely globules of fat, and are subservient only to the me
chanical o<U+FB02>ices of <U+FB01>lling up spaces that would otherwise be left
vacant during the movements of the joints. By a careful examina
tion of their real structure with the aid of the microscope, the au
thor has found that they present an arrangement of vessels quite
peculiar to themselves, and bearing no resemblance whatever to
that of the vessels which secrete fat; together with an epithelium,
remarkable by its form and disposition, and characteristic of organs
endowed with the function of a special secretion.         He has traced
the presence of these synovial fringes in all cavities which contain
synovia; that is to say, not only in the joints, but also in the sheaths
of tendons, and in the bursae mucosae. When well-injected, they are
seen, under the microscope, to consist of two parts; namely, a con
volution of blood-vessels, and an investing epithelium.      These con
voluted vessels do not enclose, by their anastomoses, spaces like
those capillaries which secrete fat, and which are of a much smaller
size than the former; and the epithelial investments, besides en
closing separately each packet of convoluted vessels, sends off from
each tubular sheath secondary processes of various shapes, into
which no blood-vessels enter.         The lamina itself, forming these
folds and processes, consists of a very thin membrane studded with
<U+FB01>attish oval cells, a little larger than blood-corpuscles, but destitute
of nucleus or nucleoli; presenting none of the characters of tes

                                        622
 sellated epithelium, but corresponding more to what Mr. Goodsir
 has termed germinal membrane.               From all these facts the author
 concludes that the proper o<U+FB02>ice          of this structure is to secrete syno
 via; an o<U+FB02>ice which Clopton Havers had assigned to them as long
 ago as the year 1691, although his opinion has not been generally
 adopted by later physiologists.

     Contributions to Terrestrial Magnetism.             No. VII. By Lieut.
 Colonel Sabine, R.A., For. Sec. R.S.
     From the discovery which was made of the non-coincidence of
 the locality of the maximum magnetic intensity, within the Arctic
 circle, with that in which the magnetic direction is vertical, it fol
 lowed that the generally prevailing opinions respecting the distri
 bution of magnetic force at the surface of the earth were erroneous,
 and that even the broad outline of the picture of terrestrial mag
 netism required to be recast.          For the purpose of obtaining su.<U+FB02>i
 ciently copious and accurate materials, by means of which so de
 sirable an object could be accomplished, the British Association for
 the Advancement of Science requested, in the year 1835, a report to
  he prepared, in which the state of our knowledge, collected from a
 great variety of sources, with regard to the variations of the mag
 netic force at different parts of the earth's surface, should be re
 viewed, and               discussed, and suggestions offered as to the
 best means o properly
                  extending the inquiry.          In the report so obtained, it
 was recommended that magnetic surveys of that portion of the
'North American Continent, which is comprised within certain iso
 dynamic lines, should he procured. The present paper contains the
 results of an expedition towards the accomplishment of this object,
 recommended by the President and Council of the Royal Society
 to be undertaken under the auspices and with the assistance of the
  Hudson's Bay Company.           Lieutenant Lefroy, of the Royal Artil
 lery, who had received an appointment to the Toronto Observatory,

                                      62$
 with a special view    to this snrve\’,  wa' entrusted with the conduct
 of an   expedition in conformity with that recommendation.
     The author gives a circumstantial narrative of the expedition,
 together with minute details of the instruments employed, and the
 methods of observation ldopted; and extensive tables of the ob
 servations themselves, both as regards intensity and inclination, at
 the different stations where they were made, occupying altogether
 about 120 folio pages of manuscript.
     It results from the calculations founded on the data furnished by
 these observations, that the geographical position of the point of
 maximum intensity, where its amount is l'88, is 52° l9"8 north
 latitude, and 268°0l' longitude.       The angle which the major axis
 of the ellipse makes with the paralh-l of geographical latitude is
 57° 4-9"5; and the values of the selui-axes of the ellipse of P875
 are 290 and ll0 geographical miles rc‘pcelivcly.

     “ An Account of the desquamation and change of colour in A
 Negro of Upper Guinea, West Africa."           By the Rev. Thomas S.
 Savage,   M.D.,  Corr. Member   of  the Boston  Natural History Society,
&c. Communicated by Richard Owen, Esq., F.R.S.
    The subject of this narrative, named Tahtoo Duari, is a member
of the Grebo tribe, the aboriginal inhabitants of Cape Palmas and
its vicinity. His parents were members of the same tribe and
natives of the same region.        The father was of a decidedly black
complexion,     while the  mother   was what is termed yellow, the two
extremes observable in the tribe, and between which there is found
every variety of shade. In March 1844-, when about twenty-<U+FB01>ve
years of age, Tahtoo was attacked with a quotidian ague, having
previously been in perfect health.        The febrile symptoms subsided
in the course of a week, but were followed by a general desqua
mation of the cuticle, leaving the subjacent skin ofa dingy yellow
hue.     A month afterwards, the same process, preceded by a similar
febrile attack, recurred, and was followed by still greater whiteness
  ofthe newly-formed skin, resulting in the complete conversion of a
negro to a white man, retaining the characteristic features and hair
of an Ethiopian. This change was accompanied with great sensi
bility in the skin to the heat of the sun and of <U+FB01>re, exposure to
which readily excited irritation, and even in<U+FB02>ammation; but the
general health soon became completely re-established.              ln the
course of three months, subsequently to this change, numerous
spots of a chestnut-brown colour made their appearance, <U+FB01>rst on the
wrists, then on the back of the arms, head and neck, and succes
sively on the other parts of the body, forming by their extension
dark patehes of various sizes; which, being scattered over the

                                  624
whole surface, presented a singularly mottled appearance; and as
the black colour became predominant, the white portions of the
skin seemed like patehes of irregular shape formed in the natural
negro skin.    With the colour of the skin, that of the hair, which
had also become white, has been gradually restored to its former
black hue.    During this process of return to the natural colour the
health has been remarkably good.

   “On the Physiology of the Human Voice."           By John Bishop,
Esq., F.R.S.
   After premising a brief description of the system of organs which
are subservient to the voice, the author proceeds to consider the
several theories which have been devised to account for its various
modi<U+FB01>cations.    These theories have, for the most part, been founded
on the laws which regulate the vibratory movements of stretehed
membranous surfaces; and the investigation of those laws has ac
cordingly occupied the attention of many eminent mathemati
cians, such as Euler, Bernoulli, Riccati, Biot, Poisson and Her
schel; but it is a subject requiring the most profound analysis, and
involving the resolution of problems of much greater complexity
than the laws of the vibrations of either strings or bars.     The as
sumptions which are necessary in order to bring the subject within
the reach of analysis, namely, that the membrane is homogeneous
in its substance, and of equal thickness and elasticity throughout its
whole extent, are at variance with the actual conditions of the vocal
organs, which are composed of tissues differing in thickness, density
and elasticity, and of which the tension is indeterminate; circum
stances which present insuperable obstacles to the attainment of a
 mathematical theory of their vibrations.
    The author, after giving a critical account of the experiments
 made by Blot, Willis, Muller, Cagniard la Tour and De Kempelin
 on the vibrations of membranous laminae, examines the various
 actions of the vocal organs during the production of the more sim
ple tones; and considers more especially the of<U+FB01>ce of the vocal
ligaments, in regulating the piteh of the voice, which he considers
as resulting from variations in their length and tension conjointly.
By applying to the chordae vocales the formulae of vibrating cords,
he traces the in<U+FB02>uence which is exerted on their movements by the
mucous membranes; and <U+FB01>nds that they obey, to a certain extent,
                                                          r
the laws of vibrating strings.
   The analogy between the action of the glottis and that of a reed is
next examined, and an opinion expressed that the movements of the
glottis in the vocalization of the sound, partake of the nature of the
reed, during the partial opening and shutting of the rima-glottidis.

                                    625
    The author next investigates the acoustic relations between the
actions of the glottis and that of the vocal pipe. and the acoustic
effects of <U+FB02>exible membranous tubes on a column of uir vibrating
within it, and <U+FB01>nds that the structure of the trachea and of the soft
parts above and below the larynx is adapted to vibrate synchro
nously with any note that may be formed in the larynx.          The fal
setto voice may be produced either by the partial closing of the
glottis, or by a nodal division of the vocal chords; the piteh of the
sound in the production of this peculiar modi<U+FB01>cation of the voice,
being such that the column of air in the vocal tube is of the precise
length requisite to vibrate in unison with the larynx.     The inquiry is
further extended to the sources of the various tones of the voice
in singing, such as the bass, tenor, contrallo, and uprano; together
with their subdivisions of barylone. mezzo-soprano, and soprano
sfogato; and to the places which they occupy in the musical scale.
Independently      of the falsetto, the compass of the natural voice
rarely   exceeds  two  octaves; although in some cases. as in those of
Malibran and Catalani, it may extend even beyond three. The
voice in singing is modulated by the contraction or relaxation of
the velum, uvula and fauces. The author lastly adverts to the at
tempts that have, at various times, been made by the Abbé Mical,
Faber, Kratzenstein, De Kempelin, Willis, Wheatstone and others,
to imitate articulate sounds by mechanism.
     Having thus examined the human voice as resulting from the
 vibration of membranous ligaments, in obedience, <U+FB01>rst, to the laws
 of musical strings; secondly, to those of reeded instruments; and
thirdly, to those of membranous pipes; he arrives at the conclusion,
 that the vocal organs combine, in reality, the actions of each of
these instruments, and exhibit in conjunction, the perfect type of
every one of them.

     “ The Electric Fluid."    By W. F. Stevenson, Esq., F.R.S.
     The author denies the existence of two electric <U+FB02>uids, and main
 tains that all the phenomena are explicable on the hypothesis of a
 single <U+FB02>uid; which when present in a conducting body renders it
 positive, and in a non-conducting body, negative; but a body which
  is naturally a conductor, may, he asserts, be rendered otherwise, by
 changing its form.

 days of the month of June 184-6."         By George I-Iunsley Fielding,
  M.D., F.R.S.
     On Sunday the 7th of June I84-6, the thermometer in the shade
  rose to the extraordinary height of 94-° Fahr., exceeding by one de

                                 626

the highest on' record in this country.
   “ On the relative ‘dynamic value of the Degrees of the Compass;
and on the Cause of the Needle resting in the Magnetic Meridian."
By Sir Graves C. Haughton, K.H., M.A., F.R.S., Foreign Associate
of the Institute of France.
   By ascertaining the distances at different azimuths at which a bar
magnet placed with its axis directed to the centre of a magnetic
compass needle caused the needle to assume the position in which
its axis was in the same line with that of the magnet, the author
found that these points of distance form a peculiar curve, which was
nearest to th'e centre of the magnet at the east and west azimuths,
and receded from it as it advanced to the north and south ; and was
twice the distance from it at the north than at the south azimuths.
From this and other experiments he infers that the value of every
degree of the compass is inversely as the square of the length of the
ordinate or co-ordinate passing through       the abscissa being con-
                                            it,
sidered as zero; and that the magnetic needle does not rest in the
magnetic meridian in consequence of polar attraction, but         isim
pelled in that direction by the effect of repulsion, from the east or
west, and that its natural position    isthe result of an equilibrium
between the eastern and western repulsions.         On the other hand,
the return of the needle, when   it    placed in the reverse position,
                                      is
that  is,when made to deviate 180° from its natural position,     isthe
result of an attraction towards the east and west positions; the force
of attraction in that case being quadruple the force of repulsion in
the former case.     He consequently led to the conclusion that the
                        is
operation of terrestrial magnetism    totally different from that of an
                                      is
arti<U+FB01>cial magnet, in which latter case the attractive and repulsive
forces are exactly equal.
  “ Remarks   on the Extractive Material of Urine, and on the Ex
cretion of Sulphur and Phosphorus by the Kidneys in an unoxidized,
state."  By Edmund Ronalds, Ph.D., Giessen.     Communicated by
Golding Bird, M.D., F.R.S.
   In the course of an experimental inquiry in which the author
was engaged with    a   view to ascertain whether larger quantities of
carbon were discharged by the kidneys in cases in which the func
tions of the lungs or liver were imperfectly performed, he was led
to the result, that sulphur, not combined with oxygen in the form of
sulphuric acid, existed in the urine to the amount of from three to
<U+FB01>ve grains in the course of day; and also that phosphorus, not in
                             a
the state of phosphate, was in the same period excreted    by   the same
channel, to the extent of nearly six grains.
  “ On some
             peculiarities of Foetal Digestion." By George Robin
son, M.D. Communicated by William Bowman, Esq., F.R.S.
  The author endeavours to show, contrary to the assertions of Dr.
Robert Lee, that the human f(etus, in common with that of all the

                                    627
higher animals, invariably      contains, during the latter periods of
intra-uterine life, albuininons or nutritious matter, which undergoes
digestion in the small intestines.     lle <U+FB01>nds that the nature of this
substance varies very much in different animals.          in the earlier
periods of foetal life, the stomaeh contains very little, if any, nutri
rious matter.    Hc is disposed to con-ider the salivary glands as the
source of the albuminous matter found in the stomach at later
periods.
   “ Extracts of Letters from Captain Williams, <U+FB01>rst Assistant to the
Commissioner of Arracan, and from Ensign Haukeu and Mr. Howe,
Marine Assistant Commissioner, giving details of a curious pheno

Mahon, F.R.S., Pres. S.A.
   The appearance in question, seen between <U+FB01>ve and six o'clock in
the evening of the 2nd of December 184-5, was that of a large <U+FB02>ame
far out at sea, <U+FB02>ickering several times for <U+FB01>fteen and twenty minutes,
and suddenly ceasing.       It was conjectured to have been either a

for determining the question.
    “ On the Fossil Remains of the soft parts of Foraminifera dis
covered in the Chalk and Flint of the South-east of England."         By
Gideon Algernon Mantell, Esq., LL.D., F.R.S.
   By subjecting small portions of calcareous rock to the action of
diluted hydrochloric acid, the calcareous earth and the shells it had
enveloped were removed; the residue consisting of particles of
quartz and of green silicate of iron; and also numerous remains of
the soft parts of animalcules, chie<U+FB02>y Xanthidia and Rotaliae.        The
organization of the latter appears, from the observations of Ehren
berg, to be very simple, and to have no relation with the Cephalo
poda, as was formerly imagined.        The lmdy is enclosed within the
shell, which is polythalamous, and it occupies not only the outer cham
ber, but also all the cells contemporaneously, and the shell is pierced
all over with minute pores, through which tentacula protrude; and
there are also several soft transparent feelers, or pseud(podia, which
are instruments of locomotion.      When the shell is removed by acid,
the soft body is exposed, and is seen to extend to the innermost
chamber; and there is a connecting tube occupying the place of
the siphuncle of the nautilus, but which is the intestinal canal; for
the cells are the receptacles of the digestive sacs or stomachs, in
which monads, naviculae, and other minute infusoria, which the ani
mal had swallowed, may sometimes be observed.           In the fossil re
mains, the appearance of the parts which the author supposes to be
the digestive organs, is that of a series of bladders or sacs, composed
of a tough <U+FB02>exible integument, and connected by a tube. These
organs are more or less <U+FB01>lled with a dark substance; those which
are distended are always well-de<U+FB01>ned, while the empty ones are col
lapsed and disposed in folds, just as membranous pouches would
appear under similar conditions.        The sacs regularly diminish in

                                   628
 size from the outer to the innermost cell, and vary in number from
 fourteen to twenty-six.     In some instances, small papillae are ob
 servable on the external surface of the integument, which are pro
 bably vestiges of the bases of the pseudopodia or tentacula.

     “ Microscopic Observations on the so-called Vesicular Vapours
 of Water as existing in the Vapours of Steam, and in Clouds," &c.
 By A. Waller, M.D. Communicated by P. M. Roget, M.D., Sec. R.S.
     From some experiments, of which the author published an ac
 count in the Philosophical Magazine of last February, he was led
 to conclude that the opaque vapours of condensed steam consist of
 minute globules or spherules of water, and not of small vesicles, as
 is implied in the generally received theory, according to which this
 condition of water is designated by the term vesicular vapour.       In
 the present paper, he relates a set of experiments con<U+FB01>rming by mi
 croscopic observation his views of the globular condition of the par
 ticles of opaque vapours; premising a short retrospect of the opi
 nions of Sir Isaac Newton, Halley, Kratzenstein, and De Saussure
 on this subject.   Finding it impossible to observe the globules with
 any high magnifying power while they are at liberty to move, the
 author adopted the plan of <U+FB01>xing the condensed vapours arising
 from the breath or other sources, in some liquid, such as oil, which
 has no a<U+FB02>inity with water.      Of the many vehicles which he has
 tried, he <U+FB01>nds Canada balsam to be that which is best adapted for
 these observations.    By breathing with a little force on a slip of
 glass previously covered  with a thin layer of balsam, the vapours of
 the breath are not only condensed on its surface, but penetrate be
neath, where they may be recognised in opaque streaks of a white
colour, and where they remain stationary for more than an hour;
 or, if covered with another thin piece of glass or talc, for a much
longer period.     These streaks are decomposed under the micro
scope into minute globules perfectly spherical, like shot, or the glo
 bules of mercury.    The author describes, at some length, the various
appearances presented under different circumstances, and with dif
ferent oily <U+FB02>uids; and gives drawings of these appearances as exhi
bited by the microscope.
    “ Experiments relative to Animal Temperature, showing that there
must be some source of animal heat besides the combustion of the
Carbon and the Hydrogen contained in the Food of Animals." By
Robert Rigg, Esq., F.R.S.
    The subject of these experiments was alabouring man in the em
ployment of the author, living on his ordinary food, and working
at his usual employment.      A strict examination was instituted into
the quantity and chemical constituents of the ingesta and egesta
during ten days; at the end of which time he had gained one pound
in weight.    He infers from the results of this experiment, that the
carbon and hydrogen contained in the food of animals, which enter

                                            629
into combination with the rcspired oxygen. forming carbonic acid
and water, do not generate su<U+FB02>icient heat for the purposes of animal
life; and that consequently there must be some other sources of
heat in the animal economy, one of which he believes to be the
secretion of carbon.

   In the prosecution of his inquiries on the physiological action of

    1. The passage of the electric current through          mixed nerve pro
                                                                  a

tially in degree, according to the direction of the current through
the nerve.      This excitability      weakened and ultimately
                                       is
and this takes place more or less rapidly according as destroyed;  the irect

                      pf
is, from the penphery to the centre, or the am.-ene current, the ex
citability is   preserved and increased.

the passage of the current, tend to disappear more or less rapidl oi|                      '

‘according to the movements of the magnet, but to a much greater
 extent, impinges on highly sensitive photographic paper, wound
 round a horizontal cylinder, which is made, by a wateh movement,
 to revolve once in twelve hours.      Thus, by a combination of the

      GENTLEMEN,
IT is with the deepest concern that I have to commence my address
to you by expressing my regret that death has deprived your Coun
cil and myself of the services of one who has ever been most zealous
for the promotion of your interests,—I need not say that speak of      I
the late lamented Dr. Bostock.
   During the last twelvemonth your Council have been unremitting
in its attention to its duties, and I therefore beg leave to tender to
them your thanks.
    The year that has just elapsed has been a very important one in
the annals of science, both at home and abroad.                On the continent
it has been remarkable for the discoveries of M. Schiinbein, M. Le
Verrier and M. Gall, while the researches and calculations of M.
Méidler, if con<U+FB01>rmed and accredited by other astronomers, lead to
 results of such an extraordinary and gigantic character as to throw
other discoveries into comparative shade *.
    At home we have the observations already made by Lord Rosse’s
unequalled telescope, the continuation of the bright line of research
pursued by our illustrious Faraday, and the remarkable discovery of
 a younger chemist, Mr. Grove, who I trust has still a long course
 of scienti<U+FB01>c glory to run. From the Polar region I hope also that
the year 1846 may not have been unfruitful in important geogra
phical discovery.
   * The discovery of the planet Astraea should also have been mentioned, though
not pointed out by previous calculations like that indicated by M. Le Verrier.

                                          635
    In the sister sciences of Geology and Pahcontology, the same year
has seen issue to       light one of the most important works that has ap
peared for a great length of ti|nr,—l mean the great work on the
Geology of Russia, by which, assistetl by the two companions of his
travels, the President of the British Association, Sir Roderick Mur
chison, has crowned his Silurian labours.
   In the department of palmontology we have also seen the com
mencement of the able and splendidly illustrated description of those
extraordinary and gigantic extinct Mammalin, with which the libe
rality of Major Cautley has enriched our national collection at the
British Museum.            ln the same department we have seen that which
has been hitherto little more than the instrument of amusement, an
amusement it is true well-worthy of a great naval people, I mean a
yacht, converted into the means of adding largely to our knowledge
of the marine zoology of the British seas. As President of the prin
cipal Scienti<U+FB01>c Society in England, I think it right to express the
thanks of science to Mr. l\rlacAndrew, for the liberality, of which
Professor Edward Forbes has made such good use, and more espe
cially for the example thus set to others. This, Gentlemen, is an in
stance among many that might be found, of the utility, for the pur
pose of extending science itself, of spreading even among those who
 do not absolutely pursue it themselves, the feeling of its real in
 terest and importance.           It is a proof that the rich and the powerful
 can, from time to time, advance knowledge by holding out n help
 ing hand to its active cultivators.
     Within a few days, Gentlemen, you have seen revived the ancient
 and time-honoured custom of the delivery of the Bakerian Lec
 ture.     I regret that this custom had slumbered for several ycars,
 and rejoice at the success which attended it in the able hands of
 Mr. Grove, aided no doubt by the very interesting nature of the
 communication which he had to make to us.                  I hope we shall not
 again   suffer   it to  fall into  desuetude.
     It has occurred, Gentlemen, to myself and to your Council, that
 many of the Members of the Physiological Committee, owing to
 their imperative professional duties, have not their time so much at
 their own disposal as those of the other scienti<U+FB01>c committees.             We
 have therefore thought it right to add to the numbers of the mem
 bers of that particular committee, as it is evident that it ls import
 ant that it should have a respectable attendance whenever it has to
 discharge the duties entrusted to its care.
     In the <U+FB01>nancial statement that has been laid before you, you will
 see that the expenditure on our Transactions                this year has been
 larger   than   for several years     that have lately elapsed. The average
 expense     for  the   last <U+FB01>ve years has been 750 pounds; for the last
 ten about     a   hundred a year more.         For this year, including a vo
 lume of Magnetical Observations now in the press, lt will amount
 to about £1400, of which however we have reason to expect that
 about £200 will be repaid to us by the Government.                    This will
 leave about £1200.
     This, Gentlemen, is a large sum, and probably for some years it

                                    634
may not be very materially less; I do not think however that this
ought to be any matter of regret.       If  we have the means we can
not put them to     a nobler  use, or one more  consonant to the wishes
of our illustrious   Founder.
     Gentlemen, we must remember that, though we are a Royal So
 ciety, our true glory does not rest on our Royal Foundation, nor on
 Royal Patronage.      Nor does it rest on the names of the illustrious
nobles, of the eminent statesmen, or of those distinguished in art or
literature who may have given lustre to the lists of our Members.
 Nor yet does it arise from the array of foreign philosophers, who
 have considered that it is a desirable reward of their discoveries to
 be Honorary Members of our body.           Nor even does it rest on the
great lights of science, either still burning, or extinguished in death,
 who belong, or who have belonged to our Society.       N0, Gentlemen,
 our true glory must be chie<U+FB02>y found in our scienti<U+FB01>c utility,—in the
 manner in which we have ful<U+FB01>lled our duties and promoted the ob
jects of our Founders, and more especially must we look for our true
 title of honour in our Transactions.
     I regret, Gentlemen, that it is not in my power to announce to
 you any de<U+FB01>nitive arrangement by which our Anniversary should be
 held at a more genial and convenient season of the year,—at a time
when we might expect a larger concourse of our Members to witness
 the bestowal of our Medals, to listen to an account of those Fellows
 whose loss we have reason to deplore, to attend to the statement
 of our <U+FB01>nances, and lastly, to take a part in the important constitu
 tional duty of electing the O<U+FB02>icers and Council for the ensuing year.
 This important object has not been absent from the thoughts and
 deliberations of your Council. In the course of those deliberations
 changes in the mode of electing Fellows, and other alterations have
 been suggested, requiring mature consideration and discussion.       In
 consequence of these delays I have it not at this moment in my
 power to announce to you any de<U+FB01>nite arrangement.
     Gentlemen, I am now arrived at the most agreeable part of my
 Presidential duty,—the pleasant task of acknowledging and confer
 ring honorary rewards on scienti<U+FB01>c merit. I regret, Gentlemen, that
 in conferring one of these Medals on a distinguished foreigner, we
 are not to have present the discoverer of the new planet; I rejoice
 however that he is on this occasion to be represented by the son of
 another illustrious foreigner, the native subject however of our own
 Sovereign, and become an Englishman by his residence, and still
 more by his scienti<U+FB01>c discoveries in England, and himself the dis
 coverer of one of the most distant of the sister worlds, who travel
 round the same <U+FB01>xed star as we do. It is an interesting fact to us on
the present occasion that it is to the slight disturbance of the motion
of the planet Herschel, that we owe our knowledge of the planet
                                                          I
Le Verrier. From the courtesy due to a stranger, am sure you
will think me right, before bestowing the Medals on our own Fara
 day and Owen, that I summon to my side the representative of Le
 Verrier.

                                  635
       Sin JoHn HznscnsL,
   I  have great pleasure in committing to your charge this Medal,
which    has been awarded by the Council of the Royal Society to
M. Le Verrier. It is well-deserved by the genius that foresaw the
result, and the persevering calculations that enabled M. Le Vcrrier
to predict the exact quarter of the heavens where a new planet must
pursue its course in obedience to those                laws by which the
Almighty governs the universe. There general. I. Gall's telescope enabled
him to verify the calculations of the young French astronomer, and
other observers have since witnessed the existence ofthis new member
of the solar system. Astronomy does not merely owe to M. Le Ver
rier the knowledge of this new companion of those planets who were
known to man already, but it also owes to him a bright con<U+FB01>rma
tion of the truth of the Newtonian theory itself,—a con<U+FB01>rmation
that must speak convincingly to the most sceptical and the most
ignorant, if indeed in this case there be any other scepticism than
that of ignorance.
    I will not deny that it would have been very agreeable to me to
have given this Medal to an Englishman: but if the English science
that, unknown to M. Le Verrier, had nearly caught the prize, was
not quite in time to do so, if I say this discovery was not made by a
countryman of Newton, I cannot grudge it to one of the same na
tion that has produced a Laplace and an Arago.           I wish to M. Le
Verrier every success in his scienti<U+FB01>c pursuits.          I rejoice in the
honour that a grateful country has bestowed upon him, and I trust
that between his country and my own there may be no other con
test than a generous emulation to surpass each other in the great
achievements of peace, and in the cultivation of art, literature and
 science.
       Mr. FARADAY,
    It is an unusual honour that I have to announce to you to-day,
and it is with unusual pleasure that I do so.
    The Council of the Royal Society has adjudged to you two
 Medals, at the same time, for your late brilliant discoveries in the
universal action of electricity and galvanism.           If, however, the
 honour be unusual, such a long-continued sequence of scienti<U+FB01>c
 discovery, such 0. stream of electrical light, thrown as it were on
 the dark places of science by the genius and persevering energy of
 one man, is still more singular.    It is my agreeable duty to add,
 that in presenting you these Medals, I consider that I do so to one
to whom English science, and most especially the Royal Society, lies
 under the deepest obligations. The Royal Society was itself founded
 for the more extended and more accurate cultivation of natural
 knowledge, and while it can boast in its Transactions of such papers
 as those for which it is indebted to you, its prosperity must be re
garded as established on the surest basis.

                                             636
       Mr. Owen,
    It  gives me great satisfaction to announce that the Council has
awarded one of the Royal Medals to you for your very excellent
paper on the Belemnite.              It is a communication of the highest in
terest, at the      same     time    to  the geologist and the palaeontologist.
It describes and explains           the   nature of an extinct animal, one por
tion of whose frame            is  found largely existing in different strata,
while very slight indications of the remainder of its structure had
been known to the world till a very recent period.                        It adds to our
satisfaction, as an English Society, that the ample account of this
animal, given to us by your anatomical skill and experience, is de
rived from remarkable specimens, hitherto at least found in En
gland alone. Their discovery has been owing to the formation of
the Great Western Railway. In this instance, therefore, and pro
bably in many future ones, this gigantic instrument, the child of
modern engineering genius, is not only the means of rapid loco
motion to the traveller, but also carries forward with accelerated
speed the                  of physical science itself.
    I trust, Rgogress
              r r. Owen, that the Royal Society will have many future
 occasions for gratitude to you for interesting additions to the Phi
losophical Transactions.
    I  now proceed to the biographical notices of some of our deceased
Members.
    Jorm Bosrocx, M.D.,              has long occupied a distinguished station
 among the zealous           cultivators      of Animal Chemistry, Physiology,
 and other branches         of  Medical      Science.      His father had been esta
 blished as physician         at  Liverpool,     and   from   his great talents would
 probably have       risen  to  considerable      eminence,    had not these brilliant
 prospects    been    doomed      to  sudden     extinction    by an untimely death,
 before   he  had   attained     the   age   of thirty.    He   left an only child, the
 subject of the present           notice,   who   was   born   in  177-1', the year pre
 ceding that      fatal   event,    and   whose     early   education    was conducted
 at the New College         at   Hackney,      at  the  time  when   Dr.    Priestley was
 delivering lectures on chemistry. Having imbibed, under such able
 tuition, an ardent love of science, young Bostock was led to make
 choice of medicine as his profession.                    He studied at Edinburgh,
 where     he  graduated       in  the    year   1798,    and soon afterwards com
 menced practice        in  his  native    town.     The    activity of his mind was
 there displayed,       not  only   in  numerous       contributions     to most of the
 medical    and   scienti<U+FB01>cjournals,         but  also  in the  prominent part which
 he took     in  planning       and   establishing     various    charitable, scienti<U+FB01>c
 and literary    institutions,     and    more    particularly the Fever Hospital,
 and   the  Botanic     Garden;       and   also   the Philosophical and Literary
 Institution of Liverpool, where, in the capacity of Professor of Phy
 siology, he delivered the <U+FB01>rst course of lectures there given.
     Having secured a competent fortune, Dr. Bostock determined, in
 1817, to relinquish his profession and <U+FB01>x his residence in London,
 where he could possess more extensive means of prosecuting his

                                     637
favourite studies, and enjoy a more enlarged society of scicnlitic
friends.     He soon became an associate of most of the scienti<U+FB01>c so
cieties  of the metropolis, and an active labourer in their management.
In l8l8, he was elected a l'\'ll0w of the lloyal Society; was svverul
times placed on its Councils, and in 15:32, <U+FB01>lled the o<U+FB02>icc of \'icc
President. He was for some years Secretary of the Geological So
ciety, and in 1826 was                 its President. He long held the
oi<U+FB01>ce of Treasurer of the  appointed
                             . ledical and Chirurgical Society, and took
an active share in the management of the Fever llospital, not only
as a member of its Committee, but also as one of its House Direct
ors.    He was also, during a long period, one of the lecturers on
Chemistry at the Medical School of Guy's llospital, being appointed
to that o<U+FB02>ice on the death of his friend Dr. Marcct, in 1822.
    Amidst these multiplied public avocations, he found leisure for the
accomplishment of a great variety of literary and scienti<U+FB01>c labours,
the aggregate amount of which would appear astonishing to any
one who was not acquainted with his methodical habits, his perse
vering industry, and his advantageous employment of every portion
of his time. His contributions to medical and scienti<U+FB01>c journals,
transactions of societies and cyclopaedias, amount to no less than
sixty-nine; of which twenty arc contained in Nicholson's Journal
and A—nnals of Philosophy, eighteen in the .\ledico-Chirurgical Trans
actions, and twelve in the Cyclopedias of Practical Medicine, and of
Anatomy and Physiology. Only one paper by him appears in the
Philosophical Transactions (in 1829), namely, that “ On the spon
taneous puri<U+FB01>cation of the Thames \Vater," recording the observa
tions he made in the course of some analyses which he undertook
at the request of the Commissioners appointed by the Crown to
inquire into the supply of water to the metropolis.
    Some of the more <U+FB01>nished papers and essays which had appeared
in these works, were afterwards republished by him in a separate
form.     Among these are his “ Account of the History and present
state of Galvanism," originally published in Brewster's Cyclopaedia,
and which appeared in 1818; and his “ History of Medicine," which
had been pre<U+FB01>xed to the Cyclopedia of Practical Medicine.            One
of his earliest publications was an “ Essay on Respiration ;" his at
tachment to chemical pursuits having naturally led him to the par
ticular study of this part of the animal economy. At a later period,
he engaged in the compilation of a general work, embracing the
whole subject of physiology, which he completed in three volumes,
the last of which appeared in 1827, under the title of
                                                           “ lilementury
System of Physiology ;" the third and last edition, published in 1837,
comprised the whole in one thick octavo volume of nearly 900 pages.
It is a work of immense labour and research, containing condensed
and elaborate analyses of all that had at that time been published,
both as to facts and theories in the wide <U+FB01>eld of physiology. It con
stitutes, in fact, an Encyclopaedia of this department of medical
science, where the student will <U+FB01>nd indicated, with scrupulous ex
actness, the authorities for every statement, and the sources which
may supply him with whatever further information he might require

                    ‘
                                   638
on any particular     subject. After he had completed this work, he
                                         “ Natural
projected a new translation of Pliny's             History," to be ac
companied with notes ; in 1828 he printed, for private distribution,
a specimen of the work, consisting of the <U+FB01>rst and thirty-third
books; and he afterwards devoted a considerable portion of his
time to the prosecution of this undertaking, in which he had made
some progress at the time of his death.          For the last two or
three years his health had been declining, but the immediate cause
of his death was an attack of cholera, which proved fatal on the 6th
of August in the present year.
    Respected and beloved by a wide circle of friends and relatives,
his memory will long be cherished with affection by those who sur
vive, and with gratitude by the votaries of those sciences which his
labours have promoted and enriched.
   JoHN Consrmwrma CARPUE, who died in the beginning of the
present year, at the advanced age of eighty-two, was, during a long
period of his life, a distinguished teacher of Anatomy and Surgery.
His family had originally been Spanish, and attached to the Roman
Catholic Church. He himself was intended for the priesthood, and
with that view received the elements of his education at the Jesuits’
College at Douay. A youthful eagerness to see the world prompted
him, at the age of eighteen, to traverse the continent on foot, in
various directions, remaining much in France, where he had ample
opportunities of observing the state of society both before and after
the Revolution, and of being an eye-witness of many of the memo
rable scenes that occurred in Paris during the most critical epochs
of that eventful period. To the early impressions thus received, may
probably be traced the peculiar bent of his mind, which led him, in
after life, to engage largely in the political discussions of his own
country; and also his keen relish for travel, and especially for pe
destrian expeditions, in which, on his return to England, he often
indulged ; at times rambling over Wales, or the Highlands of
Scotland; and in later years, accomplishing, with his family, exten
sive tours through various parts of Europe.
    He was long undecided in his plans of life. After he had re
nounced the priesthood, he looked forward to succeed in the business
of a bookseller, his uncle, Mr. Lewis, who carried on that trade in
Great Russell Street, Covent Garden. He subsequently directed his
views to the law,and was preparing to embark in this new career, when
he was suddenly smitten with admiration for Shakespear, and resolved
to devote himself t'o the stage.    But his passion for acting having
cooled, he <U+FB01>nally determined to adopt the profession of Surgery;
and for that purpose commenced his medical studies at St. George's
Hospital, in which institution he served for some time as House
Surgeon. He afterwards received the appointment of Staff-Surgeon
to the York Hospital at Chelsea, where he remained twelve years;
at the end of which period he retired from this military duty, being
apprehensive of being ordered on foreign service; and was imme
 diately elected, in conjunction with Mr. Pearson, Surgeon to the

                                    639
National Vaccine Institution, an o<U+FB02>ice which he held during the
remainder of his life.
    The accidental circumstance of his being requested by n pupil
of the York Hospital to assist him in acquiring a knowledge of
anatomy, and of that pupil making rapid progress under his tuition,
suggested to him the idea of setting up as an anatomical lecturer.
His success as a teacher in that department far exceeded his most
sanguine expectations ; and his original mode, and impressive style
of instruction, soon procured him over<U+FB02>owing audiences. Every
year he delivered three courses of daily lectures, which courses suc
ceeded each other with no other intermission than a few days during
the summer season.       For a period of thirty-four years he pursued
this laborious career, which, as may easily be conceived, afforded him
scarcely any leisure for literary pursuits.      He has, however, left
behind him a few professional works.          In I801 he published a
“ Description of the .\luscles of the Human Body ;" in 1803, “ An
Introduction to Electricity and Galvanism, with cases showing their
effects in the cure of Disease ;" in 1816, " An Account of two suc
 cessful operations for restoring a lost Nose,"&c., and in 1819, “ The
 History of the High Operation for the Stone."
     Endowed by nature with a robust constitution, his life would
 probably have been prolonged for many years, had he not, whilc in
 travelling with his family, met with a disastrous accident, which
 proved immediately fatal to two of his servants. The severe injuries
 he received on that occasion gave a shock to his constitution from
 which it never entirely recovered, and on the 80th of January 134-6,
 he eventually sunk under repeated attacks of bronchitis.    In private
 life he was endeared to his family and friends by the strongest ties of
 affection, and he was eminently gifted with the happy art of winning
 the con<U+FB01>dence and attachment of his pupils.
    We have to lament the death of Hssnv G.u.i.YKmo|-|r,Esq.,whose
 high cultivation of mind and <U+FB01>ne feeling for the beauties of paint
 ing, sculpture and architecture, so well entitled him to be called an
 accomplished English gentleman, and whose valuable architectural
 works have done such good service to the study of our mediaeval
 architecture.   He was educated at Eton; thence he went to Trinity
 College, Cambridge, a little before the time of Byron's admission at
 the same College.     Their acquaintance began here, and was renewed
 in 1810, when Mr. Knight, in company with the Hon. Frederic North
 and Mr. Fazakerly, visited the most interesting provinces of the
 Turkish empire. The observations and impressions of their travels,
 he clothed in the form of Eastern Tales, under the titles of Ilderim,
  in four Cantos; Phrosyne, a Grecian talc; and Alarhtar, an Ara
  bian tale. They do not appear to have attracted very general atten
 tion at the time, though of one, which Mr. Murray sent in manuscript
  to Lord Byron, without however communicating        the name of the
 author, his Lordship decreed, “ There are many beautiful passages
  in the tale you sent me, and an interesting story. It must have been
 written by some one who had been on the spot, and 1 wish him, and

                                 640
he deserves, success." Subsequently these tales passed through four
editions.
   Mr. Knight many years afterwards published a dramatic poem
entitled “ Hannibal in Bithynia,” conceived, he tells us, many years
before at Brusa.     Fortunately, however, its author soon discovered
that towards History and Architectural Archaeology was his true vo
cation.    In 1831, he landed at Dieppe, and then began his tour in
Normandy, having engaged as his companion Mr. Richard Hussey,
an architect by profession, that he might, to use his own words,
“have the assistance of a practised eye to examine the construction
of the buildings and a practised hand to delineate their outline."
The result was a small octavo volume with plates, called “ An Ar
chitectural Tour in Normandy," a work of considerable research and
great nicety of observation, and so highly approved in France as to
be translated into the French language.        His next publication was
“ The Normans in Sicily," a kind of historical sequel to his Archi
tectural Tour, and, like  it,accomplished with an architect by his side,
and distinguished by diligent endeavours to arrive at truth. “ Ec
clesiastical Architecture of Italy, from the time of Constantine to
the <U+FB01>fteenth century," followed ;   a  splendid work in two vols. royal
folio, containing eighty-one litho-chromatic       plates by Mr. Owen
Jones, and prefaced by clever introduction from Mr. Knight's pen,
                        a
and probably the work on which his fame will rest. He lived to
publish no other, but the love of his favourite study remained with
him to the last; for at the time of his decease he was busy with     a
new work on architecture.        Mr. Knight was elected a Fellow of the
Royal Society   in  184-1
                      ;    he  was one of the Commissioners on the Fine
Arts; and represented North Nottinghamshire       in    Parliament since
1834.     He  expired   on the  9th of February, aged <U+FB01>fty-nine, at his
residence in Lower Grosvenor Street.
   In the death of Hononarus LEIGH THOMAs, Esq., the Royal
Society, as well as the Royal College of Surgeons, have to deplore
the loss of one of their oldest members.
   Mr. Thomas was one of the few remaining pupils of the celebrated
Mr. John Hunter, from whom he imbibed habits of assiduity, zeal
and industry, which characterized him through     a  long and arduous
professional career. The department of surgery having been chosen
as his profession, he became early associated with Mr. Hunter as
his dresser at St. George's Hospital, and through his recommen
dation was afterwards appointed assistant-surgeon to accompany
Lord Macartney on his important embassy to China in 1792. The
voyage was replete with interest, and proved most creditable to the
medical staff, whose services were highly estimated, not only by
members of the embassy and the ship's company, but also by the
troops quartered at Chusan, to whom at    acritical juncture most ac
tive assistance had been rendered.
   On the return of the embassy to this country an expedition was
<U+FB01>tting out against Holland, and Mr. Thomas’s tender of services to
accompany the army was accepted.         During the arduous duties

                                     64-l
which attended this ill-fated campaign, many of the wounded fell
into the hands of the enemy and were made prisoners of war.
Here the disinterested magnanimity of the young volunteer was
exhibited in his request to be allowed to remain to attend upon the
sick and wounded.         This laudable determination subjected him to
exertions and labouni of no ordinary kind, his services not only
being rendered available, in the most active sense, to his own coun
trymen, but to the enemy also.          llestored to his own country, Mr.
 Thomas became associated with Mr. Cruikshank in 1799, at the
 School of Anatomy in \\'indmill-street, where he gained great credit
as demonstrator.        About this time he had the honour conferred
 upon   him   of  being elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and be
 came a contributor to its Transactions.
    As connected with the lloyal College of Surgeons, .\lr. Thomas was
 admitted into the Council, and for many years was one of the Court
 of Examiners, an o<U+FB02>ice which he retained to the period of his retiring
 from practice. In this situation he displayed his innate kindness of
 heart, by his encouraging method ofexamining, which tended greatly
 to dissipate the nervous di<U+FB02>idence of those presenting themselves be
 fore this searching tribunal. In the usual routine, Mr. Thomas served
 the o<U+FB02>ice of President, and delivered the Hunterian Oration on the
  14th February, 1827.       For some years the disease of stone in the
 bladder   had   proved  a serious interruption to Mr. Thomas's comfort,
 and at the age of sixty-<U+FB01>ve became so intolerable that his profes
 sional friends acceded to his suggestion of undergoing the then
 new and ingenious method of crushing, which was accomplished in
 their presence, most skilfully, by the Baron Heurtaloup, and with
 the happiest result; a calculus, of very considerable size, having
  been pulverized and effectually removed with comparatively little
  or no pain.      This proved instrumental to renewed constitutional
 vigour and enjoyment to the age of seventy-<U+FB01>ve, when suspicious
 indications of a renewal of calculous formation created alarm, and
 determined Mr. Thomas to seek repose by retiring from professional
 anxiety, and on this occasion he received the thanks of the Council
 of the Royal College of Surgeons of England for his long and
 ef<U+FB01>cient services.
     Mr. Thomas's retirement enabled him to eujo domestic society,
 although suffering from gradually increasing infirmities, which led
  to the termination of his valuable life at the age of seventy-seven.
     The re<U+FB02>ection of having passed an active life in a profession and
  in a position which allowed of administering to the comforts and of
  meliorating the condition of suffering humanity, proved, in the in
  stance before us, a soothing balm to the departing spirit.
     Joim Tnomsou, M.D., one of the ablest representatives of the
  last generation of medical men, was Professor oi General Pathology
  in the University of Edinburgh, and died on the llth of October last,
  at his residence in the vicinity of that city, at the advanced age of
  eighty-two years.
     He was born in the town of Paisley in Renfrewshire, and in over

                                     642
 coming the impediments of an humble station, of straitened cir
 cumstances, and of a defective education, he early exhibited those
 vigorous intellectual powers which were afterwards so successfully ex
 erted in the acquirement of information and the promotion of science.
 His innate love of knowledge soon became apparent by the strenuous
 application of his mind, in succession, to various important objects
 of scienti<U+FB01>c interest. While yet a youth, and during the short in
 tervals of leisure, stolen from the servile drudgery of a medical ap
 prenticeship in his native town, he devoted himself with such energy
 and success to the study of Botany, as ever after to retain a lively
 interest in that pursuit.     Having completed his medical education
 in the Universities of Glasgow and Edinburgh, and in the medical
 schools of London, he settled, in the concluding years of the cen
 tury, as a general practitioner in Edinburgh.      He there delivered
lectures on Chemistry, and published a translation of Fourcroy’s
 Elements of that science, accompanied with valuable notes.
    Being appointed one of the Surgeons of the Royal In<U+FB01>rmary in
 the year 1800, he commenced his labours as a Teacher of Surgery,
and on the institution, at his recommendation, of a Professorship of
 Surgery in the Royal College of Surgeons, he was appointed to that
o<U+FB02>ice. It was on his representation that the injurious system which
then prevailed, of changing the surgeons at short intervals, was aban
doned, and the tenure of that o<U+FB02>ice rendered one of reasonable
duration; and that the delivery of Clinical lectures by the surgeons
in o<U+FB02>ice, of all modes of instruction the most valuable, was com
menced. To his counsel the College of Surgeons were indebted for
the foundation of a Museum of Anatomy, both healthy and morbid,
which, enriched as it has since been by many valuable collections,
now ranks second only to that of the Royal College of Surgeons of
England.
    For a period of sixteen years Mr. Thomson delivered the lectures
on Surgery in the Hall of the College to crowded auditories of
students and practitioners.      In the year 1806 he was appointed by
the crown Professor     of Military Surgery in the University of Edin
burgh, a chair which     had  been newly created by the government of
that period.
    The publication on which his permanent reputation rests bears
the title of “Lectures on In<U+FB02>ammation."       It appeared in 1813, and
was in effect a revival and masterly exposition of the views and doc
trines of John Hunter, which, partly from a de<U+FB01>ciency of perspi
cuity in that great man's style, and partly from the small degree of
attention which they had excited among the profession, had never
before obtained their due in<U+FB02>uence, nor had their truths been suf<U+FB01>
ciently recognised and established. It is a work which exhibits the
results of acute discrimination, unwearied ardour, persevering re
search, and a clear and careful method of argumentation.         It has
been   translated into many foreign European languages,    and speedily
became the standard authority on that important subject, consti
tuting as it does the basis of all Pathology.
    On the death of Dr. Gregory in 1821, Dr. Thomson resigned his

                                   64-3
surgical appointments, and having formerly graduated at King's Col
lege, Aberdeen, now joined the College of Physicians and practised
as consulting physician, commencing at the same time a course of
lectures on the practice of physic. This may be regarded ss the
second remarkable period of his professional career. The novel and
distinguishing feature of this course of lectures consisted in its being
founded on pathological anatomy, or the structural changes induced
by disease in the several tissues of the body, as auxiliary to the an
cient system of pure symptomatology.         To accomplish this object
in the most effectual manner, Dr. Thomson had recourse to the aid
of the draughtsman, and presented to the eye of the student accurate
coloured delineations of morbid appearances, arranged on anatomica
physiological principles, and accompanied by their corresponding
histories. The result of this spirited enterprise, prosecuted both
abroad and at home during a period of several years, and at a very
considerable pecuniary sacri<U+FB01>ce, has been n splendid collection of
anatomical drawings, surpassing all others at present existing in
richness and extent.
    In 1832, a Chair of General Pathology was added to the Univer
sity of Edinburgh, to which endowment the suggestions and the
 evidence of Dr. Thomson before a commission appointed by Lord
 Liverpool's government in 1826, materially contributed.        The sp
 pointment of <U+FB01>rst professor was conferred upon himself; but the
 pressure of advanced years and in<U+FB01>rm health unfortunately com
 pelled his retirement after he had held it for four years.
    At various times Dr. Thomson visited the British metropolis and
 the continent of Europe, chie<U+FB02>y for the purpose of personally exami
 ning their pathological collections; and after the battle of Waterloo
 he repaired to Brussels, in order to avail himself of the advantages
 which were afforded on that occasion of examining the nature and
 treatment of gun-shot wounds and <U+FB01>eld injuries.        The result of his
 observations he shortly afterwards published in a “Report of the
                          '
 wounded at Waterloo.
    To Dr. Thomson's spirit of independence, not less than to his
 ardent love of knowledge, the school of Edinburgh is specially in
 debted; for in addition to his active exertions in the foundation of
 Professorships, of a museum and of a library, and the establishment
 of a dispensary for visiting the poor in their own dwellings, he was
 ever watehful of its interests, and as fearless in denouncing usages
 which he considered prejudicial as he was prompt in suggesting and
 earnest in promoting bene<U+FB01>cial changes and reforms.        To the jea
 lousies which are ever engendered by merit, and by attempts at re
 form, and to the opposition he encountered from the magisterial
 authorities of the city, may be ascribed his failure of success when
 a candidate for the vacant chair of Dr. Gregory, although he was
 supported by overwhelming testimonials of superior claims from the
 most eminent medical men throughout Europe; and the same cause,
 together with the liberal bias of his political views and opinions, (for
 though he did not obtrude he never sought to conceal them) will
 also explain the anomaly, that although no professional opinion

                                    64-4'
was    more highly esteemed than his, yet he never attained to ex
traordinary popularity in practice. Some of the prejudices he had to
 contend against were the fruits of his scrupulous honesty, of the sim
plicity of his mind and manners, and of his hostility to every species
 of professional charlatanism in whatever quarter it was displayed.
 It can excite no surprise that he stood high in the estimation of his
many celebrated contemporaries of the Scottish metropolis, and that
he should have enjoyed a cordial and continued intimacy with such
 men as Stewart, Allen and Mackintosh. Associated with the pro
jectors of the Edinburgh Review, he was a contributor to some of
 the early numbers, of articles connected with medical philosophy.
 In other researches of science not strictly professional, Dr. Thomson
 evinced an erudition of greater extent and profundity than could
 have been attained by any individual not possessing his quickness
 of apprehension and unquenchable thirst for knowledge.
     The profession at large are perhaps scarcely aware of the extent
 of their obligations to Dr. Thomson.         Some however yet survive
 who can attest the peculiar   interest   he inspired in his pupils by his
 earnestness as a  teacher, and  the  enthusiasm    they imbibed from his
 precepts and cherished by his example. Unostentatious in his search
 after truth, he was neither so frequent or voluminous an avowed
 contributor to the common stock, as many men of much inferior
 talent; but he was continually engaged in fostering the spirit and
 directing the pursuits of others, of whom some have largely contri
 buted, in their riper years, to extend the boundaries of medical and
 surgical knowledge.
     The biography of Dr. Cullen, whose character he held in high
 veneration, occupied the years of his retirement.       The vigour of his
 faculties remained unimpaired to the last, and he contemplated with
 calm serenity the approaching end of a life devoted to the cultiva
 tion and improvement of the profession he had chosen,and of which
 he was a distinguished ornament.
     Astronomy has sustained a heavy loss, in the last year, by the
 death of BasseL.       Fansnaicn Wll.HELM BEsSEL was born at
  Minden, on the 22nd of July 1784. His father held a civil o<U+FB02>ice
 under the Prussian government, with the title of Justizratll, but
 his means were narrow and his family numerous; and at the age
 of <U+FB01>fteen the future astronomer began his career as an assistant
 or apprentice in a mercantile house in Bremen.           Having acquired
 a taste for Astronomy and Mathematics, he assiduously devoted his
 leisure time to the study of those sciences; and his progress was
 such that he soon attracted the notice and obtained the friendship
  of Dr. Olbers, then in the zenith of his fame. His <U+FB01>rst published
  essay, which appeared in Zach's 'Monatliche Correspondenz’            in
  1804, was a reduction‘of the observations made by Harriot and
  Torporley of the comet of 1607. ln communicating this paper to
  Zach, Olbers eulogised, in the warmest terms, the acquirements and
  industry of his young friend, and expressed his regret that so much
  talent and zeal, and such powers of calculation, should not have

                                      64-5
been acquired for the exclusive service of astronomy.           An oppor
tunity was soon found of making the desired acquisition; Bessel,
in 1806, becoming successor to llarding in the o<U+FB01>ice of assistant
to Schroeter, in the Observatory of Lilieuthal.          In this congenial
situation he rapidly acquired for himself a great reputation; and,
indeed, almost from the <U+FB01>rst, took his place as one of the best astro
nomers of Europe.          In l8lO, he was appointed professor of astro
nomy in Kiinigsberg; a post which he occupied during the re
mainder of his life, and over which his genius and labours have
thrown an imperishable lustre.
     The Observatory of Kiinigsberg, now so celebrated, owes not only
 its celebrity, but its existence to Bessel. The building was begun
 in  l8ll    under his direction.   It was <U+FB01>nished in l8l3; and the <U+FB01>rst
 published observations are dated in November of the same year.
 From 1815 the observations have been published regularly; accom
 panied by full descriptions of the different instruments successively
 employed, the elements of reduction, some valuable catalogues, and
 all the information necessary to inspire complete con<U+FB01>dence in the
 results.     This publication has exercised a powerful in<U+FB02>uence on the
 progress of practical astronomy.
     Bessel's scienti<U+FB01>c life is one of extraordinary fertility, and it is
 only a few of the more important of his productions which can even
 be alluded to in this brief notice.      His principal work, the ' Funda
menta Astronomiu-2,’ is peculiarly interesting to English astronomers,
 from the circumstance of its being founded on observations made at
 the Royal Observatory at Greenwich.          Bradley's observations, as is
 well known, were taken possession of by his representatives, and
 presented by them to the University of Oxford.              From various
  causes, their publication was not completed until 1805, forty-three
  years after the death of Bradley; and although some results and
  some imperfect catalogues had been deduced from them, the great
  mass of the observations still remained in a state in which they were
 nearly useless.     At the instigation of Olbers, Bessel undertook the
  formidable task of reducing the whole series. The reduction was
  commenced in the autumn of 1807, and, though frequently inter
  rupted by his other avocations and duties, it was never wholly laid
  aside till its completion in l8l8, in which year the 'Fundamenta'
  made its appearance.       Of this great work it would be di<U+FB02>icult to
  speak   in  terms  of  too  high praise.   Besides elaborate determina
  tions of all the principal elements of the reduction,—the errors
  of the instruments, the height of the pole, refraction, parallax,
  aberration, precession, proper motion,--it contains a catalogue of
  the mean places of 5222 <U+FB01>xed stars, observed between 1750 and
  1762 with the best instruments in existence at that time; and re
  duced to the epoch of 1755 with a precision and accuracy of which
  there was no previous example.        It now furnishes astronomers with
  the best existing means of determining all those data which can
  only be deduced from a comparison of observations made at consi
  derably distant intervals of time, and may be considered, in fact, as

                                   64-6
having laid the foundations of the principal improvements which
have been made in astronomy since the date of its publication.
    The ' Tabulae Regiomontanae,’ published in 1830, may be re
garded in some respects as a supplement to the ' Fundamenta.’
 This collection was undertaken with a view to facilitate the reduc
 tion of planetary observations, past and future, on a uniform system ;
 and it contains all the tables necessary for that purpose as Well as for
ordinary star-reduction, for the century to which it applies, founded
on elements derived from the comparison of Bradley's with Bessel's
own observations, together with the formulae for computation.          It
 is in daily use in every observatory, and has led to the general
adoption of a uniform and precise system of astronomical calcula
tion which has been attended with signal advantage to the science.
    The services rendered to astronomy by Bessel were not con
<U+FB01>ned to the observatory and the closet. In the course of a series
of experiments, undertaken in 1826, for the determination of the
length of the seconds’ pendulum, he detected and demonstrated
the existence of a cause of error in the usual reduction to a va
cuum, which, though it had long before been clearly pointed out by
Du Buat, appears to have been entirely overlooked and forgotten.
This consists in the fact that every oscillating body drags along
with it a certain portion of air, or of the <U+FB02>uid in which it moves,
so that the speci<U+FB01>c gravity of the actually moving mass is di<U+FB01>erent
from that of the body at rest; and as the quantity of dragged air
depends on the form of the moving body, the speci<U+FB01>c gravity can
not be determined vi priori, but must be found by experiment for
each particular pendulum.       It followed, therefore, that the results
of all the previous pendulum experiments were erroneous to the ex
tent occasioned by the neglect of this circumstance.    Bessel's method
of conducting the experiment was extremely ingenious; and it may
be asserted that his determination of this important astronomical
element—the absolute length of the seconds’ pendulum—is the only
one yet given which is deserving of full con<U+FB01>dence.         The details
and results were published in the Berlin Memoirs in 1828.
    Another very important result of the indefatigable activity of
Bessel, is the 'Gradmessung in Ost-Preussen,' published in 1838.
Aseries of geodetical measurements, comprehending the measure
of an arc of the meridian of the Dorpat Observatory, had been exe
cuted by Struve and Von Tenner in Russia, and it was of great im
portance, in reference to the question of the <U+FB01>gure of the earth, to
connect them with those of the west and south of Europe. The
operations necessary for this purpose were undertaken by the Prus
sian government in 1830, and executed under the direction of Bes
sel, who seized on the opportunity of measuring an arc of the meri
dian of his Observatory.     In consequence of the novel methods em
ployed both   in the geodetical and astronomical parts of this operation
the details are of extreme interest, more particularly with reference
to the ingenious apparatus for measuring the base line, the mode of
observing and connecting the terrestrial angles, and the application

                                     6+7
of a method of computation      by which every geometrical relation sub
sisting umong    the angles  over  the whole triangulated surface is ex
pressed by equations     of  condition,   and the results, with their pro
bable errors, deduced by the method of least squares.         The ' Grad
messung' may      be  described  as  having   done  for gcodesy what the
' Fundamenta' did for                    both works
                          astronomy    ;             exhibiting the appli
cation of the best and surest methods of deducing results from ob
servations which science has yet placed within the reach of the
computer.
    Several of his minor papers on the subject of geodesy, published
in the ' Astronomische Nachrichten,’ are of great interest and value.
He recomputed the French triangulation between Montjouy and
 Formentera (No.4-S8), and the sector observations of the English
and Indian arcs measured by Mudge and Lambton (334-, 356); and
from the whole of the meridional arcs hitherto measured with ad
missible precision, deduced elements of the terrestrial spheroid which
give probably the nearest approximation which has yet been made
to the true form and magnitude of the earth.
    In connexion with the measurement of the pendulum and arc of
meridian, he also undertook a comparison of the standard measures
of Prussia; determined their relation to the unit of the French
measures; and directed the execution of a new standard which will
 probably become an object of great interest in some future age.
 The details of these delicate and di<U+FB02>icult comparisons are described
 by him in an interesting work published by order of the Prussian
government in 1839.
    The question of the annual parallax of the <U+FB01>xed stars,—a vexed
 question in astronomy since the days of lirudley,—has of late years
 acquired an extraordinary interest through the labours of Struve,
 Henderson, and Bessel.       Having previously made some unsuccess
 ful attempts, Bessel at length determined to attack the problem in a
 new way, and to subject one individual star to a scrutiny which
 would infallibly decide whether any appreciable parallax existed in
 that particular case. The star which he selected was 61 Cygni, a binary
 system whose two members had been proved to be physically con
 nected, and which, by reason of the very considerable distance be
 tween the component bodies, and its large proper motion, affnrded
 strong presumptions ofits being one of the nearest to the earth. With
 the splendid heliometer of the Kiinigsberg Observatory, an instru
 ment peculiarly adapted for such a purpose, he commenced a series
 of micrometrical measurements of—the distances of the star from two
 others in its vicinity, which were continued from August 1837 to
 March 184.O, and conducted with all the appliances and precautions
 for attaining extreme accuracy which were to be expected from the
 importance of the inquiry and the consummate skill of the observer.
 The results exhibited a periodic and systematic <U+FB02>uctuation of the
 places of the double star, agreeing exactly in its law and period with
 the effects of parallax, and referable to no other known cause. The
 parallax thus indicated was indeed an extremely minute quantity,
 amounting only to 31-l0Oths of a second; but no one in a condition

                                    64-8
to appreciate the evidence on which it rests will doubt the possibility
of detecting such a quantity by such means ; and astronomers, accord
ingly, regard the conclusion as one which, if not absolutely certain,
is at least so extremely probable, that it must command assent until
disproved by another equally good, and longer continued, series of
observations.                                            .
    The fruits of the extreme precision which Bessel so greatly con
tributed to introduce into astronomical observations and reductions,
have already begun to make their appearance.           In an interesting
                                                           '
disqnisition published   in some recent  numbers  of the     Astronomische
Nachrichten' (514',     515,  516),  he  seems to  have      established   the
existence   of a very  remarkable    phenomenon   which      had  been   indi
cated, at different times, by Pond, namely, the variability of the
proper motion of two of the principal stars, Procyon and Sirius.
It is unnecessary to point to the boundless <U+FB01>eld of speculation re
specting the constitution of the sidercal heavens which such a dis
 covery lays open.
    The annals of astronomy affford many illustrious examples of inde
 fatigable industry and proli<U+FB01>c labour, but few more remarkable than
 Bessel.    From the date of his <U+FB01>rst publication in 1804-, the astrono
 mical periodicals of Germany teem with his productions.               Zach’s
 '
   Monatliche Correspondenz,’ Lindenau’s ' Zeitschrift,’ Bode’s 'Jahr
 buch,’ the ' Berlin Ephemeris,’ the ' Memoirs of the Berlin Acade
 my,’ and, more especially, Schumacher's 'Astronomische Nachrich
 ten,’ have all beenenriched by his communications.          The last-named
journal, indeed, contains upwards of 180 bearing his signature, em
 bracing almost every subject connected with the science and prac
 tice of astronomy. and questions of every order of di<U+FB02>iculty.          Some
 of his papers in the 'Berlin Memoirs’ are extremely remarkable,
 not only by reason of the results arrived at, but as showing the re-
 sources and originality of the author, and his skill in the highest
 departments of analysis and physical astronomy. Among these may
 be mentioned, in particular, his researches on the great comet of
  1807 (published in 1810), in which he proposed a method, which is
  now generally followed, of determining the orbit when it is necessary
  to take the perturbations into account; a most important memoir on
  the precession of the equinoxes. (1815); another on the planetary
  perturbations (1824); and three on the right ascensions of Maske
  lyne’s 36 stars (1818, 1819, 1825).       Among his later productions
  are two quarto volumes of ' Untersuchungen’ (or Astronomical Re
  searches), and a third is said to have been nearly prepared for the
  press. Many other titles might be cited, but those now mentioned
   may sut<U+FB01>ce to give an idea of the wide extent over which he ranged.
  Indeed it may be said of Bessel, that there is no department of astro
  nomy which he did not handle, and that nothing passed through his
  hands without receiving extension or improvement.             But,‘perhaps,
  that which stands out as most remarkable in his writings is his pro
  found knowledge of the theory of instruments; and perhaps also the
  in<U+FB02>uence of his example in teaching observers to trust less to the
   mechanical perfection of instruments, and to bestow more pains in

                                     64-9
determining their errors so as to remove them by numerical correc
tions, have contributed as much to the advancement of astronomi
cal science as his own proper labours and discoveries. His country
men adopted his methods as the models of their practice ; the pre
sent state of German astronomy shows with how much advantage.
   Bessel was elected a Foreign .\lember of this Society in I825.
He died at Kiinigsberg on the lTth of March 184-6, after a long and
painful illness occasioned by an internal disease. The history of
his labours will occupy a large and prominent place in the history
of astronomy during the <U+FB01>rst half of the present century.
    The Banos on DAMOIsEAU was one of the most distinguished
astronomers of the age. llis most considerable work was his “ M6
moire sur la Théorie de la Lune," which was presented to the In
stitute in 1821, but not published before 1827, when it appeared in
the “ Mémoires des Savans Etrangers." The methods which are used
in this important memoir are, generally speaking, the same as those
adopted by Laplace: the moon's true longitude being assumed as
the independent variable, and the <U+FB01>nal equations solved by the me
thod of indeterminate coe<U+FB02>icients; the solutions being given in nu
merical and not in literal coef<U+FB01>cients, as in the great work of Plana
on the same subject.       The approximations, also, are carried to a
greater extent than in the “ Mécanique Céleste." This memoir was
followed by the celebrated “Tables of the Moon," which were founded
upon     it,
          and which appeared in l8Q4- under the title   “   Tables de la
Lune, formée sur la seule Théorie de l'Attraction et suivant la divi
sion du cercle en 4-00 dégrés."     They form the <U+FB01>rst, and indeed the
only expanded tables of the moon which are founded entirely upon
theory, borrowing nothing whatever from observation but the sim
ple elliptic elements, the proportion of distances of the sun and moon,
and the masses.     All preceding tables, such as Mayer's, Borg's and
Burckhardt's, had derived many of their coe<U+FB02>icients empirically from
observation.    These tables are the basis of those which are used
                                                                      by
the present Astronomer      Royal in the great lunar reductions whic
are now in progress under his superintendence.
   The Baron de Damoiseau was also the author of “ Tables of the
Satellites of Jupiter," and of many other works and memoirs con
nected with the advancementof astronomical science: he was      a  very
profound analyst, a most laborious and faithful calculator, and the
author of the most important advancements which the lunar theory
received in the period which intervened between the appearance of
     great works of Laplace and Plana to whichl have before re
 the
erred.

Meteorological lustruments, by Photography."          By Charles Brooke,
M.B., F.R.C.S.E. Communicated by G. B. Airy, Esq., F.ll.S.,
Astronomer Royal.
   The author enters into fuller details than he had done in his
former   communication    to the Society, which was read on the 18th
of June, respecting the construction of the instrument, the prepa
ration of the highly sensitive photographic paper employed in the
process, and the minute adjustments necessary for ensuring accuracy
in registering the results.
   In a supplement to the above paper, the author describes the
methods he has contrived for obtaining a similar automatic registra
tion of the heights of the barometer and thermometer, by suitable
additions to the same apparatus which registers the magnetic varia
tions.

The    MARQUIS OF NORTHAMPTON,                    President, in the Chair.
   W. R. Grove,          M.A., F .R.S., delivered the Bakcrian Lecture
-" On certain Phenomena
                  Esq.,
                              of Voltaic Ignition, and on the Decompo
sition of Water into its constituent Gases by heat."
   The author refers to an eudiometer, an account of which was
                            '
published by him in the Philosophical Magazine’ for 1840, formed
of a glass tube, into the closed extremity of which a loop of plati
num wire was sealed. The gases to be analysed were mixed in this
tube with a given volume of oxygen and hydrogen, and detonated
or slowly combined by the voltaic ignition of the platinum wire.
He was thence led to try a further set of experiments on the analysis,
by this instrument, of such gases and vapours as are decomposable

                                     658
by heat; the process being capable of much greater exactness than
the received one of passing them through ignited tubes.             The re
sults of the analyses of several gases by this means are given in the
paper.     When carbonic acid and hydrogen are mixed in equal
volumes and exposed to the ignited wire, the hydrogen abstracts
oxygen from the carbonic acid, and leaves carbonic oxide.              Con
versely, when carbonic oxide is exposed over water to the ignited
wire, it abstracts oxygen from the aqueous vapour, and forms car
bonic acid.
    It thus appeared, that provided there were bodies present capable
of absorbing by a<U+FB02>inity the elements of water, ignited platinum
would either compose or decompose water. The author was thence
led to hope that he might by ignited platinum decompose water into
its constituents, without absorption by other bodies, and thus pro
duce converse effects to those already known.         In this he ultimately
succeeded by various methods, in some of which the ignition was
produced by electrical means; in others by ordinary calori<U+FB01>c pro
cesses, such as the oxyhydrogen blowpipe, &c.
r
    A platinum wire is ignited at the closed extremity of a species of
tube retort, full of pure water, and having a narrowed neck close
above the wire; as soon as the wire becomes incandescent, it forms
around itself an atmosphere of vapour which it immediately decom
poses; anatural valve being formed by the con<U+FB02>ict of ascending
gas and descending water, the bubbles of mixed gas are cut off by
an intermittent action, and thus, as their recombination is prevented,
avolume of gas collects in the bend of the tube and is ultimately
expelled at its ori<U+FB01>ce.   If, again, a button of platinum be fully ignited
by the oxyhydrogen blowpipe, and plunged into water previously
heated to nearly its boiling-point, bubbles of mixed gas ascend and
may be collected by an inverted tube.        The electrical spark is shown
to be capable of decomposing aqueous vapour, and various other
modes of producing the same results are given.
    Some theoretical views are then advanced as to the spheroidal
state which appears to the author to be intermediate between that
of ebullition and decomposition; as to the probable non-existence
of Water or steam in the interior of the earth, and as to the antago
nism between physical repulsion and chemical af<U+FB01>nity.
    In a supplementary paper, the author considers how far catalysis
affects the phenomenon, and regards the decomposition thus pro
 duced as presenting a parallel effect produced by the force of heat,
to that known to be produced by electricity; he considers it expla.
 natory of the decomposition of water by the electrical spark as in
the experiments of Pearson and Wollaston.             Some further expe
 riments are given, in which iridium and osmium and silica are sub-
stituted for platinum; and also some experiments on the liquids
 bromine and chloride of iodine, both of which yield pure oxygen
when exposed to the ignited wire in Mr. Grove’s apparatus.            These
last experiments cannot however be long continued in consequence
 of these liquids ultimately attacking both the glass and the platinum.
 In conclusion, the author calls attention to the general evolution of

                                  659
                                ~i

   “Researches on Pliysical Geology."—Pnrt I. The Figure and
Primitive Formation of the Earth.       By Ilenry Hennessy, Esq.
Communicated by Major North Ludlow Beamish, K.H., F.lt.S.
   The author's investigations of the <U+FB01>gure of the earth proceed on
the hypothesis of its having originally been a heterogeneous <U+FB02>uid
mass, possessing only such general properties as those which have
been established for <U+FB02>uids; and indepemlcntly of the supposition,
with which the theory has generally been complicated, that the vo
lume of the entire inass, and the law of the density of the <U+FB02>uid, have
suffered no change in consequence of the solidi<U+FB01>cation of a part of
that <U+FB01>uid.    Assuming the <U+FB01>gure of the mass to be an ellipsoid of
revolution, the author obtains general analytical expressions for its
ellipticity, and for the variation of gravity at its surface.   lle gives
a general sketeh of the consequences that may result from the im
proved hypothesis of the primitive <U+FB01>gure of the earth, to physical
geology, that      to the changes occurring upon the external crust of
                 is,
the earth during the process of its solidi<U+FB01>cation. resulting both from
calori<U+FB01>c and chemical changes taking place among its di<U+FB02>ercnt parts,
and giving rise to     aprocess of circulation throughout the <U+FB02>uid por
tions of the mass.
   The present memoir      is only the <U+FB01>rst of  aseries which the author
announces   it   ishis intention  to communicate   to the Society on the
same subject.

   The following paper was read   :
   “ Quelques Recherches surl'Arc Voltaique; et sur l'in<U+FB02>uence qu'ex—
eree  leMagnétisme, soit sur cet Arc, soit sur les Corps qui trans
mettent les Courants Electriques Discontinus."       By M. Auguste
De la Rive, Foreign Member of the Royal Society, Professor in the
Academy of Geneva, Corresponding Member of the Academy of
Sciences of Paris, &c.
  In the <U+FB01>rst section of this memoir the author gives a detailed de
scription of the phenomena exhibited by the luminous voltaic arc
produced either in   vacuum or in atmospheric air, or in hydrogen
                       a
gas, by employing electrodes of different kinds of conducting sub<

                                    660
stances, in the form either of points or of plates. He examines mi
nutely the transfer of particles which takes place from one pole to
the other under these various circumstances, and the differences
which occur when the currents are reversed. He observed that
when a positive metallic point is presented to a negative plate, par
ticles of the former are transported by the voltaic arc, and deposited
on the latter, forming a ring of a regular form, having as its centre
the projection of the point on the plate.        This happens in atmo
spheric air whether highly rari<U+FB01>ed or of the ordinary density, but
not in hydrogen gas.      This deposit consists always of oxidized par
ticles of the positive metal which forms the pointed electrode.         In
the case of platinum, the circular spot is of a blue colour, and pre
sents the appearance of the coloured rings of Nobili.          This effect
 the author is disposed to ascribe to the action of the oxygen brought
 by the voltaic current into that particular condition which Schoen
 bein <U+FB01>rst described under the name of Ozone. While this deposit
 is taking place, a vivid blue light is emitted.
    In the second section the author investigates the action exerted by
a powerful electro-magnet on the voltaic arc.        He describes the re
markable modi<U+FB01>cations which the length, the form, and even the
 nature of the arc undergoes when the electro-magnet is brought ex
tremely near to it, and the magnetization of the electrodes them
 selves, when they are susceptible of that affection by their approxi
mation to the electro-magnet.      He notices the singular phenomenon
 of a peculiar sound emitted by the luminous arc, when subjected to
this magnetic in<U+FB02>uence; asound which varies both in its nature and
its intensity according to the nature, the form and the temperature
of the electrodes, consisting sometimes of ashrill whistle, and at
other times of a series of slight detonations.
    The third section is devoted to the investigation of a remarkable
phenomenon presented by all the conducting bodies while transmit
ting discontinuous electric currents, under the in<U+FB02>uence of a power
ful electro-magnet; namely, the emission of a sound resembling that
of the revolving toothed-wheel in Savart’s experiments.       This sound
is distinctly heard, and is peculiarly loud with prismatic bars of lead,
bismuth, tin, &c., about three-quarters of an inch square and a foot
and a half long, whether placed in the direction of a line joining the
poles of an electro-magnet, or in a direction at right angles to such
line: it was weakened only by increasing the distance between the
poles and the bar.     The intensity of the sound appeared to depend
much less on the nature of the substance which was subjected to
this action, than on its form, its volume, and its mass.    All conduct
ing bodies, whatever may be their nature, or state of aggregation,
are capable of yielding these sounds.       They are produced by char
coal of all kinds and shape. Mercury contained in a cylindrical
glass tube, of similar dimensions with the metallic bars, emits a
sound of great intensity; and a still louder sound arises from a wire
coiled as a helix around a cylinder of wood, and also by tubes formed
of different metals. Similar phenomena are also observable by the
action of a helical coil substituted
                                      for the electro-magnet.

                                  titil
   On the whole, the author arrives at the conclusion that the phr
nomena noticed in this paper are altogether molecular. and that they
establish the following principles: <U+FB01>rst, that the passage of the elec
tric current modi<U+FB01>es, even in solid bodies, the arrangement of the
particles; and secondly, that the action of magnetism, in like man
ner, produces an analogous modi<U+FB01>cation in the moh-cular constitu
tion of all bodies. This has already hi-rn demonstrated by Faraday
in the case of transparent bodies, in its effects on polarized light;
and is now extended by M. De la Rive to opaque conducting bodies,
by employing, instead of polarized light, a discontinuous electric
current.
   “ On the Ganglia and Nerves of the Virgin L'terus."       By Robert
Lee, M.D., F.R.S., &c.
   The author states that his recent dissections have enabled him to
verify the descriptions he gave of the ganglia and nerves of the
uterus in his papers already published in the Philosophical Trans
actions, and also to detect the existence of ganglia situated in the
muscular coat of the uterus, and of plexuses ofnervea accompanying
all the blood-vessels and nbsorbents ramifying in its walls, between
the peritoneum and lining membrane.         By examining the hearts of
a fcetus, ofa child ofsix years of age, of an adult in the sound state,
a human heart greatly hypertrophied, and the heart of an ox, he
found that there exists a striking analogy between the ganglia and
nerves of the uterus and those of the heart.         He ascertained by
microscopic observation that the muscular and vascular structures
of the auricles and ventricles are endowed with numerous ganglia
and plexuses of nerves, which, as far as he knows, have not yet been
described, and which enlarge simultaneously with the natural growth
of the heart, and also continue to enlarge during its morbid condi
tions of hypertrophy.    The author also <U+FB01>nds that the size of the
ganglia   and nervea of the left auricle and ventricle, in the normal
state, is more than double that of the corresponding parts on the
right side. A description is then given of two elaborate drawings
which accompany the paper.
   “ On a new and practical form of Voltaic
                                                 Battery of the highest
powers, in which Potassium forms the positive element."        By John
            Esq. Communicated by S. Hunter Christie, Esq., A.M.,
GOOti{!n8n,
Sec. .S.
   The author succeeded in constructing a voltaic arrangement of
some power by <U+FB01>xing a piece of potassium to the end ofa copper
wire, placed in a tube containing naphtha, and bringing it in con
tact witha small quantity of mercury, held by a layer of bladder
closing the lower end of the tube, which was itself immersed in
acidulated water immediately over a piece of platinum, and then
completing the circuit by establishing a metallic contact between
the copper wire and the platinum.       This battery acted with energy
on the galvanometer, and effected the decomposition of water.          A
series of twelve pairs of similar plates exhibited a sensible attraction

                                  662
of a slip of gold leaf.   Thus it appears that the substance which
possesses   the highest chemical   a<U+FB02>inity manifests also the greatest
power of electrical tension.

   “ On Photographic Self-registering Meteorological and Magneti
cal Instruments."    By Francis Ronalds, Esq., F.R.S., &c.
    The apparatus employed by the author at the Kew Observatory,
and which he terms the Photo-Electrograph, is described by him
in the following words :—“ A rectangular box, about sixteen inches
long and three square, constitutes the part usually called the body of
a kind of lucernal microscope.      A voltaic electrometer (properly
insulated, and in communication with an atmospheric conductor) is
suspended within the microscope, through an aperture in the upper
side, and near to the object end. That end itself is closed by a plane
of glass, when daylight is used, and by condensing lenses, when a
common Argand lamp is employed.           In either case an abundance
of light is thrown into the microscope. Between the electrometer
and the ether, or eye-end of the microscope, <U+FB01>ne achromatic lenses
are placed, which have the double effect of condensing the light
upon a little screen, situated at that eye-end, and of projecting a
strong image of the electrometer, in deep oscuro, upon it.      Through
the screen a very narrow slit, of proper curvature, is cut (the chord
of the arc being in a horizontal position), and it is <U+FB01>tted into the
back of a case, about two-and-a-half feet long, which case is <U+FB01>xed
to the eye-end of the microscope, at right angles with its axis, and
vertically.   Within the case is suspended a frame, provided with a
rabbet, into which two plates of pure thin glass can be dropped, and
brought into close contact by means of six littlebolts and nuts.
This frame can be removed at pleasure from a line, by which it is
suspended, and the line, after passing through a small aperture
(stopped with grease) cut through the upper end of the long case,
is attached to a pulley (about four inches in diameter), <U+FB01>xed, with
capacity of adjustment, on the hour arbor of a good clock.        Lastly,
counterpoises, rollers, springs, and a straight ruler are employed for
ensuring accurate rectilineal sliding of the frame, when the clock is
set in motion.
   “ A piece of
                 properly prepared photographic paper is now placed
between the two plates of glass in the moveablc frame; the frame
is removed (in abox made purposely for excluding light), and is
suspended in the long case; this is closed, so as to prevent the possi
bility of extraneous light entering with it; the clock is started, and
the time of starting is noted.

                                   663
   “  All that part of the paper which is made to pass over the slit in
the screen, by the motion of the clock, becomes now therefore sue
cessively exposed to a strong light, and is consequently brought into
a state which <U+FB01>ts it to receive a dark colour on being again Wl.\.\'h\'d
with the usual solution, excepting those small portions upon which
dark images of the lower parts of the pcndulinns ofthc electroineter
are projected through the slit.     These small portions of course re
tain the light colour of the paper; and from the long curved lirnics
or bands, whose distances form each other, at any given part of the
photograph, i. e. at any given time indicate the electric tension of
the atmosphere at that time.
   “ By certain additions to the instrument above described, the kind
as well as the tension of electrical charge is capable of being rc
gistered; and by the employment also of a horizontal thermometer,
&c., it is adapted to the purposes of a Tliermograph, as well as
Photo-barometrograph and Jlagnetograplt."

   “ On the Lunar Atmospheric Tide at St. Helena."                By Lieut.
Colonel Edward Sabine, R.A., For. Sec. ILS.
   The results of the observations made by Captain Lefroy, of the
Royal Artillery, Director of the Magnetical and Meteorological Ob
servatory at St. Helena, are here given; from which it appears, on
the examination of the barometrical changesduring seventeen months,
that a maximum of pressure corresponds to the moon's passage over
both the inferior and superior meridians, being slightly greater in
the latter case, and that a minimum corresponds nearly to the rising
and setting, or to six hours before and after the former periods.        The
average atmospheric pressures     are  28°27l4-   inches  in  the  <U+FB01>rst case,
and 289675 in the last; the difference being 00089 inch.                 The
height   of the cistern of the barometer     above   the  sea  is 1764- feet;
and the latitude of the Observatory 15° 57' S.          These results were
still further con<U+FB01>rmed by those of a series of observations during
two years.     These observations also establish the conclusion that
the moon exerts a greater in<U+FB02>uence on the amount of atmospheric
pressure at the periods of her perigee than at those of her apogee.

   “ On the Diurnal Variation of the Magnetic Declination of St.
Helena." By Lieut.-Colonel Edward Sabine, R.A., For. Sec. R.S.
   It has long been known that the diurnal variation of the magnetic
needle is in an opposite direction in the southern, to what it is in
the northern hemisphere; and it was therefore proposed as a pro
blem by Arago, Humboldt and others, to determine whether there
 exists any intermediate line of stations on the earth where those
diurnal variations disappear. The results recorded in the present
paper are founded on observations made at St. Helena during the
<U+FB01>ve consecutive years, from 1841 to 184-5 inclusive; and also on
similar observations made at Singapore, in the years l84'l and 184-2;
and show that at these stations, which are intermediate between the
northern and southern magnetic hemispheres, the diurnal variations
still take place; but those peculiar to each hemisphere prevail at
 opposite seasons of the year, apparently in accordance with the
position of the sun with relation to the earth's equator.

lished by Waring about the year 1770, without any proof ), which
theorem is that, if A be a prime number, l. 2. 8. . . .                   is                 (A-l)+l
divisible by A; refers to Lagrange's and Euler's demonstrations,
and mentions Gauss’a extension of the theorem, to any number, not
prime; provided that instead of 1, 2, 3, &c. (A-1), those numbers
only be taken which are prime to A, and 1 be either added or sub
tracted.   This theorem was published by Gauss without a proof in
 1801, with a rule as to the cases in which 1 is to be added or sub
tracted, the correctness of which is questioned by the author, who
proceeds to propound the following theorem, which he had previ
ously, for distinctness, divided into three.
    If an number, prime or not, be taken, and the numbers prime to
               hess
             than one half of
                           ii

whose squares         are equal to the prime number, or some multiple
of (which may be more than one), then the product of the re
   it
 maining primes (if any), -_i_-1 shall be divisible by the rime number.
    He gives as examples, 14-, the primes to which, and less than one
 half, are l,        and 1.8. 5=l5; therefore 1. 8. 5—l=l4-; also
                      8,   5,
 15, the primes to which and less, are                  7; but 4-X4=l6  1,   2,    4-,
=l5+l;      therefore       to be rejected, and
                                4-   is               2. 7+1=l5.       The    1.
 author adds another theorem, that         A be a prime number, all the
                                                              if
 odd numbers less than        (rejecting as before); also, all the even
                                      it
 numbers (making the same rejection except                 will, multiplied  A-1)
 together, be  equal  to         Ai       l.
    The author then proceeds to prove Gauss's extension of Wilson's
 theorem, and to give the cases in which             to be added or subl     is
 tracted; and in the course of the proof, he mentions that the num
 bers prime to any number not only are found in pairs, one greater
 and one less than one-half of the number, but that they associate
 themselves in sets of four, with an odd pair in certain cases.      Thus,
 the primes to     are 7        1,    6,—
                                     2,

          1, the number may be    any other prime to A. Upon this
 foundation the author proceeds  to show that Wilson’s theorem, and
 also Gauss’s, may be made much  more general; that if A be a prime
 number, as 7, the numbers less  than it may be arranged in pairs,
not only with reference to l, but to any number less than 7. Take
4' as an example :—
                                            1     x        3=7—4

therefore       1    .2.3    .4‘   .5 .6-l-43:71a; that

    The   same   then shown as to numbers not prime, provided those
                      is
numbers alone are taken which are prime to          and the number of                it,
pairs  will be  half  the number  of  primes.   The   general theorem
therefore    this :—If
                is        be any number, prime or not, and m be the
                                      A

                                      it,

be greater or less.
    It follows from this that                    zgi
                                        must be divisible by A, and there

 of it. But the theorem        true though A be not
                                            is              prime number,                  a

of primes to A and less than it.
    The author has therefore in this paper offered proof of Gauss's                        a
theorem, and proved that         applies in certain cases to one half of the
                                            it
primes, and in all cases, with certain modi<U+FB01>cations, has shown that
a  similar property belongs to the product of the odd numbers, and
also of the even numbers which precede any prime number; and
lastly, has shown the intimate connexion between Wilson"s theorem
and Fermat's, and shown that each            but    part of a much more

general proposition, which, he observes, may itself turn out to be
part only of still more universal one.

not yet fully determined the precise conditions on which this phe

portion of the mixed gases, diffused throughout the whole liquid,
coming into contact with the platinum plates, and being recombined
on the surface of those plates; and this process being renewed with
every fresh portion of the gases which takes the place of the former,
the whole of the gases are thus reconverted into water.

of production and action of certain secondary or induced conditions
of the nervous system, which are effected by a voltaic, and proba

of that current is withdrawn."     This condition he designates by the
new term electrogenic, as describing at once the origin and the inde
pendence of that condition.      On the present occasion he con<U+FB01>nes
himself to the subject of the electrogenic condition of the muscular
nerves, postponing to future inquiries that of the incident nerves
and of the spinal marrow; and also the modes of action of other
physical and chemical agents, such as mechanical injury, heat and
cold, strychnine, and the hydrocyanic acid.
   The bones and muscles of the brachial lumbar and pelvic regions
of a frog, being isolated from all the other parts of the body, except
ing only by means of their respective brachial and lumbar nerves,
which were perfectly denuded on all sides, and raised from the glass
on which the limbs were laid,   a  voltaic current from     pair of the
                                                              a
“ couronne de tasses" was passed downwards through the nerves, in
a direction from their origin in the spinal marrow towards their ter
minations in the muscles.     Energetic muscular movements were at
<U+FB01>rst excited; and the current was thus continued during the space
of <U+FB01>ve, ten, or <U+FB01>fteen minutes, and at the end of this period was

                                      668
withdrawn.       No sooner was the current discontinued than the mus
cles were affected with spasmodic contractions, and with a tetanoid
rigidity, constituting the secondary, or what the author denominates
the electrogenic condition; an effect, which as instantly subsides on
the restoration of the voltaic current.
     The author proceeds to state the precautions which must be taken
to ensure the success of experiments on this subject; and traces the
 effects of desiccation of the nerves from spontaneous evaporation,
 and of the application of external moisture, on the phenomena; and
 also the modi<U+FB01>cations introduced by varying the extent of voltaic
 contact.    Various experiments are then described, which the author
 instituted with a view to ascertain the nature of the electrogenic
 condition of the nerves, and the circumstances under which it is in
 duced; and he is led to the conclusion that the phenomena involve
 some voltaic principle which has not hitherto been fully investigated.

  tary College, Sandhurst.        Communicated by Sir John F. W. Her
  schel, Bart., F.R.S.
      After taking a summary review of the methods employed by Mr.
  Baily for determining, on the plan devised by Mr. Cavendish, the
  mean density of the earth, and of the anomalies, hitherto unac
  counted for, which had introduced perplexity in the results obtained,
  the author, suspecting that these anomalies had their source in the
  variable magnetic states of the masses which were the subject of
  experiment, traces the effects which such an in<U+FB02>uence might be
  supposed to have on those results.         He <U+FB01>nds that, the attraction
  arising from gravitation between a mass and one of the balls being
  exceedingly minute, an almost inconceivably feeble magnetic state
  may be the cause of great perturbations.         He then proceeds to in
  vestigate the subject by the application of mathematical analysis;
   from which he is led to the conclusion that the masses and balls do
  actually exert on one another in<U+FB02>uences which are independent of
   the action of gravitation.      He <U+FB01>nds that such in<U+FB02>uences are of a
   very  <U+FB02>uctuating  nature;   the  action arising from them being either
   positive or  negative,  and  its sign also changing in each revolution
   as the masses are turned round a vertical axis; and he observes that
   such action may either fall short of that arising from gravitation or
   exceed it many times. Such disturbing force he conceives can be no
   other than amagnetic in<U+FB02>uence; not however one of the ordinary
   kind, but that which Faraday has recently discovered as affecting
   all diamagnetic bodies.

should in future be conducted, so as to obviate or eliminate this
source of error.    Such an inquiry, he remark.-4, would, by exhibit

in all probability, to important consequences.

F.R.C.S. Communicated by honnm Bell, Esq., €'.ll.S.
                                   '1“
   The observations of the author, of which he gives detailed ac  a
count in the present memoir, have led him to the following con
clusions    :
   Two species only of the genus Triton are met with in England;
namely, the Trilon verrucosus and the Lissa-triton punctatus.            It   is
three years before the animal       capable of propagating its species,
                                   is
and four years before     attains its full growth.
                          it                          In its tadpole state,
it remains in the water till its legs acquire sutiicicnt strength to
qualify    for progressive motion on land. While land animal,
            it                                                a               it
is  in an active state during the summer, and              the winter in a
state of hybernation; but does not then, as passes   as been erroneously
supposed, remain at the bottom of pools.           Very dry, or very wet
situations are incompatible with the preservation of life during the
period of hybernation.      At the expiration of the third year, the
triton revisits the water, in the spring season, for the purposes of
reproduction, and again leaves     itat' the commencement of autumn.
Impregnation       accomplished through the medium of water, and
                   is
not by actual contact.     The growth and development of the triton
are materially in<U+FB02>uenced by temperature, and but little by the action
of light. The triton possesses the power of reproducing its lost
limbs, provided the temperature be within the limits of 58° and 75°
Fahrenheit; but at lower temperatures, and during the winter,               it
has no such power.

     “ On the Proper Motion of the Solar System." By Thomas Gal
  loway, Esq., A.M., F.R.S.
     The object of this paper is to communicate the results of a calcu
 lation for determining the direction of the proper motion of the
  solar system from the apparent proper motions of stars in the
  southern hemisphere, deduced mostly from a comparison of the
  observations made by Lacaille at the Cape, about the middle of the
  last century, with the recent observations of Mr. Johnson and the
  late Professor Henderson at St. Helena and the Cape respectively.
  After adverting to the papers of Sir William Herschel in the Philo
  sophical Transactions for 1783 and 1805, and some other investi
 gations of the same subject, the author remarks that up to a
 recent period astronomers seem generally to have entertained the
 opinion that our knowledge of the proper motions of the stars is
 not su<U+FB02>iciently advanced to enable us to pronounce positively either
  on the fact or the direction of the motionof our own system. This
 opinion was grounded on the discrepancies which present them
 selves when it is attempted to explain the observed displacements
 of individual stars by referring them to the motion of the sun in an
 opposite direction; it being always found that whatever-direction
 is assigned to the sun’s motion, there are many stars whose proper
 motions cannot thereby be accounted for.        But if the sun be in
 motion it is very improbable that any star is absolutely at rest;
 hence the proper motions deduced from a comparison of catalogues
 must be regarded as the effect partly of the true proper motions of
the stars, and partly of the apparent systematic or parallactic mo
 tion caused by the displacement of the point of view; and as we
 have no reason for supposing the true proper motion of a star to be
more probable in one direction than in another, it may be expected,
¢i priori, that the observed directions will form angles of all different
values with the direction of the sun’s motion, or any other <U+FB01>xed
line.    The observed discrepancies are therefore not incompatible
with a general drifting of the stars towards a particular region of
the heavens; but in order to deduce the direction of the systematic
motion, it becomes necessary to take account of a very considerable
number of proper motions, and to represent them by equations,
involving the unknown quantities required for determining the
direction of the sun’s motion, and to solve the equations so as to
obtain the most probable values of those quantities.   The <U+FB01>rst person
who investigated the subject under this point of view was Professor
Argelander of Bonn, in a paper published in the Petersburg Me
moirs for1837.      From the proper motions of 390 stars deduced
from a comparison of Bessel’s catalogue of Bradley's observations
with his own catalogue of stars observed at Abo, Argelander found
the direction of the sun’s motion, for l792'5, to be towards the point
of the sphere whose right ascension is 259° 4'7"6 and declination
 -I-32° 29"5. Lundahl, subsequently, from a comparison of the places
of 147 stars in the catalogues of Bessel and Pond, and not included
among those considered by Argelander, found the co-ordinates of
the point to be 1R.=252° 24%, Dec.+ 14° 26"1 ; and Otto Struve,

                                    67!
still more recently, from the comparison of about 400 of Bradley's
stars with the positions determined at the Dorpat Observatory, ob
tained the result zR=261° 23"l, Dec.-t-37. 35"7.            The mean of
those results taken with respect to their probable errors, was found
by O. Struve to be 1R='25$)° 9"-l-, Dee.+34-° i$(i"5.
    All the stars included in the calculations of Argelander, Lundahl,
and O. Struve being situated to the north of the tropic of Capri
corn, it°appeared to be a point of some interest to determine whe
ther the southern stars agree with the northern in their indication
of the direction of the sUlnr motion, or afford any confirmation of
the hypothesis of the sun's translation.        l7nfortunately, we have
no observations made in the southern hemisphere in the last century
equal in precision to those of Bradley, but the catalogue given by
Lacaille in his 'Astronomiue Funda|nenta,' furnishes a means of
comparison of considerable value in reference to the present in
quiry. In Ur. Johnson's 'Catalogue of 606 Stars in the Southern
Hemisphere’ (London, 1835), there are sixty-one which, on com
paring their places in 1830 with those of Lacuillc reduced to the
same epoch, appear to have shifted their-positions not less than 8"
in space in the interval of eighty years between the epochs of the
catalogues, or to have an annual proper motion of not less than
one-tenth ofa second in space. Prof. Henderson's catalogue (Mem.
It. Astron. Society, vols. x. and xv.) furnishes thirty-six stars, which,
on a like comparison, appear to have an annual proper motion ex
ceeding the saine limit.      Ofthese, however, thirty-two are contained
in Mr. Johnson's catalogue, but Henderson gives the proper motions
of sixteen other-stars (in the southern hemisphere), from the com
parison of his own places with those of Bradley.           On the whole,
therefore, the two catalogues furnish eighty-one different stars whose
proper motions are given both in right ascension and declination.
 The method of investigation is the same as that of Argelander. From
the differences of At and Dec. given by comparison of the cata
logucs, the direction of the amaarent motion of each star is com
puted.     It is then assumed that the sun is moving towards a point
whose right ascension A=259° 4-6"‘2 and declination D=-1-32°
29"6; and the direction in which each star would appear to move,
if it were itself at rest, is computed on this hypothesis. The differ
ence of these two directions is treated as an error of observation,
and its numerical value substituted for the differential of the angle
which determines the direction of the parallactic motion; this diffe
 rential being expressed by a formula containing the differentials of
 A and D multiplied by known coef<U+FB01>cients. An equation is thus
obtained of the form
                             O=adA+bdD+n,
in which a, b, and n are known quantities.         Each star furnishes ti
similar equation; and the equations, being <U+FB01>rst multiplied respec
 tively by the sine of the star's distance from the point assumed as
the apex of the sun's motion, in order to give them all the same
weight, are solved by the method of least squares, and the result

                                672
ing values of d A and d D applied as corrections to the assumed
values of A and D. The results are as follows :—the whole of the
eighty-one equations give (for 17.90) as co-ordinates of the point
towards which the sun's motion is directed,
      1R=268° as’-015° 14'-5; Dec.= +s7° 15'ois° 17'-6.
But two of the stars compared with Lacaille move in a direction so
nearly opposite to that of their motion on the assumed hypothesis,
that (in one case especially) a slight error of observation would
change the sign of n in the equations of condition.      It therefore
appears necessary   to reject those two  stars; and a further -reason
for rejecting them  is,that they are both situated within 8° of the
pole, in which position Lacaille’s determination of the right ascen
sion is  probably not to be depended upon.    Setting aside, there
fore, the two stars in question, the remaining seventy-nine equa
tions give
     }R=£256° 51"5i4a° 45''1   ;   Dec.= +24"   14'-s1—~5°   26'-2.
The author further observes, that one of the stars compared with
Bradley's catalogue  is   also remarkable as appearing to move in a
direction nearly opposite to the mean direction of the whole, and
thatif  this star be rejected also on account of the great probability
there is that the parallactic motion   in this case concealed by the
                                      is
larger proper motion of the star itself in an opposite direction, the
co-ordinates of the solar apex become
     ./R=259° 47"4i4'° 21'-9; Dec.= +a4° 19'-5i5°            17'-7,
a  result differing less than
                           a  degree either in right ascension or de
clination from the mean, as above stated, of the three previous de
terminations.

    “ On a new substance occurring in the Urine ofa Patient with
Mollities Ossiumi"       By Henry Bence Jones, M.D., F.R.S., Physi
cian to St. George's Hospital.
    The chemical analysis of this substance showed it to be the hy
drated deutoxide of albumen, of which 66'97 parts were contained
in every 1000 parts of urine, an amount equal to the proportion of
albumen in              blood; so that every ounce of urine secreted was
                  the oss of an equal quantity of blood.
equivalent tohealthy                                         The peculiar
characteristic of this substance was its solubility in water, and its
being precipitated by nitric acid; the precipitate being dissolved by
 heat, and again thrown down by cold.          The urine which contained
it was reddened by the addition of nitric acid; a phenomenon, the
occurrence of which might, in future cases, lead to its re-discovery.

     “ On Carbonic Acid as a Solvent in the process of Vegetation."
 By John Davy, M.D., F.R.S.
     In this paper the author describes the results of experiments made
 with water saturated with carbonic acid, in many instances con
 densed by pressure and supersaturated, on the more important in
 organic elements of plants, compounds not soluble in water alone,
 such as phosphate of lime, silica, &c.      These results appear to prove
 that  this  acid performs  in  the economy of growing plants a double
 function; one well-known, already carefully studied, by which,
 undergoing decomposition in the leaves under the in<U+FB02>uence of solar
 light, it supplies carbon to the growing vegetable, and restores oxy

                                   674
 gen to the atmosphere; the other, hitherto little attended to, in
 which it acts as a menstruum, conveying certain compounds, inso
 luble in water, from the soil into the interior of plants to 'become
 constituents of their organism.
     The experiments he details are of two kinds, one set being on
 single compounds, the other on a mixture of these compounds.        The
 results of the latter seem to prove that water impregnated with car
 bonic acid is capable of dissolving several substances at the same
 time, and of keeping them mixed in solution, as carbonate of lime,
 carbonate of magnesia, phosphate of lime, silica, &c.
     He concludes his paper with certain remarks of a theoretical
 nature, founded on his experimental results, bearing on vegetable
 physiology, soils and their substrata, and mineral waters,—n1aking
 these remarks, as he says, with the hope of drawing attention to the
 subject in its most interesting relations, and of exciting further and
 more minute research.
    “ An Account of the

    The hurricane commenced at half-past ten o’clock on the night
of the 10th of October, 1846, and was at its utmost height until
from seven to ten the following morning, producing the most exten

tion among the shipping in the harbour.        The barometer was ob
served to fall to the lowest point, after the hurricane had subsided.
The progress of the hurricane appears to have been from the south,
and passing on to the west, to have lost itself in Florida.       It was
not attended with lightning, as was the case with the hurricane of
 1844.

    “Researches into the effects of certain Physical and Chemical
Agents on the Nervous System.” By Marshall Hall, M.D., F.R.S.,
&c.
    In this paper, to which the author considers his former commu
nication as strictly preliminary, he proposes to treat of what he terms
the electrogenic state in the spinal marrow and in incident nerves,
and to give the details of the collateral experiments he alluded to
at the close of his last paper.   He also submits to the consideration
of the Society the following circumstances, namely,
    “ 1. The
               electrogenic state of the nerves admits of being dis

                                   675
charged, and is capable of inducing the phenomena of voltaism in
other nerves.
   “ 2. This state is inducible by momentary and slight voltaic cur
rents.
   “ 8. It is more inducible by the reverse than by the direct vol
taic current, as stated by others.
    “ 4-. \\'hen a nerve forms a part of the voltaic circle, new and
superadded circles may be cffected, which, by inducing a change in
the condition of the <U+FB01>rst, result in the phenomena of muscular con
tractions.
    “ 5. When the voltaic circle is either complete, or, being com
plcted, is broken, and various parts of the wires and animal tissues
which form or formed that circle are colmecled by a conductor, a
series of phenomena is produced, some of which still require ex
planation.
    “ 6. It is also important, especially in a medical point of view, to
observe the manner and degree in which the vis nervous and the
via muacularis are diminished by repeated voltaic action."
    In conclusion the author observes, “ I have purposely and care
fully avoided all theoretical views, con<U+FB01>ning myself to the accurate
detail of experiments.     The condition induced in the nervous system
by a current of voltaism I have denominated the electrogenic.           It
might be viewed as one of polarization, its discharge one of depo
larization.    But I have nothing to add to these views, beyond what
is universally known.      The phenomena of the continuous, inter
rupted, and sudden discharge of the electrogenic condition, have
not, I believe, been traced and detailed before."

    A   paper was read, entitled    “On the Nervous       System   of the
Heart." By Robert Lee, M.D., F.R.S.
    The author premises a historical notice of the various opinions
entertained by distinguished anatomists respecting the nerves of the
heart; some having maintained that the human heart is copiously
supplied with nerves, and others that it has few or none. In Sep
tember 184-6, the author resolved to dissect, under the microscope,
the nerves of the heart while covered with alcohol, as he had done
those of the uterus.      His examinations of the fwtal heart, of the
heart of a child at the age of six years, of the heart of an adult
in the sound state, of the human heart greatly hypertrophied, and
of the heart of the ox, warrant, he thinks, the following conclusions :—
 1st, that the blood-vessels and the muscular structure of the auri
cles and ventricles of the heart are furnished with numerous gan
glia and plexuses of nerves which have hitherto been neither de
scribed nor represented by any anatomist ; Qndly, that these nervous
structures of the heart, which are distributed over its surface and

                                    676
throughout its walls to the lining membrane and columnw carnae,
enlarge with the natural growth of the heart before birth, and during
childhood and youth, until the heart has attained its full size in the
adult; Srdly, that when the walls of the auricles and ventricles are
affected with hypertrophy, the ganglia and nerves of the heart are
enlarged like those of the gravid uterus; and 4'thly, that the gan
glia and nerves which supply the left auricle and ventricle in the
natural state, are more than double the size of the ganglia and
nerves distributed to the right side of the heart.
    The author observes that the ventricles and auricles of the human
heart and of those of the hearts of the larger quadrupeds, are covered
with two distinct membranes; the exterior is the serous membrane,
connected by cellular tissue with another distinct tunic, which has
scarcely, if at all, been noticed by anatomists.      This second mem
brane is stated to have a dense <U+FB01>brous structure, to be semitrans
parent, and to resemble in a remarkable manner the aponeurotic ex
pansions, or fasciae, covering muscles in other parts of the body;
and, like them, it sends numerous <U+FB01>bres or processes between the
muscular fasciculi, blood-vessels, nerves, and adipose substance of
the heart.     This membrane, the author thinks, may appropriately
be termed the cardiac fascia, and he states that, through this, after
the removal of the serous membrane, there are numerous ganglia
and plexuses of nerves visible to the naked eye.       If these nerves be
traced backwards towards the base of the ventricles, they are seen
to terminate in a great ganglionic plexus, situated between the pul
monary artery and aorta; into which plexus branches of nerves
enter from the par vagum of each side, the recurrent and the sym
pathetic nerves.      From this great ganglionic plexus, which the
author considers to be the root of all the principal cardiac nerves,
branches invested with a soft neurilema proceed to the auricles
 and ventricles, and their septa. Large <U+FB02>at branches of nerves pass
 from this ganglionic mass to the coronary arteries, the trunks of
which they completely surround like a sheath, and all the rami<U+FB01>ca
 tions of which they accompany, not only over the surface of the
 heart, but into the muscular substance, and they aredistributed
 with these arteries throughout its walls to the lining membrane.
 The author also states that there are besides numerous branches of
 nerves from the great ganglionic plexuses at the base of the heart
 and surrounding the coronary arteries, with ganglia distributed over
 the surfaces of both the ventricles, which do not accompany the
 blood-vessels, but run obliquely across them, and also across the
 <U+FB01>bres of the muscular coat.       These super<U+FB01>cial cardiac nerves are
 described as being remarkably soft, <U+FB02>at, of a grey colour, and some
 what transparent, as had been formerly stated by Scarpa.         Towards
 the left side and apex of the left ventricle, these nerves lie in grooves
 or depressions of the muscular coat, and spread out into ganglionic
 enlargements, from which innumerable <U+FB01>laments are sent off late
 rally to the muscular coat. There are ganglia of considerable size
 on these super<U+FB01>cial nerves where they are crossing the arteries,
 which send branches to the coats of the vessels, and some of which
 branches pass down with the vessels into the substance of the heart.

    The Right Hon. Viscount Morpeth was elected into the Society.
    A paper was read, entitled “ On   a Function of the Red Corpus
cles of the Blood, and on the Process of Arterialization."          By
George Owen Rees; M.D., F.R.S. &c.
    The author states that he was <U+FB01>rst led to the new theory he has
formed for the explanation of the chemical phenomena of respira
tion, and more especially of the change in the colour of the blood
which occurs in that process, by having observed that a garlick
odour, similar to that evolved from phosphorus, was produced by
agitating in distilled water the clot obtained from some specimens
of venous blood. His attention was consequently directed to the
investigation of the state in which the phosphorus exists in the
 blood; and the result of that investigation was the theory, of which
the following is a succinct outline.
    The venous corpuscles are known to contain fat in combination
 with phosphorus.    This compound ingredient of the corpuscles, on
 coming into contact with atmospheric oxygen during the respiratory
 act, is consumed, and combining with that oxygen, forms the car
 bonic acid and water which are expired, and also phosphoric acid,
 which, uniting with the alkali of the liquor sanguinis, forms atri
 basic phosphate of soda. This salt, like many others, acts upon
 haematosine in such a manner as to produce the well-known bright
 arterial tint.
    The analyses which the author has performed in order to test the
 correctness of this theory were made upon the blood, both of the
 veins and of the arteries of the same animal; and also upon sepa
 rated portions of the same venous blood; one of which portions had
 been arti<U+FB01>cially arterialized by having been brought into contact
 with air, while the other portion had not been so exposed. These
 comparative experiments showed that arterial blood, both when ob
 tained from the vessels and when arti<U+FB01>cially produced, contains in
 its serum a larger proportion of tribasic phosphate of soda than that
 obtained from the veins.      The venous corpuscles, as they are con
 tained in the clot, yield a fatty matter combined with phosphorus;
 while those from arterial blood yield a fat, the ashes of which mani
 fest an alkaline reaction.    Thus the venous corpuscles are shown to
 be acted upon both by respiration and by the arti<U+FB01>cial arterializa
 tion of the blood, in such a manner as to lead to the formation of
 tribasic phosphate of soda at the expense of the phosphorus they
 contain.

                                         678
    No exact quantitative          analyses were attempted by the author,
 the comparative experiments having been performed on small por
 tions only of serum (from 25 to 40 grains); suf<U+FB01>ciently large, how
 ever, to furnish satisfactory evidence of the actual presence of the
 phosphate in arterial blood, and also’ in those portions of venous
 blood which had been arterialized out of the body; while no such
 indications were obtained from similar portions of the blood con
 tained in the veins.
    At the conclusion of the paper, the author notices the experi
 ments of Enderlin, in which no alkaline carbonate could be de
 tected in the ashes of blood; and shows that this is the natural con
 sequence of the phosphates of the clot being oxidized during com
 bustion, and thus supplying a quantity of phosphoric acid su<U+FB02>icient
 to decompose completely the alkaline carbonate produced by the
 incineration of the lactate and albuminate of the serum.               Most
 specimens of serum, even as obtained from arterial blood, yield an
 alkaline carbonate when incinerated; and this is always the case
 with the serum of venous blood.             The author, therefore, thinks
 himself warranted in regarding the conclusion founded on Endor
lin's experiments, that the blood contains no lactate, as being erro
 neous.

 By Signor Carlo Matteucci, Professor in the University of Pisa.
 Communicated by Michael Faraday, Esq., D.C.L., F.R.S., &c.
    The <U+FB01>fth series of these researches contains the sequel of the
author's investigations of induced contractions, which, in his third
memoir, published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1845, he
had considered as being due to nervous in<U+FB02>uence acting through
the muscles during their contraction, and was therefore referable to
a kind of nervous induction, and not to the generation of any elec
tric current by muscular contraction.            From the experiments re
lated in the present paper, he is led to the conclusion that the phe
nomena of induced contraction belong exclusively to the muscle in
the state of contraction.         He now, however, <U+FB01>nds reason for doubt
ing    that   the  fact  is  established that induced contractions are not
due    to  an  electric  discharge produced during the contraction of the
muscle.
    The second section of this memoir relates to the phenomena eli
cited by the passage of the electric current through the nerves of a
living animal, or of one recently killed, according to the direction
of the current.         He <U+FB01>nds that in whatever manner the current pass
ing through the nerve of the inverse limb is arrested, tetanic con
traction is excited.        In order to produce this effect, it is su<U+FB02>icient
to moisten the nerve with a large drop of water, or to double it

                                    679
 back upon itself.   Phenomena perfectly analogous to those observed
in frogs, may be produced in warm-blooded animals, by the action
of inverse currents; they continue, however, for a much shorter
time, especially if the vitality of the animal is very great.     These
phenomena clearly belong to the nerve, and have their origin in the
relation, the nature of which is yet undetermined, which exists be
 tween nervous in<U+FB02>uence and the action of the electric current ac
cording to the direction of that current.     Thus a limb traversed by
the direct current may be compared to a limb fatigued by repeated
effort.s; the inverse current may be supposed to act in an opposite
 manner, and during its passage, the nervous force may accumulate
 in the nerve. The facts here recorded may establish a fresh con
 nection between nervous in<U+FB02>uence and the passage of the electric
current according to its direction.
    The sixth series treats of the laws of the electric discharge of the
Torpedo and other electrical <U+FB01>shes, and of the theory of the pro
duction of electricity in these animals. Irritations applied to any
point of the body of an electrical <U+FB01>sh are transmitted by the nerves
to the fourth lobe of the brain, and are then followed by the elec
tric discharge: the nervous action by which this discharge is de
termined under the in<U+FB02>uence of the will resides in that fourth, or
electrical lobe of the brain; for after the three superior cerebral
lobes have been removed, the torpedo can still give the shock, either
voluntarily, or by external irritations.    The separation of the two
electricities which takes place in the cells of the electrical organ,
under nervous in<U+FB02>uence, are instantaneously reunited by the dis
charge.     The strength of the current obtained during the discharge
is proportional to the length of the cellular prisms included in the
closed circuit. The author concludes that the nervous force in
creases independently of the will with every increase in the activity
of the functions of circulation and of respiration, and of every act
of nutrition, and also under the in<U+FB02>uence of certain agents intro
duced into the system.
   The seventh and last series treats of the relation that exists be
tween the intensity of the electric current and that of the corre
sponding physiological effect.     A detailed account is given of the
apparatus employed, and of the method of experimenting, which
the author had recourse to in his researches on this branch of the
subject.     The amount of the contractions produced in muscles under
different circumstances of electric excitation is stated in a table
which closes the paper.
   2. “On different properties of Solar Radiation, producing or pre
venting a deposit of Mercury on Silver Plates coated with Iodine, or
its compounds with Bromine or Chlorine, modi<U+FB01>ed by coloured glass
media and the vapours of the atmosphere."            By A. C. Claudet.
Communicated by Sir David Brewster, K.H., D.C.L., F.R.S., &c.
   At an early period of the study of photography, it was observed
that the red, orange and yellow rays are endowed with antagonistic
powers, preventing and destroying the action produced by white

   .       I
                                    680
light, or by the rays properly called photogenic rays. One of the
<U+FB01>rst discoverers of this property was Dr. Draper of New York:
his experiments were made with the pure rays of the spectrum act
ing on the Daguerreotype plate. Previously to this, however, Sir
J. Herschel had made similar observations on the action of the pure
rays of the spectrum on several kinds of photogenic paper.             Dr.
Draper also found that the        red,  orange and yellow rays which
protect’the plate from ordinary photogenic action, are themselves
capable, when isolated, of producing a peculiar photogenic effect.
In opposition to the hypothesis of an antagonistic or destroying
action exercised by the red, orange and yellow rays, M. E. Bec
 querel announced that those rays are endowed with the property of
 continuing the action commenced by the photogenic rays.
     The author of the present paper has made a series of observations
 on light transmitted through certain colouring media, through the
 vapours of the atmosphere, and through red, orange and yellow
 glasses.    Having directed a camera obscura to the sun when his
 disc appeared through a fog quite red, he obtained, after ten seconds,
 a black image of the sun.       The red sun had produced no photo
 genic effect, although the surrounding spaces had been su<U+FB02>iciently
 affected by the photogenic rays coming from the zenith to attract
 the white vapour of mercury; thus proving that the red rays have
 no photogenic power.      In another experiment he left the plate in
 the camera during twenty minutes.          The sun had passed over a
 long space on the surface of the plate, and the result was a long
 image of the sun, quite black throughout; so that not only the red
 sun had produced no photogenic action, but the red rays had de
 stroyed the effect produced previous to their passage.       Not content
 with the result obtained by the slow motion of the sun, he next
 moved the camera obscura from right to left, and vice versoi, lower
 ing it each time by means of a screw.        In this manner the sun was
 made to pass rapidly over <U+FB01>ve or six zones of the plates, and its
 passage was marked by long black bands, while the intervals were
 white; showing again that in order to destroy the action of the
 photogenic rays, it was suf<U+FB01>cient to cause the red rays to pass rapidly
 over the spaces previously affected by the former.
     He afterwards operated with coloured glasses.           After having
 taken the impression of a piece of black lace by white light on a
 Daguerreotype plate, he covered one half of the plate and exposed
 the other to the radiation of a red glass. The mercury developed
an image of the lace on the part which had been acted on only by
 the white light; and the other part, which had afterwards received
 the action of the red rays, remained black.        The red glass had de
 stroyed  the photogenic  effect, precisely  as was  the case with the red
 light of the sun. He made similar experiments with orange and
yellow glass, and obtained analogous results, but in different periods
 of time. These experiments prove that the red, orange and yellow
 rays destroy the effect of photogenic light, whether these rays are
produced by the prism or by the action of coloured media; but the
 author believes that he was the <U+FB01>rst to remark, that after the de

                                        68l
struction of the photogenic effect, the plate is perfectly restored to
its former sensitiveness to white light.
     After exposing a plate to the daylight, and then submitting it to
the destructive action of red, orange or yellow rays, it will be found
to be again sensitive to the same white light.           lt appears from the
author's observations, that a plate may be exposed to thcsc two
actions alternately, for any number of times, without altering the
 <U+FB01>nal property of the surface, which will be invariably sensitive to
 the vapours of mercury, if its last exposure has been to the action
 of white light; whilst it will be deprived of that sensitiveness if it
 has been exposed lastly to the action of the red, orange or yellow
 rays. It results from the restoring action of the red, orange and
 yellow rays, that Daguerrcotype           plates may be prepared in open
 daylight;    and   that  in  order  to  give sensitivencss, it is necessary
 only   to place   the  plate   for some    minutes under red glass before
 putting   it into  the  camera   obscura.     The knowledge of this will be
 advantageous      to persons wishing     to  take views in places where it is
 di<U+FB02>icult to <U+FB01>nd dark rooms in which to prepare the plates.
     Besides the destructive actions of the red, orange and yellow
 glasses, these same radiations are endowed with a photogenic action
 of their own ; that is to say, they have, like the blue and violet rays,
 the power of causing the <U+FB01>xation of mercurial vapours.                Those
 radiations, therefore, are endowed with two actions of a contrary
  nature; one destructive of the effect of the photogenic light, and
  the other producing an effect analogous to that light.
     The photogenic action of the red rays is 5000 times, that of the
  orange 500 times, and that of the yellow 100 times slower than white
  light in producing an equal amount of effect. The destructive action
  of the red rays is 100 times slower than that of the white light, the
 orange 50 times, and the yellow only 10 times. When a plate has
  been exposed to the destructive action of any particular ray, it can
  not be affected photogenically by the radiation which has destroyed
  ther<U+FB01>rst effect; it is sensitive only to the other radiations.         The
  photogenic action of any radiation cannot be continued by another.
     The solar spectrum is therefore endowed with three different pho
  togenic actions, and three different destroying actions, correspond
  ing with the red, the yellow and the blue rays. The three photo
  genic actions of the spectrum thus distinguished have distinct cha
  racters; each of these radiations is endowed with a photogenic
  power peculiar to itself, and which gives to the Daguerreotype plate
  an a<U+FB02>inity for mercurial vapours; nevertheless these three actions
  are so different, that we cannot, by mixing them arti<U+FB01>cially, make
  one assist the other; for they are antagonistic.            The effect pro
  duced by the blue rays is destroyed by the red and yellow; the red
  and yellow mutually destroy each other, and the effect of either is
  destroyed by the blue.       The alternate changes of the surface of the
  plate by these three kinds of radiation seem to prove that the chemi
  cal compound remains always the same under these different in
  <U+FB02>uences, and that there is no separation or disengagement of the
  constituent elements.

                                       682
      The author has no doubt that electricity, which accompanies each
  radiation, acts positively under the in<U+FB02>uence of the one, and nega
  tively under that of the other, without changing the chemical com
  pound; in the one case this in<U+FB02>uence would give the a<U+FB02>inity for
  mercury, and in the other it would destroy it.
      3.  “ On the Value of Absolute Alcohol in Spirits of different
  Speci<U+FB01>c Gravities."        By George Fownes, Esq., F.R.S., Professor of
  Practical Chemistry in University College, London.
     Having been recently engaged in a series of experiments on the
  fermentation of sugar and molasses, which rendered it necessary to
  refer to atable of the value in absolute alcohol of spirits of different
 speci<U+FB01>c gravities, the author found himself compelled to construct
  for this purpose a new table, which he lays before the Royal Society
 in the present paper.
     The table was formed by weighing out absolute alcohol and di
 stilled water in <U+FB01>xed proportions, mixing them, and after allowing
 time for condensation, determining with suitable precautions the
 speci<U+FB01>c gravity of each mixture at the temperature of 60° Fahren
 heit.      Each alternate number in the table was so obtained; the rest
 being     interpolated.    The alcohol employed was prepared by digest
 ing the strongest recti<U+FB01>ed spirit, <U+FB01>rst with dry carbonate of potash
 and afterwards with powdered quicklime and distilling. It had the
 speci<U+FB01>c gravity -7938 at 60°, and boiled at 177° Fahr.
     The table is followed by a diagram for the purpose of contrasting
 the actual speci<U+FB01>c gravities found by experiment with the calcu
 lated mean speci<U+FB01>c gravities of the various mixtures of alcohol and
water, in which the speci<U+FB01>c gravities are indicated by horizontal
lines and the proportions of the two liquids by vertical lines.        The
mean speci<U+FB01>c gravities of course run straight across the diagram
from corner to corner, while the actual speci<U+FB01>c gravities form; an
irregular curve with upward convexity, rising rapidly to near its
maximinmdeviation          at 30 per cent., proceeding nearly parallel with
the other line to 50 per cent., and thence declining until it reaches
the extremity of the scale.

at the Terrestrial Surface, &c., and their connection with the Diur
nal Variation of the Horizontal Magnetic Needle."              By W. H.
Barlow, Esq., M.I.C.E.           Communicated     by Peter Barlow, Esq.,
F.R.S., &c.
     The observations recorded in this paper were undertaken in con
sequence of certain spontaneous de<U+FB02>ections having been noticed in
the needles of the Electric Telegraph on the Midland Railway.
The telegraph is constructed on the principle patented by Messrs.
Wheatstone and Cooke, and the signals are made by de<U+FB02>ecting a
magnetic needle placed in a coil, to the right or left, by means of a
galvanic battery.        It was observed that when no signals were pass
ing, and when the wires of the telegraph had simply connexion
with the earth at the two termini, spontaneous de<U+FB02>ections, differing

                                   683
in amount and direction, occasionally occurred.        lt was also ob
served in the four principal llnn's of telegraph which unite at Derby
as a centre, two of which proceed in a northerly direction to Leeds
and to Lincoln, and two in a soutln.-rly direction to Birminglm|n
and to llugby,-that the relative de<U+FB02>ections of the four instruments
were such as to indicate that when the current of electricity, which
produced the de<U+FB02>ection. <U+FB02>owed from liugby northwards towards
Derby, it was also <U+FB02>owing northwards in ull the other three; and
likewise, that when it <U+FB02>owed southwards in one, it <U+FB02>owed south
wards in all; the times of the de<U+FB02>ections being simultaneous or
nearly so. There appeared to be no regularity as to the hours,
either during the day or night, at which thcsc de<U+FB02>ections occurred.
Atmospheric electricity also affected the instruments, but in general
only by sudden and violent effects during thunder storms, some
times reversing thc poles of the needles contained in the coils, and
sometimes fusing the wire of the coil itself.     llut the cffects <U+FB01>rst
mentioned appeared to arise from a diffcrent cause; and from the
great extent of line affected simultaneously by currents in the same
direction, it appeared impossible they could arisc from local atmo
spheric in<U+FB02>ucnces.      On the night of Friday the l9th of March,
there appeared u brilliant aurora, und during the whole time of its
remaining visible, rapidly alternating de<U+FB02>ections were exhibited in
the telegraph instruments.
    The occurrence of these phenomena induced the author, with de
<U+FB02>ectometers of very delicate construction, to make a series of expe
riments, from which the following results were deduced. Wires in
sulated throughout, and wires having only one connexion with the
earth, produced no de<U+FB02>ection; and a complete circuit made by
uniting both extremities of two wires, each forty-one miles long, but
insulated throughout, produced no de<U+FB02>ection.       In every case, how
ever, a de<U+FB02>ection was obtained on a wire having both ends con
nected with the earth, which de<U+FB02>ection was continually varying
in amount and sometimes in direction.
   On making a series of observations every <U+FB01>ve minutes for twenty
four hours, at both extremities of a wire, from Derby to Birming
ham, it was found that the changes, both of amount and direction,
occurred simultaneously at the two ends, and that the current <U+FB02>owed
from one end communicating with the earth to the other.            The
examination of this series of observations         showed a general
direction of the needle to the right from noon till near midnight,
and then to the left until between nine and ten A.M., when it again
changed to the right.     In consequence of this apparent regularity,
the experiments were carefully followed up at Derby for a fortnight
on the two telegraphic wires proceeding from Derby to Rugby and
Birmingham. These experiments showed that the electric current
was subject to a regular diurnal alternation, the times of zero agree
ing nearly with the known times of zero of the variation of the mag
netic needle; and also that the de<U+FB02>ection to the left corresponded
with easterly-variation, and the ‘de<U+FB02>ection to the right with westerly
variation; the path described by the needle of the de<U+FB02>ectometer

                                       684.
being by no means steady and uniform, but subject to alternating
changes of greater or less amount.            The effects exhibited on these
wires, and which, from the experiments, were found to occur on the
north of Derby as well as on the south, would be accounted for by
supposing that they were caused by alternating currents of elec
tricity on the earth's surface in a northerly and southerly,direc
tion, proceeding towards the north until 9A.M., and towards the
south until from 7 to 12 P.M., and then again turning northwards;
agreeing, therefore, nearly in point of time with the usual times of
daily change in the direction of the magnetic needle.            The experi
ments, as has been stated, were continued during a fortnight, and
the de<U+FB02>ection noted every <U+FB01>ve minutes, day and night.                    The
paper contains the tabular records of these observations; and also
diagrams are given exhibiting the daily path of the needle.
    The author concludes his paper by expressing his regret that his
avocations do not allow him suf<U+FB01>cient leisure to prosecute this in
quiry, but that he will be happy to place in the hands of any person
desirous of pursuing the subject all the tables and results which he
has collected.
    5. “ On the Direction assumed by Plants during their growth." By
Professor Macaire, of Geneva.               Communicated by P. M. Roget,
M.D., Sec. R.S.. &c.
    This paper is divided into three sections.
    The <U+FB01>rst section contains an account of some observations and
 experiments made by the author on the phenomena of the curling
 of the tendrils of the Tamas communis. After a description of the
 tendril, which in this plant is the footstalk of an abortive leaf, the
 author shows that the contractile power of the organ is excited by
 contact with any object whatsoever, and even with another part of
 the same plant; that the curling begins at the point of contact, but
 continues in both ends of the tendril, either forming knots, if there
 be something to embrace, or taking the shape of a cork-screw, if
 there be not.      The knots are completed in a few minutes, and exert
 a considerable degree of pressure.            A separation from the plant
 stops  the   curling up  of  the  tendril.   The  curling always takes place
 in the same direction from the outside inwards.            When the tendril
 is immersed in water, or in a solution of gum, it does not contract;
 but at the same time it does not lose the faculty of curling up.by
 contact with a solid body.          Ammonia, alcohol, or Eau de Cologne
 have   little or  no effect.    Diluted    sulphuric and nitric acids, even
 the vapours alone     of  the  last, without    actua] contact, immediately
 excite in the tendril      an    energetic contraction.     The same thing
 happens with a solution of corrosive sublimate.            On the contrary,
 prussic acid stops the curling up that had already begun, and renders
 the tendril incapable of being again excited by the contact of a
  solid body.
     The conclusions which the author comes to on this subject are,
 that the contractions of tendrils cannot be expla.ined- by the hypo
  theses of Knight and De Candolle of an unequal action of light on

                                 685
the two sides, for they are too rapid to be the effect of so slow a
process; but that they are the result of a vital property residing in
p    organ, on which the poisons act as they do on the sensitive
  ant.
lillé
   The second section relates to the direction of stems towards the
light. A<U+FB02>er having described the nature of the phenomenon, and
stated the explanation of it given by De Candolle, namely, the bend
ing of the stem by an accumulation of carbon and the consequent
hardening of the side most acted upon        by
                                              light, the author endea
vours to ascertain if the light exercises real attraction for the green
                                         a
parts of plants.   He operated on naturally <U+FB02>oating plants, such as
the duckweed (Lemna minor and Pol;/rhino), and on different species
of other plants placed on cork <U+FB02>oats. He placed each of them on
water in vases which were partly darkened by screens, and he never
saw the plants receiving from the light an impulsion which brought
the <U+FB02>oats away from the spot where they had been placed. When the
plants, fully developed, were kept in the dark part of the vase, there
sprouted from the neck of the root  a    new stem, slender and blanched,
that ran all along the water so as to reach the diaphragm, and then
gave out leaves and grew erect; but the <U+FB02>oat was never attracted
towards the light, although the new stem which the plant had to
produce was often three feet and more in length.         In the course of
these experiments, he had occasion to notice the tendency of roots
 when developed in the light in water, to take     a    spiral shape, and
 found that the white light appears to favour the production of radi
 cular <U+FB01>brils, while, on the contrary, the blue light opposes it.
    In examining the grounds of Dutrochet's theory on the existence
in stems of two systems of cells and <U+FB01>bres decreasing in size from
the circumference to the centre, and from the centre to the circum
ference,  by   which he explains by endosmose the bending of the
stem, the author has found that this bending in contrary directions
of the two parts of stem slit longitudinally has nothing to do with
                      a
light. In cutting the stem in various directions,      it   always bends
 outwards by the swelling of the cells and the resistance of the cuti
 cle, and does not bend at all if   this last
                                           is   removed or slit across in
 two or three places.
    To ascertainif   the sap could be supposed to travel by endosmose
 from cell to cell, he placed within one another three endosmose
 tubes <U+FB01>lled with a    solution of sugar; the last, or largest, plunging
 in water. This was the only one in which any endosmose was visi
 ble, the difference in density from the others being insuf<U+FB01>cient to
 produce it. It  is  probable that  it   would be the same for the cells
 of plants; and some facts have induced him to think that the liquids
 penetrate chie<U+FB02>y through the intercellular spaces of the vegetable
 tissue.   He has assured himself by experiments that neither heat
 nor light have any in<U+FB02>uence in increasing the quantity or the rapi
 dity of endosmose, and he is, consequently, little inclined to admit
 this phenomenon as exercising the in<U+FB02>uence sometimes attributed to
 it in vegetation, and especially in the inclination of stems towards
 the light.

                                   686
    The third section relates to the direction of the leaves of plants.
 After having described the appearance and structure of the two
surfaces of leaves, and mentioned the known fact of the direction of
 the superior or varnished surface towards the light, the author re
 views the labours of Bonnet and Dutrochet on this subject.        As no
 direct experiments had proved that the direction 'of leaves is due t0
 the in<U+FB02>uence of light itself, he begins by showing, <U+FB01>rst, that the
turning over of inverted leaves does not take place regularly in com
 plete obscurity; secondly, that it is possible to induce a leaf to turn
 itself over by screening its superior surface, and by lighting its in
 ferior one with an inclined mirror; and thirdly, that when both the
 surfaces of the leaf are illuminated, the leaf takes a globular form
 so as to protect the inferior surface from the light.     He afterwards
 shows that although in most plants the turning over of inverted         1
leaves takes place through .a movement of the footstalk, yet in some
 of them it is the <U+FB01>at part of the leaf that curls itself over, and that
in all the same thing happens when it is the best way of bringing
 back the superior surface of the leaf towards the light. This is the
 case, for instance, when the footstalk has been removed, and when
the inferior surface is lighted by a mirror and the superior one is
screened by a piece of black paper <U+FB01>xed to it. The <U+FB02>at part of the
leaf bends its edges and takes a globular form.
    The two surfaces of the leaf do not seem to be under the in<U+FB02>u
ence of any real attraction towards the light, for when placed in an
inverted position on moveable <U+FB02>oats, the leaf turns itself over by
means of the footstalk, or the curling of the <U+FB02>at part, without cre
ating any motion in the <U+FB02>oat.      The removal of one or many lea<U+FB02>ets
in a compound leaf, or of part of a single leaf, does not prevent the
turning over of the remainder when placed towards the light in an
inverted position.    By means of coloured glasses, the purity of the
light of which had been ascertained by the prism, it has been shown
that the leaves turn over best in the blue rays; next in the violet,
but not at all in the red.
    The author next examines the differences produced in the power
of leaves to exhale and decompose carbonic acid, according as the
light shines on one or other of their surfaces. In order to measure
the exhalation, he placed in a bottle full of water of known Weight,
a leaf with one of its surfaces darkened and the other exposed to
light, changing the surfaces alternately while the experiment lasted.
The result of a great many series of experiments has been to show
that the loss of water by exhalation in all temperatures and by all
weathers is much more considerable during the same time when the
inferior surface of the leaf is exposed to light, than when the supe
rior surface is so exposed. This increase explains the rapid wither
ing and subsequent death of inverted leaves which cannot turn them
selves over.    In coloured glasses the blue rays created the greatest
exhalation; next the diffused white light; next the green; the red
rays coming last.                                        -
    On examining, under the same     circumstances,   the decomposition
of carbonic acid, the author <U+FB01>rst sought in what part of the leaf this

                                     687
chemical power resided.          He found that the green matter did not
possess   it in itself, that it operated in the cells of the parcnchyma,
and that the vessels and pores of the cuticle have u useful in<U+FB02>uence
in the phenomenon, so as to increase the quantity of oxygen gas
disengaged.       When solar light is received on the superior surface
of leaves immersed in spring water, the quantity of oxygen gas dis
engaged is, in the same time and under similar circumstances, two
or three times greater than when it is received on the inferior sur
face.    The same difference may be observed in the di<U+FB02>nsed light,
by means of the leaves of Cun|clliajapomba, Portugal laurel, and
some others which, \\ hen kept during some time in the dark in
spring water, give out, when brought into the light, bubbles of oxy
gen gas through the central vessels of the footstalk.
   The following is a brief rccnpitulation of the facts which the
author has attempted to prove in this paper:—
    l. The theories advnnced to explain the curling up of tendrils,
do not agree with the experiments made on those of the Tamus
communis, this phenomenon being the result ofa vital irritability
acted upon by chemical agents.
   2. The direction of the green parts of plants towards the light is
not the result of an attraction properly so called.
   3. The.bending outwards of slit stems is due to thc elongation of
the cellular tissue by endosmose of water and the resistance of the
cuticle.
   4-. The quantity or rapidity of endosmose is not in<U+FB02>uenced by heat
or light.
   5. Light is the only agent of the natural position of lcaves and
of their turning over when inverted.          The blue are the most, the
red the least active rays.
   6. Light does not act in this case by a physical attraction or re
pulsion, properly so called.
   7. The turning over of leaves takes place sometimes by a torsion
of the footstalk, sometimes by a curling of the <U+FB02>at part.
   8. The blue rays appear to be the most, and the red the least
active in operating the turning over of leaves.
   9. The exhalation of leaves is much increased when their inferior
surface is exposed to light.
   10. The decomposition of carbonic acid and the disengagement
of oxygen gas are, under the same circumstances, considerably di
minished.
   6. “ On the Solution of Linear Differential Equations."            By
Charles James Hargreave, Esq., B.L., F.R.S., Professor of Juris
prudence in University College, London.
   1. By the aid of two simple theorems expressing the laws under
which the operations of differentiation combine with operations de
noted by factors, functions of the independent variable, the author
arrives at a principle extensively applicable to the solution of equa
tions, which may be stated as follows :—“ if any linear equation
¢(.'r,D ).u=X have for its solution u=\,L(x,D).X, this solution being

                                              688
so written that the operations   included under the function       are not         ~11
performed or suppressed, then ¢(D,—:c).u=X has for its solution
u=¢r(D,—x).X.” The solution thus obtained may not be, and often
   not, interpretable, at least in <U+FB01>nite terms; but         by any trans
                                                                       it if

to represent    true result.
                 a
   An important solution immediately deducible from this principle
is given by Mr. Boole in the Philosophical Magazine for February
184-7, and    extensively employed in the present paper.
             is                                               It imme              is
diately obtained   by making    the  conversion   above  proposed in the
general equation   of the  <U+FB01>rst order  and its solution.
   2. By the use of this theorem and the general theorems above
referred to, the solution of the equation
             D*u+2Q.Du+(¢’+Q’+Q'—                         ~)u=P,

of which various particular         cases and transformations              are given and
discussed;    including the well-known forms

                                                                           I

   The application of the process to equations of the third and higher

the equation

and by the application of the theorems <U+FB01>rst referred to,     still more        a
general form      issolved.
    The solutions above-mentioned are subject to the important re

operations are to be repeated) must be integer; but in the subse
quent part of the paper, a mode is suggested ofinstantaneously con
verting these solutions into de<U+FB01>nite integrals not affected by the re
atriction.
   8. The interchange of symbols above suggested frequently renders
available forms of solution which otherwise would not be interpret
able in <U+FB01>nite terms.     The operation (¢D)" is not intelligible if m
be a fraction; but if by any legitimate process this be changed into
the factor (¢(—r))"', the restriction ceases to operate.    By the ap
plication  of this principle, solutions of a simple character are ob
tained for (b being integer),

that the number and order of the operations in the solution are ex
pressed generally, and not by a series of substitutions involving

                                                          described as
follows: they consist in the performance (repeated m
                                                       times) of ope
rations of the form ¢D upon the second side X; multiplication by
the factor z-—1; and the performance (repeated m—1
                                                        times) of the
inverse operation (QD)—l; and         will be seen that, in all cases
                                                               it

integrals by changing ¢D into ¢z, multiplying by s", changing x—'

 on the Respiratory Movements, with some remarks on Muscular
 Power, in Man." By John Hutehinson, M.R.C.S. Communicated
 by Sir Benjamin Brodie, Bart., F.R.S., &c.
     The object of this.paper is to demonstrate by models and dis
 sections the action of the intercostal muscles.
     After premising an account of the views of several eminent phy
 siologists, and in particular those promulgated by Haller, the author
 shows that they re'olve themselves into the general opinion that the
 scalcne or other muscles of the neck <U+FB01>x the <U+FB01>rst rib, in order to
 enable the two sets of intercostal muscles to act either separately or
 conjointly, as inspiratory or expiratory muscles.    IIe then proceeds
 to state the proofs that the intercostal muscles possess an action
 which is independent of any other muscle, and also independent of
 each other, so that any of the twelve ribs may be elevated or de
 pressed by them either separately or conjointly.      He demonstrates
 the nature of this action by means of models, producing oblique
 tensions between levers representing the ribs, and allowing of rota
 tion on their centres of motion; and he shows that such tension in
 the direction of the external intercostal muscles, elevates both the
 levers until the tension ceases, or the position of the bars by proxi

mity obstruct each other.     If the tension be exerted in a contrary
direction, as in the internal intercostal muscles, the bars are both
depressed.    This movement was demonstrated by a model. It was
farther shown that two tensions decussating can, according to the
position of the fulcra, be made to act as associates or antagonists to
each other.    Such motions are to be considered with reference to
the fulcra, bars with one fulcrum common to each having no such
action; and the author accordingly draws the following conclu
sions :
   lst. All the external intercostal muscles are true inspiratory mus
cles, elevators of the ribs, and with this act they dilate the inter
costal spaces, thus increasing the cavity of the chest.
   2nd. The internal intercostal muscles have a double action; the
portions situated between the cartilages are associates in action
with the external layer, and act as elevators of the cartil-ages, while
the portion between the ribs are depressors, or antagonists of the
external layer, and are here true expiratory muscles; with this they
decrease the intercostal spaces.
   3rd. These muscles can elevate or depress the ribs independently
of any other muscle, <U+FB01>xing the <U+FB01>rst or last rib. Any one lamella,
or series of muscles, can, as required, independently perform in
spiration or expiration at any one of the twenty-two intercostal
spaces.                                                           g
   4-th.    ln inspiration, the intercostal     increase, with a short
                                                spaces
ening  of the muscle;  and  in expiration, they decrease their perpen
dicular distance, with a shortening of the muscle.
   5th. All parallel intercostal muscles, acting with uniform force,
concur in the same effect, whether near the fulcrum or more distant
from   it,
         and these muscles gain power with their increasing obliquity
     well
                                                                      i
as           as speed.
     In the third part of the paper an account     given of the differ
                                                         is
ence between the external thoracic space and the internal pulmonic
space.    The respiratory movements are described in health and
disease, and      itshown that the chest
                         is                    rarely enlarged at two
                                                    is
places at one and the same time.
   In conclusion the author conceives that he has established the
following propositions :—
   lst. Costal breathing may be distinguished from abdominal by
determining which part       <U+FB01>rst put in motion, and the kind of re
                              is
spiration may be designated according to the name of such part.
   2nd. Healthy costal breathing begins with the motion of a supe
rior rib, which    followed by that of the lower ones in succession.
                         is
   3rd. Ordinary respiration in men      abdominal, in women, costal;
                                               is
extraordinary breathing      the same in both sexes.
                               is
   4th. Any of the ribs, from the twelfth to the <U+FB01>rst, may carry on
respiration.
   5th. Diseased respiration    of various kinds; the movements may
                                    is
be symmetric or not symmetric, costal or abdominal; all or none of
the ribs may move; the abdomen may or may not move; the chest

                                   G93
may dilate in all its dimensions at one and the same time; costal and
abdominal breathing may alternate with one another; co.-tal motion
may be undulating or not; and all these may be combined in one,
which the author terms “l|0.ri1uling breathilig ;" and lastly, the quan
tity of air breathed is diminished when there exists pulmonary dis
ease.
   8. “ ()n the Structure    and Development of the Liver."        liy C.
Hand<U+FB01>eld Jones, M.B., Cantab.         Communicated by Sir Benjamin
C. Brodie, Bart., F.R.S., &-c.
    The author gives a detailed description of the structure of the
liver in animals belonging to various classes of the animal kingdom.
He states that in the Bryuzoon, a highly organized polype, it in clearly
of the follicular type; and that in the Asterias, the function of the
liver is probably shared between the closed appendage of the stomach
and the terminal caeca of the large ramifying prolongations of the
digestive sac contained in the several rays.      Among the Annulosa,
the earthworm presents an arrangement of the elements of the he
patic organ, corresponding in simplicity with the general con<U+FB01>gura
tion of the body, a single layer of large biliary cells being applied as
a kind of coating over the greater part of the intestinal canal.       In
another member of the same class, the Leech, in which the digest
ive cavity is much less simple, and presents a number of sacculi
on each side, these elements have a very different disposition; and
the secreting cells, although some remain isolated, for the most
part coalesce to form tubes, having a succession of dilatations
and constrictions, and <U+FB01>nally uniting and opening into the intes
tine.    ln Insects, the usual arrangement is that of long curved <U+FB01>la
mentary tubes, which wind about the intestine; these, in the meat
<U+FB02>y, are sacculated throughout the greater part of their course. till
they arrive quite close to the pylorus, where they open; near their
origin they appear to consist of separate vesicles. which become
gradually fused together, but occasionally they are seen quite sepa
rate.    The basement membrane of the tubes is strongly marked,
and encloses a large quantity of granular matter of a yellowish tinge,
with secreting cells; another portion of the liver consists of sepa
rate cells lying in a granular blastema, which cells, in a later stage
of development, are seen to be included in vesicles or short tubes
of homogeneous membrane, often coalescing and exhibiting a more
or less manifestly plexiform arrangement;          this portion   of the
liver is regarded by Mr. Newport as really adipose tissue. The
author has termed it the Parenchymatous portion of the liver, on
account of its general appearance and mode of development, though
he has not been able to determine whether the tubes always origi
nate from it. Among the Arachnida, the follicular type of arrange
ment prevails; and the same is the case with the Crustacea, the folli
cles in these last being distinctly visible to the naked eye. In Mol
lnsca. also, we <U+FB01>nd the follicular arrangement universally to obtain;
yet in certain cases the limiting membrane of the follicles cannot be

                                      694
 shown to exist, and the author therefore thinks that its importance
 is probably not great, but that it serves chie<U+FB02>y to ful<U+FB01>l the me
 chanical function which its synonym “ basement" indicates.                 The
 quantity   of retained  secretion  in  the liver    of  molluscs seems  clearly
 to imply that the bile in them is not an excrementitious <U+FB02>uid; it is
 used slowly on account of the imperfect character of the respira
                                                 r
 tion.
     In passing from the Invertebrata to the Vertebrate division of the
 animal kingdom, and beginning with the class of Fishes, a great
 change is immediately manifest in the form and character of the
 biliary organ ; it is now a gland of solid texture, to which the term
parenchyma! is justly applied.         Two portions may be distinguished
 init,  namely,  the  secreting  parenchyma,       consisting of delicate cells,
 or very often of nuclei, granular and elaborated matters in great
 part, and the excreting ducts, which, though completely obscured
 by the surrounding bulky parenchyma, may yet be satisfactorily de
 monstrated, and traced often to their terminal extremities in. the
 following manner. If branch of the hepatic duct be taken up in
                             a
 the forceps,    itmay be dissected out without much dif<U+FB01>culty from
the surrounding substance, which          isvery soft and yields readily to
gentle manipulation; when         a   trunk      isin this way removed and
placed under the microscope,          a multitude of minute rami<U+FB01>cations
are seen adhering to it; among these not               few may be discovered,
                                                       a
which do not appear to have suffered injury; some are occasionally
seen terminating by distinctly closed extremities; more usually the
duct becomes very minute and gradually loses all de<U+FB01>nite structure,
appearing at last like       amere tract of granular matter; in either
case there  is  no communication by continuity with the surrounding
parenchyma.       Large yellow corpuscles, peculiar cells, and consi  a
derable quantity of free oily matter usually existing in the liver of
various <U+FB01>shes, seem generally to indicate a great superiority in the
amount of secretory over that of excretory action, and to betoken
clearly the feeble intensity of the aerating function.
                                                                                \
    In Reptiles, there  is the same arrangement in the liver, namely,
a secreting parenchyma of cells and an apparatus of excretory ducts,
which have the same essential characters as those of <U+FB01>shes; but
there exists very frequently in the parenchyma remarkable dark
corpuscles, which appear to be masses of retained biliary matter,
the import of which, in the situation they occupy,                doubtless the
                                                                 is
same as that of the similar masses existing in <U+FB01>shes.
    In Birds, the parenchyma of the liver         isremarkably free from oily
or retained biliary matters;     it  often consists almost wholly of free
nuclei and granular matter, with scarcely a single perfect cell; the
excretory ducts often greatly resemble those of reptiles, sometimes
rather those of mammalia; the essential character          is, however, always
the same, namely, that they terminate without forming any important
connexion with the parenchyma.
    In Mammalia, the parenchyma of the liver consists usually of per
fect cells, which are arranged often        inlinear series of considerable

                                   695
length, radiating from the axis of each lobule; these unite at various
points with each other, so as to present a more or less decidedly
plexiform appearance. Each lobule, as described by Mr. Kiernan,
is separated from the adjacent ones by the terminal twigs of the
                                                   “ <U+FB01>ssure," though in
portal vein, and to a greater or less extent by a
most animals the lobules are continuous with cach other both above
and below the <U+FB01>ssure. The elaboration of the secreted product
seems to be most completely e<U+FB02>ected in the cells adjoining the
margins of the lobules, which are often seen to contain a larger
quantity of biliary matter than tho-e in the interior, and to be appa
rently in the act of discharging it into the <U+FB01>.-.-urc; the margin of
the lobule then presents an irregular surface with large globules of
the secretion clustering together all over it. The capsule of Glisson
surrounding the vessels in the portal canals gives a <U+FB01>brous invest
ment to those surfaces of the lohulcs which are towards the canal ;
but when it has arrived in the ti-'sures, it forms a continuous mem
brane lining the surfaces of opposite lubules; this membrane is often
 truly homogeneous, and closely resembles the has‘ ment tissue: there
appears occasionally to mi. a delicate epithelium on its free surface;
 but this, as well as the membrane itself, is often absent, when the
 margin of the lobules is in that condition which has just been de
 scribed and which may be termed uctire.        The minute branches of
 the hepatic duct as they approach their termination undergo a re
 markable alteration in their structure; they lose their <U+FB01>brous coat,
 which blends itself with the membranous expansions of the capsule
 of Glisson; their basement membrane becomes gradually indistinct,
 and at last ceases to exist, and the epithelial particles no longer
 retain their individuality, but appear to be reduced to mere nuclei,
 set yery close together in a faintly granular basis substance.     The
 mode of their termination is not uniformly the same; frequently they
 present distinctly closed rounded extremities, between one and two
 thonsandths of an inch in diameter; at other times they seem to
 cease gradually in the midst of <U+FB01>brous tissue, the nuclei alone being
 disposed for some little way in such a manner as to convey the idea
 of acontinuation of the duct. These ducts can seldom be dis
 cerned in the <U+FB01>ssures, but have several times been seen in the
 “ spaces," where several <U+FB01>ssures unite; they do not form anything
 like a plexus between the lobules. From the anatomical relation of
 the ducts to the parcnchymu, and from the circumstance that a
  distinct vessel conveying a different kind of blood is distributed to
  the hepatic duct, as soon as the liver assumes the parenchymal form,
  it seems probable that the mode in which the secreted bile is con
  veyed out of the organ, is by its permeating the coats of the minute
  ducts in obedience to an endosmotic attraction, which takes place
  between the bile in which the ducts may be said to be bathed, and
  a denser (perhaps mucous) <U+FB02>uid formed in their interior.          The
  large quantity of oily matter frequently existing in a free state in
  the secreting parencbyma of the liver, which must be regarded as a
  product of secretory action, seems to suggest the idea, that a cer
  tain quantity of the biliary secretion may be directly absorbed into

                                  696
 the blood, and in this manner conveyed away from the organs, just
 as occurs in the thyroid body, suprarenal capsules, and other
 glands unprovided with efferent ducts.
    With respect to the development of the liver, the author considers
the opinion of Reichart to be decidedly the correct one, namely,
that its formation commences by a cellular growth from the germi
nal membrane, independently of any protrusion of the intestinal
canal.    On the morning of the <U+FB01>fth day, the oesophagus and stomach
are clearly discernible, the liver lying between the heart, which is in
front, and the stomach which is behind; itis manifestly a parenchy
mal mass, and its border is quite distinct and separate from the digest
ive canal; at this period, the vitelline duct is wide, it does not open
into the abdominal cavity, but its canal is continued into an anterior
and posterior division', which are tubes of homogeneous membrane,
<U+FB01>lled, like the duct, with opaque oily contents; the anterior one
runs forwards, and forms behind the liver a terminal expanded
cavity, from which then passes one offset, which, gradually dilating,
opens into the stomach; a second, which runs ina direction up
wards and backwards, and forms apparently a caecal prolongation;
and a third and fourth, which are of smaller size, arise from the
anterior part of the cavity and run to the liver, though they cannot
be seen to ramify in its substance; at a somewhat later period, these
offsets waste away, excepting the one which is continued into the
stomach, and then the mass of the liver is completely free and un
connected with any part of the intestine.        As the vitelline duct
contracts, the anterior and posterior prolongations of it become
fairly continuous and form a loop of intestine, the posterior division
being evidently destined to form the cloaca and lower part of the
canal.    The <U+FB01>nal development of the hepatic duct takes place about
the ninth day by a growth proceeding from the liver itself, and
consisting of exactly similar material; this growth extends towards
the lower part of the loop of duodenum, which is now distinct, and
appears to blend with the coats of the intestine; around       it,at its
lower part, the structure of the pancreas  is  seen to be in process of
formation.    The further progress of development of the hepatic
duct will, the author thinks, require to be carefully examined, but
the details he has given in this paper have satis<U+FB01>ed him of the cor
rectness of the statement that the structure of the liver is essentially
parenchymal.

         GENTLEMEN,
  Smcn our last Anniversary, your Council have been much occupied
  with anxious deliberation on many subjects of great importance to
  our Society: among these, the one that chie<U+FB02>y interests science is
  perhaps the question, how we may most completely secure the proofs
  of priority in the communication of scienti<U+FB01>c discovery.           For this
  purpose we have framed rules which I hope may be found su<U+FB02>icient
  for the attainment of our object.
      I regret extremely that it is not in my power to announce to you
  that any tidings have reached us from our gallant countrymen who
  have engaged in the arduous enterprise of again exploring the icy
  regions of the Arctic Seas. There is no reason indeed for our feel

     r
                                    699
ing any alarm      as to the safety of Sir John Franklin and his brave
 companions, but it is impossible for us not to be anxious on their
account.      Let us hope that the same gracious Providence that
 shielded Sir James Ross amongst the icebergs of the South will
protect also our adventurous sailors in the North.
    Since our last Meeting in June, l trust, Gentlemen, that you will
 think that our Apartments have assumed a more creditable appear
 ance.    It is more than forty yours since our rooms were painted; a
long period in the smoky and dingy atmosphere of London. I hope
 the time may come when ingenuity and science combined may, in
 some degree at least, abate this great drawback to the convenience
and comfort of the British metropolis.       Your Council, and that of
 our friends and neighbours, the Society of Antiquaries, feeling that
they ought not longer to delay to repaint their rcspcctive apartments,
have united in doing so to the staircase and ante-room, which are
common to both bocieties.        l am happy to add, that by the care
that has been taken in the management of this affair. its expense
 has been much reduced from that on the former occasion.        lts cost
has, however, been still necessarily considerable; but l trust that it
has been so well done, that though we cannot expect such a period
as forty years again to intervene, yet that it will be some time be
 fore we are obliged to repaint our apartments.
    In spite of this unusual expense, lam glad to say that our <U+FB01>nances
are in so good a state, that we have been able to invest in the pub
lic funds the large sum of two thousand pounds. You must not
however imagine that this is the surplus of the present year; for the
truth is, that according to our usual custom one-half of this sum
would have been funded immediately after our Anniversary, and
would so have come into our <U+FB01>nancial statement of next November.
The lowness of the funds, and the present state of the money mar
ket, have rendered it expedient for us to invest the money without
further delay. A portion of our surplus has arisen from the unusual
circumstance that two of our Fellows who had paid annual sub
scriptions have compounded in the last year ; their composition has
produced the sum of eighty pounds, but of course our annual in
come is by this means proportionably diminished.
    During the last year, an important alteration has been made in
 our Statutes with reference to the election of new Fellows, as you
must be well aware.       This change was made with the approbation
 of a large majority of your Council. As I was one of those who
 entertained considerable doubts of its prudence and expediency, I
 cannot claim any praise if it prove advantageous to the Society, nor
 must I be considered responsible in case of its failure. Having been
 adopted, however, it appears to me that it ought not hastily to be
 either rescinded or modi<U+FB01>ed ; that it ought to have a fair trial, for
 the experience of many years can alone decide whether it be inju
 rious or bene<U+FB01>cial.
    Many of you, Gentlemen, must be aware that a much more strin
 gent regulation was at one time in contemplation, which would have
 affected your privileges.   Had not that proposition been abandoned,

                                     700
I   should have felt it my duty to urge strongly on the Council the
propriety of bringing the whole question before the Society at large,
and I have little doubt that that course would have been readily
adopted.     As, however, the limitation of the number <U+FB01>fteen applies
alone to the number to be recommended by the Council; leaving to
you the power to elect more candidates, should you think <U+FB01>t to do
so, there seemed to me to be no necessity for calling you together
in a Special General Meeting.
     Having stated to you my doubts as to the expediency of the limi
tation of the number of Candidates recommended by the Council, it
 is right to add that those doubts do not at all extend to the change
 in the manner of our election.        I am convinced that considerable
 advantage    must accrue  from  its  being attended with greater solem
 nity, and from the participation of a larger number of our Fellows
 in its exercise. This change has also the further recommendation,
 that the reading of our papers will not be perpetually interrupted
 by the circulation of the ballot-box.
     The alteration of the time for the adjudication and presentation
 of our medals, and for the delivery of the Annual Address of the
 President, will remove many of the disadvantages of the autumnal
 period of our Anniversary.     As great doubts exist whether we could
 legally alter the time for the election of our Councils without a new
  Charter, and as such a course would be attended with many dif<U+FB01>
  culties and much expense, we have thought it best to do nothing in
  that matter.
     In the course of the last twelvemonth we have had the unusual
  occurrence of a Special Meeting.on the question of the adjudication
  of a Royal Medal by a former Council. Ihope and trust that no
  unpleasant feeling remains on the subject.        We are engaged 'ln a
  noble pursuit—that of scienti<U+FB01>c truth, and in that pursuit we ought
  to overlook all minor considerations.
      Three very important works have recently issued from the British
  press, the results of arduous scienti<U+FB01>c labours in very distant parts
  of the globe. Of these, one, the measurement of sections of the
  Meridional Arc in India, though highly important in itself, and ho
   nourable to the scienti<U+FB01>c ability of Colonel Everest, who carried it
   through, and to the enlightened policy of the Directors of the East
   India Company, who ordered it, I shall merely mention thus curso
  rily, as the Royal Society is no otherwise connected with it thanby
  its regard to whatever tends to promote the cause of natural know
  ledge and to do honour to the science of Great Britain.       The two
  other works are more immediately interesting to us.      Of these,‘ one
  extends our own knowledge of the sidereal heavens, while the other
  enlarges our acquaintance with our own planet.         The <U+FB01>rst is the
  <U+FB01>lial monument erected by the science of a son to the fame of his
  equally eminent father.     The second, the visit by a British seaman
  to the South Polar regions after having explored the Arctic Seas. I
  need not say that I speak of the volumes for which we are indebted
  to Sir John Herschel and to Sir James Ross.
      The former of these works has received at the hands of your

                                    701
 Council the award of the Copley Medal, which, before l sit down, l
 shall have the satisfaction of bestowing on its author.      The latter
 work is still more directly connected with ourselves, inasmuch as
 your Council. in conjunction with the British Association, brought
 before the Government the advantage of exploring the antarctic
 portion of the globe at the time that great simultaneous inquiries
 were carried on into terrestrial magnetism.
    Moreover, as the instructions on scienti<U+FB01>c subjects were drawn up
 for Sir James Ross by us, at the request of Government, we cannot
 but consider the expedition of the Erebus and Terror as, if not the
 child, at least the nurseling of the Royal Society.
     lt is true that by the labours of Colonel Sabine a considerable
 portion of the magnetic results of the expedition of Captain Ross
 has been already laid before the world; it is true also that we have
 long known that under the auspices of Sir James Russ the British
 <U+FB02>ag has waved where it ncver waved before; or at least that no
 mortal who had seen the <U+FB02>aming but snow-covered Hecla of the
 Southern Pole had ever before returned to tell the tale ; but we had
 not the interesting history of all that had been achieved, and at what
 peril, until now.
    Though we have no tidings from Sir John Franklin. and cannot
 now expect any for some time, I rejoice that northern discovery has
 not stood still.   By the energy of Mr. Ray, under the patronage of
 the Hudson Bay Company, it has been ascertained beyond a doubt
 that Boothia Felix is a peninsula; and other additions have been
 made to our acquaintance with that remote portion of the globe.
    Though not directly connected with the Royal Society or its pro
 ceedings, yet I think, Gentlemen, you will excuse my alluding for
 an instant to the two remarkable chemical and medical discoveries,
by means of which the most severe operations are performed with
out pain to the patient—a saving of human suffering, which must
extend also to the humane and sympathising surgeon.          This is in
deed a great and noble achievement of modern science —an achieve
ment for which we cannot be too grateful to Him who has thus
graciously permitted philosophy to lighten the ills mortality is heir
to.     You will allow me to add a hope that mankind, and especially
civilized nations and civilized Governments who gave their rewards
to a Jenner, will not forget what is owing to the new benefactors of
their species.
    I regret to have to state that there are three vacancies among our
Foreign Members.        We should before this have requested you to
<U+FB01>ll them up, but for the unavoidable absence of your Foreign Se
cretary from our recent Councils on account of illness.        This has
induced us to postpone the question, as we felt that it would not be
right for us to act in that matter without the bene<U+FB01>t of his advice.
I trust however soon to have to propose three foreign gentlemen to
you for election.
   I now come to the most grateful part of my address-that of the
presentation of the Royal and Copley Medals.          The two subjects
proposed for the former this year were the sciences of Chemistry

                                  702
and Mathematics.        As in the latter there was no paper coming
within the Royal regulations to which we could properly give the
medal, we were obliged by the same regulations to turn to the sub
jects of Physics and Geology.     We have, in consequence, awarded
the Medal in Physics to Mr. Grove, for the paper which constituted
the subject of the Bakerian Lecture; and to Mr. Fownes, for papers
which, as Mr. Grove’s, appear in the Philosophical Transactions.
 I must request, in Mr. Fownes’ absence, Dr. Bence Jones to receive
 the medal and to transmit it to him.
       Dr. BENCE Jones,
    In transmitting to Mr. Fownes this Royal Medal for his very valu
 able paper describing a new vegetable alkali, a discovery of the
 highest chemical interest, l beg you to inform him of our deep regret
 that illness should prevent liis being present to receive it in person.
 In a note to his paper, I <U+FB01>nd that in a manner very honourable to
 himself, he has stated that in a portion of his discovery he had been
 anticipated, though unknown to himself, by Mr. \Vm. Coley Jones
 of Plymouth. This acknowledgement on his part is what we should
 naturally expect from a gentleman desirous to promote science for
 its own sake, and therefore anxious to claim no further credit for his
 own discoveries than was justly due to them. This circumstance
 must necessarily lead the public to place more implicit faith in his
 subsequent communications, which I hope may be numerous, and
 that the Royal Society may have the honour to give them to the
 world.
       Mr. Gaova,
    It is with great pleasure that I place in your hands this Royal
 Medal, for your very interesting and valuable paper with which you
 have enriched our Transactions.      It is, indeed, a good proof of the
 love of science when a gentleman of your important and engrossing
 profession is induced to employ the little leisure that is left him in
 the pursuit of scienti<U+FB01>c investigation.     We must therefore feel the
 more obliged to you.     It would be sel<U+FB01>sh in the Royal Society to
 wish you an increase of that leisure, that she might pro<U+FB01>t by it; but
 I may be allowed to express the con<U+FB01>dent expectation that you will
 always feel an anxious wish to promote the cause of science and the
 increase of natural knowledge.
                                                        ‘
       Sm Jorm HERsCHEL,
    It is with the highest feelings of satisfaction that I perform the
 duty of giving to you the Copley Medal for your long, and arduous,
 and valuable labours in the service of astronomy at a very distant
 part of our globe.
    I feel quite sure that every cultivator of that noble branch of
 natural knowledge will agree that we could not <U+FB01>nd a sou of science
 more deserving of such a mark of our respect. That word is indeed
too cold to express the feelings entertained for yourself by the Royal

                                    703
  Society.   They are feelings so warm that they cannot be enhanced
 by that which would otherwise enhance them; by the recollection
 that you have an hereditary title to our regard.       l may. however,
 venture to say, that among the many reasons for gratitude to your
 eminent father, it is not the least that he has trained his son to
 follow in his footsteps and to emulate his fame.
     Dr. Roget, the senior Secretary, then addressed the Meeting       as
 follows :—
        MY Loan,
     I wish to take the opportunity afforded me by the present assem
 blage of the Fellows to announce to them my intention of retiring,
 at the next anniversary, from the oiiice l have so long had the honour
 of holding in the Royal Society.      This determination, us many of
 my friends well know, has not been formed hastily; and l would
 have carried it into effect some time ago, had it not been for the pe
 culiar circumstances in whichl found myself placed.
    The duties required of the Senior Secretary have, in process of time,
 become much more laborious and much more arduous than they were
 at the time of my appointment to that o<U+FB02>ice, when I succeeded Sir
 John Herschel in the year l827, which is just twenty years ago.
 During this long period, which, l may be allowed to remark, con
 stitutes a large portion of human life, l have witnessed considerable
 changes in the Society.     There have been changes of Presidents, of
 Secretaries, of Librarians, of Assistant Secretaries—in fact all the
 o<U+FB02>ices, in every department, from the highest to the lowest, have
 undergone repeated changes.      l have seen, in the course of these
 events, various changes of administration, and many important alte
 rations in the mode of carrying on the business both of the Society
 and of the
              Council; and these alterations have been constantly at
 tended with increased labour to the Secretaries.        lt is since the
period of my <U+FB01>rst appointment that the Council have undertaken the
o<U+FB02>ice of assigning the channels through which the Royal favour is
to <U+FB02>ow in the distribution of the Royal Medals; an o<U+FB02>ice, the proper
performance of which, as your Lordship well knows, is generally
di<U+FB02>icult. often delicate, and sometimes invidious; and of which the
trouble and responsibility have been felt by the Council to be so
great, that they have found it expedient to delegate the larger por
tion of that responsibility and trouble to separate standing scienti<U+FB01>c
Committees, which they appoint from year to year. To these Com
mittees they have also consigned the task of determining the se
lection of papers for publication in the Philosophical Transactions.
    Another circumstance which has added considerably to the la
bours of my o<U+FB02>ice, is the practice now adopted of having all the
proceedings, both of the Society and of the Council, printed and, of
course, published to the world.       Upon me has devolved the whole
of the editorial labour of these publications, and the superintendence
of the minutiae of the press; not to speak of the far greater care
and attention required in preparing the abstracts of the papers read

                                       704
to the Society, compared with what was suf<U+FB01>cient for thepurpose
when these abstracts were merely read at the meetings, and then
consigned to oblivion in the archives.        All these causes, and many
more that I might      mention,     have concurred in rendering my of<U+FB01>ce
anything but a sinecure.          In fact, every new measure that was
adopted entailed on me greater toil, made larger encroachments on
my time, and imposed on me more extended responsibility.               Not-
withstanding these additional burdens, and amidst the breezes I
have weathered, and the battles I have been compelled to <U+FB01>ght, for
your Lordship can bear witness that occasions have not been want
ing to put my zeal for the Society to the proof, I have never shrunk
from those duties, but have devoted my best energies to the service
of the Society and the promotion of its interests. Having now grown
grey in that service, I feel that it is time for me to retire, while my
strength is yet unbroken, and before the changes which the Society
is now undergoing shall cause fresh demands to be made upon it;
that I may dedicate the remaining term of life that may yet be
spared me to those pursuits of science to which I have always been
warmly attached, and with which the labours and the cares of o<U+FB02>ice
have seriously interfered.
   Ihave alluded to the existence of some peculiar circumstances
which had prevented my taking this step some time ago. These
circumstances must be fresh in the memory of most of those I am
now addressing: they sprung from a series of malignant attacks,
carried on with extraordinary pertinacity during nearly two years,
against the Society, its President, and, above all, the Committee of
Physiology; and these attacks were pointed more particularly
against myself, under the erroneous notion that I was especially
responsible for the proceedings of that Committee;              whereas, in
reality,  of all its members,   I  was  the one  who was   least implicated
in them. While the battle was raging, I could not, in honour, with
draw from the <U+FB01>eld; my duty was to remain at my post and abide
 the pelting of the storm. But these squalls having now blown over,
I feel at liberty to retreat, and to resign into your hands the trust you
have so long and so liberally con<U+FB01>ded to me. I should have tendered
this resignation on the present day had Ir not considered that the
interests of the Society might suffer by your being suddenly called
upon to choose a Secretary, and that the more proper and respectful
 course was to give due notice of the vacancy; and I have accord
ingly allowed my name to be placed before you as Candidate for
re-election in the balloting list recommended by the Council. If
 you are pleased to accept the tender of my services for another year,
ample time will be afforded the Society for making selection, at the
end of that period, of the person best quali<U+FB01>ed to ful<U+FB01>l the duties of
 Secretary.
   The President then called on Dr. Roget to read the biographical
notices of some of the deceased Members, which he then handed
to him.
    Huon, Tnmn Dunn or NORTHUMBERLAND,                the eldest ‘son of the

                                    705
second Duke, was born on the 17th of April I785. He received his
education at Eton, and in his seventeenth year was entered at St.
John's College, Cambridge, where hc passed through his college
career with considerable distinction, having stood high in the <U+FB01>rst
class at every examination; so much so, indeed, that at his <U+FB01>nal
examination, in June 1505, it was considered right by the Master
and Examiners to notice his exertions by a recorded entry, convey
ing "their highest approbation of Earl Percy's uniform and success
ful application to the subjects of all the six examinations, when from
his rank he might have declined attending the two last."          In July
of the same year, he took his degree as Master of Arts without fur
ther examination, as was then the universal custom.            Very soon
after quitting College and attaining his majority. he entered on pub
lic life as Member for Buckingham in 1806. and continued to sit as
 Member successively for \Vcstmiuster, Launceston, and <U+FB01>nally for
the county of Northumberland till l8l2, when he was called to the
 House of Lords by writ.
    In 1817 he married the Lady Charlotte Clive, second daughter of
 Earl Powis, and his father dying shortl after this event, he suc
ceeded to the dukedom on the 10th of July I817.
    Of his public and political life this is not the occasion to speak at
 length.    Su<U+FB02>ice it to say, that although taking generally little part
 in the management of affairs, and avoiding rather than courting
 political power, he was on more than one occasion selected as the
 representative of his Sovereign in situations of high dignity and im
 portance.    On the occasion of the coronation of Charles X. he was
 invested with the character of Ambassador Extraordinary           at the
 French Court, the whole charges of which mission, though sustained
 with very extraordinary magni<U+FB01>cence, he insisted on defraying from
 his private resources.   In 1829, he was also appointed as the suc
 cessor of the Marquis of Anglesea in the Lord Lieutenancy of Ire
 land, where, though of decidedly conservative politics and thoroughly
 protestant principles, his gentle and conciliatory disposition secured
 him general respect and good-will even from those opposed to his
 views of government.
    In the year 1834, he became High Steward of the University of
 Cambridge, and in 1840, was elected as successor to His Royal
 Highness the late Duke of Gloucester in the Chancellorship of that
 venerable institution, which o<U+FB02>ice he <U+FB01>lled during the remainder of
 his life.
    In the year I823, his Grace was elected a Fellow of the Society
 of Antiquaries and of the Linnman and Geological Societies, as well
 as a Trustee of the British Museum, attending the meetings of the
 Board of Trustees with great regularity and assiduity, even while
 suffering severely from attacks of gout. which during many years of
 his life afforded him little respite.     In I839, he <U+FB01>lled the o<U+FB02>icecof
 President at the Newcastle Meeting of the British Association for
 the Advancement of Science.       The Observatory of Cambridge owes
 to his mnni<U+FB01>cence the large and excellent equatoreal telescope, by
 Cauchoix, which is one of its most e<U+FB02>icient instruments, and of

                                    ms
which, with its mounting and the building which contains it, as well
as the publication of its elaborate description by the present Astro
nomer Royal, he defrayed the entire cost.        The recent appearance
 of Sir John Herschel's Astronomical Observations at the Cape of
 Good Hope, as he himself informs us in his preface to the volume
 containing them, was owing to the destination by his Grace of a
large sum in aid of their publication.        In his own county, and
through the whole extent of his vast territorial property, he stood
forward as the patron and supporter of every institution tending to
wards public improvement; and the general prosperity and advancing
condition of a tenantry more numerous and substantial as a body
 than those probably of any landed proprietor in the British dominions,
bears honourable testimony to the enlightenment of his views and
 his identi<U+FB01>cation of their interests with his own,
    His death took place on the 11th of February of the current year.
 It was sudden and unexpected, having been preceded only by an
attack of in<U+FB02>uenza, from which no ultimate danger was apprehended.
    NICHOLAs CARLIsLE was born at Stillington in the county of
Durham in 17 71.       His father married, <U+FB01>rst, Miss Elizabeth Huteh
inson, an immediate descendant from Colonel Hutchinson, who de
fended Nottingham Castle; and, secondly, Susanna Shottom, to
whose father, Captain Cook, our celebrated circumnavigator, owed
his education.     Mr. Carlisle was the son of the last-named lady,
while    his half-brother,  the late celebrated surgeon, Sir Anthony
Carlisle, was the fruit of the <U+FB01>rst marriage.
    After receiving the usual grammar-school education, Mr. Carlisle
entered the naval service of the East India Company, where he
amassed a considerable sum of money, most of which he expended
as joint housekeeper with his brother, to whom he was much attached,
and whom he thus assisted at the commencement of his professional
career.
    In the year 1807, he was elected a Fellow of the Society of Anti
quaries, and in the same year succeeded to the o<U+FB02>ice of one of its
Secretaries, from which he retired a few months only before his
decease.
    In 1808, he commenced his Topographical Dictionary of England,
Scotland and Ireland, and completed it in six volumes 4to in 1813.
    In the year 1814, he became a Member of the Royal Society, and
in 1815 a Member of the Irish Academy.
    In 1818, he was appointed Secretary to the Committee of Educa
tion; and in 1835, he became one of the Commissioners for inquiring
into the state of the public charities.
    For his various publications, and more especially for his laborious
and long-continued, though unsuccessful, attempts to establish pro
fessorships of the English language in various foreign Universities,
he was rewarded by orders from several courts.        Among these was
the Order of Hanover, and that of the Iron Crown of Italy, bestowed
on him by the Emperor of Austria.
    He assisted in drawing up returns to Parliament on the state of

                                      707
the population, and on the subject of the Poor Laws, and was author
of many other works.
     The University of Oxford conferred on him, in the year 1835, the
degree of Doctor of Civil Law; and he was elected Honorary Mem
ber of many learned Societies on the continent.
     Mr. Cnrlisle was remarkable for the zeal that he displayed in
whatever he undertook to perform, whether for the public service or
in behalf of his friends; and his pcrsevering industry and nnwearied
activity were commensurate to his zeal.          Pure and universal bene
volence was the distinguishing feature of his private character, and
 in his social capacity he died as he had lived, without reproach. He
 closed his active literary life in the month of August last.
     Wu.uAs| Dssurnr, D.D., Archdeacon of Surrey, Canon of Vt'in
 chester, Rector of Clapham, and some time Fellow of Trinity College,
 Cambridge, died on the 15th of October 1847.
     He was born in Yorkshire in the year I775 ; a younger son of an
 ancient and respectable, but in later days not opulent family, the
 fragments of whose landed possessions were Vested in him on the
 death of his father. He was sent young to Cambridge, and acquired
 such distinction at Catherine Hall, that the late venerable head of
 that Society, the Rev. Dr. Proctor, told him that he could not
  feel justi<U+FB01>ed in desiring to detain him there while there was an
  opening for his admission to Trinity College.        'l'o that great esta
  blishment he accordingly transferred himself; became one of its
  Fellows in I798, and continued so till his marriage in l8l4. In
   1796, he was Second \Nrangler, and Second Smith's Prizeman.            In
   1802, he was Moderator in the examinations of the University. At
  the foundation of the East India College in Hertfordshire, he was
  appointed Professor of Mathematics there.         In l8l0, he published
  his work on Fluxions, which more immediately connects him with
  the interests and reputation of the Royal Society.        In that work he
  began with the simplest instance of the application of <U+FB02>uxional prin
  ciples, and then proceeded, as he stated, to the more general cases.
  He felt strongly that the mere knowledge of certain truths is, to the
  great body of literary men, a matter of only secondary importance,
  when compared with the advantages which result from the exercise
  of the understanding and the improvement of the reasoning faculty:
  and it may safely be added, that there have been few who, in their
  own persons, have exhibited a closer union of vigorous intellect,
  high science, and practical good sense.
      His talents, indeed, were of a high order, and his acquirements
   were of corresponding extent and variety; but that which, in con
   nexion with his intellectual character, distinguished him above many,
   his equals in other points, was the humility and gentleness of his
   nature.    It is not, in truth, within the range of these notices of the
   deaths of men of science to advert with any fulness to their personal
   and domestic character, and almost as little to the part which they
   may have taken in other paths distinct from that which led them to
   the Royal Society.      But, in the briefest notice of any dignitary of

                                  708
the Church, whose name occurs among the losses sustained by us in
the past year, it is scarcely possible to record his scienti<U+FB01>c attain
ments and to forget at the same time the principle on which he pur
sued them, and the general tendency of his professional life and ser
vices. His principle was to employ faithfully, as a Christian minister,
every talent committed to him; and, in his functions as Fellow and
Tutor of Trinity College, and afterwards as Professor of Mathe
matics in the East India College (to which, with many very eminent
men, Fellows of this Society, who have passed away before him, he
was nominated at its <U+FB01>rst institution), he endeavoured to discharge
his o<U+FB02>icial duties always in harmony with his higher obligations as
a Christian.    Though most moderate in his temper and in his ex
pressions,  he was  most <U+FB01>rm in his views of truth and most fearless
in his defence of them; and the part which he took as foremost in
the early controversy on the Bible Society, thirty-<U+FB01>ve years since,
may be admitted, without entering into the merits of the question,
as a proof of the vigour of his mind and of the integrity of his prin
ciples.   His latest public act was to preach the Fast-Day Sermon
before  the House of Commons on the 24th of March 1847, a duty
comparatively frequent at an earlier period, but which, as no such
case, it is believed, had occurred in the last quarter of a century,
may not un<U+FB01>tly be recorded as-constituting some distinction in the
life of one selected for such an o<U+FB02>ice.
    The Right Hon. Sm. Enwnnn HYDE Easr was born in Jamaica
on the 9th of September 1764, and was the grandson of Captain John
East, who assisted Penn and Venables in the conquest of the island
in 1655, and for this service had a grant of an estate from the Crown
after the Restoration, which has descended to the present Baronet.
By marriage Sir Edward was connected with the family of a cousin
of the Lord Chancellor Hyde, Earl of Clarendon. Sir Edward’s uncle,
Mr. Hinton East, established a Botanic Garden in Jamaica, which
boasted of contributions from the East Indies and China.            Sir
Edward was sent to England when seven or eight years old, and
having passed through Harrow school, entered Magdalen College,
Oxford.     He became a student of the Inner Temple, and was called
to the Bar in November 1786, having been previously two years
under an eminent special pleader.       In December 1786 he married
Miss Hankey, who died in 1844, leaving an only son. Mr. East
was introduced by the Duke of Chandos to Lord Mans<U+FB01>eld, which
led to an acquaintance with Mr. Justice Buller; and the friendship
and advice of these distinguished men materially facilitated Mr.East’s
progress.    But chie<U+FB02>y to himself he owed his <U+FB01>rst distinction, by
the entirely new proceeding of periodical and systematic Reports of
the King’s Bench : a plan which has since been taken up in all the
other courts in Westminster Hall.      The Term Reports rwith which
Mr. East was connected, consisted of 24 volumes, from 1794 to
1815, the <U+FB01>rst eight of which were the joint labours of Mr. Durn
ford and himself, and the last sixteen volumes resulted from his own
industry and ability. Contemporaneously with these works he pub

                                    709
lished " The Pleas of the Crown," which has been considered a text
book on the Criminal Law of England. These literary professional
labours materially interfered with Mr. East's Bar-life on the \\'estern
Circuit, and at the Exeter Quarter Sessions; and he was obliged to
con<U+FB01>ne himself to particular cases.     In the important constitutional
case of the corporation of llelleston he successfully distinguished
himself; also before an Election Committee of the House of Com
mons on Captain Preston's petition respecting the election for Ci
rencester.    At the period of the beginning of the French Revolution
 Mr. East accepted a seat in Purliinnent for Great Bedwin, \Vilts,
of which the Earl of Aylesbury was patron.        Partaking in the ge
 neral enthusiasm of the country, which occasioned the volunteer
 armament, he entered as a private in the London Light Horse Vo
 lunteers; but about a year after, his neighbours in Bloomsbury
 Square associated themselves in an independent company, of which
 he was elected the commandant, and he bore the king's commission
 for several years.   In the House of Commons he carried through a
 bill against considerable opposition, having the just and humane
 object of preventing the arbitrary removals of the poor from parishes ;
 and of this bill the late Sir Samuel ltomilly said, he would rather
 have been its author, than the author of any other act in George
 the Third's reign.                      -
     In 1800, impaired health induced Mr. East to resign his seat. In
  1812, he applied for and obtained from Mr. Percival the o<U+FB02>ice of
 Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in Calcutta.          Mr. Percival's
 atrocious assassination, however, retarded the completion of the
 patent; but the appointment was con<U+FB01>rmed by Lord Liverpool in
 February 1813, and Mr. East was knighted.        He continued in India
 eight years ; and the friendly relations he maintained with the Go
 vernor-General advanced the public interests.     He early mixed with
 the native gentry, particularly the Hindoos, and <U+FB01>nding a strong
  desire among them for European knowledge, he projected a plan of
  secular‘ education; and to work it ou\ a meeting of the native
  gentry was convened at his own house in 1806, the Government not
  taking any direct part in the institution of the project.      A sub
  scription was opened, and liberal contributions made, for securing
  a building, the provision of instructors, &c.    As various castes of
  scholars were to meet under the same roof, a considerable innova
  tion would be effected on ancient prejudices. The European gentry
  soon gave their aid, and the result was the Hindoo College, the pre
  cursor of the many noble educational institutions which the govern
  ments of India have established in the different Presidencies.
      Sir Edward East resigned his o<U+FB02>ice in January 1822, and re
  turned to England. Previously to his departure the native gentry
  of Calcutta expressed their gratitude to him, in an address, for his
  able and upright administration of the law, and particularly for the
  stimulus he had given to native education by promoting the foun
  dation of the Hindoo College ; and in testimony of the sincerity of
  their assurances, they had a statue of Sir Edward executed by the
  hands of Chantry, and placed in the Grand Jury Room of Calcutta.

                                      710
   After his return he re-entered the House of Commons as member
   for Winchester, and sat during two Parliaments.          In April 1823,
   George IV. raised him to the Baronetey.         In November 1823, he
   was called to the Bench of the Inner Temple; and King William
   on his accession conferred on him the further distinction of a
   Privy Councillor; and he took part in the Judicial Committee in
   cases of appeals from the East Indies. Mindful of his native friends
   in the East, he associated himself with the late Lord Munster and
   others who had been in India, in founding the Royal Asiatic Society
   of Great Britain and Ireland, together with the Oriental Translation
   Committee as auxiliary to that Society, for the purpose of putting
   into an English dress curious and important works in the Eastern
   languages, relating to History, Science or Literature.      The Society
   and the Committee equally <U+FB02>ourished ; and the latter has placed be
   fore the European world many Orientalr works, which, but for its
   labours, must have remained long unknown.         In his late years, Sir
   Edward partly occupied himself with religious and controversial
                                                      “
   subjects, and published, under the signature of A Layman," a trea
   tise “ On the Origin of Evil in the World," and another “ On the
   mysterious Book of Job."
      Sir Edward Hyde East, Bart., became a member of our Society
   in April 1799, and died in the course of the present year.
      Mr. Macvar NAPIER was born in the year 1777, and descended
   from an ancient family in the West of Scotland.         After successful
   studies in the two Universities of Glasgow and Edinburgh. he be
   came a member of the Society of Writers to the Signet.       His talents
   would probably have led him to great success in the legal profes
   sion, had not his taste for literary and philosophical pursuits led
   him to other avocations. He was, however, the object of so much re
   spect and regard, that he was at an early age elected by the Society to
   the honourable o<U+FB02>ice of their librarian; an o<U+FB02>ice for which he seems
   to have been admirably quali<U+FB01>ed.      At a later period, they selected
   him from many able competitors to deliver lectures on Conveyancing.
   The University of Edinburgh subsequently evinced their sense of
   the merits of these lectures by converting the lectureship into a
   professorship, with a handsome endowment, and permitting Mr.
   Napier to become the professor without ceasing to be librarian.
      In the year 1814, Mr. Napier edited the Supplement to the En
   cyclopaedia Britannica, and at a later period, he superintended anew
   edition of the same important work, and by so doing conferred a
   great bene<U+FB01>t on the science of his country and of the world.
      In the year 1830, Mr. Napier was appointed to the situation of
   principal Clerk of Session, and resigned that of librarian to the
   Writers to the Signet, having the year before succeeded Mr. Jeffery
   as the editor of one of the most in<U+FB02>uential of those quarterly jour
   nals whose publication is of the greatest importance to the literary
   and scienti<U+FB01>c interests of the country.     He had been a contributor
   to the Edinburgh Review previously, and was therefore the better
   able to manage it with success. A memoir that has been published

                                       711
on his life, evidently written by one well-acquainted with his nerits,
remarks, " I-le was in all respects perfectly trustworthy : all secrets
con<U+FB01>ded to him were sacred ; and the most distinguished of his con
tributors wereifarther ready to admit the value of his suggestions
and the justice of his criticisms."
      He continued to attend to the duties of his class at the Univer
sity very nearly to the time of his death.
      He married young, and left a large family at his death, which
happened in the 7 lst year of his age.
      During the latter years of his life his health had been declining;
 but his intellectual powers were unimpaired to the lust. By those
 with whom he was intimate even a higher estimate of his talents
 is entertained than what is felt by those who merely look to the im
 portant share that he took in literature and science as the editor
 of the Encyclopedia Britannica and the Edinburgh Review.               So at
 at least says the author of the memoir alluded to already.              This
 seems ditlicult; but they alone can judge of the merits of his con<U+FB01>
 dential correspondence and his part in domestic society : it is per
                                                    " a pious, an intelligent
 haps more important to say, that he was
 and an honest friend."        He became a Fellow of the Royal Society
  in the year I817.
      The Rev.Joun I'I.u1.s-rozn was born on the 13th of December.
   1759, and received his early education at Beverley School in York
  shire.     From thence he went to Cambridge, where he pursued his
  mathematical studies with so much success that he took the high
   degree of Second \Vrangler at the examination in the year I782.
  The same course of study was followed by him in after-life.
       In the year 1784, he became a Fellow of Trinity College, and in
   1788, he was appointed to the o<U+FB02>ice of Woodwardian Professor of
   Mineralogy. After holding this Professorship for the long period of
   thirty years, he married and retired to the vicarage of Trump
   ington, near the University; avilla.ge interesting to the lover of
   literature as having been the residence of Anstey, the author of the
   Bath Guide, and at a subsequent period, of Mr. Hailstone’s brother
   professor, the celebrated traveller, Edward Daniel Clark.
       I-Iere Mr. Hailstone died on the 9th of last June, at the very ad
   vanced age of 87, retaining his faculties till the last. After his
   election to the Woodwardian Professorship he went to Germany to
   pro<U+FB01>t by the lectures of VVerner.       To Mr. Hailstone the University
   is  indebted  for additions  to  her  collection   of minerals and fossils.
    He published   a  syllabus of  Lectures,  but did not succeed in bringing
    together a class, as he received little or no encouragement from the
    heads of the University. I-le published little: one paper in the
    Geological Transactions, and a few short notices in the Transactions
    of the Cambridge Philosophical Society.         In politics he was a whig.
    He was a friend to education, as he showed by the endowment of
    a day-school, and the expenditure of several hundred pounds in im
    proving a parish school.

                                     712
     The Rev. WILLIAM Psaason, LL.D., was upwards of twenty
  eight years a Fellow of this Society, and well-known for his ardent
  attachment to practical science. He was born at Whitbeck, in Cum
  berland, on the 20th of April, 1767, and was educateddat the Hawks
 head Grammar-school.        Being of an active mechanical turn, he
 employed himself in early life in constructing a curious astronomical
 clock; and at different periods afterwards he made a complete Tel
 lurian, a very detailed Planetarium, a Satellitian for showing the
 motions and periods of Jupiter':-1 satellites, and a complex Orre-ry.
 When he became proprietor of the large seminary at East Sheen.
 near Richmond, he erected an excellent private observatory, and
 furnished it with so liberal a supply of the best instruments, that he
 was induced to write a detailed description of them, and thereby
 produced his principal publication,
                                         “ Practical Astronomy ;" a work
 for which the gold medal of the Royal Astronomical Society was
 awarded him.      Besides this, Dr. Pearson also wrote numerous arti
 cles for Rees’s Cyclopaedia; and he contributed to the Memoirs of
 the Royal Astronomical Society, his last paper in those volumes being
 a Catalogue of 520 stars, made with a three-foot altitude and azi
 muth instrument, in the observatory which he had built at his       r
                                                                        rec
 tory  at South  Kilworth,  in  Leicestershire.
    Dr. Pearson enjoyed robust health to an advanced period of life,
 and, after a meritorious and useful career, rexpired at South Kil
 worth on the 6th of last September.                          .
    Professor  MACCULLAGH       was born in the year 1809.       The place
of his birth was the townland         of Loughlindhuhussey,      then pos
sessed by his grandfather, a man of considerable acquirements, and
a scholar of some pretensions.          This place is in the parish of
Upper Badoney, in the county of Tyrone, about ten miles from
Strabane.
    Shortly after his birth, his father removed from the mountain farm
he occupied to Strabane, principally that he might have the means
of educating his son, it not being possible to do so in the secluded
glen in which he lived.        In Strabane he was, while very young,
placed at the only respectable school at that time in the town. Here
his genius soon displayed itself.      After school hours he was almost
constantly employed in solving mathematical problems; yet, it is
remembered that when Euclid was <U+FB01>rst put into his hands he was
dissatis<U+FB01>ed with the task. He was only required to get the solution
of a problem by heart, like a copy of verses, and repeat it. There
was no attempt made at explanation.             This did not suit the cha
racter of his mind, which even then could not rest until it thoroughly
understood the nature of everything that came before it.          For some
days   he  was restless, unhappy    and  puzzled,   wandering   about  with
his Euclid in his hand.       In his perplexity he met a neighbour, a
working carpenter, a man of cleverness and talent, who, seeing the
boy evidently unhappy, was good enough to ask him what was the
matter.     He immediately told his good-natured friend that he was
obliged   to get by heart a set of strange words, the meaning of which

                                        T13
 he wanted to understand; at the same time showing him the pro
 position he was committing to memory for the next day's task. The
carpenter instantly sat down with the puzzled boy, and in a short
 time showed him what a proof was. This was the way in which
 Professor I\'IacCuIlugh <U+FB01>rst learned to prove a proposition in Euclid.
 He was afterwards, when commencing his classical studies, sent to
 Lifford to the school of the Rev. John Graham, and subsequently to
 that of the Rev. Thomas Rollestone.           lle entered Trinity College,
 Dublin, as a pensioner in November 1824, being then in the <U+FB01>fteenth
 year of his age.      In the following year, he became n candidate for
 Sizarship,      and  was   successful.   Throughout his under-graduate
course he carried away every Honour both in Science and Classics.
 In I827, he obtained a Scholarship, and in 1832, (the year when his
 Scholarship expired) he was elected a Fellow. In I835, he became
 Professor of Mathematics, Dr. Sadleir (the present Provost) having
 resigned expressly to make way for him. In I843, he was chosen to
 <U+FB01>ll the Chair of Natural Philosophy, in the room of the present Dr.
 Lloyd, who, by becoming a Senior Fellow, was incapacitated from
continuing to hold it. In 1880, his <U+FB01>rst paper on Refracted Light
 was read in the Royal Irish Academy, and shortly after he became a
 Member of it, and contributed largely to place it in that position
 which it now holds among the learned Societies of the world.             In
 1838, he obtained the Conyngham Gold Medal from the Academy
for his paper “ On the Laws of Crystalline Re<U+FB02>exion and Refraction,"
which was presented to him, with an Address (since printed in the
Proceedings) respecting the then existing state of science in that
department, by Sir \\'m. Rowan Hamilton, who was at that time
 President of the Academy.         In I839, Professor MacCullagh may be
regarded      as  having  laid the  foundation of the highly valuable Mu
scum of Irish Antiquities, now in Dublin, by presenting to the Royal
Irish Academy the celebrated Cross of Cong.              In presenting the
Cross to the Academy, Professor MacCullagh stated, that his mo
tive for doing so was, by putting it in the possession of a public
body, to save it from that shameful process of destruction to which
everything venerable in Ireland had been exposed for centuries, and
to contribute at the same time to the formation of a national col
lection, the want of which, he had been told, was regarded by Sir
Walter Scott as a disgrace to a country so abounding in valuable
remains.       He afterwards assisted in enlarging the Museum, which
he had thus (it may be said) commenced, by muni<U+FB01>cent subscrip
tions.    I-Iis contributions to the Academy were not con<U+FB01>ned to sci
enti<U+FB01>c subjects; they embraced matters of general literature, espe
cially some connected with ancient Egyptian chronology.            In 1842,
he was awarded the Copley Medal for his investigations on the
Theory of Light. Among the competitors were Bessel, Dumas, and
Murchison. On this occasion he was much indebted to Dr. Lloyd's
excellent report.
   In the following year, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society,
but was not a contributor to its Transactions.        The reason frequently
assigned by      him for this  was,  that he  felt bound to do as much as

                                   714
in him lay to raise and elevate the literary and scienti<U+FB01>c institutions
of the country of his birth. This with him was ever a paramount
object; and in connexion with that object, in the summer of the
present year, he resolved, at great inconvenience to himself, to make
an effort to free the University with which he was so closely con
nected from what he considered a disgrace, namely, its being repre
sented in Parliament by men not educated within its walls.           He
was in<U+FB02>uenced, too, by what he considered a public want, that the
interests of science and literature should be represented in the
Imperial Parliament.
  ‘
    He was not successful; but his personal bearing throughout the
 contest was such as to secure to him the admiration and the good-will
 of all opponents as well as friends.     This remarkable contest was,
as might be expected, commenced and carried on by Professor Mac
 Cullagh, without his ever accepting that pecuniary assistance which
 was frequently and warmly offered by others, but by him was grate
 fully declined.
    About the middle of September, he commenced working at a sub
ject which he was anxious to free his mind from as soon as possible.
 The heading of the paper remains: it is, “ A Theory of Total Re
<U+FB02>exion of Light. By James MacCullagh, Fellow of Trinity College,
 Dublin. Read May 24th, 1841."
    Con<U+FB01>nement and over-work gradually produced disease, mental
 as well as bodily; and after a few days’ illness, an end was put to
 his career on the night of the 24th of October, in the 38th year of
 his age.                                                   .
    As it is understood that there will be given at the stated Meeting
 of the Royal Irish Academy, in March next, a more lengthened
 memoir of Professor MacCullagh’s life than could conveniently be
 offered to the Royal Society now, I have contented myself with the
 few facts and dates which have been thus rapidly stated; and as I
 am led to believe that there will be given to the public on the same
 occasion an accurate and detailed account of his scienti<U+FB01>c labours
 and discoveries, which it has been found di<U+FB02>icult (through want of
time) to put together in a satisfactory manner for our Meeting this
 night, I will merely glance at some of the things done by him since
 this Society awarded to him the Medal already mentioned, being
 the highest honour in their power to bestow.        My information is
 derived chie<U+FB02>y from gentlemen who have attended to and pro<U+FB01>ted by
 his o<U+FB02>icial teaching in the University of Dublin, and who,-having
 since attained distinction and station in that University, speak now
 with a natural enthusiasm of their lost preceptor and friend.
    Since Professor MacCullagh obtained the Copley Medal, in ad
 dition to the different papers which he published in the Proceedings
 and in the Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy, he has given
 seven courses of lectures in di<U+FB02>"erent branches of Natural Philosophy,
 in his capacity of professor of that subject, having for about eight
years previously <U+FB01>lled the Chair of Mathematics in a manner which
 those alone can fully appreciate who know what was the state of
 mathematical knowledge in the Dublin University previous to his

                                       \l   L-!
election and what   it   is  now, and who can compare the state in which
 he found it   with that in which he left it.     allude to these Lectures,
                                                  l
 because  it  was in the delivery of them, that is, in the conscientious
 and due performance of the proper duties of his calling, that Pro
 fessor MacCullagh   is    reported to have ever appeared to the greatest
 advantage.    It   was  there  that he used to display the extensive in
 formation, the elaborate research, and the vast acquired treasures of
 his highly cultivated mind; and       itwas there that he most delighted
 to turn to account the noble faculty of inventive genius with which
 he was so eminently gifted, in improving, by means of it, every sub
ject he ever handled. There       is  no one capable of appreciating such
 subjects, and who enjoyed t.he privilege of attending the courses
above referred to, but will admit, that during the severul years of
his purely mathematical lectures, nothing could exceed the depth
or surpass the exquisite mste and elegance of all his original concep
tions, both in analysis and geometry.        Nor will it  be denied by any
who were so happy as to possess the opportunity of judging, that
during the last three years and half in which he <U+FB01>lled the Chair of
                                      a
 Natural Philosophy, his earnest endeavour was ever to instil sound
and accurate physical conceptions into the minds of his hearers, and
 to array them, when stated in mathematical language, in all the
 charms which arises from true taste and appropriate re<U+FB01>nement.
     In his <U+FB01>rst course of Lectures—on the rotation of     a a
                                                                 solid body
round a     <U+FB01>xed point—--he completely solved the case of       body aban
doned to its own motions on receiving a primitive impulse in any
 direction, and under the action of no external accelerating forces.
This problem he had <U+FB01>nished several years before, and was preparing
it  for publication, when he found that he had been just anticipated,
in many though not in all respects, by Poinsot, who published about
that time very elegant little tract on the subject. During the same
          n
course of Lectures he gave some interesting and original theorems
respecting the rotation of surfaces of revolution moving freely' in
space, and acted on by any external accelerating forces, directed to
any number of <U+FB01>xed centres.
    In his course of Lectures on attractions, he gave some very beauti
ful theorems respecting the attraction of a body of any nature and
form on   a   point distant   along way in comparison of its own dimen
sions.      And he gave some most simple and elegant geometrical
methods for <U+FB01>nding the attraction of an homogeneous ellipsoid on
any internal point. The subject of attractions seems indeed to have
been a    favourite one with him  ;   and he on several previous occasions
gave new and beautiful theorems in it, and in many important re
spects improved the existing theories, keeping always in advance of
the knowledge of the time.         He delivered also courses of Lectures
on part of Sir Isaac Newton's Principia, and on Heat, Electricity
and Magnetism.
 l     now come to Professor MacCullagh’s great course of Lectures
on "The Dynamical Theory of Light," which was on his part
(whatever other researches on that subject may have been elsewhere
made) the unaided creation of his own genius; and was founded

                                                    -
                                   716
on one single and simple hypothesis, on which as a basis (to bor
row the language of Dr. Lloyd when speaking of Fresnel’s beau
tiful theory of double refraction), he “ has reared the noblest fabric
which has ever adorned the domain of physical science, Newton's
system of the Universe alone excepted."       If we now venture to say
that Professor MacCullagh ranks as a philosopher higher than Fres
nel in the region of Light (and if that be admitted,.he will certainly
rank inferior to none on that subject), it is not thereby designed to
institute any comparison between labours so different in their na
ture as those of these two great men. Professor MacCullagh may
be regarded as standing to Fresnel in the same relation as Newton
to Kepler. Fresnel undoubtedly discovered all the elegant laws of
the propagation and double refraction of light in crystallized media,
as Well as in ordinary, with some of those of total re<U+FB02>exion at the
bounding surfaces of ordinary media, but he did not account for
them on any correct mechanical principles ; with respect to propa
gation, the very <U+FB01>rst principles from which he sets out are such as
cannot now be admitted : with respect to ordinary re<U+FB02>exion, he partly
accounted for them on correct principles, in the particular case of
ordinary media, which was the only one for which he had ever given
them. Professor MacCullagh, on the contrary, not only deduced
the known laws in all the three cases from mechanical principles of
a nature so simple and probable, that they cannot but bear con
viction of their truth to any mind re<U+FB02>ecting on them, with anything
like the attention they deserve, but he also gave the general equa
tions of the propagation of light not only for all known media, but
also for all media which could ever be discovered or even conceived.
And with these he gave also the general conditions which must be
ful<U+FB01>lled at the common bounding surface of every two, not only
known, but conceivable media, and which in every case give all the
laws of re<U+FB02>exion and of refraction, whether ordinary or total.
   Thus did he deliver to his hearers and to posterity a perfect and
complete mechanical theory; that is to say, analytically complete :
so that any one who in future may attempt to discover in this re
gion of science, can only do so by treading in his steps, and adopt
ing his principles, but can never supersede them. In fact; he has
discovered and handed down the general principles which must hold
in all cases.   It remains for future investigators only to apply them.
He himself applied them to the two most general cases of propaga
tion, viz. of polarized waves of undiminishing intensity in u crystal
line medium, and of that peculiar species of propagated vibrations
which take place in the rarer medium in every case of total re<U+FB02>exion
at the surface either of an ordinary or of a crystalline medium.       In
the former case he arrived at all the laws of propagation in crystal-.
line media which were discovered by Fresnel, with one single varia
tion, and that the very one on which he himself had long previously
corrected Fresnel, viz. the vibrations of the aether, in place of coming
out to be perpendicular to the plane of polarization, as Fresnel had
supposed, came out on the contrary to be parallel to that plane, as
 MacCullagh himself had supposed.

                                    717
    He was enabled by discoveries of his own. to deduce again in n far
easier manner, all the beautiful geometrical laws of crystalline re
ilexion and refraction, which he had formerly laid before the Royal
Irish Academy in 1837, and for which that body awarded him the
honorary distinction of the Conyngham Medal, which I have before
alluded to. And they fully con<U+FB01>rmed the acute prophecy then made
by his sagacious mind, on <U+FB01>nding to his astonishment. that n law of
re<U+FB02>exion depended for its existence on the existence of a law of pro
pagntion ; when he said that the law of vis viva which he had as
sumed at the outset could not be a fundamental but rather a se
condary law, and remarked that perhaps the next step in physical
optics would be the deduction, as parts of one system, of all the laws
both of propagation and re<U+FB02>exion from some higher and more gene
ral law, containing them both as particular cases : anticipations
which were singled out for special attention, in the Address deli
vered by Sir W. Rowan Hamilton. on the occasion already referred
to.    How little perhaps did Professor MacCullagh then know that
both of his own prophecies were destined to be so soon ful<U+FB01>lled,
and both by the powers of his own mighty and creative mind !
    In the general case of total re<U+FB02>exion at the surface of a crystal,
he afterwards showed, by a most ingenious employmentof imagi
nary quantities, that the refraction was still double, and never more
than double; and he showed that the directions of the refracted rays
remained always the same, whatever were the incidence, provided it
gave total re<U+FB02>exion.     Again, as he had done for the case of ordinary
re<U+FB02>exion by means of his beautiful theorem of the polar plane, so
in the case of total re<U+FB02>exion he determined the two directions.of
polarization, in a given incident plane polarized wave. which would
give uniradial refracted rays, by means not of a polar plane, but of
a polar cylinder, which he succeeded in showing was the analogous
surface in the more ditlicult cases.
    In the particular case of total reflexion at the surface of an ordi
nary medium, the whole theory of total re<U+FB02>exion became exceedingly
simple, and that case is left by him completed.         He showed that
whatever were the incidence, the refracted wave was always perpen
dicular to the intersection of the plane of incidence, and of the sur
face of the crystal ; he showed that the axes of the ellipse of vibra
tion, projected on the plane of incidence, were parallel and perpen
dicular to that line; he gave a beautiful construction, by means of
an equilateral hyperbola touching with its vertex the section of the
index sphere at the point where it intersects the same right line, for
determining the velocity of the refracted wave, and the ratio of the
axes of its elliptic vibrations corresponding to any given incidence;
he determined at once the limiting angle of total re<U+FB02>exion: and,
<U+FB01>nally, he got out the two empirical formulae of Fresnel, for the ac
celeration of the refracted phase over the incident, and the subse
quent equal acceleration of the re<U+FB02>ected phase over the refracted ;
the one for the case of the incident light polarized in the plane of
incidence, and the other for the same polarized in the perpendicular
plane.    For all cases, whether of propagation or of 're<U+FB02>exion, ordi

                                     718
nary or total, the whole theory, as he has left it, is analytically
complete : but the geometrical interpretations in the general case of
total re<U+FB02>exion at the surface of a crystal present very great difficul
ties.    Many of these his acute intellect had with great labour sur
mounted; he had been working hard at the subject for the last four
weeks of his life, and with so much success, that he had actually
commenced a new paper for the Irish Transactions, embodying the
results of his latest investigations. The heading of this paper, which
Ihave already mentioned, remains in his own handwriting. It is
believed that several of his manuscripts on other subjects are in the
possession of his family, although it was not his custom to preserve
many written papers.               .
    ALEXANDER BRONGNIART, the son of a distinguished architect,
 was born at Paris in the year 1770.       In early youth he derived his
 love of science, not only from his father, but also from his father's
 friends, Franklin, Lavoisier, and other eminent men of the day.
 He received his earliest lessons in science at the Ecole des Mines,
 and afterwards at the Ecole de Médecine.          At the age of twenty,
 he came to England, and visited the mines of Derbyshire.             On
 his return to his own country, he published a memoir on enamel
 ling, which induced M. Berthollet, several years later, to recom
 mend his appointment to the o<U+FB02>ice of Director of the manufactory
 of Sévres. At the time of the French Revolution, he had the mis
 fortune to be suspected of the offence .of favouring the escape of
 M. Broussonet, and was thrown into prison. More fortunate however
 than so many others who were arrested in that terrible time, he
 escaped with his life, and, after his release, returned to Paris and be
 came a Mining Engineer. ,He subsequently was appointed Professor
 of Natural History at the Ecole Centrale des Quatre Nations ; and in
 the year 1800, commenced his superintendence of the manufactory
 of porcelain at Sevres, an o<U+FB02>ice <U+FB01>lled by him for the long period of
 nearly half a century.
     In the year 1807, appeared M. Brongniart’s ' Traité Elémentaire
 de Minéralogie,’ a work of great importance and merit.
     M. Brongniart did not con<U+FB01>ne his scienti<U+FB01>c researches to mine
 ralogy.     Zoology also attracted his attention and pro<U+FB01>ted by his
 labours, and a community of pursuit brought him into close relation
 with the illustrious Cuvier.
     In the year 1808, he revisited this country and studied its fresh
 water formations, a study of great importance with reference to a
 work published by him, in conjunction with M. Cuvier, after his
 return to France, on the Geology of the Environs of Paris.
     In consequence of the great service he had rendered to science,
 he was elected a member of the French Academy in the year 1815.
Two years later, he visited Switzerland, the Alps and Italy, where he
 extended his geological fame by fresh observations ; and in 1822, he
published the second and enlarged edition of his Geology of the
 neighbourhood of the capital of France.
     In the year 1824, he made a journey in Norway and Sweden, and

                                    719
in the course of it studied the    more early fossiliferous deposits, and
brought together the materials for n memoir on erratic blocks.
   Other geological questions occupied his thoughts, and among
them were the interesting phienomena of volcanos, and especially of
Vesuvius.
   Such is a brief account of the scienti<U+FB01>c career of this zealous and
active philosopher, as exhibited in the touching address delivered
after his death by his friend .\l. Elie de Beaumont.      Science was not
however his only, or perhaps his principal occupation, though it
might be supposed that he had little leisure for any other.       On the
contrary, he diligently discharged for forty-seven years the duties of
the director of a great national mnnufactory, and during the later
years of his life, he published two important works on the potter's
art; an art which, dating from very early periods of human exist
ence, so eminently unites the beuutiful with the useful ; an art
assuming a very different appearance at Nola or Pckin, at Firenze
or Dresden; an artwhich seems to mark out the kind as well as de
gree of civilization of the different nations in which it has <U+FB02>ourished
or declined.
   We should be mistaken, again, were we to imagine that natural
science on the one hand and the care of the establishment of Sévres
on the other absorbed the whole thoughts and time of M.Brongniart.
 He took an active part in the affairs of the Institute, n zealous share
in the advancement of knowledge by scienti<U+FB01>c association, and n
lively interest in the pursuits of other inquirers after truth. He
was, says M. de Beaumont, “ non seulement le snvant éminent,
l'esprit supérieur, mais encore l'homme aimable, l'homme excellent,
l'honnéte homme, l’homme profondement dévoué aux plus nobles
devoirs."
   He became a Foreign Member of the Royal Society in the year
 1815, and died at the advanced age of seventy-seven, admired, re
spected, beloved and lamented.       He has left behind him a son in
heriting his love for science and devotion to its cause.

   Postscript to Mr. W. H. Barlow’s paper on Alternating Diurnal
Currents of Electricity at the Terrestrial Surface.
   The author states that since his paper was read to the Society, he
had made further experiments to determine with greater accuracy
the direction in which the daily electrical currents travel, and also
how far the motions of the horizontal magnetic needle correspond
with that of the telegraph. \Vith regard to the latter, he <U+FB01>nds that
although they agree as to the general character of their de<U+FB02>exions,
there is no decided simultaneous coincidence in their movements.

  Bloodhound.’      By Captain Edward Johnson, R.N., F.R.S.     Com
municated to the President by the Lords Commissioners of the Ad
miralty, and communicated to the Society by the President.
   These experiments were undertaken with the view of ascertaining
whether the action of steam upon the hull of an iron vessel affects a
compass, properly placed, in any degree that may be of practical
importance in its navigation; and also whether the keeling of the
vessel produces any alteration in the deviations, or disturbs a com
pass so placed to any considerable extent.    The former question is,
from the results of these experiments, resolved in the negative ; but
with respect to the second, it appears that the deviations produced
by keeling are very marked, and could not be safely disregarded.
These observations completely con<U+FB01>rm those already made by Mr.
Walker and Commander Shaugh on board H.M. Iron Brig ' Recruit,’
Commander A. Slade, and they prove the necessity that exists for
ascertaining the deviations of the compass in all ships, not only at
the beginning and end of their voyage, but likewise at intermediate

may be steering.

    The author has collected materials for Tide Map of the Paci<U+FB01>c
                                                 a
from various navigators ;—Cook, Flinders, King, Captains FitzRoy,
 Sir-E. Belcher, Sir James Ross, Stokes, Killet, and others of our
own countrymen; Malaspina, Freycinet, Du Petit-Thouars, Wrarigel
and Admiral Liitke, and other Spanish, French and Russian navi-r
gators.    The result of these appears to be, that on the eastern coast
of the Paci<U+FB01>c, the tide comes from the west; arrives <U+FB01>rst at the coast
near Acapulco and Nicoya, and         later and later both to the north
                                           is
and to the south of this point; passing to the eastward round Cape
Horn, as observed by King, and to the northward along the coast

                                         729
 of North America, and then to the westward along the Aleutian
 Isles, and so to Kamtschatka, as stated by Admiral Liitke.
     The tides in the centre of the Paci<U+FB01>c are too small and anomalous
 to allow us to trace the connection among them. At Tahiti, accord
 ing to the observations of Sir Edward Belcher, the solar and lunar
 tides appear to be equal.
    The tides have been traced along the coasts of New Zealand and
 Australia by Cook, Flinders, and other succeeding navigators. They
 come from the east; and the eotidal lines which mark their pro
 gress appear to have a north and south range, except when de<U+FB02>ected
 by passing round promontories and the like.               When we pass west
 ward from the eastern coast of Australia, the cotidal lines are too
 much broken and complicated by the intervention of islands, to be
 traced with our present materials of knowledge.
    The second part of the memoir, " On l/u- Diurnal Inequality," treats
of the di<U+FB02>erence of the two lidvs of the same day, which has also
been discussed in former memoirs by the author, and its laws so
fully made out, that this inequality has been introduced into the
tide tables for Liverpool and for Plymouth.            Tliisinequulity depends
mainly on the moon's declination.            In England it is small : it is very
marked on the coasts of Spain, Portugal and North America, as was
shown by the observations of I836: but in the North Paci<U+FB01>c and
in the Indian seas, it reaches an enormous amount, and shows itself
with curious differences.        ln many places in those seas, the diurnal
inequality is much larger than the differences of spring and neap
tides, and is so large as utterly to confound the usual modes of
                   “                  "
estimating the establishment             of a place.
    This inequality affects the tides of various parts on the coast of
Australia to a very great amount, and with very remarkable diffcr
ences.    lt is seen at Adelaide on the south. and Port Es ington on
the north coast ; and at each place it produces a difference of several
feet between every two successive tides, when it is at its maximum 1
but this difference affects mainly the high waters at Adelaide and the
low waters at Port Essington*.           Also on the west coast of Australia,
near Swan River, the diurnal inequality appears with another pecu
liarity, afffecting the times of high water rather than the heights.
These differences, the author remarks, show that the diurnal wave
travels separately from the semidiurnal wave; but our materials do
not at present enable us to analyse the compound tide into these
two waves, and to trace the course of each.
    The author observes, in conclusion, that our knowledge of the tides
is not likely to be completed, nor even much advanced, by tide ob
servations made bynavigators and surveyors voyaging with other
main objects.       The later observations of the Paci<U+FB01>c, though made
with great industry, have added little to the knowledge derived from
Cook, Flinders and King, because they were not geographically con
nected with each other: and the great discrepancies of the obser
   * These results follow from a series of tide observations made at Adelaide by
Mr. Bealten, and at Port Essington by Sir Gordon Bremer.

                                    730
vations at the same place show how little correctness the mean of
them, or the result, however obtained; can pretend to.
    The results of the recent observations, withwhich the author has
been furnished by various navigators and by the Hydrographer's
O<U+FB02>ice, have been obtained by throwing the observations into curves,
according to methods formerly used and described by the author.
This labour has been carefully performed by Mr. D. Ross of the
Hydrographer's      Of<U+FB01>ce.

     “ On Terrestrial Magnetism." By William A. Norton, A.M.,
 M.A.P.S., Professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy in De
 laware College, United States of America. Communicated by Lieut.
 Colonel Edward Sabine, R.A., For. Sec. R.S.
     The object of the author in the present memoir is to show that,
 by adopting certain fundamental conceptions with respect to the
 terrestrial magnetic forces, the magnetic may be deduced from the
 thermal elements of the earth.       The following are the propositions
 which he considers    he  has established  by his inquiries.
     1. All the magnetic elements of any place on the earth may be
 deduced from the thermal elements of that place; and all the great
 features of the distribution of the earth’s magnetism may be theore
 tically derived from certain prominent features in the distribution of
 its heat.
     2. Of the magnetic elements, the horizontal intensity is nearly
 proportional to the mean temperature, as measured by Fahrenheit’s
 thermometer;      the vertical intensity is nearly proportional to the
 difference between the mean temperatures, at two points situated at
 equal distances north and south of the place, in a direction perpen
  dicular to the isothermal line ; and, in general, the direction of the
 needle is nearly at right angles to the isothermal line, while the pre
 cise courses of the in<U+FB02>ected line, to which it is perpendicular, may
 be deduced from Sir David Brewster's formula for the temperature,
 by differentiating and putting the d<U+FB02>ferential equal to zero.
     3. As a consequence, the laws of the terrestrial distribution of the
 physical principles of magnetism and heat must be nearly the same;
  and these principles themselves must have towards one another the
  most intimate physical relations.
     4. The principle of terrestrial magnetism, in as far as the pheno
  mena of the magnetic needle are concerned, must be con<U+FB01>ned to the
 earth's surface, or to a comparatively thin tratum of the mass of
 the earth.
     5. The mathematical theory of terrestrial magnetism which has
 been under discussion must be true in all its essential features.
     6. We may derive the magnetic elements by very simple formulae,
  and with an accuracy equal to that of Gauss’s formulae, from a very

                                      73l
 small number of magnetic data determined by observation, and the
 mean annual temperature of the place.

   "On      the Disruptive Discharge of accumulated Electricity, and
  the Proxiinate Cause of Lightning."       By lsham Baggs, Esq. Com
  municated by S. Hunter Christie, Esq., Sec. R.S.
     The author proposes to inquire into the principal causes of the
  violent and disruptive union of opposite electricities which consti
  tutes the electric discharge ; and to apply the knowledge thus gained
  to the explanation of natural phenomena, and the further proof of
  the identity of frictional and voltaic electricities.    He describes two
  instruments which he employed for the purpose of regulating the
  discharges of a Leyden jar, or battery, by adjusting with precision
  the distances between two brass balls, forming a communication
  between the inner and outer coatings;           allowing of their being
 charged only to a limited degree of intensity, by can'ying off all the
 electricity beyond that extent; and thus guarding the glass from
 the dangers of fracture from an excess of charge.          He is led to the
 conclusion, that with a given dialectric, such as glass, the limit to
 the intensity of the charge it can receive varies directly as the cube
 of its thickness, being in the compound ratio of the resistance it
 presents to the discharge, which is simply as the thickness, and of
 the square of the distance of the two charged surfaces, such being
 the law of electric action.
     When a number of insulated lreyden jars, arranged in a consecu
 tive series by connecting the outer coating of each with the inner
 coating of the next, is charged by means of an electrical machine,
 the tension of the charge diminishes in each jar as they follow in the
series, that of the terminal jar being exceedingly small. On the other
hand, when each jar has been charged separately in the same manner
and to an equal extent, and then quickly arranged in a series, the
jars not touching one another, but the knobs connected with the
inner coating of each jar, after the <U+FB01>rst, being placed at a certain
distance from the outer coating of the preceding jar, which in such
an arrangement is charged with an electricity of an opposite kind to
that of the knob adjacent to    it, the author found that the tension of
the electricities was greatly augmented, giving rise to violent ex
plosions whenever a discharge occurred.          He considers    a  battery
thus constituted as bearing the same relation to a single Leyden jar
as the voltaic pile does to a   single galvanic circle   ; and as affording
in like manner the means of exalting, to any assignable degree, the
electric tension.     Adopting the views of Mr. Crosse as to the con
stitution of a   thunder-cloud, namely, that   it   is  formed ofa  number
of concentric zones of electricity, alternately positive and negative,

                                    732
the central one having the highest intensity, and the tension dimi
nishing in the successive zones surrounding the innermost, till it
became inappreciable in the one most remote; the author considers
this condition of the cloud to be analogous to that of the battery
above described, and the phenomena of the former to receive com
plete illustration from the experimental results obtained with the
latter.                                        .

    “ On the Heat disengaged during Metallic Substitutions." By
 Thomas Andrews, M.D., M .R.I.A., Vice-President of Queen's Col
 lege, Belfast, &c. Communicated by Michael Faraday, Esq., D.C.L.,    r
 F.R.S. &c.
    In a paper which was published in the Philosophical Transactions
 for 1844,   the author deduced from the experimental inquiry there
 recorded the general law, that when one base displaces another from
 any of its neutral combinations with an acid, the heat evolved or
  abstracted is always the same, whatever that acid element may be,
 provided the bases are the same.       Extending a similar. inquiry to
  salts with metallic bases, he establishes, as the result of the investi
  gation of which an account is givenin the present paper, the ge
  neral principle that when an equivalent of one and the same metal
  replaces another in a solution of any of its salts of the same order,
 the heat developed is, with the same metals, constantly the same,
 the expression “rof a solution of the same order" being understood
 to mean a solution in which the same precipitate is produced by the
  addition of an alkali, or, on one view of the composition of such
  salts, in which the metal exists in the same state of oxidation. The
 metallic salts, in the precipitation of which by other metals the
  evolved heat was ascertained, were those of copper precipitated by
 zinc, iron or lead; of silver, precipitated by zinc or copper; and of
 lead, mercury, and platinum precipitated by zinc: and the acid ele
 ments were either the sulphuric, hydrochloric, acetic or formic acids.
 From the last series of experiments the author deduces, that if three
 metals A, B, and C, be so related that it is capable of displacing B
 and C from their combinations, and also B capable of displacing C,
 then the heat developed in the substitution of A for C will be equal
 to that developed in the substitution of B for C ; and a similar rule
 may be applied to any number of metals similarly related.

    "  On Galvanic Currents existing in the Blood."       By James New
 ton Heale, Esq., Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians, and

                                    733
  Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. Communicate
  by P.  M. Roget, M.D., Sec. R.S.
     The following abstract of this paper has been drawn up by the
 author.
     The author endeavours to prove, by inductive reasoning and by
 historical considerations of the earliest indication of vitality in the
 egg, that motion of a <U+FB02>uid in a ccrtain de<U+FB01>nite circle constitutes the
 <U+FB01>rst link in the chain of causes by which vitality is perfected ; that
 all the other phenomena of living structure are supplementary and
 superinduced upon this primary and iudis|)cn.-uble condition; and thnt,
 although it might be possible to maintain this primary circulation
 under certain circumstances, even though all the other functions of
 life were suspended or destroyetl, they, on the contrary, cannot exist
 independently of thut circulation.     He shows it to be necessary to
 circulation, that two <U+FB02>uids. or a <U+FB02>uid in two different states, should
 communicate by two points or extremities with cnch other, and that
 these extremities should present such n resistance to their mutual
 connexion and commixion, that the transfer of conditions of each,
 from one to the other, must take place, otherwise the uniformity of
 both would speedily put an cnd to the process; and it is indicated
 that the forces in operation in these two places would be reverse to
 each other; in the one it would be from arterial to venous, and in
 the other from venous to arterial.                                    '
    The blood-vessels containing the two kinds of blood are com
pared by the author to two bar-magnets placed side by side, the
pulmonary and systemic capillaries representing the armaturcs placed
 at their extremities ; with this limitation, that as the changes in
 the blood take place only in the two opposed sets of capillaries,
 the force is necessarily generated only in them. and therefore the
intermediate blood contained in the larger blood-vessels merely re
presents conducting wires completing the circuit.      The left side of
the heart is viewed as being placed in the largest ampulla of the arte
rial circulation, and the right side of the heart as being in the like
position with respect to the venous current.                           -
    The portal circulation is alluded to, in order to prove that a pro
pelling force is not essential to produce circulation of blood. An
account is given of numerous experiments on various animals, in
which the ends of two similar wires (in some cases of copper and in
others of platinum) were inserted; that of the one into n vein, and
that of the other into an artery, the free ends of both wires being
brought into connexion with u delicate galvanometer; and it was
found that during life a galvanic current was indicated, passing along
the artery and returning by the vein ; that this current became more
feeble in proportion as the vitality of the animal declined, and again
more strong as the effect of the chloroform, which was administered
for the purpose of preventing pain, subsided.
    The author also observed, that the strong action of a muscle (the
sterno-mastoid) between the two blood-vessels tended to discharge
the galvanic force as it was generated; and that when that muscle
was divided, the galvanic force became much stronger.         VVhen the

                                   734
connexion of the current with the lungs was severed by a ligature
placed on the vein between the insertion of the wire and the heart,
the current was instantly reversed, passing up the vein and returning
by the artery.    The same reverse current was indicated when the
wires were inserted into portions of the blood-vessels which had been
isolated, each by two ligatures, placed the one above and the other
below the insertion of the wires. A similar effect was also obtained,
as long as the blood continued to coagulate, when the two kinds of
blood were drawn from the blood-vessels into separate cups, and
brought into connexion with the galvanometer; the blood in the cups
being connected together by the ends of a piece of copper or of a
strip of muscle dipping into each.
    Several experiments are related, tending to prove that the power
which <U+FB02>uids, differing chemically from each other in however great
a degree, were supposed to possess of acting chemically upon the
copper wire, and thus generating currents, had been greatly exag
gerated; and that much which had been attributed to this cause de
served rather to be ascribed to the polar forces, which the <U+FB02>uids had
a tendency to assume, being discharged through the copper as a
conductor, since the same effect was produced when platinum was
used, and in an appreciable degree even when no metal was in con
tact with those arti<U+FB01>cial compounds, cotton moistened with water
being only used to make the different connexions with the <U+FB02>uids.
   The author then traces the course of the blood in the fcetus, show
ing that the blood passes in it, throughout the body, in the direction
wholly from artery to vein ; the upper half constituting one segment,
and the lower half of the body the other segment of the circle; and
pointed out that, thus far, there was no antagonism of forces, and
therefore no power of generating a galvanic current, which he indi
cated was supplied by the smaller circle, through the placenta, join
ing the larger circle at the vena cava, and leaving it at the hypo
gastric arteries; the smaller circle inducing the current in the larger,
in the same manner as the larger circle in the adult maybe supposed
to induce lesser secondary circles, as the hepatic, &c.
   The author then dilates on the importance of the galvanic current
in physiological and pathological inquiry; pointing out the peculiar
signi<U+FB01>cance of the fact of the reverse current being established as
soon as the direct current is impeded ; the systemic capillaries being
endowed with the power of generating a force exactly the reverse to
that set up in the lungs; the rapidity of the circulation thus being,
czeteris paribus, the measure of the excess of the primary force over
the resistance.    He infers, that the galvanism found in the muscles
owes its origin to the opposed condition of the blood in the capillary
network which supplies each; the anastomoses of the arterial capil
laries with each other increasing their galvanic surface, while their
limited anastomoses with the veins supply the conditions necessary
for the passive current.    Tlie o<U+FB02>ice of conductors, for the active dis
charge of the accumulated force, is assigned to the nerves of the
voluntary muscles; the author believing that the circuit by which
this is effected is, in them, prolonged up to and from the nervous

                                   \l Q'Q1
centres ; which centres are, in their turn. shown to be liberally sup
plied wilh blood-vessels capable of in<U+FB02>uencing the galvanic equili
brium.     The accclcrated respiration caused by increased muscular
exertion is attributed to this cause.       It is inferred, that the involun
tary muscles are provided with apparatus within themselves, adapted
toregulute their periodical galvanic discharge. The mutual reaction
of distant parts is attributed to the fact of the whole body being
included in one galvanic circle, which cannot be disturbed in a part
without the whole participating proportionally in the effects.

    " Examination   of the Proximate Principles of the Lichens."            By
John Stenhouse, Esq., Ph.D.
   The author, after adverting to the labours of llobiquet, Heeren,
Dumas, and Kane in the investigation of the proximate principles of
the lichens, especially of those which yield red colouring matter with
ammonia, and also of the more recent inquirers on this subject, such
as Schunck, Rochlcder, Heldt and Knop, who have greatly extended
our knowledge of this interesting but dif<U+FB01>cult department of organic
research, proceeds to state that ncnrly two years ago his attention
was directed by Dr. Pereira to n kind of Orcclla weed, which had
been recently imported into London from the Cape of Good Hope,
but which had been rejected by the London archil manufacturers
as being un<U+FB01>t for their use, from the small quantity of colouring
matter it yields when subjected to the usual process. \Vith a view
to ascertain whether or not the red dyes obtained from the various
lichens result from the action of ammonia on a certain crystalline
principle, described by Schunck under the name of lecanorine, the
author procured quantities of the several lichens usually employed
by the archil makers, and subjected them to investigation; the minute
details of which, together with the results, are given at length in the
present paper.
   The specimens examined are the following :
            I. South American variety      of Roccella tinctorin.
   The lichen was cut into small pieces and macerated with a large
quantity of water for some hours, then quick-lime was added.                  A
yellow solution was obtained, from which muriatic acid precipitated
the colouring matter, as a bulky gelatinous mass ; this was washed,
dried on a plate of gypsum, and dissolved in hot spirits of wine (not
boiling). The solution on cooling deposited the colouring principle
in small white prismatic needles arranged in stars. This is—

and its salt of baryta—

      2. Alpha-Orsellesic acid was obtained by mixing crude gelatinous
  orsellic acid with a little water, neutralizing with lime or baryta, and
  precipitating with muriatic acid.                       A gelatinous hydrate is obtained,
  which may be puri<U+FB01>ed by solution in dilute alcohol and crystallization.
     The composition of this acid and its baryta salt is as follows :—
                Alpha- Orsellesic acid              . . . . . .       C16   Ha 07+   HO                ‘
                                                                                                        r
                Alpha-Orsellesiate             of  lzaryta            C1, H8   O,-|-BaO.
     This acid gives a fugitive bluish-red or violet tint with hypochlo
 rite of lime.           Orsellic acid gives a deep blood-red tint, quickly
  changing to yellow.                        -                 .
     3. Orsellesic ether, C16 H, O, 4-C4 H,-, O, is obtained from alpha-or
 sellic acid by boiling in strong alcohol, evaporating to dryness, and
 dissolving in boiling water.                   It crystallizes on cooling in long <U+FB02>at
 needles, having a yellowish colour from adhering resin,

     By processes similar to those just mentioned, this lichen yie1ded-

     2. Beta- Orsellesic acid (formula to be given hereafter).
     3. An ether compound, which is probably orsellesic ether.                                     By
 three experiments its composition was found to be—
                                            I.            .          II.              III.

    4. R0ccellim'n.—Obtained by drying the gelatinous mass which is
precipitated from the lime solution by muriatic acid, and boiling in
strong spirit. The ether compound dissolves, and roccellinin remains
behind.        It is puri<U+FB01>ed by repeated crystallization from strong spirit,
aided by     animal      charcoal, and presents itself in soft hair-like crystals
about    an   inch long, arranged in stars.                         It is a very indifferent sub
stance, appearing however to be a feeble acid.                                                      .

baryta, and throwing down crythrelesic acid with muriatic acid, a
mother-liquid is obtained containing picro-erythrin, from which that
substance may be separated in the form of yellowish crystals; and
these may be puri<U+FB01>ed and decolorized by repeated crystallization from
hot water aided by the use of animal charcoal. Picro-erythrin gives
a blood-red colour with hypochlorite of lime.
    Its empirical formula is L', H,, 0,...
    6. Pseudo-orcin, of which the empirical formula is C“, H“ Om. It
is obtained hy boiling the lime solution of R. Mantagnei till it is re
duced to one-fourth of its hulk, passing carbonic acid in excess
through the liquid, and evaporating the <U+FB01>ltered liquid to the consist
ence of a syrup; this is introduced into a <U+FB02>ask and digested with a
large quantity of ether, which dissolves orcin and leaves pseudo
orcin.      On being crystallized two or three times from strong spirit,
it is obtained in large shining colourless crystals. Still larger cry
stals may be obtained from an aqueous solution.                    Hypochlorite of
lime has no action upon it.
    The author then gives a mode of extracting the colouring princi
ples of the lichens, so as to make them portable for commercial pur
poses. The extraction might be performed in the country where the
 lichens grow, by cutting them up into small pieces, macerating in
milk of lime, neutralizing with muriatic or acetic acid, collecting
the gelatinous precipitate on cloths, and drying it at a gentle heat.
     He also suggests two modes of estimating the quantity of colour
ing matter in the lichens.
     1. By macerating a known quantity of the lichen in milk of lime,
 and adding bleaching powder of known strength from an alkalimeter
 till all colour disappears from the liqnid, and noting the quantity of
 solution required.     lt is thus found that

 solution yields crystals of evernic acid. The insoluble part is usnic

for about an hour.      Carbonic acid is given off, and crystals of co

   “ On    a Formula for the Elastic Force of Vapour at different
Temperatures."       By Captain Shortrede.          Communicated by Lieut-.
Col. Sykes, F.R.S.
   The author adopts as the basis of his formula the <U+FB01>rst series of
experiments at high temperatures made by the French Academy,
and those of Magnus at low temperatures.                    For the Academy's
experiments, he adopts the indications of the smaller thermometer in
the steam in preference to those of the larger thermometer in the
water.    Of Dr. Young’s sort of formulae, he notices that of the Aca
demy and several others with exponents varying from 5 to 7.              From
the elasticity at freezing, as given by Magnus, compared with four
of the Academy’s experiments, he shows that for the range of obser

                                              739
vation the number   6 is preferable to 5 as an exponent; but, as he
states, no formula of this sort with a constant index can be found to
agree with the observations throughout.
   The formula of Magnus he <U+FB01>nds to agree with these observations
better than any of the others ; but being adapted to the air-thermo
meter, and therefore not convenient for ordinary use, he gives his
own formula adapted to the mercurial thermometer,

   The author compares with the experiments the formula of the
Academy and those of Southern. Coriolis. Tredgold, and one deduced
as above; also that given by August, and the same modi<U+FB01>ed so as
to give at freezing the elasticity found by Magnus; also that of
Magnos, and the same reduced to the mercurial thermometer by the
data of Dulong and Petit; and lastly, his own formula.      Then as
suming that the experiments of Mngnus are represented by his for
mula, he compares the other formula with      at every 10° from— 10°

Academy's formula      better than the others of Dr. Young's sort;
                          is
but at low temperatures        very erroneous.
                                   it   is        Southern's formula
at low temperatures    better than that of Coriolis, but at high tem
                          is
peratures not so good.   Tredgold and the other like     are better at      it
low temperatures than that of Coriolis, but worse at high tempera
tures.       August’s formula      is       and in its modi<U+FB01>ed form
                                        very erroneous      ;
it   is   still worse, the errors increasing to about
                                               10° or more, showing
that the theoretic considerations by which          deduced are not
                                                                  it   is
founded in truth.   With the Academy's experiments, the errors of
Magnus's formula are —, but when reduced to the mercurial ther
mometer they are all + the mean of the whole being 0°'33.
                               ,                               With
the new formula the errorsare nearly balanced, the sums on the
thirty experiments being — l°'78 and +3°'55, in only two cases
amounting to half a degree.    On the twelve experiments, at or near
the maximum, the errors are —l°'l2 and +0°'43.
   From zero to 100° the differences between the new formula and
that of Magnus are all of one kind; and when reduced to tempera
ture are less than 0°'4, which the author thinks to be within the
probable difference between the air and mercurial thermometers, and
within the errors of observation.

     “ On the Moist-Bulb Problem." By Captain Shortrede.           Com
 municated by Lieut.-Colonel W. H. Sykes, F.R.S.
 r
     The author adopts the notation of Professor Apjohn, and by a
 similar method deduces the fundamental equation, which is then
 translated into numbers, taking ll75° F. as the sum of the latent
 and sensible heats, 0'267 as the speci<U+FB01>c heat of dry air, the weight
 of aqueous vapour as <U+FB01>ve-eighths of that of air, and its speci<U+FB01>c heat
 =O'S67, that of water being unity.                                      .
 .
     The coe<U+FB01>icient for barometric pressure is resolved into a simple
 change on the temperature of the air, and consequently also on the
 depression of the moist bulb ; and the equation is put into a shape
 convenient for use, and shown to be free from objection.           The
 author uses the table of the force of vapour, given in the accom
 panying preceding paper, and then gives a table of maximum
 depressions for every degree of the moist bulb from —40° to 212°,
 and another table interpolated from it for every degree of temperature
 of the air from 0° to 212°.          Q
 . Gay-Lussac’s    depressions are then compared with those of the new
formula; and the errors are shown to be almost insensible near the
freezing-point, but increasing gradually, till at 25 Cent. it is about
 10 per cent.    The author attributes these errors to the gradual de
terioration of the chloride of lime during the experiments.
    The author then compares Prinsep’s maximum depressions collected
and given in vol. v. of the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal.
The observed depressions are generally below those given by the new
formula, like those of Gay-Lussac. The errors on those where the
air was heated by a steam-pipe, are not greater than on those at na
tural temperatures; and that with air passing through a porcelain
tube at an orange heat, falls within the limits assigned by Prinsep in
estimating the temperature of the air.
    Apjohn’s maximum depressions are then compared with the new
formula.    And here the errors are of an oppositecharacter to those
preceding, which the author attributes to the lowering of tempera

      .                                  7-ll
     ture occasioned by expansion on escaping from the compression used
     to force the air in a rapid current through the apparatus.        Apjohn's
     dew-point observations are then compared, and the errors are found to
     be similar to the preceding, and apparently from the same cause.
         To make the formula generally useful, the author gives a table of
     the depression of dew-point below temp|rature for every degree of
     depression of the moist bulb, at every 5° of tempeniture from 0° to
      100°, and for every 10° from 100° to l-lO°, which he protructs on a
     chart, so as to give the dew-point in every case with little more
     trouble than is required for reading a common thermometer, and
     also at the same time the elasticity of vapour in the atmosphere.
         " Experiments on the in<U+FB02>uence of Magnetism on Polarized Light."
   I  By Professor Carlo Matteucci.        Communicated by Sir John F. W.
      Herschel, Bart., V.P.lt.S. 8-c.
         The object of this notice is to communicate some recent experi
      ments on diamagnetism, and particularly on the in<U+FB02>uenee of mag
      netism on polarized light. The following extracts are in the words
      of the author :—
         “ The apparatus l employed in these experiments was an electro
      magnetic apparatus invented by M.l{umkorf, and described by l\l.Biot
      at a meeting of the Academy of Sciences of Paris, and consisting of
      a powerful electro-magnet, of which the soft iron cylinder is traversed
      by a hole in the direction of the length of the axis. through which
      hole the ray of polarized light is made to pass; and the voltaic cur
      rent which l employed on this occasion was that of seven pair of
      Grove's construction.      I made my <U+FB01>rst experiment with a piece of
      heavy   glass, which   I received  from Faraday himself.      In .order to
      assure myself of the exact amount of rotation induced by magnetic
      action, I caused the ray of light, before it reached the heavy glass,
      to pass through the system invented by M. Soleil, consisting of two
      equal plates of perpendicular quartz, placed side by side; the one
      turning to the right, the other to the left.    l ascertained, <U+FB01>rst of all,
      the rotation produced by making       the current pass sometimes in one
      direction, and sometimes in the other ; the two rotations, one to the
      right, the other to the left, thus produced, were exactly the same.
      Then I compressed slightly the middle part of the piece of heavy
      glass, in the same manner as one compresses pieces of glass.         lwas
      then obliged to turn the eyepiece in a certain direction in order to
      restore the image to its <U+FB01>rst condition; in my experiments lalways
      had to turn it, after compression. towards the right.        I next made
       the current pass, <U+FB01>rst in one direction. then in the other.      The ge
      neral facts which I have observed constantly and without exception
       are the following :—The rotation produced by the magnet on the com
      pressed piece of heavy glass is not the same to the right as it is to the
      left : the rotation produced by the magnet is considerably greater in
       the direction of the rotation produced by compression than it is in the
       contrary direction : the rotation produced by the magnet on the com
      pressed heavy glass, and in the direction of the rotation produced by the
       compression, is greater than that produced by the same magnet on glass
$9

                                     742
  which has not been compressed, and the rotation in the contrary direc
  tion is less.   The following are the numerical results.
      “ In one experiment I obtained on a piece of heavy glass not com
  pressed, 3° of rotation to the right or to the left, according to the
  direction of the current: on slightly compressing the glass, I had to
 turn to the right the eyepiece to 4°, 5°, and even to 8° in order to
  restore the image to its <U+FB01>rst condition.    In closing the circuit, the
 rotation produced in the same direction as that due to compression
 was 3§° or 4°, while the rotation produced in the contrary direction
 was from 2° to 1§°.       On ceasing to compress the glass, I obtained
 the same phaenomena as I had observed before the compression.
     “ I have made in the same manner experiments with a piece of
 <U+FB02>int--glass, which produced a rotation of 2° under the in<U+FB02>uence of the
 magnet.      When I applied the same magnet to pieces of compressed
 <U+FB02>int-glass, I could not discover the slightest sensible rotation in
 whatever direction I might make the current pass. Plates of quartz
 cut perpendicularly or parallel to the axis, and compressed in various
 directions, did not acquire any rotatory power under the in<U+FB02>uence of
 the magnet.      I think that the peculiarity exhibited by compressed
 heavy glass. is of some interest, in as far as it appears likely to lead
 to a more satisfactory explanation of the want of rotatory power
 communicated by magnetism|in crystalline bodies.
     “ I shall conclude by communicating the negative results of some
 experiments I attempted with a view to discover the action of dia
magnetic bodies on each other, and of magnetism on gaseous bodies.
I suspended small needles of bismuth between the poles of a very
powerful electro-magnet, and with a good chronometer I counted
the number of their oscillations, either alone or in the vicinity of
 pieces of bismuth of various shapes and sizes.     I repeated these ex
periments with all possible care, avoiding the slightest current of air,
reckoning the smallest oscillations, and those of the same extent in
the di<U+FB02>erent cases.      I never obtained any di<U+FB02>erences beyond half a
second, which existed equally whether the pieces of bismuth were
near or not.      The experiment therefore does not serve to show the
action of diamagnetic bodies on each other; an action which natu
rally ought to exist, but which perhaps is overpowered by the stronger
action of the magnet.
    “ I afterwards counted the oscillations of a small needle of bismuth,
which I succeeded in suspending by a silk <U+FB01>bre (<U+FB01>l de cocon) inside
of a glass ball blown at the top of a barometer-tube.       The ball was
placed between the poles of my electro-magnet.         In this experiment
the bismuth needle was held sometimes in a nearly perfect vacuum,
at others in atmospheric air. The number of oscillations in both
cases was exactly the same.
    “ We must therefore give up the idea of explaining diamagnetic
phaenomena by a magnetic action, which would be stronger upon the
air than upon bismuth."

    "On   the Corrections necessary to be applied to Meteorological
Observations made at particular periods, in order to deduce from
them Monthly Means."         By James Glaisher, Esq., of the Royal
Observatory.     Communicated by G. B. Airy. Esq., F.R.S., &c.,
Astronomer Royal.
    The author, under whose immediate superintendence the whole of
the mngnetical and meteorological observations taken at the Royal
Observatory at Greenwich have been conducted, by direction of
the Astronomer-Royal, has communicated in the present paper
various tabular results deduced from the meteorological observations,
reserving for future notice those deduced from the magnetical series.
His chief object has been to determine the corrections which are
applicable to the results obtained by different observers at various
times, so as to render them comparable with one another.          The
barometrical and thermometrical observations here recorded have
been made at every hour of Gottingen mean solar time, during the
whole of <U+FB01>ve years, namely, from the end of 1840 to that of 1845.
The mean of each hour represents the results deduced from about
 150 observations; those for each month represent about 1800 ob
servations ; and those for the year represent upwards of 21,000 ob
servations of each element.
    Tables are given representing the excess of the mean value of each
element at every hour of observation, in every month, above the mean
value for the month; and also the mean of the numbers so found,
arranged for the different years, and likewise for the same hours in
every month.      The numbers were then laid down on paper, as ordi
nates to a curve of which the times were the abscissae, and a curve
passed through, or very near each point; and the ordinates at every
 Greenwich hour were measured from that curve, and their values
given in a table.    The accordance of the results thus obtained for
the same hours in the same months of the di<U+FB02>erent years is very
close and satisfactory; and shows that observers may obtain very
                                 L
valuable approximate results, by taking a comparatively small num
ber of observations in each day at hours by no means inconvenient
in ordinary life, furnishing a close approximation to the mean and
extreme values, as well as to the diurnal and annual variations of
atmospherical phenomena.

     " Report of Experiments made on the Tides in the Irish Sea; on
 the similarity of the Tidal phenomena of the Irish and English Chan
 nels; and on the importance of extending the experiments round the

                                      744
Land’s-End and up the English Channel."               Embodied in a letter to
the Hydrographer, by Captain F. W. Beechey, R.N., F.R.S.                   Com
municated by G. B. Airy, Esq., F.R.S., Astronomer Royal.
    The author commences by stating, that the set of the tides in the
Irish Sea had always been misunderstood, owing to the disposition
to associate the turn of the stream with the rise and fall of the water
on the shore. This misapprehension, in a channel varying so much
in its times of high water, could not fail to produce much mischief ;
and to this cause may be ascribed, in all probability, a large proportion
of the wrecks in Caernarvon Bay.
    The present inquiry has dispelled these errors, and has furnished
science with some new and interesting facts.               It has shown that,
notwithstanding      the variety  of times   of  high   water, the turn of the
stream throughout      the  north  and   south  Channels    occurs   at the same
hour, and that this time happens to coincide with the times of high
and low water at Moricombe Bay, a place remarkable as being the
spot where the streams coming round the opposite extremities of
Ireland <U+FB01>nally unite. These experiments, taken in connexion with
those of the Ordnance made at the suggestion of Professor Airy,
 show that there are two spots in the Irish Sea, in one of which the
 stream runs with considerable rapidity, without there being any rise
 or fall of the water, and in the other the water rises and falls without
 having any perceptible stream ; that the same stream makes high and
 low water in different parts of the channel at the same time; and
 that during certain portions of the tide, the stream, opposing the
 wave, runs up an ascent of one foot in three miles, with a velocity of
 three miles an hour.
     The author then enters minutely into the course of the stream;
  shows that the point of union of the streams from the opposite chan
  nels takes place on a line drawn from Carlingford through Peel in the
  Isle of Man on to Morecombe Bay; and concludes his remarks on
  this part of the subject, by adverting to the great bene<U+FB01>t navigation
  will derive from the present inquiry.
     The author then notices a chart of lines of equal range of tide,
  which has been compiled partly from the ranges published by the
  Royal Society0, and partly from observations made on the present
  occasion; and has annexed a table T, by the aid of which the seaman
  will be able to compare his soundings taken at any time of the tide
  with the depths marked upon the Admiralty charts.
   , Next follows the mention of a feature in the motion of the tide
  wave, which Captain Beechey thinks has hitherto escaped observation;
  viz. that the upper portions of the water fall quicker than the lower,
  or in other words, that the half-tide level does not coincide with the
  place of the water at the half-tide interval; that this difference in
  the Bristol Channel amounts to as much as four feeti, and that the
  law seems to be applicable to all the tides of the Irish Sea§.
      We are 'next presented with a table (No. 5) exhibiting the various
                                                                              i

                                     7-I5
curves assumed by the tide-wave, and with the durations of the ebb
and flood at each place.
    Having explained these observations in the Irish Sea, the author
proceeds to apply to the tides of the English Channel the law which
he found to regulate the stream of the Irish Channel, availing himself
of the observations of Captain M. White and others for this purpose.
There was no di<U+FB02>iculty in adapting the rule in the upper part of the
 Channel; but below the contraction of the strait, the apparent dis
cordance was so great, that nothing but a reliance on the general
accuracy of the observations prevented the inquiry being abandoned.
    It seemed that the streams are operated upon by two great forces,
acting in opposition to each other; viz. that there is a great oiling
stream setting along the western side of the British Isles, and <U+FB02>owing
in opposition to the tides of the Channel above the contraction, turn
ing the stream with greater or less effect as the site is near to, or
removed from, the points of in<U+FB02>uence.        By pursuing this idea, it was
immediately     seen  that  the observations in the English Channel re
spond    to it;  and then applying it to the o<U+FB02>ing of the Irish Sea. and
considering that channel to comprise within its limits the Bristol
Channel, as the English Channel does the Gulf of St. Malo, it was
found that the observations there also fully hear out the idea.         So
that there was afterwards but little di<U+FB02>iculty in tracing the course of
the water, and bringing into order what before appeared to be all
confusion.
    The author then traces the great similarity of tidal phenomena
of the two channels, and proceeds to describe them. For this pur
 pose he considers the            Channel as extending from a line con
                           Iris}:
necting the Land's End with Cape Clear to the end of its tidal stream,
or virtual head of the tide at Peel; and the English Channel from a
line joining the Land's End and Ushant, to the end of its tidal stream
oil" Dungeness.      With these preliminary lines, he shows that both
channels receive their tides from the Atlantic, and that they each
<U+FB02>ow up until met by counter-streams; that from the outer limit of
the English Channel to the virtual head of its tide the distance is
262 geographical miles; and in the Irish Channel, from its entrance
to the virtual head of its tide, it is 265 miles.
    In both channels there is a contraction about midway; by Cape
La Hague in the one, and by St. David's Head in the other, and at
nearly the same distance from the entrance.        In both cases this con
traction is the commencement of the regular stream, the time of the
movement of which is regulated by the vertical movement of the
 water at the virtual head of the channel ; situated in both cases 145
miles above the contraction, and the actual time of this change,
or Vulgar Establishment, is the same in both cases.       Below the con
traction of the strait, in both cases the stream varies its direction
according to the preponderance of force exerted over it by the oiling
stream.     In both caaes, between the contraction and the sonthern
horn of the channel, there is a deep estuary (the Bristol Channel and
the Gulf of St. Malo) in which the times of high water are nearly
the same, and where, in both, the streams, meeting in the channel,

                                       746
 =pour   their waters into ‘these gulfs, and in both raise the tide to the
  extraordinary elevation of forty-seven feet.       From the Land's End
  to the meeting of these streams in one case is seventy-<U+FB01>ve miles, and
  in the other the same.
      In one channel, at Courtown, a little way above the contraction,
 and at 150 miles from the entrance, there is little or no rise of the
  water; and in the other, about Swanage, at the same distance from
  the entrance, there is but a small rise of tide also (<U+FB01>ve feet at springs).
  In both cases these spots are the node or hinge of the tide-wave, on
  either side of which the times of high water are reversed.              And
  again,  near  the virtual head  of the tide, in both cases  there  is an in
  creased elevation of the water on the south-east side of the channel
  of about one-third of the column; the rise at Liverpool being thirty
  one feet, and at Cayeux thirty-four feet.
      The author traces a further identity in the progress of the tide
  wave along the sides of both channels opposite to that of the node.
  In the <U+FB01>rst part of the channel the wave in each travels at about
  <U+FB01>fty miles per hour; in the next, just above the node, this rate is
  brought down to about thirty miles per hour in one, and to sixteen
 miles in the other; it then in both becomes accelerated, and attains
                                             r
 to about seventy-six miles per hour.
      Lastly, the author observes that the node or hinge of the tide,
 placed by Professor Whewell (in his papers on the Tides) in the
  North Sea, is situated at the same distance nearly from the head of
  the tide off Dungeness, as the node near Swanage is on the opposite
  side of it ; and that in the Irish Channel, at the same distance nearly
 as the node at Courtown is from the head of the tide o<U+FB01>’ Peel, there
 is a similar spot of no rise recently observed by Captain Robinson.
      The author concludes this paper by urging a further investigation
  of the tidal phenomena of the English Channel, on the ground of the
  great advantage navigation, as well as science in general, would de
  rive from such an examination.
      Captain Beechey’s letter is illustrated by twelve charts and dia
  grams, showing the identity and singular phenomena of these two
  great channels.

      " Observations on some Belemnites and other fossil remains of
   Cephalopoda, discovered by Mr. Reginald Neville Mantell, C.E., in
   the Oxford Clay, near Trowbridge in Wiltshire." By Gideon Algernon
   Mantell, Esq., LL.D., F.R.S., Vice-President of the Geological
  Society.
      The author states, that   a line of railway now in progress of con
   struction to connect the large manufacturing town of Trowbridge
   with the Great Western, being part of the Wilts, Somerset, and

                                     ‘I   IL‘

Weymouth line, traverses extensive beds of the Oxford clay of the
same geological character as those at Christian-Malford in the same
county, which furnished the remarkable fossil cephalopods described
by Mr. Channing Pearce under the name of Belnnnoleutbis, and by
Professor Owen (in     a   memoir which received the award of a Royal
Medal of this Society), as the animals to which the fossils commonly
known by the name of Belenuuiln belong.
    The son of the author, Mr. R. N. Mantell, being engaged in these
works under the eminent engineer Mr. Brunei, availed himself of the
opportunity to form an extensive and highly interesting collection of
the fossils of the Oxford clay. and other oolitic deposits cut through
or exposed by the engineering operations.        Among those transmitted
to the author are many illustrative examples of Bclemnoteuthes and
Belemnites; some of which con<U+FB01>rm the opinions entertained by the
late Mr. C. Pearce. Mr. Cunnington. and other competent observers,
that the body and soft parts, with the cephalic uncinated arms, &c.
of cephalopods, obtained from Christian-Malford by the Noble Pre
sident and Mr. Pearce Pratt, and referred by Professor Owen in the
memoir above-mentioned to the Belemnite, belong to                  a distinct
genus—the Belemnoteuthis.
    The author describes and <U+FB01>gures several perfect examples of the
phragmocone of the Bclemnoteuthis, and institutes         a  comparison be
tween them and beautiful example of the phragmocone of a belem
                   a
nite occupying the alveolus of the guard; and de<U+FB01>nes the essential dif
ferences observable in the form and structure of these chambered cal
careous cones.       He especially points out as distinctive characters of
 the phragmocone of the Belemnoteuthis, two <U+FB02>at longitudinal ridges
which extend upwards from the apical extremity, and the granulated
and striated external surface of the epidermis.           The phragmocone
of the Belemnibe has         a smooth surface,   is  destitute of any lon
gitudinal ridges, and terminates at the apex in       a  very <U+FB01>ne point, the
axis being in an oblique direction.
    The author next describes    a   remarkable specimen of     a Belemnite,
twenty-two      inches in length,   in which  the  osselet  or guard, phrag
 mocone, and capsule or receptacle, are preserved in connexion.              In
this fossil is  demonstrated, for the <U+FB01>rst time, the upper or basal ter
mination of the phragmocone, with two elongated calcareous pro
 cesses extending upwards from the margin: these are analogous in
 form and position to the prolongations from the peristome of the
 outer chamber of certain Ammonites, as for example, in A. Jasoni.
ln the phragmocone of the Belemnoteuthis the peristome               entire.
                                                                    is
    Another interesting part of the structure of the Belemnite, not
 previously detected,   is  also shown in the same specimen, as well as
 in many other examples found in the Oxford clay near Trowbridge;
 namely, a calcareous shelly periosteum or capsule, which invests the
 guard, and expands upwards into           horny sheath or receptacle, that
                                           a
 surrounds the basal chamber of the phragmocone in which the viscera
 were probably contained.         This receptacle was formerly supposed to
 originate  from   within the   alveolus of the guard.     Mr. Miller, many
 years ago,   inferred  the  existence   of a vascular  integument around

                                   748
the guard from the meandring impressions of blood-vessels obser
vable on the surface of some specimens; but the presence of a cal
careo-corneous capsule or sheath investing the guard, and expanding
into a horny receptacle, has not till now been demonstrated.
    The author considers the facts described as proving that the ce
phalopod of the Belemnite was entirely distinct from the Belemno
teuthis; and that the muscular mantle, cephalic arms, and other
parts referred by Professor Owen to the former, exclusively belong
to the latter genus.
    He concludes that the remains of at least three genera of naked
Cephalopoda occur in the argillaceous deposits of the oolite in Wilt
shire; namely, the <U+FB01>rst or true Calamary, with a horny dorsal gla
dius or pen ; the second. the Belemnoteuthis, or a decapod with unci
nated cephalic arms, ink-bag, pallial <U+FB01>ns, and a corneo-calcareous
phragmocone; and the third, the Belemnite, which possessed a phrag
mocone having the apical part implanted in the cavity or alveolus of
a guard or osselet, which in its original state resembled in substance
the sepiostaire of the Cuttle-<U+FB01>sh, but is generally found mineralized
by calcareous spar ; and the peristome, possessing two or more elon
gated shelly processes; both the guard and the phragmocone being
invested with a corneo-calcareous capsule or receptacle. He observes,
lastly, that the body and other soft parts of the cephalopod of the
Belemnite are at present unknown.        The author's communication
was illustrated by drawings, and accompanied by the specimens
above described.

    “ Chemical Researches on the Nature of Wax." By Benjamin
 Collins Brodie, Esq. Communicated by Sir Benjamin Collins Brodie,
 Bart., F.R.S.
    It is known that bees’-wax is separable, by means of boiling water,
 into two portions : to the one, which is more soluble in alcohol than
 the other portion, the name of Cerin has been given : the residuary
portion, which does not dissolve, has been termed Mycicin.       In this
paper the author gives an account of his investigation of the proper
ties of the former of these substances, namely Cerin.
    This substance has been represented by certain chemists in France,
M. Lewy and M. Gerhardt, as being convertible by oxidation into
the stearic acid, and as being a substance which stands with respect
to that acid in the remarkable relation of an aldehyde. These views
the author believes are incorrect; and he states that no pure chemical
 substance was procured by these chemists from cerin, and that the

                                      749
substance of which the greater part of the cerin consists in no alde
hyde, but a hydrated acid. existing as such in bees’-wax.
    The acid is best prepared by precipitation from the alcoholic solu
tion of the cerin by an alcoholic solution of acetate of lead, and sub
sequent separation and precipitation of the acid by methods described
in the present paper.        When puri<U+FB01>ed, the acid is n white brittle
body, of a crystalline appearance, melting at from 79° to 80° C.
 The formula of the acid is C,, H“ O', a formula which was deter
 mined by the analysis of the silver salt having the constitution C“
 H” O, + AgO. and of the compound ether L7,, HM O, = CH ll,,
 O, + C, ll, O. The acid is volutile: it was analysed after distilla
 tion; and it was also procured from the wax itself in a pure state by
 simple processes of crystallization.      T 0 this acid the author gives
 the name of Cerolic acid.
     By the action of chlorine, the wax ncid is converted into a sub
 stance having all the appearance of a gum-resin ; a change analogous
 to which may be effected in various other wax substances examined
 by the author.      It has still the characters of an acid, and has the
 formula    C“         O4, a formula   which  is con<U+FB01>rmed    by that of the
                    Ii
  compound ether C M              O'. The analyses of  these substances are
                         {tll'°Ii
  given.
     When distilled in a pure state, the cerotic acid is volatile. When
  mixed with other waxy matters, however, it passes by distillation
  entirely into volatile oils, a circumstance which accounts for the fact
  that it has never been dissolved in the wax distillate.       By precipi
  tating a weighed quantity of wax by acetate of lead, the quantity
  per cent. of the cerotic acid in the bees'-wax, namely 22, was deter
  mined.
     This acid was present in all the European bees’-wax examined by
  the author; but suspecting that its quantity might vary in other in
  stances, he procured bees’-wax from Ceylon, formed under different
  conditions of climate and vegetation, and found on examination that
  there was a total absence of the acid in that specimen.       The author
  draws attention to this curious variation in the nature of an animal
  secretion under different conditions of life, a variation of which we
  have another example in that of the volatile acid of butter, discovered
  by Leich; namely, that the butyric and caproic acid of one season
  were, in another, replaced by vaccinic acid, differing from the former
  acids in the amount of oxygen alone.

   Honorable East India Company's Iron Steamer Pluto, from Septem

   By John Tudor, Commander R.N. Communicated by S. Hunter
   Christie, Esq., Sec. R.S., &c.
     The author states that the compasses of the Pluto were adjusted
   by Mr. Sims, of the <U+FB01>rm of Troughton and Sims, by order of Mr.

                                         I

    Pencoote of the East India House, under whose directions that ship
     was <U+FB01>tted out; and it is to the great pains taken ‘by Mr. Sims in
    placing the magnets employed for counteracting the local attraction
     that the author attributes the undeviating accuracy of those com
    passes during the whole time the Pluto was under his command in
     both hemispheres.      He observes that, in the <U+FB01>rst place, much care is
     required in securing the magnets, and protecting "them from wet,
     after their proper position has been ascertained.     In the case of the
     Pluto, two magnets were placed under the deck in the author's cabin ;
     one of them eighteen inches below the deck, being, it is true, an eye
     sore, but one of tri<U+FB02>ing consideration, when compared with the great
     importance of the well-working of the compass. The next point to
     be attended to is that the cards, or needles, should be all of the same
     size, and exactly corresponding with that of the compass used at the
     placing of the magnets for counteracting the local attraction.      The
     bittacles should all be of the same make and height, and the compass
     boxes of the same size; so that whenever a new compass or a fresh
     bittacle is wanted, the circle in which the needle moves may remain
     at the same angle from the magnet as at the <U+FB01>rst adjustment.         On
     a strict attention to these precautions will depend the well-working
     of the compassin all iron vessels, and also in wooden vessels when
     ever the quantity of iron they contain creates the necessity of mea
     sures being taken for counteracting local attraction.
        It has been alleged that the adjustments for local attraction made
     in northern latitudes are not correct when the ship is south of the
.1“  equator; but the author states that, in the Pluto, he observed no dif
     ference; that ship having made, while under his command, passages
    of many thousand miles, comprising 94 degrees of latitude, namely
    from 51° North to 43° South, and 153 degrees of longitude, namely
    from 30° West to 123° East, during the \vhole of which he never
     found any other correction for the compasses necessary excepting that
     required for the magnetic variation, the local attraction having been
     completely neutralized.

     magnets with relation to the compass.

   “ Minute structure of the Organ of Taste in Vertebrate Animals."
Part I. By Augustus Waller, M.D. Communicated by Richard
Owen, Esq., F.R.S.
   The author states that, in 1839, his attention was <U+FB01>rst directed to
the organ of taste on discovering the peculiar advantages for micro
scopic examination which are offered by the tongue of the living
frog. When prepared in the manner he describes, it is much more
transparent than the web of the foot; and its papillae, mucous mem
brane, blood-vessels, nerves, muscular <U+FB01>bres, &c. may all be examined
during life.
   He subsequently found that, contrary to the opinion of anatomists,

                                      752
it contains two     species of papillae distinct in their structure,   cor
responding     to the conical and fungiform papillae of man.
     In the presentcommunication        he describes the result of his fur
 ther researches on the frog's tongue, principally with regard to the
ultimate termination of the nerves in the papilla and the precise
 nature of the functions of these papillae in the act of taste, and de
 monstrates a similar disposition of the nervous extremities in man
 and the rest of the mammiferae.
     After giving a brief account of the researches of former ana
 tomists, he proceeds to state his method of preparing the frog for
 examination, which consists in rendering it insensible by exposing
 it to the vapour of ether or of various rother volatile agents. The
 tongue is then expanded so as to render it perfectly transparent.
 The conical papillae he describes as small cones, sometimes simple,
 sometimes compound.          They are composed of globular, or wedge
 shaped epithelial    cells, generally with a medullary stem running up
 the centre, giving off small processes to the separate epithelial cells.
  Each of the papilla.1 presents, near its summit, a small aperture. The
 fungiform papillae are distinguished from the‘ former by their glo
  bular shape, larger size, and above all by the existence of a coil of
  capillary vessels within them, containing blood in a state of active
  circulation. At their summit or at their sides, the vascular coils are
  extremely super<U+FB01>cial and merely covered by an exceedingly thin
  membrane.       Besides the blood-vessels, these papillae are invariably
  found to contain a nerve and also muscular <U+FB01>bres. The nerve con
  sists of about eight or ten simple tubules.       Atthe base of the pa
  pillae it forms several loops, and afterwards ascends between the
  capillary vessels towards the summit of the papillae, where its tubules
  diverge and terminate in abrupt extremities.          The author terms
  that part of the papillae where the membrane is so attenuated, and
  where the vessels ramify and the nerves terminate, the new-0-vas
  cular area; the muscular <U+FB01>bres ascend into the papilla in the same
  direction as the nerves, and after nearly reaching the summit, are
  lost in the tissue surrounding the neuro-vascular area.       The nerves
  of the conical papillae, contrary to the former, never terminate in
  abrupt extremities, and consist of a network of nearly single tubules.
  Neither the nerves nor the vessels of these papillae ascend into their
                                                                 ‘
  interior, but are only spread out at their base. r'              .
      The author deduces from these and other observations which are
  minutely described in his paper, that the fungiform are the papillae
  of taste and the conical those of touch. He considers that by rea
  son of the thinness of the membrane at the neuro-vascular area, a
  sapid substance must quickly traverse it; the nerves immediately
  beneath, like the spongioles of the roots of a plant, being acted upon
  by the sapid substance, convey the sensation of taste to the brain.
   The active circulation in the capillaries at the same spot appears to
  be for the purpose of removing by endosmosis the sapid substance
  from the nerve so as to render it capable of receiving a fresh im
  pression. A further peculiarity exists with respect to these papillae,
   which is that they present at their surface an active ciliary move
                                                                     I

                                           753
 ment of which the conical papillae are devoid.    This movement ap
 pears to be for the purpose of promoting absorption and of removing
any foreign particles from their surface.
   He regards the conical papillae as strictly destined for tactile
purposes, on account of the thickness of their epithelium, and the
presence of the nervous rami<U+FB01>cations at their base, which are simi
lar to those existing at the under surface of the tongue, where the
sensation of taste does not exist and the tactile powers alone are
present.
   The author has extended his observations to other animals, to the
mammifera, and to Man in particular, and statm that in all these
the same diffcrence exists between the two species of papillae.   He
promises in his next paper on this subject to describe the structure
of the mammiferaa.

only diffused in comparatively minute proportions throughout the
other parts of the nervous apparatus, which, when detached from
the central organ, speedily lose the power of exciting muscular con

  of the nervous system and the source of its power.
    .2. The grey matter of the spinal chord and the ganglia of the
  sympathetic are to be considered as reservoirs of this power, for the

     4'. In several disorders which have been too exclusively referred
 to the spinal chord, the brain is the organ principally implicated.

     For attaining the objects mentioned in the title of this paper, the
 author was led by a process of experimental research, founded on
 chemical principle, to the discovery of the superior ef<U+FB01>cacy of a
 varnish consisting of one part of piteh and two parts of naphtha,
 together with ten pounds of the sub- and per-oxides of copper to
 each quart of the varnish.     This varnish is made to adhere by ap
 plying it to the iron previously rendered hot by placing underneath
 it braziers of ignited charcoal. He found that this coating of var
 nish not only protected the iron from oxidation, but formed a perfect
 barrier to electro-chemical action between the copper oxide and the
 iron. Two or three of these coats are applied in succession, each
 being laid on after the preceding one has become hardened.          The
 trials made of this method on various ships, the results of which are
 detailed in an appendix to the paper, have proved perfectly satis

    " On   the Chemical Nature of a Wax from China."       By Benjamin
Collins Brodie, Esq. Communicated by Sir Benjamin Collins Brodie,
Bart., F.R.S.
    The wax which is the subject of this investigation, is a substance
imported into this country from China. It has the general appear
ance of spermaceti, but is harder than that body. The author gives
reasons for believing that this wax, like bees’-wax, is a secretion from
an insect.
                                                                  A

                                     Q UlCu
    The wax may be decomposed by fusion with hydrate of potash, by
which process two substances are procured; namely, n wax acid,
which, combined with the potash, forms a soap; and another body
which is dissolved in the soap solution. By precipitation with chlo
ride of barium and washing out the dried baryta salt with ether, or
other suitable solvents, the two substances may be separated.
    The substance dissolved in the ether has the appearance of a wax.
By crystallization its melting-point may be ruised to 79° C-., at which
point it is <U+FB01>xed. The body, when analysed, gave numbers agreeing
with the formula CM H,' O,. the formula, namely. of the alcohol of
cerotic acid, the acid which in n previous paper the author has shown
to exist in a free condition in bees'-wax, and the constitution of
which he there determined.        To this alcohol the author gives the
name of cerotine.     By oxidation, by means of lime and potash, the
alcohol is capable of being converted into cerotic acid. C“ H“ O4.
The analyses of the acid and of its silver salt are given. The for
mula of the alcohol is further con<U+FB01>rmed by the analysis of its com
bination with sulphuric acid ; and the process to be employed to pro
cure this substance is detailed. lts formula is S0,, C,, H“ O + HO ;
the sulphate of the oxide of cerotyle, using the usual chemical
language to express the nature of the combination.        By the action
of chlorine on the alcohol, the alcohol-type is destroyed, and a body
is formed, analogous to chloral, containing two equivalents of hy
drogen less than the alcohol itself.    The analyses lead to the formula
C“           0,.   The substance has the appearance of   a resin.
          l
    By decomposing the above-mentioned baryta salt, after the cerotine
has been entirely removed by washing with suitable solvents, the
same cerotic acid may be obtained as that        into which the alcohol
itself is converted by oxidation.    The analysis of the acid and of its
silver salt is given.
    This Chinese wax cannot be distilled without decomposition. By
its distillation two substances are procured; cerotic acid, C“ H.,, O,,
and hydrocarbon.      The hydrocarbon consists principally of a solid
matter, one of those substances which, inthe opinion of the author,
have been indiscriminately classed together under the general name
of para<U+FB02>ine. This substance, to which he gives the name of cerotine,
contains equal equivalents of hydrogen and carbon, and has the for
mula C“ H“. This formula is determined with precision by the ac
tion of chlorine on the substance, which gives rise to a series of
products of substitution, of which several were analysed, namely the
substances
                    °" ion;     °"{01..'

                                                 {Ola
   The density of the vapour of cerotine cannot be taken, as, by di
stillation, it is decomposed. The experiment was made of distilling
and redistilling the substance in a sealed tube, in which cases it
passes entirely into <U+FB02>uid and gaseous hydrocarbon.

                                                 756
  The analysis of the Chinese wax itself corresponds with the for
mula Cm Hm, O4, which admits of a simple explanation of the nature
of its decompositions: its decomposition by potash being explained
by the equation
           Cm    H108   O4   "|-   KO H0: (C54              H53   03+ KO)      'l" C54 Has O2.
and its decomposition by heat by the equation
                         G108 H105     O4    =    C54 H54     04   +   C54 H54,
the substance itself belonging to the class of compound ethers.
   The author announces his intention of following up this paper by
a third on the constitution of myricine.

    “ On  a new case of the Interference of Light."          By the Rev.
Baden Powell, M.A., F.R.S. &c., Savilian Professor of Geometry in
the University of Oxford.
   The principal experiment exhibiting the newly-observed case of
interference described by the author,      the following: into
                                                             is    hollow                  a
prism or trough containing oil of sassafras, anise, cassia, &c.,    plate                    a
of glass   isdipped so as to intercept the light passing through the
upper or thicker half of the prism, and leave the lower half clear:
the spectrum of a line of light or narrow slit,        then immediately     is
seen to be covered with dark bands parallel to the slit or edge of the
P nsm.
    Some substances, as oil of turpentine, water, &c., give no bands
with this arrangement, but will give them,             a complementary     if
arrangement     be adopted, viz. by placing      narrow  slip of glass at
                                                                    a
the bottom of the prism, or so as to intercept         the  light passing
through the thinner half.
    The production of the bands in general, and the reason of the dif
ference existing in the cases referred to, are fully accounted for on the
theory of waves and interference: whence the following formula                                   is
deduced, giving the number of bands (n), when /4, and /4,, the in
 dices for any ray for the plate and for the medium, are known, of
which  A    the wave length; and taking these quantities for any two

The numbers thus calculated agree with observation for many
media. The distinction of the two cases alluded to depends on
whether    result positive or negative that is, on the relative values

   If doubly retracting media are used as plates, two sets of bands
are seen superimposed, which are easily shown to be due to the or
dinnry and extraordinary rays respectively. -But for some of those
crystals the data are as yet inlu<U+FB02>icient to give more than s general
accordance with theory.
   The method might be applied practically for determining the in
dices of many substances to which the ordinary method is inapplica
ble from the impossibility of forming them into prisms: n will also
exhibit palpably the most insensible degree of double refraction, and
may thus become useful to the mineralogist.
   There is a close analogy between these phenomena and those
observed by Baron von Wrede, and by Sir D. Brewster and l\lr.
Fox Talbot, of which Mr. Airy has given s theory.             A similar
theory is necessary for explaining some of the more minute details
of the present phenomena: and on this subject some extensive re
searches have been pursued by Mr. Stokes of Pembroke College,
Cambridge, which will soon appear.

   The suthor has devoted nearly four years to the investigation of
the quantities of rain fslling in the lake districts of Cumberland and
Westmoreland: and he commenced, two years ago, a set of experi
ments specially directed to ascertain the amount of rain deposited at
great elevations above the sea. such as the summits of our highest
English mountains. As the investigation proceeded, some remarka
ble results were obtained, which coming to the knowledge of the
Royal Society early in Inst year (1847), the Council contributed a
sum of money from the Donation Fund towards the current expenses
attending this inquiry, of which the results are given in the present
communication, comprising extensive tables of observations relative
to the quantity of rain in different situations within the above period
of time.

 The  MARQUIS      or   NORTHAMPTON,           President, in the chm.
   " On the structure of the Jaws and Teeth of the lguanodon."
By Gideon Algernon Mantell, Esq., LL.D., F.R.S., Vice-President
of the Geological  Society, &c.
   The recent discovery of the right dentary bone of the lower jaw
of an adult lguanodon with teeth, having enabled the author, with
the aid afforded by other specimens, to determine the structure of the
maxillary organs of that gigantic herbivorous reptile, the result of
his investigations are embodied in the present communication.
   The <U+FB01>rst memoir of the author on the teeth of the lguanodon was
published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1825; but owing

                                       758
  to the fragmentary and water-worn condition in which the fossil re
   mains of terrestrial vertebrated animals occur in <U+FB02>uviatile deposits,
   in consequence of these strata consisting of materials transported from
   far-distant lands, nearly a quarter of a century elapsed before any
   portion of the jaw with teeth was discovered.
      The most important of the fossils described in this memoir con
   sists of the anterior part of the right side of the lower jaw, which was
   discovered a few weeks since, in a quarry in Tilgate Forest, by Capt.
   Lambart Brickenden, F.G.S., who with great liberality placed it at
   the disposal of the author as the original investigator of the fossils
   of the Wealden.
      This dentary bone, which is eighteen inches long, is perfect in the
   anterior part, but is broken at the hinder extremity, and retains <U+FB01>ve
   or six inches of the coronoid bone : the length of the jaw to which it
   belonged is estimated at four feet. It contains two successional teeth
  in place, the fang of a third, and the alveoli or sockets for eighteen
   or nineteen mature molars; the entire number of teeth on each side
  the lower jaw was about twenty.
      The mature teeth, which, when abraded by use in mastication,
  resemble the worn molars of herbivorous inammalia, appear to have
  been arranged in a close-set series. The lower teeth had their ena
  melled striated face parallel with the alveolar plate, and fronting the
  inside of the mouth; but the upper were placed in a reverse position,
  that is, with the enamelled facet of the crown external; and the
  teeth in the upper and lower jaws were arranged subalternate or in
  termediate in relation to each other, as is the case in the ruminants.
      But a still more remarkable character presented by this specimen
 is the peculiar construction of the anterior part of the lower jaw,
 which forms the symphysis. This process, instead of being con
 tinued round the front of the mouth and beset with teeth, as in all
 other saurians, is edentulous, and extends into a procumbent scoop
 like expansion, very analogous to the symphysial portion of the
 lower jaw in the Sloths, and especially to that of the colossal extinct
 Edentata--the Mylodons. Along the external surface of this dentary
 hone there is a row of very large vascular foramina; and the sym
 physis also is perforated with numerous openings for the passage of
 blood-vessels and nerves sent o<U+FB02>’ from the great dental canal. The
 unusual number and magnitude of these foramina indicate a great
 development of the integuments and soft parts with which the bone
 was inevsted, and also the large size of the under lip.
     The upper jaw, of which a considerable portion discovered by the
author is in the British Museum, con<U+FB01>rms the inferences deduced
from the teeth and dentary bone of the lower maxilla.
    The author, with the able assistance of Dr.A. G. Melville, instituted
a comparison between all the teeth of the Iguanodon to which he could
obtain access, and those of recent saurians; and the result of the
investigation is detailed.     The new light shed on the structure and
functions of the dental organs, con<U+FB01>rms, in every essential particular,
the inferences deduced by the author from the detached teeth alone,
m l11s memoir of. 1825; and it also reveals an extraordinary devia

                                    759
  tion from all known types of reptilian organization, and which could
  not have been predicated; namely, that this colossal reptile, which
  equalled in bulk the gigantic Edentata of South America, and like
  them was destined to obtain support from comminuted vegetable sub
  stances, was also furnished with a large prehensile tongue and <U+FB02>eshy
 lips, to serve as instruments for seizing and cropping the foliage and
 branches of trees; while the arrangement of the teeth as in the ru
  minants, and their internal structure, which resembles that of the
 molars of the Sloth tribe in the vascularity of the dentine, indicate
 adaptations for the same purpose.
     Among the physiological phienomena revealed by Palaeonto
 logy, there is not a more remarkable one than this modi<U+FB01>cation
 of the type of organization peculiar to the class of reptiles, to meet
 the conditions required by the economy of a lizard placed under
 similar physical relations, and destined to effect the same general
 purpose in the scheme of nature, as the colossal Edentata of former
 ages, and the large herbivorous maminalia of our own times.
     From the facts detailed, the author is led to consider the specimen
 described in his memoir of 1841, as being probably the lower jaw of a
 young lguanodon (but the true nature of which, from the absence of
 the crowns of the teeth, was doubtful) belonging to the same family,
 but referable to a distinct genus or subgenus; and he proposes the
 name of Regnosaurus Norllurmptoni for that remarkable fossil saurian.
 The communication was illustrated by several drawings of the speci
 mens described.
     “ An Account of    some Observations made on the Depth of Rain
 which falls in the same Localities at different altitudes in the hilly
 districts of Lancashire, Cheshire and Derbyshire." By S. C. Homer
 sham, C.E. Communicated by George Newport, Esq., F.R.S. &c.
    The author states, that having been present at a meeting of the
 Royal Society when a paper was read on the Meteorology of the
 Lake districts of Westmoreland and Cumberland, by J. Miller, Esq.
of Kendal, in which it was stated that the'quantity of rain falling in
mountainous districts appears to increase from the valley upwards, to
the altitude of about 2000 feet, and then rapidly to decrease, he
wishes to lay before the Royal Society the results of his own obser
vations, which lead him to a different conclusion.    After stating that
he had been at some trouble to analyse Mr. Miller's observations
which have been communicated to him by that gentleman, he is of
opinion that they do not warrant the conclusion deduced from them,
and are also at variance with the recorded observations of Daines
Barrington, Dr.Dalton, Professor Daniell and others, as well as those
of Capt. Lefroy and Col. Sabine.
    The author then shows from observations very carefully made in
Lancashire, Cheshire and Derhyshire, from January 1846 to March
18-18, that more rain falls at the bottom than at the tops of hills of
a less elevation than 2000 feet in the same locality, and that the
quantity diminishes in a ratio almost precisely corresponding to the
height.    The details are given in tables of monthly observations,

                                   760
made near Whaley and Congleton in Cheshire, and Chapel-en-le
frith in Derbyshire, and also of other observations made for the Cor
poration of Liverpool at Rivington and in the valley of Roddlesworth
near Preston in Lancashire, which have been communicated to him.
The whole of these observations, carefully analysed and compared,
have led the author to a conclusion opposite to that arrived at by
Mr. Miller.
    The author then proceeds to show that the details of Mr. Millei-’s
own observations are in accordance with his, and that they fully bear
out his views, and not those of that gentleman. Some apparent dis
crepancies in the results are pointed out and their cause explained
by reference to peculiarities in the localities in which the observa
tions were made, as shown by reference to a map accompanying this
paper, and to the details given by Mr. Miller; so that the observa
tions of this gentleman, when examined with reference to locality,
fully con<U+FB01>rm those of the author and of the authorities he has quoted,
and establish the proposition, that as a general law, the quantity of
rain deposited in the valleys and at the bottoms of hills is greater than
in more elevated situations in the same locality.
    “
      Microscopical examination of the contents of the Hepatic Ducts."
By Thomas Wharton Jones, Esq., F.R.S.
    On a microscopical examination of the matter contained in the
larger hepatic ducts, the author has observed what he considers the
debris of broken-up hepatic cells, in the form of free nuclei, a granu
lous substance, oil-globules and fragments of cell-walls; while in
the matter contained in the smaller branches of the duct, entire cells
of hepatic parenchyma may, in addition, be seen.        These facts the
author adduces as proofs that the cells of hepatic parenchyma are
analogous to the endogenous cells, or true secretory corpuscles of
the pancreas and other glands; and he infers that as the endogenous
cells of other glands are constantly being reproduced, successively
cast off, received into the radicles of the ducts (into which the con
taining vesicles or tubules of the former open), broken up and re
solved into the secreted matter, so the cells of hepatic parenchyma
are received into the radicles of the hepatic duct as they are succes
sively cast off, and are there broken up and resolved into bile. This
conclusion, namely, that the hepatic cells are analogous to the en
dogenous cells of other glands, as was <U+FB01>rst suggested by Professor
Henle of Heidelberg, and not to glandular vesicles as has been as
sumed by some, the author considers as throwing light on the
anatomical relation of the hepatic cells to the radicles of the hepatic
ducts.

Benjamin C. Brodie, Bart., F.R.S.
    This paper is an abridgement of a former one, bearing the same
title, by the same author, which was read to the Society on the 17th

                                    761

    " Attempt   to apply instrumental     measurement   to the Zodiacal
Light."     By Prof. C. Piszzi Smyth.
    After describing the manner in which the zodiacal light was <U+FB01>rst
strongly represented to him in South Africa in 1843, and which
seemed to imply that some of the received opinions with regard to
it were erroneous, the author describes       an equatorial  instrument
which   he contrived for the purpose of measuring the right ascension
and declination of the apex of the light; some instrumental method
of determining     these data, and thcncc the principal phenomena of
the appearances, being evidently desirable on account of the immense
extent to which the judgement may be biasscd by prejudice or casual
circumstances. when the mere senses are trusted to for determining
the extent, situation and character of so faint and vague a body.
    The most favourable astronomical, atmospheric and personal con
ditions requisite to obtain undeniable observations of the zodiacal
light are pointed out; and aided partly by strict attention to these,
and partly by the clear atmosphere of the high mountains on which
he was then residing, the author found the phenomenon to be of a
far more stable and determinate character than has generally been
represented; and his observations, made by the above instrument in
the years 1844—45, of which a list is given, seem to be affected with
a probable error not greater than 2°.
    Since his return from the Cape, the author's geographical position
has wholly prevented him from continuing his observations : he there
fore now publishes his experiences to induce others in more favour
able situations to follow up the subject; which by comparing his
results with those of other observers in the northern hemisphere,
he shows has many ofits principal features in a state of ambiguity,
that ought not in the present day to be allowed to exist any longer;
 and further, to enable others to take up the subject as nearly as pos
 sible as he left it off, the author adds to his paper a series of views
 of the different appearances of the zodiacal light at various seasons
 of the year, and explains the peculiar projections employed to give a
 true as well as a pictorial representation of the sky.

                   -                                                I
                                      762
        GENTLEMEN,
    I have generally commenced my annual addresses to you, by re
turning my thanks to my colleagues in the Council for the assistance
 that I have received from them in performing my presidential duties.
 On the present occasion I must extend my acknowledgement, and
express, in the warmest manner that         Iam able, my grateful sense
of the unvarying kindness that I have experienced at the hands of
the Society at large.
    Holding our General Meeting, as we now do for the <U+FB01>rst time in
June, six months only having elapsed since the election of the last
Council, there are many topics of former addresses which will form
no part of that which I now deliver.         The time for the award of
our Medals has not yet arrived. It would also be premature to give
an obituary, before the of<U+FB01>cial announcement, of the names of those
 Fellows whom we have lost, which announcement will take place as
 usual on St. Andrew's day.      I presume, however, that henceforth
the obituary will be read in June, with reference to the deaths de
clared in the preceding November.         This will in some respects be
more convenient, and will give additional time for its due prepara
tion.
    I regret extremely, that I have it not in my power to announce to
you that any intelligence has arrived respecting the Northern Ex
pedition of Sir John Franklin.        It is hardly necessary for me to
mention, that both by land and sea the Government has taken steps
to obtain intelligence of, and also to give assistance to our gallant ex
plorers.   I   am sure you will all join me in the fervent wish that
Heaven may prosper these endeavours.
    I have toinform you, that the Council of the University of London
have been so kind as to grant us the temporary loan, if we should
have occasion to wish for   it, of three rooms adjoining to ours and to
those   of the  Society of Antiquaries.    This concession may be very
convenient to the Royal Society.       One of these rooms    islent to the
Society of Antiquaries, for their   use, on Thursday evenings:      Ineed
hardly say, therefore, that at those times, we could not make use of
them, and that it    would have been the farthest thing from the wish of
us all to interfere with the accommodation of    a  Society, with which
we have always been, and      I    trust always  shall  be, on the most
friendly terms      indeed, so many of our Fellows   form  also    portion
                                                                  a a
               :
of the Society of Antiquaries, that there must always be mutual
bond between us.        On your part then, Gentlemen, I   beg to express
our thanks to the Chancellor and Council of the University of
London.
   Today, Gentlemen, come into operation for the <U+FB01>rst time our new
regulations on the subject of election.  have never concealed my
                                            I
own doubts on the main feature of these regulations.    believe that
                                                        I
many Fellows of the Society participate in these doubts, but            it
would be to me     amatter of the deepest regret if  they do not receive
a fair trial. Still more should   I deplore the result, if the supposed
errors of these regulations were to be              on the unoffending
                                           'visited

                                    763
Candidates. In saying this I hope it will be understood that I-do not
wish in the least to interfere with the free exercise of the rights
of the Fellows.      The Council would have no right to complain, be
cause every Candidate selected by them was not elected, and still
less because some were to be elected whom they had not named;
for I need scarcely repeat, that the Fellows may eh-ct all the Can
didates before them, or none of them. The latter alternative would
however convey an expression of opinion against both the claims of
the Candidates and the justice of the Council's selection neither
complimentary nor just. I therefore really think that the Council
would be hardly treated, if at least the greater part of the selected
Candidates were not elected.
    It is rather a singular circumstance, that, since our selection was
 made, one of the gentlemen whom we had chosen, Mr. Syme,
should have withdrawn his name. The stringency of our rules has
afforded the Council no means of supplying his place.          The possi
bility of occurrence of such a case had not arisen in the minds of the
 former Council, when the new rules were framed, but it may perhaps
be considered next year whether it ought to be provided against, or
 whether it is likely to occur so seldom as not to require any special
 provision.
    Many of you are probably       cognizant of the Winteringham be
 quest, by which an annual sum of money was left to be invested in
 the purchase of a silver cup as a prize for a scienti<U+FB01>c essay.   To the
 good intention of the testator l am bound to express our obligation.
 The conditions of the bequest are however so complicated and
 troublesome, that it appears hardly possible to comply with them;
 and it is besides extremely problematical whether the prize would
 really obtain essays worthy of it.    In that case it is obvious that no
 bene<U+FB01>t would be conferred on science, while the Royal Society
 would <U+FB01>nd itself placed in what has been called a false position.
 I have therefore thought it best, in agreement with the opinion of
 your Council, and of other Fellows whom I have also consulted, to
 do nothing in the matter in this the last year of my presiding over
 you, leaving the question to be fully and maturely decided by my suc
 cessor and the Council, with whom he will have to deliberate.
    With politics, in their ordinary sense, we as a Scienti<U+FB01>c So
 ciety have nothing to do, except as far as public events may
 tend to favour or discourage those studies, for the promotion of
 which the Royal Society was established. I cannot but fear, Gen
 tlemen, that the promotion of scienti<U+FB01>c progress will be retarded
 by the disorder that at present exists on the Continent, and
 by the degree in which men's minds are engaged in state affairs.
 It is creditable, I think, to foreign governments under such cir
 cumstances, that the combined prosecution of magnetieal inquiries
 is still continued.    This combined inquiry is however soon coming
 to an end, but I hope that the ingenious self-registering instrument
 invented by our colleague Mr. Brooke, and now most successfully
 employed in the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, may <U+FB01>nd its way
 into other national establishments, and by that means enable other

                                      764
 countries to continue inquiries without any serious expense.          It
 must be within your cognizance, Gentlemen, that many schemes for
alterations in our Society have been.of late suggested, or, to speak
more correctly, have been hinted at, for nothing distinct or de<U+FB01>nite
has been proposed, as far as      I  know.    Those who advocate such
plans   should  always  remember   that the  Royal Society is not placed,
like the Institute in France, under the protection of the government,
nor supported at the public expense. Whether that be a gain or
not is not a question for our consideration, but for my own part       I
should be sorry to exchange our independence for any other advan
tage. As however we have to support ourselves, any such extreme
restriction of our numbers as should make us a very select body
would deprive us of the power of publishing those Transactions,
 which constitute the main part of our scienti<U+FB01>c usefulness. Our
body consists not only of men of science, but also to a certain extent
 of literary men, eminent artists and gentlemen of rank and station.
I  believe that this widening of the basis of our Society is most use
 ful to it,and besides serves the important purpose of enlisting in the
 cause of science those who may patronize and defend, though they
 do not follow her.
    There are some persons who seem to think that      it  would be ad
 visable for us, not only to be a common link and bond for the other
 Societies of London, but also actually to unite with them, and thus
 to form one monster Society.      This    certainly an imposing scheme,
                                            is
 but very much doubt its practicability, and still more its advantage
    I
 to the cause of science itself.  I     doubt whether any one Society
 could follow out all the rami<U+FB01>cations of individual branches of
 knowledge asithey are now followed out by the Linnesan, Astrono
 mical and Geological Societies.      Itmay however be worth consider
 ing whether we might not lend our rooms .for the service of some of
 those Societies that have not convenient places of meeting.         This
 we have already done, in some instances, to the Commission on
 Weights and Measures.        Of course, however, nothing of this kind
 should be done without mature consideration.
     There cannot be    a  doubt, Gentlemen, that the establishment of
 separate  Societies   must  have deprived the Philosophical Transac
 tions of many papers of great interest; and this has probably led to
 the notion that our Society is   less <U+FB02>ourishing than
                                                     it   was.  As, how-~
 ever,
    I     believe that the whole number of scienti<U+FB01>c papers published
 in England       increased, and as the object of the Royal Society is,
                   is
 not our own glory, but the improvement of natural knowledge, and
 the scienti<U+FB01>c honour of the country, we ought not to regret that
  valuable communications adorn other Transactions than. our own.
 We ought also the less to regret this circumstance, as most of the
  principal supporters of other Societies are members of our body also.
  At the same time we may sometimes feel sorry that particular com
  munications are not made to us, and we may perhaps think that some
  of our Fellows are not quite so mindful of us as they should be.
     After <U+FB01>lling the honourable of<U+FB01>ce of your President for ten years,
                                                                     I
  think it     now right to surrender
              is                            to some one who has higher
                                            it

                                     765
quali<U+FB01>cations for it than     I can pretend to possess. I have long
entertained the opinion that it was not d\'slrnblc that an individual
should hold it for life, as has been the case with some of my prede
cessors, though I do not quite agree with those who think that its
tenure should be limited to n wry short period.        You are probably
aware that it is the intention of your Council to reC0l|lnnicnd as my
successor a nobleman who has displayed for n long series of years the
greatest zeal for the progress of Astronomy.       You |nust all be aware,
Gentlemen, of the wonderful telescope made by Lord ltosse, the great
ingenuity displayed in its construction, and the labour and expense
that it must have cost its constructor.     These are strong claims on
the Royal Society, and strong guarantees for his future zeal in your
service, and in that of science in general.      I do not haitate to add,
and the more so as some seem inclined to demur to my opinion, that
it is clear to my own mind that his rank and station are additional
reasons in his favour.     I am not, indeed, one of those who hold that
any rank or position, however exalted, can confer honour on science :
on the contrary, I shall always maintain that science confers honour
on them: it     is,however, not less clear that the possession of wealth,
of rank, and of station, gives to their possessors the power of aiding
science in various ways; and this     is the real point to be considered.
On the question, however, of my successor, which         is  one for your
decision,  I  feel that   would be indelicate and improper for me to
                           it
say more.
    In retiring from the o<U+FB02>ice of your President, whatever may have
been my other de<U+FB01>ciencies,       Itrust no one can justly reproach me
with want of zeal for your interests and your honour.         To my col
leagues in the different Councils, who have been elected by the gene
ral body, Imust attribute whatever prosperity may have attended the
Society during the last ten yeam. In looking back to that period, there
are three circumstances that give me unmixed pleasure.            The <U+FB01>rst
of these the very important series of papers on Electro-Magnetism,
           is
for which we are indebted to a philosopher, of whose presence among
us we have especial reason to be proud:    I    need hardly name to you
 Professor Faraday. The second point to which     I    refer   the prompt
                                                              is
 attention that was paid        by
                               the British Government to the joint re
 commendation of the Royal Society and the British Association to
 send an expedition for scienti<U+FB01>c purposes to the southern regions
 of the globe. The glory which has attended the successful exer
 tions of Sir James Ross and his brave comrades     is  re<U+FB02>ected not only
 on his country, but also on the Societies that recommended, and the
 Government that sent out the expedition.
     The third subject that claims my attention, and to which      I  have
 already alluded,     isthe great conjoint inquiry on Terrestrial Mag
 netism, still going on, and owing its origin to the united recommen
 dations of the British Association and the Royal Society.
     It
      is  true that this object had been brought before the notice of
 the Royal Society some years before by one of the most illustrious
 of modern travellers and philosophers, the author of Cosmos,’ M.
                                                          '
 Humboldt; but the immediate origin of the undertaking was the

                                    766
recommendations of the two English societies, acting on foreign Go
vernments through our own. To the Foreign Secretary of the Royal
Society, in conjunction with Dr. Lloyd of Dublin, was con<U+FB01>ded the
important task of drawing up the regulations under which the in
quiries of associated nations, instead of associated individuals, were
to be carried on.
    In the case, too, of the South Polar Expedition, the Royal Society
was applied to by the Government for scienti<U+FB01>c recommendations ;
and your Council, in conjunction with your different scienti<U+FB01>c Com
mittees, drew up a Report of the highest value, not only to the par
ticular voyage for which it was specially prepared, but also for all
other similar undertakings, and even for every scienti<U+FB01>c traveller in
little-known regions of the globe.
    It would be invidious, Gentlemen, to allude to individual papers
that have been published in your Transactions during the term of
my Presidency.      I should not, indeed, be capable of doing justice to
all, even if time permitted, which it certainly does not. I may per
haps, however, allude to one philosophical invention described in
them, as being most important to the great inquiry on Terrestrial
Magnetism—I mean Mr. Brooke's Photographic Self-Registering In
strument, which I have already mentioned.         On the same head, I
may take the opportunity to return the thanks of the Society to
Colonel Sabine for the labour he has bestowed on the Magnetical
Observations made at Toronto and elsewhere.
    You will all rejoice, Gentlemen, I am sure, to see the zeal that is
shown without as well as within the Royal Society in the cause of
science; to see the continued prosperity of the British Association;
to see our new as well as our old Societies <U+FB02>ourishing; to hear of
fresh discoveries in Astronomy; to see the great collections of Na
tural History in the British Museum and the College of Surgeons
augmented every year; to <U+FB01>nd our knowledge of the wonderful
animals now extinct,—of the Dinornis, Iguanodon, and other mon
sters of antiquity,—increased    by the labours of an Owen, a Mantell,
and   others;  to see a magni<U+FB01>cent pile rising to contain specimens of
the economic geology of Great Britain and Ireland, and of the
<U+FB01>nished products of Art that owe their existence to it.
    These, Gentlemen, are all reasons why we should rejoice, and
also to see the increased degree in which the importance of science
is acknowledged for ship-building, for agriculture, and for the pre
servation of human life and health in our great cities, in the great
hives of human industry.      But they are not only reasons for rejoi
cing, they are reasons why we should return our hearty thanks to
Almighty Providence for thus blessing our land. Lastly, we should
remember that where so much has been given much will be re
quired, and that it is our duty to extend these blessings as far as we
can for the happiness and comfort of our fellow-men.
    On the motion of Sir R. H.rInglis, Bart., the thanks of the So
ciety were voted to his Lordship for his Address, with a request that
he would allow it to be printed.

   " On the Chemical Nature of Wax."—Part Ill. " On Myricine."
By B. C. Brodie, Esq.          Communicated by Sir B. C. Brodie,          Bart.,
F.R.S.
   This paper     is the last of three papers on the chemical nature of
wax,    and  contains     the investigation of that portion of bees-wax
which    is soluble    only with di<U+FB02>iculty in boiling alcohol.      This body
could   never  be   rightly investigated   before  the  discovery  of the true
nature   of the  other constituent of the     wax, namely,    the cerotic  acid,
for the absence of which no test was        known,   and  the  products  of the
decomposition of which would materially interfere with any experi
ments on the nature of the myricine. \Vhen the cerotic'acid has been
absolutely removed by repeated boiling of the wax with alcohol, a sub
stance remains, which is saponi<U+FB01>able, but with di<U+FB02>iculty. From the
products of saponi<U+FB01>cation the author isolated palmitic acid, Cm Hm O4,
and a new wax-alcohol, analogous to, but yet different from cerotine,
described in a former paper. This alcohol, melissine, has the formula

                                    76$'
Cw   HMO, By oxidation of this substance by means of lime and
potash, the acid C6,, H6', O , melissic acid, was obtained; and by the
action of chlorine, a body analogous to chloral, a substance, that is,
of the aldehyde series, but with a substitution of between fourteen
and <U+FB01>fteen equivalents of chlorine for hydrogen.       In its conversion
into this substance the alcohol loses two equivalents of hydrogen,
without substitution.      The author also investigated the products of
the distillation of myricine.    From these he procured likewise pal
mitic acid and a solid hydrocarbon, which, recti<U+FB01>ed over potassium,
had a melting-point of 62°, and contained, as shown by analysis,
carbon and hydrogen in equal equivalents. The analogy of the mode
of formation of this substance to cerotiue from Chinese wax shows
that it is the hydrocarbon, melene, Cm H60. By repeated crystalliza
tion from ether a substance was obtained from the impure myricine,
of a crystalline character, melting at 72°; the analysis of which
agrees with the formula C92 H9, O4, which explains the reactions of
the substance.
    The general conclusion from this investigation is, that waxes are a
class of bodies which, chemically speaking, stand in the same rela
tion to fat as fatty bodies do to the alcohol and acetic acid of'vinous
fermentation; all which bodies are members of one chemical series,
possess an analogous chemical character, and are susceptible of
analogous transformations.                           -

    "An   account of Astronomical     Observations proposed to be made
 in South America." By S. M. Gilliss, in an extract of a letter to
 Lieut.-Col. Sabine, R.A., For. Sec. R.S. Communicated by Lieut.
 Col. Sabine.                                                             ‘
         DEAR Sm,                           Washington, October 25, 1848.
    During the month of April last I sent to you, through the Royal
 Society, a printed report from one of the naval committees in con
 gress, recommending a grant of funds for the purpose of sending
 an astronomical expedition to the most available point in South
 America, to make observations which should have for their object
 the improvement or veri<U+FB01>cation of the solar parallax.       The basis of
 this report was a correspondence between Dr. Gerliug of Marburg,
 other astronomers, and myself, that had been presented for con
 sideration by the Secretary of the Navy, and, in accordance with the
 views of the Philosophical Society and of the Academy of Arts and
 Sciences, had been laid before congress for their decision.
    Conformably with the recommendation of the committee, an ap
 propriation was made, and the Honourable Secretary of the Navy
 directed to employ it in making the observations requested by the
 two societies just named. The command of the party has been as
 signed to me, and a plan of operations submitted to the societies
 having received their sanction, has been approved by the Secretary.
 This is brie<U+FB02>y as follows :
    To embark the instruments and their assistants by the lst of June

                                    769
 next forValparaiso,for which place Ishall leave New York per steamer.
 vid Chagres and Panama, at the same time.         As the voyage by this
 route may be readily made in thirty-<U+FB01>ve days, I shall be able to se
 lect a suitable station and make all necessary arrangements prior to
 the arrival of the instniments; but it is very probable that Santiago
 or Talca will be chosen for our operations, and from the solicitude
 expressed by the residentChilianChargé d'Affaircs, the preponderance
 is on the side of Santiago.     Moreover. it is thought that if Santiago
'is chosen and we remain nearly four years, as contemplated, the Chi
 lian government will be induced to establish a pcrmancnt observatory
 there.
    The observations I propose to make are,—Wars on the meridian
 and extra-meridian, during the oppositions of 1849 and l852; and
 Venus under analogous conditions at the inferior conjunctions and
 stationary terms of 1850 and I852. These observations will be dif
 ferential, and (as the grant of congress implies) are the paramount
 objects of the expedition; but as they will occupy only a portion of
 our time. the following series have also been decided on :
     lst. \Vith a view to improvement in the constant of lunar parallax,
 Burckhardt's semidiameter, and the local longitude, the moon and
 culminating stars on the meridian; both limbs at opposition and
 near conjunction.
     2nd. The smaller planets on the meridian.
     3rd. A catalogue of stars to the 8th magnitude inclusive, within
  60° of the south pole.
     Three hours of every suitable night will be given to this work,
 and the arrangement is such that the whole 60° may be examined
 and three observations made of each star within the proposed term
 of residence.
     4th. Lunar occultations.     Longitudes resulting from culminalions
 as compared with occullations, have exhibited an extraordinary dif
 ference, to be accounted for perhaps by an error in the assumed
  semidiameter; this series of observations is considered necessary.
     5th. It has been thought that useful information to terrestrial re
 fractions will be obtained from observations in the two hemispheres
 on circum-zenith stars at each place of observation, and six stars
  have been selected which are near the zeniths of Talca and Wash
 ington to be observed on the meridian.
     6th. Comets when discovered in the course of other observations,
  and at their periodic returns.
     7th. Magnetical observations.      The term-days of such observa
  tories as continue to keep them has been set apart to obtain the three
  elements of the earth's magnetic condition, and on occasional term
  days the observations would be made uninterruptedly during twenty
  four hours with the declinometer.
     8th. Meteorological   observations at three stated hours (9 A-M.,
  3 P.u. and 9 rum) of each day; to embrace records of barometer;
 dry, wet, radiating and registering thermometers ; rain-gauge ; wind
 vane and clouds.      Hourly observation on equinoctial and solstitial
 term-days.

                                      7 70
    9th. Earthquakes,    the registrations of a seismometer.
    A meridian circle of    3 feet diameter, with a telescope of 52 lines
aperture,  has been  ordered   from Pistor and Martins; the Smithsonian
 Institution has just authorized me to obtain an equatorial of 6 (French)
inches aperture, with clockxmotion, which they will lend me; in ad
dition to which I have a 48 lines equatorial by Fraunhofer ; these,
with a clock and one or two portable instruments, comprise my astro
nomical equipment.        In magnetism I am most especially desirous of
your   advice.  Pray give me all possible information, and recommend
such instruments, times and methods of observation as our limited
grant from congress and the number of assistants will enable me to
obtain and use as designated.
   Such of the meteorological instruments as we do not possess will
be ordered in a few days; but for a proper seismometer I know not
where to go,.the only account seen being in one of the earlier volumes
of the British Association.        The instrument is to be obtained at
the expense of the Smithsonian Institution, and if you will do us
the favour to confer with some of the members of your Association
or of the Royal Society who have taken interest in the investigation
of earthquakes, you will especially oblige Professor Henry and myself.
The opportunity which my residence in Chili will offer to make ac
curate notes of these occurrences may perhaps be productive of use
ful results.   I do not doubt that the instrument will be ordered the
moment I hear from you.
   Whilst I have asked your views especially on magnetism, I shall
be grateful for counsel respecting any of the observations which are
contemplated, or for suggestions of new series which the locality
offers peculiar advantages for making.       I have planned this expedi
tion and embark in it with a desire to render the greatest possible
amount of useful data to science; and you may be assured of hearty
zeal in whatever yourself or any of the Fellows of the Royal Society
may propose.
                   Believe me, dear Sir, very respectfully,
                                           Your friend and servant,

the honour conferred on him for ten years, delivered the Medals
with the following words :—
      Mr. GALLOWAY,                            .
   I deliver this Royal Medal to you with great satisfaction, for your
communication on one of the most interesting and dif<U+FB01>cult problems
in Astronomy, the proper motion in space of our system; specula
tions which may almost seem too mighty and daring for the human
intellect.
   One who, like yourself, has entered on such a path of discovery,
is not likely to turn from it.      In further pursuing it, I feel assured
that your zeal for the prosperity of the Royal Society will induce
you to enrich our Transactions with other communications.           Should
my hopes prove well-founded, though my successor will, from his
own pursuits, be much better able than myself to appreciate your
           he will not be able to hail them with greater pleasure than
laboulrs,
 myse F.

                                     778
        Mr. Haaoanavs,
     Iam glad to deliver into your hands this Royal Medal for the
 mathematical paper with which you have enabled the Council to
 adorn the Philosophical Transactions.
     It is a paper, from its nature indeed, more suited for the attentive
 study of the closet, than for reading before an audience, however
 scienti<U+FB01>c, but it is not on that account less valuable.
     Mathematical analysis is doubly important: important in itself,
 and important as one of the great instruments of philosophical in
 vestigation.      Every extension of it mast then be at all times most
 highly welcome to a Society founded for the advancement of natural
 knowledge, and I, therefore, in its name, tender its thanks and an
 expression of the hope that it will not be the last communication that
 we shall receive at your hands.
        Mr. Anaus,
    It  is a great pleasure to me to      be the channel   by which   the
 Council of the Royal Society gives you this Copley Medal.
    In their award, I am sure that they have not done more than
justice to the scienti<U+FB01>c zeal, industry, and skill exerted by you in
 the search of the great and distant body that caused the perturba
 tions of the planet Uranus, a search crowned with success, both in
 your case and in that of your illustrious friend Le Vcrrier.
    If  he be an honour to his nation, not the less so are you to     En
 gland;    if he is a worthy follower of La Place, not less so are you of
 Newton.       His name and yours will remain imperishably umted in
 the annals of the glorious science which you both cultivate with so
 much zeal and so much success.
       Lieut.-Col. Sasms,
    I have to request of you, when transmitting to M. Regnault this
 Rumford Medal, to state to him the importance which the Royal
 Society attaches to his researches, determining with a degree of
accuracy hitherto unobtained, the laws which govern the connexion
between the temperature and elasticity of saturated steam, and the
quantity of heat absorbed by a given weight of water under different
densities and pressures.
    The laws which govern the expansion of atmospheric air, under
different pressures, and the expansion and densities of different gases
and mercury, and the measurement of temperatures by these means,
form in a series of memoirs altogether the most important investi
gations hitherto made on this subject.
    Had the philosophical and philanthropical           founder of this
Medal been now living, I am sure that he would have cordially
approved of the award of it to inquiries connected with the most
important power that Providence has, as yet, given to man for
lightening and assisting his industry, and for giving him speed for
crossing sea and land, compared with which, the fabled wings of

                                          774-
Daedalus would have been comparatively useless.  My only regret
on the present occasion that M. Regnault
                           is,               not here himself to
                                                            is
receive this Medal.
  The Statutes relating to the election of Council and Otlicera
having been read by the Secretary, and Dr. Royle and Mr. Bennett
having, with the consent of the Society, been nominated Scrutators
to assist the Secretaries in examining the lists, the votes of the
Fellows present were collected.
   Mr. Bennett reported the following Noblemen and Gentlemen                    as

     It   was moved by Sir Robert Harry            Inglis, Bart., seconded by
Mr. Broughton, and resolved unanimously             :
   That on this the last occasion of the Marquis of Northampton
occupying the Chair of the Royal Society as its President, the
special thanks of the Society be cordially tendered to his Lordship,
for his able, zealous, and ef<U+FB01>cient discharge of the duties of that
of<U+FB01>ce for ten years.
     On the motion of Dr. Paris, seconded by Professor Baden Powell,
it   was resolved unanimously    :
   That the best thanks of the Royal Society be, and they are hereby
given, to Dr. Roget for his continued and valuable services during
a period of twenty-one years,   the o<U+FB02>ice of Secretary to the Society.

           The  EARL OF ROSSE,         President, in the Chair.
    The Rev. James Challis, George Bishop, Esq., Captain Clerk,      R.A.
 were admitted into the Society.
    The Marquis of Northampton gave notice that His Grace the
Archbishop of Canterbury would be proposed at the next Meeting
for election and for immediate ballot, to which, as a Spiritual Peer of
the Realm, His Grace is entitled.
    Dr. Faraday then delivered the Bakerian Lecture, illustrative of his
                  “
paper, entitled     Experimental Researches in Electricity. Twenty
 second Series. § 28. On the Crystalline Polarity of Bismuth and
 other bodies, and on its relation to the magnetic form of force."
    In this paper the author states that in preparing small cylinders of
bismuth by casting them in glass tubes, he had often been embarrassed
by the anomalous magnetic results which they gave, and that having
 determined to investigate the matter closely, it ended in a reference of
the effects to the crystalline condition of the bismuth, which may be
thus brie<U+FB02>y stated.     If bismuth be crystallized in the ordinary way,
and then a crystal, or a group of symmetric crystals, be selected and
 suspended in the magnetic <U+FB01>eld between horizontal poles, it im
mediately either points in a given direction, or vibrates about a given
position, as a small magnetic needle would do, and if disturbed from
this position it returns to it.    On re-suspending the crystal so that
the horizontal line which is rtransverse to the magnetic axis shall be
come the vertical line, the crystal then points with its maximum
degree of force. If it be again re-suspended so that the line parallel
 to the magnetic axis be rendered vertical, the crystal loses all direc
tive force.    This line of direction, therefore, which tends to place
itself parallel to the magnetic axis, the author calls the Magne
crystallic awis of the crystal. It is perpendicular, or nearly so, to the
brightest and most perfect of the four cleavage planes of the crystal.
It is the same for all crystals of bismuth. Whether this magne
crystallic axis is parallel or transverse to the magnetic axis, the bis
muth is in both cases repelled from a single, or the stronger of two
poles; its diamagnetic relations being in no way afffected.        If the
crystal be broken up, or if it be fusediand resolidi<U+FB01>ed, and the metal
then subjected to the action of the magnet, the diamagnetic pheno
mena remain, but the magnecrystallic results disappear, because of
the confused and opposing crystalline condition of the various parts.
If an ingot of bismuth be broken up and fragmentary plates selected
which are crystallized uniformly throughout, these also point; the
magnecrystallic axis being, as before, perpendicular to the chief
plane of cleavage, and the external form, in this respect, of no con
sequence.
   The effect takes place when the crystal is surrounded by masses of
bismuth, or when it is immersed in water, or in a solution of
sulphate of iron, and with as much force, apparently, as if nothing
intervened.

                                      781
    The position of the crystal in the magnetic <U+FB01>eld is affected by the
approximation of extra magnets. or of so<U+FB01> iron; but the author does
not believe that this results from any attractive or repulsive force
exerted on the bismuth, but only from the disturbance of the lines of
force or rcsultants of magnetic action, by which they acquire as it
were new directions ; and, as the law of action which he gives, is, that
the line or aria of magnecrystallic force tends to place itself parallel,
or as a tangent, to the magnetic can-e or line of magnetic force, passing
through the place when the crystal is situated, so the crystal changes
its position with any change of direction in these lines.
    A common horse-shoe magnet exhibits these phenomena very well :
the author worked much with one lifting 30lbs. by the keeper; but
one that can raise a pound or two only, is su<U+FB02>icient for many of
the actions.      When using the electro-magnet, the advantage of
employing poles with large plane opposed faces is mentioned as
being considerable, for then diamagnetic phenomena are almost
or entirely avoided and the peculiar magnecrystallie relations then
a        .
  PTEI: peculiar force exerted in these phenomena is not either at
 tractive or repulsive, but has for its distinctive character the ten
 dency to place the crystal in a de<U+FB01>nite position or direction.       ’l'he
 author further distinguishes it from that described by M. Pliicker in
 his interesting memoir upon the repulsion of the optic axes of cry
 stals by the poles of u magnet0, in that, that is an equatorial force,
 whereas this is an axial force.
    Crystals of antimony were then submitted to a similar magnetic
 examination, and with the same results.       But there were also certain
 other effects produced of an-est and revulsion, the same in kind as
                                             '                             ’
 those described in a former series of the Experimental Researches
 (par. 2309, &c.); these are wrought out and eliminated, and the rc
 sults described.           _
    Arsenic also proved to be a body capable of pointing in the mag
 netic <U+FB01>eld, like bismuth and antimony.
    The paper describing the foregoing results is dated 23rd of Sep
 tember, l848.      in a later paper of the date of 20th October, 1848,
 the author continues his researches.      Native crystals of iridium and
 osmium, and also crystallized titanium and tellurium, appeared to be
 magnecrystallic:     crystals of zinc, copper, tin, lead, gold, gave no
 signs of this condition. Crystals of sulphate of iron are very strongly
 affected by the magnet according to this new condition, and the
 magnecrystallic axis is perpendicular to two of the planes of the
 rhomboidal prism; so that when a long crystal is employed, it will
 not, as a mass, point between the poles, but across the line joining
 them.     On the other hand, the sulphate of nickel has its magne
 crystallic axis parallel, or nearly so, to the length of the ordinary
 prism.    Hence bodies, both magnetic and diainagnetic, are, by their
 crystalline condition, subject to the magnetic force, according to the
 law already laid down. Diamond, rock-salt, <U+FB02>uor spar, boracite, red

oxide of copper, oxide of tin, cinnabar, galena, and many other
bodies, presented no evidence of the magnecrystallic condition.
   The author then enters upon a consideration of the nature of the
magnecrystallic force.     In the <U+FB01>rst place he examines closely whe
ther a crystal of bismuth has exactly the same amount of repulsion,
diamagnetic or other, when presenting its magnecrystallic axis pa
rallel or transverse to the lines of magnetic force acting on it. For this
purpose the crystal was suspended either from a torsion balance, or
as a pendulum thirty feet in length; but whatever the position of
the magnecrystallic axis, the amount of repulsion was the same.
   In other experiments a vertical axis was constructed of cocoon
silk, and the body to be examined was attached at right angles to it
as radius ; a prismatic crystal of sulphate of iron, for instance, whose
length was four times its breadth, was <U+FB01>xed on the axis with its
length as radius and its magnecrystallic axis horizontal, and there
fore as tangent; then, when this crystal was at rest under the torsion
force of the silken axis, an electro-magnetic pole was so placed,
that the axial line of magnetic force should be, when exerted, ob
lique to both the length and the magnecrystallic axis of the crystal;
and the consequence was, that, when the electric current circulated
round the magnet, the crystal actually receded from the magnet
under the in<U+FB02>uence of the force, which tended to place the magne
crystallic axis and the magnetic axis parallel.     Employing a crystal
or plate of bismuth, that body could be made to approach the mag
netic pole under the in<U+FB02>uence of the magnecrystallic force; and this
force is so strong as to counteract either the tendency of the magnetic
body to approach, or of the diamagnetic body to retreat, when it is
exerted in the contrary direction.      Hence the author concludes that
it is neither attraction nor repulsion which causes the set, or deter
mines the <U+FB01>nal position of a magnecrystallic body.
   He next considers it as a force dependent upon the crystalline con
dition of the body, and therefore associated with the original mole
cular forces of the matter.      He shows experimentally, that, as the
magnet can move a crystal, so also a crystal can move a magnet.
Also, that heat takes away this power just before the crystal fuses,
and that cooling restores it in its original direction.     He next con
siders whether the effects are due to a force altogether original and
inherent in the crystal, or whether that which appears in it, is not
partly induced by the magnetic and electric forces ; and he concludes,
that the force manifested in the magnetic <U+FB01>eld, which appears by
external actions and causes the motion of the mass, is chie<U+FB02>y, and
almost entirely induced, in a manner subject indeed to the crystalline
force and additive to it, but at the same time exalting the force and
the effects to a degree which they could not have approached without
the induction.     To this part of the force he applies the word mag
neto-crystallic, in contradistinction     to the word magnecrystallic,
which is employed to express the condition, or quality, or power,
which belongs essentially to the crystal.
   The author then remarks upon the extraordinary character of the
power, which he cannot refer to polarity; and gives expression to

                                    78$
certain considerations and views which will be best learned from the
paper itself.   After this, he resumes the consideration of Pliiclrer's
results " upon the repulsion of the optic axes of crystals" already re
ferred to, and arrives at the conclusion that his results and those
now described have one common origin and cause. He then con
siders Pliicker's results in relation to those which he formerly ob
tained with heavy optical glass and many other bodies.           In con
clusion he remarks, " How rapidly the knowledge of molecular forces
grows upon us, and how strikingly every investigation tends to de
velope more and more their importance and their extreme attraction
as an object of study !     A few years ago magnetism was to us an
occult power affecting only a few bodies; now it is found to in<U+FB02>u
ence all bodies, and to possess the most intimate relations with elec
                                ii
tricity, heat, chemical action, light, crystallization, and, through it,
with the forces concerned in cohesion; and we may, in the present
state of things, well fecl urged to continue in our labours, encouraged
by the hope of bringing it into n bond of union with gravity itself."

 Society.
    The following paper was read :
    “ On the effect of surrounding Media on Voltaic Ignition."        By
 W. R. Grove, Esq., M.A., F.R.S.
    The author refers to some experiments of his published in the
 Philosophical Magazine for December 184-5, and in the Bakerian
 Lecture for 184-7, relating to the difference of ignition generated in
 a platinum wire heated by the voltaic current, when the wire is im
 mersed in atmospheres of different gases.         In the present paper
 these experiments are continued, the current being passed through
 two platinum wires both in the same voltaic circuit, but immersed
 in atmospheres of different gases.
    It appears from these experiments that the heat generated in the
 wire is less in hydrogen and its compounds than in other gases;
 and that when the wires and their atmospheres of gas are immersed
 in given quantities of water, the water surrounding the hydrogenous
 gases is less heated than that surrounding those which contain no
 hydrogen.
    Similar experiments, in which the wires are immersed in different
 liquids, are then given ; the heat developed appears not to depend
 on the speci<U+FB01>c heat of either the gases or the liquids.

                                    784
    The two series of experiments are brought into relation by one wire
being immersed in hydrogen and the other in water, by which it
appears that the cooling effect of the hydrogen nearly equals that of
water.
    Further experiments are then given, in order to ascertain, if possi
ble, to what chemical or physical peculiarity these cooling effects are
due; and from them it appears that they are not due to the speci<U+FB01>c
gravity, speci<U+FB01>c heat, or to any conducting power of the gases for
electricity; and that they do not follow the same law as that by which
gases escape from minute apertures.        They apparently depend upon
some molecular character of the gases, by which either the inter
change of hot and cold particles is facilitated, or a super<U+FB01>cial action
takes place, the surface of the hydrogenous gases presenting a more
ready escape to the heat, similarly to that which has been long ob
served with regard to the different molecular constitutions of solid
bodies, such for instance as the more rapid radiation or absorption
of heat by black than by white 'surfaces, in the present case the
epipolic action being dependent on the surface of the aériform me
dium, and not on that of the solid substances.

    The reading of a paper, entitled, " Contributions to the Physio
logy of the Alimentary Canal." By W. Brinton, Esq., M.B. Com
municated by R. Bentley Todd, M.D., F.R.S., was resumed and
concluded.
    The paper consists of two parts, having a real relation to each
other, though apparently little connected.
    I. On the Movements of the Stomach.—The anatomy of its mus
cular coat is <U+FB01>rst brie<U+FB02>y mentioned, and the so-called oblique <U+FB01>bres
of some authors stated to be really transverse, i. e. at right angles to
the altered direction of the canal.
           muscular actions of the digesting stomach are then con
     ere .

                                    785
    These I-Ialler regarded as alternate contractions  in two directions,
now forwards, now backwards, forcing the contained food in corre
spondingly reversed directions, and rested this conclusion on expe
riment and argument: but the author believes the experiment to be
solitary, and not parallel with the fact sought to be established, and
the argument to be inconclusive.
    Beaumont's views are cited as analogous to Haller's, but are con
sidered as having been by no means clearly stated.
    The author indicates an argument from analogy, but chie<U+FB02>y bases
his conclusion on the observations of Owen and others on Fishes, and
his own observations in animals immediately after death :—in the
empty or non-digesting stomach; and in the stomach which contains
food; <U+FB01>rst, in the early stage of digestion; and, secondly, at a later
period.
    From a contrast of these three states it is found, that in the <U+FB01>rst
there is no movement; in the second and third a considerable one;
that in the latter, the opening of the pylorus, and the preponderance
of the contractions of the pyloric half of the viscus, constitute its
chief distinction from the second. The two latter movements are
both peristaltic, or in one direction only—being never reversed, so far
as the author has seen.
    The movement impressed on the food is next considered.            Ac
cording    to the observations of Beaumont    and others, the food passes
in two directions or streams, forwards and backwards. These ob
servations the author has been unable to repeat, but regards them
 as established.
    Assuming the truth of these observations, and contrasting them
 with the muscular actions previously stated, it appears that the latter
 are uniformly in one direction, the former in two,—an apparent in
 congraity, which the author next seeks to explain.
    By experiment he attempts to imitate the natural conditions, and
 with the production of the like result. He next offers an explana
tion and illustration of the fact (which might almost be predicated,
 cl priori), and adduces some (possible)     analogues from the animal
                '                                                         '
 kingdom.
     He then seeks to establish a general law—that transverse con
 tractions, occurring in a closed tube <U+FB01>lled with <U+FB02>uid, and proceed
 ing in one direction only, imply two currents; a peripheral of ad
 vance, taking the same course as the peripheral contractions ; and an
 axial of return, in the opposite direction.
     He next points out the modi<U+FB01>cation of this law for stomachs of
 human shape, and shows how compatible this is with the careful
 observations of Beaumont, none of which are essentially opposed
 to it.
     The author indicates a probable modi<U+FB01>cation correlative with the
 consistence of the food in some animals, and thus shows a dependence
 of this physical process on a previous one.
     A solitary experiment is adduced to show that, as in the healthy
 movement, so also in vomiting, no backward or antiperistaltic con
 traction necessarily occurs.

                                      786
      A conjecture concerning regurgitation of <U+FB02>uid from the stomach
  concludes this part of the paper.
      ll. O11 the Physiology of Intestinal Obstructions.—ln the preceding
  part of the paper it has been stated, that two currents probably ob
  tain in the liquid contents of the stomach.       Many of the conditions
  of the intestinal tube approximate to those of the stomach; and if
  disease or experiment add to these occlusion and distension, the ana
  logy of the two organs is rendered tolerably complete, and the results
  will hence probably be referrible to the same general principle.
     The most remarkable and constant symptom of this state of ob
  struction is the occurrence of faecal vomiting.
     The author brie<U+FB02>y states the theory of an antiperistalsis by which
  this phenomenon is ordinarily explained : and from an inquiry into its
  experimental basis he deduces this general result, that an antiperi
  staltic movement has never yet been observed in any part of the ali
  mentary canal.      He regards the irregular actions seen on laying
  open the bellies of healthy animals recently killed, as not de<U+FB01>nedly
 peristaltic or the reverse, but as dependent on the irritation pro
 duced by the admitted air.        So also, in the case of the occluded in
  testine, an inverted movement likewise fails to be recognized.         In
 general, the vermicular actions are more energetic, and more peri
 staltic, than in the healthy bowel.
     He next adduces the following arguments :-—
     l. The antiperistalsis is usually attributed to irritation; but
 irritation is present in almost every disease of the tube, while faecal
 vomiting is limited to cases of obstruction.        This renders it pro
 bable that the latter is the cause, and that the process of causation
 is, like the cause, physical.
     2. The starting-point of the supposed inverted movement is the
 fullest part of the bowel, while the place towards which it has set is
 the emptiest.      This condition is inconsistent with the supposition
 of an antiperistalsis, yet perfectly consistent with a forward move
 ment, and analogous to the obstructions of other tubes conveying
<U+FB02>uids.
     3. Intus-susception is often the cause of obstruction.      But, both
from experiment and argument, it appears probable, that an anti
peristalsis would at once remove this condition, and would there
fore be incompatible with it.
     4. The supposed inverted movement is continuous, while the
vomiting is occasional. Hence a theory which showed the essential
independency of the return of faecal matters to the stomach, and
their ejection thence, would be, so far, preferable.
     5. Experiment and observation agree in showing that the ordi
nary peristalsis obtains immediately below the strangulation.          And
it is di<U+FB02>icult to imagine how or why the same irritation should pro
duce two opposite movements in reversed directions.
     6. The general and comparative date of accession of the vomit
ing is scarcely compatible with the antiperistaltic theory.
    The author next adduces experiments in which the intestine of
animals was arti<U+FB01>cially occluded by a ligature. In exceptional cases,

                                   THT
the ligature sloughed into the canal, and the obstruction was thus
destroyed.    ln all others, the tube was distended above the stricture
to a variable extent.    Below the stricture, the intestine was usually
empty and contracted for an inch or two.       The contenta of the tube
varied both in quality and quantity; uniform <U+FB02>uidity being asso
ciated with a large quantity of contents, while their smaller amount
was often attended with differences of consistence.        The date at
which the vomiting acceded varied considerably.       ln one or two in
stances this symptom did not occur at all.        These differences ap
peared mainly dependent on
    l. The amount of <U+FB02>uid ingesta,
    2. The distance of the stricture from the stomach.
    The date of death seemed to vary chie<U+FB02>y with the degree of dis
 tension.
    He therefore deduces the theory,—'l'hat, in‘ an obstructed intes
tine, a movement of the ordinary (and probably peristaltic) character
propels the contents onwards to the seat of occlusion; that a con
tinuance of the process distends. <U+FB01>rst this part of the tube. and next,
those portions above it; that, if the contents are <U+FB02>uid, the ordinary
peristalsis tends to develope an axial and reversed current, which re
turns matter from n lower to a higher point of the intestine ;—often
from the obstruction to the stomach, whence they are ejected by
vomiting.
    T hat in some cases, however, the action is probably much less
perfect than this; the consistence of the contents preventing the
perfection of these currents throughout the whole course of the tube.
But still a mixture results, although a less intimate one.
   The author next glances at the mode in which obstruction ap
pears to affect peristalsis, and the nature of the distending <U+FB02>uid.
He compares the obstructed intestine to the healthy stomach, to the
obstructed artery and duct; referring its peculiar appearances to
the dilatable yet muscular structure of its coats.
   In conclusion, he indicates the possible result of this theory on
practical medicine.
   The following papers were also read :—l. “On the Determina
tion  of the Difference of Longitude, by means of the Magnetic
Telegraph." By Elias Loomis, Esq., in a Letter to Lieut.-Col.
Sabine, R.A., For. Sec. R.S.     Communicated by Lieut.-Col. Sabine,
R.A., For. Sec. R.S.
   The writer <U+FB01>rst refers to a series of experiments made under the
direction of Professor Bache, for the determination of the di<U+FB02>brence
of longitude between New York, Philadelphia and Washington, by
means of the magnetic telegraph.      By this series of experiments he
considers it established that, by means of Morse's telegraph, two
clocks distant from each other 200 miles, can be compared together
with the same precision as if they were placed side by side; and
that the di<U+FB02>erence of longitude of two places can be determined
with the same precision as the relative error of the clocks. These
results were so satisfactory that Professor Bache determined to pro

                                      788
secute them more extensively, and during the past summer compa
risons have been made between New York and Cambridge observa
tory near Boston.        The plan of operation this season was more
matured than during the former.           The comparisons were all made
between    a solar chronometer     at  Cambridge and a sidereal clock at
New York.       At ten o’clock in the evening, the two observatories
having been put in telegraphic communication, when the seconds
hand of the solar chronometer came round to 60', a signal was given
at Cambridge, by pressing the key of the telegraph-register;         at the
same   instant  a click  was  heard   at New  York, and  the  time  was re
corded according to      the sidereal  clock.  At the end  of 10' a second
signal was given, which was also recorded at New York; at the end
of another 10' a third signal was given, and so on for sixty seconds.
The Cambridge astronomer then commenced beating seconds by
striking the key of the telegraph-register in coincidence with the
beats of his chronometer.       The New York astronomer compared the
signals received with rthe beats of his clock, and waited for a coin
cidence.     When the beats were sensibly synchronous the time was
recorded, and the astronomer waited six minutes for another coin
cidence of beats.       The Cambridge astronomer continued beating
seconds for <U+FB01>fteen minutes, during which time the New York ob
server was sure of two coincidences, and might obtain three. When
these were concluded, the New York astronomer in the same man
ner gave signals for one minute at intervals of 10', and then beat
seconds for <U+FB01>fteen minutes, during which time the Cambridge astro
nomer obtained four or <U+FB01>ve coincidences upon his chronometer.
This mode of comparison was practised every night, and it is con
sidered that the uncertainty in the comparison of the time-pieces
cannot exceed two or three hundredths of a second on any night;
and in a series of comparisons the error may be regarded as entirely
eliminated.
   Another mode of comparison which was practised is that of tele
graphing star transits.       A list of stars which culminate near our
zenith at intervals of <U+FB01>ve or six minutes was prepared, and the ob
servers, both at New York and Cambridge, were furnished with a
copy. They then proceeded as follows : Cambridge selected two stars
from the list, which we will call A and B, and struck the key of his
register at the instant when the star A passed each of the seven wires
of his transit. These signals were heard at New York, and the times
recorded.     Cambridge then observed the transit of star B in the
ordinary manner without telegraphing.           New York then observed
the transit of star A on his meridian in the usual manner; and struck
his key at the instant the star B passed each of the seven wires of
his transit, which signals were heard and recorded at Cambridge.
The difference of longitude between New York and Cambridge is
nearly twelve minutes, affording ample time for all these observations.
Thus New York obtained upon his own clock the times of transit of
star A over the meridians of Cambridge and New York; and Cam
bridge obtained upon his chronometer the times of transit of star B
                               The difference of these times gives the dif
 over the same meridians.

 Cambridge sclccted a second pair 0f stars from the list, and the same

 of collimation was thus climimited, and by con<U+FB01>ning the observations
 to stars within about <U+FB01>ve dcgrccs of the zu-nilh, the in<U+FB02>uence of azi
 muthal error was avoided.        The level being I-ra\l at every reversal,
 the correction for it was applied by computation.          ln this manner
 it is hoped to eliminate cw-ry posk'ildu source of error, except that
 which arises from the personal lmbits of the observers. In order to
 eliminate this error, a trm-4-[ling ohsvever worked for a time at Cam
 bridge and compared with the Cambridge astronomer; then came
to New York and compared with the New York astronomer; thcn
 returned to Cambridge again, and so on as ollcn as was thought
 necessary.    Finally, at tln- conclusion of the campaign all the ob
servers wcre to meet at Cambridge and inalua a general comparison
of their modes of observation.
    On one or two nights the prcceding programme was changed, and
each observer telegraphed both star A and star B.

pounds in cases of Voltaic lgnition."         By W. F. Stevenson, Esq.,
 F.R.S.
    In this communication     the author gives several theorems which
he considers to be established by the experiments cited in a pam
phlet which he published, entitled “The Non-decomposition of Water
distinctly proved."     He then states, that when we apply the prin
ciple of these theorems to Mr. Grove's dlsCOvt.'ry of the cooling
properties of hydrogen, it will be found to admit of a most simple
solution: “ for instance, when-the coil of platinum wire is connected
with the poles of the electric battery, and the current is established,
it is evident that the electric matter thus passed through the wire
must escape at the contrary end (the air with which the wire is
surrounded not being a conductor of electricity), and as the quan
tity of electric matter thus transmitted is considerable, and its exit
from the wire con<U+FB01>ned but rapid, that commotion before noticed
(in one of the author's theorems) necessarily ensues and causes the
ignition of the wire; but when the coil of wire is immersed in
hydrogen, which is a conductor of electricity, it is evident that the
electric matter must be, at the same moment, abstracted or con
ducted from every portion of the wire, and consequently the com
motion or rush of the electric matter at the extremity of the wire,
which causes the ignition, is suspended and the comparative cool
ness of the wire is the necessary result."
    3. Postscript to a paper “ On the Ganglia and Nerves of the
Heart," with two drawings.         By Robert Lee, M.D., F.R.S.
    The author states that since his former communication was pre
sented to the Royal Society he has made a very minute dissection
in alcohol of the whole nervous system of the young hcil'er's heart.

                                                                    .
                           .            790
In this preparation the distribution'of the ganglia and nerves over
the entire surface of the heart, and the relations of these structures
to the blood-vessels and‘ muscular substance, are considered by the
author to be far more fully displayed than in any of his former dis
sections. He states, that on the anterior surface there are distinctly
 visible to the naked eye, ninety ganglia or ganglionic enlargements
 on the nerves, which pass obliquely across the arteries and the mus
 cular <U+FB01>bres of the ventricles from their base to the apex; that these
 ganglionic enlargements are observed on the nerves, not only where
 they are crossing the arteries, but where they are ramifying on the
 muscular substance without the blood-vessels; that on the posterior
 surface the principal branches of the coronary arteries plunge into
 the muscular substance of the heart near the base, and many nerves
 with ganglia accompany them throughout the walls to the lining
 membrane and columnae carneae.
     The author considers that, in the accompanying beautiful draw
 ings, Mr. VVest has depicted with the greatest accuracy and minute
 ness the whole nervous structures demonstrable in this preparation
 on the surface of the heart; but that the ganglia and nerves repre
 sented in these drawings constitute only a small portion of the
 nervous system of the heart, numerous ganglia being formed in the
 walls of the heart which no artist can represent.

         “ On the Aurora Borealis which occurred on the evening of
  Friday, the 17th of November, 184-8."             By Mr. R. Smith, Black
 ford, Perthshire.      Communicated by P. M. Roget, M.D., F.R.S.
     The author states that the 17th of November was a <U+FB01>ne day with
 a clear sky and bright sunshine: towards evening the sky became
  cloudy and a few drops of rain fell, but it soon again became clear,
  with the exception of a few <U+FB02>eecy clouds that here and there dimmed
  its brightness.    At 61' 4-5"‘ a soft and gentle light began to illumine
  the northern region of the sky; and at 7 o'clock a considerable
  portion of it was covered with dark-red streams of light towards
  the east; while streamers moving to and fro, arrayed in colours of
  golden and silvery hues, overspread the south and north.              About
  8 o’clock there appeared near the zenith, and upon the magnetic
  meridian, a ring of an elliptical form, from which proceeded in all
  directions towards the horizon, beams or columns of light, giving to
  the heavens the appearance of a splendid vault, with its top adorned
  with a crown or wreath; while around and within the vault were to
  he seen clouds of brilliant light <U+FB02>ashing towards and from the crown
  or central circle of the aurora, sometimes tinged with prismatic rays,
  at other times intensely white and lucid.              About half-past nine
  nearly   the  whole   of   the aerial  canopy   was   clad  with clouds of a
  bright   red  colour,  casting  a  curious  reddened    hue  over the objects
  on the surface of the earth.           After  a  short period of time had
  elapsed,  the  red colour began     to diminish  in intensity, and was again
  replaced by the white dome.           However,   in various parts of the sky
  the red colour still remained, principally in the north-west, south
  west, and north-east.        Between the hours of twelve and one beams

                                  791
of brilliant white light commenced shooting up in the south from
the horizon to the central ring or pole.    The beams appeared to be
at nearly equal distances from each other, the entire column of the m
stretehing over a space equal to about one-<U+FB01>fth part of the visible
horizon, in the form of a fan. The whole <U+FB01>gure rapidly changed
from a pure white light into a glow of brilliant colours of every tint,
variegating the undulating waves as they rolled on their way to the
pole of the aurora. In the course of three minutes these gave place
to the white <U+FB02>ashing radiations.
   During the time of the aurora there were a great number of small
meteors, the direction of whose motion was from east to west, and
which appeared to be considerably below the sphere of the aurora.
   A box containing a delicately balanced needle, was exposed upon
the ground during the display of the aurora, but did not appear to
be affected in the sli htest degree till about one o'clock,when it was
observed to be consigerably de<U+FB02>ected. At the time when the needle
was disturbed, them was a dense column of radiating light in the
north-west and south-east.     The re<U+FB02>exion from the north-west was
so clear, that when made to fall upon the polarizing plate of
M. Biot's polarizing apparatus, and a <U+FB01>lm of mica was placed upon
the stage of the instrument, the various colours produced by the
mica were beautifully clear and distinctly seen in the analysing glass.
   The author considers that the phenomenon of the colours which
were noticed, was probably caused by exhalations or vapour <U+FB02>oating
in the atmosphere, betwixt the light of the aurora and the observer,
causing a refraction of the rays transmitted to the eye, analogous to
that which produces the phenomenon of halos. The continued
undulations of the auroral light, and also the passing of the rays
through thick and thin portions of the vapour, may, he considers,
have produced the great variety of colours.        During the time of
the exhibition of this phenomenon, a thin fog or vapour was observed
on both sides of the auroral fan. The author is of opinion that the
cause which produced the variety of tints, is different from that
which occasioned the red-coloured auroral clouds. At the time of
the latter phenomenon the moon's position was nearly due east, and
a cloud moved from the west towards the east, which in its course
passed between the moon and the observer; as soon as the cloud
obscured the light of the moon, the red colour to the north-west
disappeared, but became visible when an opening in the cloud allowed
the rays to pass through, and again vanished when another portion of
the cloud cut off the light; and when the cloud had <U+FB01>nally passed
over, the red colour in the different parts of the sky resumed the
same tint that it pomessed before the moonlight was obscured by
the cloud.    The author states that it would thus appear, that when
the light of the moon was incident at a certain angle upon the white
light, or some kind of vapour that surrounded it, a red colour was
produced; and hence that the moon is in some way or other con
nected with the phenomenon.        ljle remarks, that the red colour
was <U+FB01>rst observed in the east, and the moon being in that quarter
of the heavens, the rays proceeding from it would <U+FB01>rst come in

                                    792
contact with that part of the aurora towards the east.        When the
aurora commenced, the moon was considerably below the horizon;
but this, it is considered, docs not form any serious objection to
what has been stated, since the aurora soared to so great a height,
that the rays of light proceeding from her would strike the aurora a
considerable time before she arose above the horizon.
    The aurora continued for upwards of six hours, and during that
time the thermometer stood at 84-”.

    The  MARQUIS OF NORTHAMPTON,                   V.P., in the Chair.
    A  paper was read, entitled
                                  “ On the Development and Homolo
 gies of the Carapace  and   Plastron of the Chelonian Reptiles." By
 Professor Owen, F.R.S.
    The author commences by de<U+FB01>ning the several parts of which the
 osseous thoracic-abdominal     case of the Chelonian Reptiles is com
posed, and brie<U+FB02>y discusses the several opinions that have been
published with regard to their nature and homologies, dwelling
 chie<U+FB02>y on that recently proposed by Prof. Rathké, in his work on
the Development of the C/zelonia, in which it is contended that the
carapace consists exclusively of the development of parts of the
 endo-skeleton, viz. the neural spines and vertebral ribs (pleurapo
physes), agreeably with the opinion of CUVIER and BOJANUs, and
 that the remainder of the thoracic-abdominal case, consisting of the
“marginal pieces" and “plastron," are formed entirely from bones
 of the dermal system.
    Adverting to the hypotheses of Cuvier, Geoffrey and Meckel, that
the thoracic-abdominal case is a modi<U+FB01>cation of parts of the endo
skeleton exclusively, the author tests their determinations by com
parisons with the corresponding parts of the bird and crocodile, and
infers, from the latter animal, that the hyosternal, hyposternal and
xiphisternal bones are not parts of the sternum, but are homologous
with the haemapophyses (sternal ribs and abdominal ribs); those in the
Plesiosaurus making the nearest approach to the peculiar develop
ment of the parts in the Ckelonia, especially as they appear in the
pl-astron of the immature Terrapenes and Sea-turtles.
    Admitting that any hypothesis framed from the comparison of the
completed structures in the adult Vertebrata requires for con<U+FB01>rma
tion its agreement with the important phenomena of the develop
ment of those structures, the author proceeds to apply that test.
    He details his observations on the development of the skeleton,
and especially of the thoracic-abdominal      case, in the embryos and
young of different genera of Chelonia.       The chief facts that have
governed his conclusions are the following :—
    With respect to the carapace. The cartilaginous basis of the
neural plates is developed in the substance of the dorm; and of

                                  793
                                               '
 these, the 9th, 10th, llth, and the ' nuchal plate are ossi<U+FB01>ed from
 independent centres, aml remain permanently free from anchylosis
with the subjacent spines of the vertebrae: they are, therefore,
 “dermal bones," lioinologou.- with lhose that overlie the vertebrae
 of the crocodile.   But thc <U+FB01>rst to the eighth neural plates inclusive
 are serial homologucs with thc foregoing, and must, therefore, have
 the same general homology. The objection that ossi<U+FB01>cation extends
 into their dermal cartilaginous basis from the neural spines is met
 by the remark, that other parts, e.g. the radius and ulna of the frog,
 are ossi<U+FB01>cd from a common centre, without thuir homologicnl di
stinctness being thereby masked or destroyed. The course or start
 ing-point of ossi<U+FB01>cation does not determine the nature and homology
 of parts, and the author refers what he believes to be an erroneous
conclusion of Prof. Ralhké to undue value being given to the cha
racter of connation.
    The cartilaginous basis of the costal plates is developed in the
substance of the derm; the subjacent ribs are previously ossi<U+FB01>ed and
present the normal slender form. llut ossi<U+FB01>cation extends from near
the head of ench of the eight pairs of dorsal ribs, from the second
to the ninth pair inclusive, into the superincumbent dermal carti
lages. This had been described as the development of the tubercle
of the rib. But Prof. Owen observes that. in the development of
the carapace of the young of the Testudo indica, the connation of
the costal plate with the rib commences at a different point in each
rib alternately, and appears to be governed by the arrangement of the
 horny scutes above.     Another objection to these ossiiic expansions
being the tubercles of the ribs is presented by their abutment me
sially against the neural plates, not against the vertebral diapo
physes, as in the bird and crocodile.
    In regard to the development of the plastron, the author describes
two situations in which the primitive cartilages are developed, cor
responding with those in the embryo-carapace, viz. one belonging to
the endo-skeleton, the other in the derm.        The <U+FB01>rst form under
which the endo-skeletal parts of the plastron appear agrees with the
evidence afforded by the comparison of the fully-developed parts
with those of the crocodile, and proves the hyosternals, hyposternals

    The following papers were read :—1. Some remarks on a paper
entitled “ On the Depth of Rain which falls in the same localities at
different Altitudes in the Hilly districts of Lancashire, Cheshire, &c.,
by S. C. Homersham, C.E." By John Fleteher Miller, Esq. Com
municated by Lieut.-Col. Sabine, R.A., For. Sec. R.S.
    The author, after alluding to the discordance between the con
clusions at which he had arrived from a discussion of his meteoro
logical observations in the lake district of Cumberland and‘West
moreland, described in a former paper, and those drawn from the
same facts by Mr. Homersham, in a paper read before the Society
on the 25th of May last, states that the results for the year 184-8
show a precisely similar gradation to those of the two preceding
years; and that the whole of the observations appear to warrant the
conclusion which he had ventured to draw from those detailed in
his former paper.
    He remarks that, as the rain-gauges are, with one exception, si
tuated on the high mountains surrounding the head of the Vale of
Wastdale, this valley is the only one which can fairly be selected as
a standard in comparing the quantities of rain obtained at the differ
ent mountain stations. The discordance between his conclusions and
those arrived at by Mr. Homersham, he considers, has arisen from
that gentleman having selected the distant and excessively wet loca
lity of Seathwaite at the head of the southern fork of Borrowdale,
as a representative of the quantity of water deposited in the valleys
generally.
    If the receipts of the mountain gauges, he observes, be compared
with the rain-fall at Wastdale Head, or in any of the other valleys
except Seathwaite, it will be found that the quantity increases con
siderably up to 1900 feet, where it reaches a maximum; and that
above this elevation it rapidly decreases, until at 2800 feet above the
sea the amount is very much less than in the surrounding valleys.
    In conclusion, the author states that it appears to him, that much
 of the discordance in the resultsobtained at various elevations amongst
 the mountains has arisen from the circumstance of the instruments
 having been placed on the slope or breast of the hill nearly in ailine
 with each other; in which positions, he is convinced from experi
 ence, that when strong winds prevail, the gauges are exposed to eddies
 or counter-currents, which prevent a portion of the water from enter
 ing the funnel, and thus a less depth of rain is obtained than is due
to the elevation.
    The gauges under his superintendence being all stationed either
 on the top or shoulder of the mountain, and exposed to the wind
 from every point of the compass, are not, he observes, open to this
 objection.
    2. Supplement to a paper “ On the Theory of Certain Bands seen
                            'x

                                     790
in the Spectrum."         By G. G. Stokes, Esq., M.A., Fellow of Pem
brokeCollege,Cambridge. Communicated by the liev. Baden Powell,
M.A., F.R.S.
      The principal object of the author in this communication is to
point out some practical applications of the interference bands re
cently discovered by Professor Powell, the theory of which was con
sidered by the author in the paper to which the present is a supple
 ment. The bands seem specially adapted to the determination of
the dispersion in media which cannot be procured in suf<U+FB01>cient purity
 to exhibit the <U+FB01>xed lines of the spectrum.          The ordinary experi
 ments of interference allow of the determination of refractive indices
 with great precision ; but in attempting to determine in this way the
 dispersion of the retarding plate employed, there is the want of a
 de<U+FB01>nite object to observe in connection with the different parts of
 the spectrum.        ln Professor Powell's experiment, the wire of the
 telescope, placed in coincidence with one of the <U+FB01>xed lines of the
 spectrum previously to the insertion of the retarding plate into thc
 <U+FB02>uid, marks the place of the <U+FB01>xed line, and so affords a de<U+FB01>nite ob
ject to observe when the retarding plate is inserted into the <U+FB02>uid,
 and the spectrum is consequently traversed by bands of interference.
       The practical applications considered by the author are princi
  pally four. In the <U+FB01>rst, the variation of the refractive index of the
  plate in passing from one <U+FB01>xed line to another is determined, the
 absolute refractive index for some one <U+FB01>xed line being supposed ac
  curately known.       The observation consists in counting the number
  of bands     seen between   two <U+FB01>xed lines of the spectrum, the frac
  tions of   a  band-interval at the two extremities being measured or
  estimated.
       In the second application, the absolute refractive index of the plate
  is determined for some one <U+FB01>xed line of the spectrum.         The obser
  vation consists in counting the number of bands which move across
  the wire of the telescope, previously placed in coincidence with the
  <U+FB01>xed line in question, when the plate is inclined to the incident light.
       The third application is to the determination of the change in the
  refractive index of the <U+FB02>uid, for any <U+FB01>xed line of the spectrum, pro
  duced by a change in the temperature.        The observation consists in
  counting the number of bands which move across the wire of the
  telescope while the temperature sinks from one observed value to
  another, the temperature being noted by means of a delicate ther
  mometer which remains in the <U+FB02>uid. For this observation a know
   ledge of the refractive index of the retarding plate is not required.
       The fourth application is to the determination of the change of
   velocity of the light corresponding to any <U+FB01>xed line of the spectrum,
   when the direction of the refracted wave changes with reference to
   certain <U+FB01>xed lines in the plate, which is here supposed to belong to
   a doubly refracting crystal.     The observation consists in counting
   the bands as they pass the wire when the plate is inclined.        It re
   quires that the plate should be mounted on a graduated instrument.
    It would be possible in this way to determine, by observation alone,
   the wave surface belonging to each <U+FB01>xed line of the spectrum.

   While considering the theory of Professor Powe1l’s bands, the au
thor was led to perceive the explanation of certain bands, described
by Professor Powell,which are seen in the secondary spectrum formed
by two prisms which produce a partial achromatism.           Although the
account of these bands has been published many years, they do not
seem hitherto to have attracted attention.     It is easily shown by com
mon optics that when two colours are united by means of two prisms,
the deviation, regarded as a function of the refractive index, the
angle ofincidence being given, is a maximum or minimum for ome
intermediate colour. For the latter colour, two portions of light of
consecutive degrees of refrangibilitycome out parallel ; and there
fore the diffraction bands belonging to different kinds of light, of
very nearly the same refrangibility with the one in question, are su
perposed in such a manner that the dark and bright bands respect
ively coincide.     Thus distinct bands are visible in the secondary
spectrum, although none would be seen in the spectrum formed by
a single prism, in consequence of the mixture of the bright and dark
bands belonging to different kinds of light of nearly the same degree
of refrangibility. The diffraction bands here spoken of are of very
sensible breadth, in consequence of the small width of the aperture
employed in the actual experiment.
   When a spectrum is viewed through a narrow slit half covered by
a plate of mica, the edge of which bisects the slit longitudinally, and
is held parallel to the <U+FB01>xed lines of the spectrum, the bands described
by Sir David Brewster are seen, provided the mica plate lie at the
side at which the blue end of the spectrum is seen, and provided the
thickness of the plate and the breadth of the slit lie within certain
limits.   When these bands are invisible in consequence of the slit
being too narrow, or the spectrum too broad, it follows from theory
that the bands ought to appear when the slit and plate are turned
round the axis of the eye, so that the edge of the plate is no longer
parallel to the <U+FB01>xed lines of the spectrum.      The author has veri<U+FB01>ed
this conclusion by experiment, employing plates adapted to obser
vations with the naked eye, which are best suited to the purpose.

   The following paper was read :—“On the Chemistry of the Urine ; n.
ingthree Parts.    By H. Bence Jones, M.D., M.A., F.R.S.
   Part I. On the variations of the Acidity of the Urine in Health.
   The mode of examination adopted by the authorwas the following :
Two test solutions were made; the one with carbonate of soda; the
other with dilute sulphuric acid, of such strength that each measure
of a graduated tube, when <U+FB01>lled with either solution, was equivalent
to one-twelfth of a grain of dry and pure carbonate of soda.
   A weighed quantity of urine was neutralized by one or other of

                                   797
the test solutions, and thus the degree of acidity or alkalescencc was
determined.
    Diurnal variations in the acidity of the urine were observed. The
acidity of the urine was found to ebb and <U+FB02>ow; it was greatest a
short time before food was taken, and was least about tllrcc hours
after breakfast. and <U+FB01>ve or six hours after dinner, when it reached
the minimum point ; after which it again increased, and attained the
 maximum point previous to food being again taken.
     If no food was taken. the acidity varied but slightly for twelve
 hours.
     By comparing the effect of vegetable food with animal food, it
 appeared that the food which irritated the stomach most and caused
 most secretion of acid in the stomach, caused the greatest oscillations
 in the urine.
     Dilute sulphuric acid taken in large doses produced but little
 effect on the variations of the acidity of the urine; but it was proved
 to increase the acidity of the urine.
           ll
     Part . On lhe rimullaneous rarilrlions of (he amount of Uric Acid
 and the Acidity of lhc l'rine in u healthy slate.
     The result of these experiments is, that there is no relation be
  tween the acidity of the urine and the amount of uric acid in it.
  The urine that was most acid contained least uric acid; that which
  contained most uric acid was not most acid. All food causes an in
  crease in the amount of uric acid in the urine; and there is no de
  cided difference between vegetable and animal food, either as to the
  increase or diminution of the amount of uric acid in the urine.
      Part lll. Variations of the Sulphate; in the Urine in the heallhy
  state, and on the in<U+FB02>uence of Sulphuric Acid. Sulphur and the Sul
 phalea, on the Sulphates in the I/rine.
     The result of these experiments is, that the sulphates in the urine
  are much increased by food, whether it be vegetable or animal. Ex
  ercise does not produce a marked increase in the sulphates.        Sul
  phuric acid, when taken in large quantity, increases the sulphates in
  the urine.    In small quantity, even when long-continued, no effect
  on the amount of sulphates is manifest.
      Sulphur taken as a medicine increases the sulphates in the urine.
                                 ii.
  Sulphate of soda and sulphate of magnesia produce the most marked
  increase in the sulphates in the urine.

            The  EARL OF ROSSE,         President,  in the Chair.
      Alpaper was read, entitled “ On the application of the Theory of
  Elliptic Functions to the Rotation of a Rigid Body round a Fixed
  Point." By James Booth, L.L.D.,F.R.S.
     In the introduction to his investigation, the author, after noticing
  the investigations of D’Alembert and Euler, and the solution of this

                                     798
  problem    by Lagrange, refers more particularly to the memoir of
  Poinsot, in which the motion of a body round a <U+FB01>xed point, and free
  from the action of accelerating forces, is reduced to the motion of
  a certain ellipsoid whose centre is <U+FB01>xed, and which rolls without
  sliding on a plane <U+FB01>xed in space; and likewise to the researches
  of Maccullagh,rin which, by adopting an ellipsoid the reciprocal of
  that chosen by Poinsot, he deduced those results which long before
  had been arrived at by the more operose methods of Euler and La
  grange; observing, however, that it is to Legendre that we are in
  debted for the happy conception of substituting, as a means of inves
  tigation, an ideal ellipsoid having certain relations with the actually
  revolving body.     He then states, that several years ago he was led
  to somewhat similar views, from remarking the identity which exists
  between the formulae for <U+FB01>nding the position of the principal axes of
  a body and those for determining the symmetrical diameters of an
  ellipsoid; and further observing that the expression for the per
 pendicular from the centre on a tangent plane to an ellipsoid, in
 terms of the cosines of the angles which it makes with the axes, is
 precisely the same in form as that which gives the value of the mo
  ment of inertia round a line passing through the origin. Guided by
 this analogy, he was led to assume an ellipsoid the squares of whose
 axes should be directly proportional to the moments of inertia round
 the coinciding principal axes of the body. This is also the ellipsoid
 chosen by Maccullagh.        Although it may at <U+FB01>rst sight appear of
 little importance which of the ellipsoids—the inverse of Poinsot, or
 the direct of Maccullagh and the author-—is chosen as the geome
 trical substitute for the revolving body, it is by no means a matter
 of indifference when we come to treat of the properties of the in
 tegrals which determine the motion.       Generally those integrals de
 pend on the properties of those 'curves of double <U+FB02>exure in which
 cones of the second degree are generally intersected by concentric
 spheres; and it so happens that the direct ellipsoid of moments is
 intersected by a concentric sphere in one of these curves. By means
 of the properties of these curves a complete solution may be ob
 tained even in the most general cases, to which only an approxi
 mation has hitherto been made.
     In the <U+FB01>rst section of the paper, the author establishes such pro
 perties as he has subsequently occasion to refer to, of cones of the
 second degree, and of the curves of double curvature in which these
surfaces may be intersected by concentric spheres, some of which
he believes will not he found in any published treatise on the sub
ject. He considers that he has been so fortunate as to be the <U+FB01>rst
to obtain the true representative curve of elliptic functions of the
<U+FB01>rst order.     It is shown that any spherical conicsection, the tan
gents of whose principal semiarcs are the ordinates of an equilateral
hyperbola whose transverse semiaxis is 1, may be recti<U+FB01>ed by an
elliptic function of the <U+FB01>rst order, and the quadrature of such a
curve may be effected by a function of the same order, when the
cotangents of the halves of the principal arcs are the ordinates of
the same equilateral hyperbola.

                                      T99
     This particular species of spherical ellipse the author   has called
the “ Parabolic Ellipse," because,       as is shown in the course of the
investigation, it is the gnomonic projection, on the surface ofa sphere,
of the common parabola whose plane touches the sphere at the focus.
As in this species of spherical ellipse either the focus or the centre
may be taken as the origin of the spherical radii vectores, in effect
 ing the process of recti<U+FB01>cation, we are unexpectedly presented with
 Lagrange's scale of modular transformations, as also with the other
 equally well-known theorem by which the successive amplitudes are
 connected.      Among other peculiar properties of the spherical para
 bolic ellipse established in this paper, it is shown that the portion of
 a great circle touching the curve, and intercepted between the per
 pendicular arcs on it from the foci, is always equal to a quadrant.
     In the second and following sections, the author proceeds to dis
 cuss the problem which is the immediate subject of the paper.
  Having established the ordinary equations of motion, he shows that,
 if the direct ellipsoid of moments be constructed, the motion of a
 rigid body acted on solely by primitive impulses may be represented
 by this ellipsoid moving round its centre, in such a manner that its
 surface shall always pass through a point <U+FB01>xed in space. This point,
 so <U+FB01>xed, is the extremity of the axis of the plane of the impressed
  couple, or of the plane known as the invariable plane of the motion.
      But a still clearer idea of the motion of such a body is presented
  in the subsequent investigations, it being there shown, that the most
  general motion of a body round a <U+FB01>xed point may be represented by
  a cone rolling with a certain variable velocity on a plane whose axis
  is <U+FB01>xed, while this plane revolves about its own axis with a certain
  uniform velocity.      This cone may always be determined.      For the
  circular sections of the invariable cone coincide with the circular
  sections of the ellipsoid of moments; whence the cyclic axes of
  the ellipsoid, or the diameters perpendicular to the planes of these
  sections, will be the focal lines of the supplemental cone; and as
  the invariable plane is always a tangent plane to this cone, we have
  su<U+FB02>icient elements given to determine it.
      From these considerations it appears that we ma dispense alto
  gether with the ellipsoid of moments, and say that ilytwo right lines
  be drawn through the <U+FB01>xed point of the body in the plane of the
  greatest and least moments of inertia, making angles with the axis
  of greatest moment, the cosines of which shall be equal to the
  square root of the expression
                                  I:(_.\1-N)
                                  .\l(L—N)’
   (L, M, N being the symmetrical moments of inertia round the prin
   cipal axes) and a cone be conceived having those lines as focals, and
   touching moreover the invariable plane, the motion of the body will
   consist in the rotation of this cone on the invariable plane with a
   variable velocity, while the plane revolves round its own axis with
   an uniform velocity.
      Although it is very satisfactory, the author remarks, in this way

                                  '8OO
to be enabled to place before our eyes, so to speak, the actual mo
tion of the revolving body, yet it is not on such grounds that the
paper is presented to this Society.     It is as a method of investiga
tion that it must rest its claims to the notice of mathematicians;   as
a means of giving simple and elegant interpretations of those de<U+FB01>nite
integrals on the evaluation of which the dynamic state of a body at
any epoch can alone be ascertained.
   In these applications of the theory of elliptic functions, the au
thor has been led to the remarkable theorem, that the length of the
spiral, between two of its successive apsides, described in absolute
space on the surface of a <U+FB01>xed concentric sphere, by the instantane
ous axis of rotation, is equal to a quadrant of the spherical ellipse
described on an equal sphere moving with the body, by the same
instantaneous axis of rotation.
   The last section of the paper is devoted to the discussion of that
                                ii.
particular case in which the axis of the invariable plane is equal to
the mean semiaxis of the ellipsoid of moments.

   The Right Honourable Sir Francis Baring, Bart., First Lord of

   The reading of a paper, entitled “ Description of an Infusory
Animalcule allied to the genus Notommata of Ehrenberg, hitherto
undescribed."    By John Dalrymple, Esq., F.R.C.S. Communicated
by Thomas Bell, Esq., Sec. R.S., was resumed and concluded.
   The examination of various specimens of the animalcule described
by the author, disclosed the dimcious character of one of the more
highly organized of the rotiferous class of Infusoria, hitherto sup
posed to be androgenous.      This discovery was <U+FB01>rst made by obser
ving the difference in the form and development of the embryo
while still enclosed in the ovisac of the parent animal.     From the
extreme transparency of this form of rotifer, it is possible to trace
the progressive development of the young from the Grae<U+FB02>ian vesicle
in the ovary to the period of mature gestation, when the embryo is

                                     801
expelled, the whole machinery of whose organs has been perfected
while still within the body of the female.
    Thus, although the young one observed in the ovisac, when nearly
ready to be expelled, was in the great majority of instances a mi
niature portrait of the parent, yet occasionally an embryo was seen
of a different aspect, within whose body a vesicle was discovered
<U+FB01>lled with actively moving spermatozoa.
     A further investigation of the subject brought clear evidence of
the functions performed by this male,—its copulation with the young
females; but it also displayed the singular fact, that although the
organs of reproduction and locomotion were highly developed, there
was a total absence of those of assimilation; in fact, that neither
mouth, nor stomach, nor other digestive cavity or glands, were pre
sent in its curious organization.
     In the early part of the paper the author describes the anatomy
 of the female, which differs from the family of Notommata of Ehren
 berg, in the absence of intestine and anal ori<U+FB01>ce, and forcipated or
 caudal foot. In every other respect the organization is so similar to
 that class, that the author believes the proper place for this animal
cule to be in a sub-genus of .\otommata.
     In relation to physiology, the author submits a new theory of the
 mechanism of circulation and respiration in the general group of
 Rotifers, a subject which is but obscurely treated of by the great
 German observer, who appears to have believed in the existence of
 tubular vessels or true vascular system. The author thinks, how
 ever, that these functions are performed in a manner more resem
 bling that of insects, viz. that the blood is contained in the general
 cavity of the animal and circulates round the lung, which is here
 represented by a contractile vesicle that receives and expels the
 water in which the animalculc lives, and so comes to be in interme
  diate relation with the air mixed with the water.        The difference
  therefore between the aeration of the blood of insects and that of this
  rotifer is rather due to the difference of the media they respectively
  inhabit, than of design. In both, the blood is contained in a general
  cavity and brought in contact with the air, without the intervention
  of any true vascular system.
      The beautiful transparency of the animal, and the facility with
  which the development of the ovum may be traced through all its
  stages, induces the author to -believe it to be well-suited to the in
  quiries of the embryologist and of those who devote themselves to
  the study of the metamorphosis of cell into tissue.
      This animalcule has hitherto been discovered only in a few situa
  tions (in Norfolk near Norwich, and in \Varwickshire near Coven
  try), but it is believed, from the very general dispersion of Infusoria,
  that it may be more extensively met with, especially in the months
  of June, July, August and beginning of September.
      The author concludes by expressing his belief that re-examina
  tion of the whole order of Rotifera is necessary to determine the
  disposition of the sexes, and to assign them their proper situation in
  the scale of animated beings.

   A paper was also read, entitled “On the Integration of Linear
Differential Equations."     By the Rev. Brice Bronwin. Communi
cated by C. J. Hargreave, Esq., F.R.S.
   The method chie<U+FB02>y employed in this paper, is analogous to one

they are any functions of that variable,      being however understood

GEORGE RENNIE,           Esq., Treasurer, Vice-President, in the Chair.
    A  paper was read, entitled “ Minute Examination of the Organ of
Taste in Man."       By Augustus Waller, M.D. Communicated by
Richard Owen, Esq., F.R.S.
    The author commences by describing his mode of observation,
which differs from that followed by previous observers. It consists
in removing from the living tongue one of the papillae, and imme
diately subjecting it to examination.     He then proceeds to describe,
—-lst, the epithelium; 2nd, the fungiform papilla-2; 8rd, the conical
papillae; and 4-th, the inferior surface with its mucous glands, &c.
    l. The epithelium is of two kinds; the <U+FB02>at plates with a central
nucleus, which are mostly found clothing the stem and other regions
of the fungiform papillae; and the globular cells which compose
most of the external parts of the processes of the conical papillae.
    2. The fungiform papillae are found to consist of numerous small
cones seated on a common stem.          These secondary cones, already
described by Albinus, are completely hidden by a common invest
ment of epithelium which <U+FB01>lls up the irregular spaces between them.
Each of these cones contains capillary vessels, which, at the apex of
the cone, either form a simple loop or a complex coil which is covered
 only by epithelian scales of the most attenuated nature. The author
 states that in these capillary vessels the motion of the blood may be
 observed for several seconds afterthe removal from the living body,
 and may be excited for along time by the application of a slight
 degree of pressure.    By these means he has been enabled to wateh
 the passage of the red and white globules contained in the blood,
 and to detect in the human papillae all the various phenomena in the
 transparent membranes of the lower animals. By allowing the blood
 to coagulate in the vessels, beautiful examples of injected papillae
 may be obtained.     The con estion of the vessels is much increased
 by compressing the point 0? the tongue before the removal of the

                                     804‘
 papillae.    The capillaries are connected together at the bases of the
 secondary papillae, and arise from a common trunk immersed in the
 body of the papilla.      The nerves are found to subdivide in the se
 parate cones, in which they ascend to the apex and terminate in
 abrupt extremities, as in the frog, toad, &c.     In the fmtus the fun
 giform papillm     are  stated to consist of a simple cone without any
secondary papilla.
    3. The conical or <U+FB01>liform papillae of man are described to be of
 a compound nature, consisting of numerous secondary cones spring
 ing from acommon stem. Each of these secondary cones is clothed
with an elongated process which is <U+FB01>tted on the cone like a sheath.
 This process consists of elongated epithelial scales ascending towards
 the summit, and resembling in general appearance the feather of an
 arrow.     At their summit these processes are clothed with an exter
nal zone of granular matter, which considerably adds to their thick
ness.      This granular matter is often detached after the papilla has
been removed a short time from the tongue. The blood-vessels form
a simple loop at the summit of the papilla, and the nerves are ar
ranged in a similar manner.
    4'. The inferior surface is described as very smooth, presenting
numerous follicles abundantly supplied with blood-vessels and nerves.
These follicles are generally of a conical shape and surrounded with
an arch composed of epithelial cells. The nerves may frequently be
detected and followed over the surface of the follicle, but their ex
tremities are hidden amidst the blood-vessels.
    The author has illustrated the paper by several drawings.

    A   paper was read, entitled “ Additional Observations on the Os
teology of the Iguanodon and Hyla=:osaurus." By Gideon Algernon
Mantell, Esq., LL.D., F.R.S., V.P.G.S., &c.
    This memoir is ‘supplementary to the author's former communi
cations to the Royal Society on the same subject, and comprises an
account of some important additions which he has lately made to
our previous knowledge of the osteological structure of the colossal
reptiles of the Wealden of the South-east of England.
    The acquisition of some gigantic and well-preserved vertebrae and
bones of the extremities from the Isle of Wight, and of other in
structive specimens from Sussex and Surrey, induced the author to
resume his examination of the detached parts of the skeletons of the
Wealden reptiles in the British Museum, and in several private col
lections; and he states as the most important result of his investi
gations, the determination of the structure of the vertebral column,
pectoral arch, and anterior extremities of the Iguanodon. In the la
bonous and di<U+FB02>icult task of examining and comparing the numerous

                                   805
detached, and for the most part mutilated bones of the spinal column,
Dr. Mantell expresses his deep obligation to Dr. G. A. Melville,
whose elaborate and accurate anatomical description of the vertebra:
is appended to the memoir. The most interesting fossil remains are
described in detail in the following order.
   Lowerlaw.—Since the author's communication on the lower jaw
of the lguauodon, published in the Philosophical Transactions, part
ii. 184-8, he has discovered the right angular bone, which was pre
viously unkuown: from the circumstances under which this relic
was found, he considers it probable that it belonged to the same
individual as the teeth <U+FB01>gured in Plate XVIII. of the Philosophical
Transactions for 184-8.
    Vertebral column.-The vertebrae hitherto assigned to the Igua
nodou consist of the middle and posterior dorsal and anterior cau
dal, as identi<U+FB01>ed by means of the Maidstouc specimen in the British
Museum: the cervical, anterior dorsal, lumbar, and posterior and
terminal caudals, were previously either undetermined or referred to
other genera of saurians.     The investigations of Dr. Melville have
established the important and highly interesting fact, that the cervi
cal and anterior dorsal vertebra! of the lguanodon were convexo
concave—that is, convex in front and concave behind—as in the
fossil reptile of Hon<U+FB02>eur termed Slrqatoqxnadylua, and in the exist
ing pachyderms; the convexity gradually diminishing, and the an
terior face of the body of the vertebra becoming <U+FB02>at, in the middle
and posterior part of the dorsal region. The supposed Streptospou.
dylian vertebnn of the Wealden (named S. major by Professor Owen
in British Association Reports on fossil reptiles) are, in the opinion
of the author and Dr. Melville, the true cervical vertebrae of the
Iguanodon.      The convexo-concave type of vertebrae was not con
<U+FB01>ned to a single genus——the Smptospondylur of the Oolite-—but
prevailed in two, and probably in several, genera of extinct sau
rians of the secondary geological epochs; in like manner as the re
verse form, the concavo-convex, predominates in the existing cro
codilians and lizards.
   Other large vertebrae found with ribs and bones of the extremities
of the lguanodon, and referred by Professor Owen to one or more
species of Cetiosaurus, are regarded, in consequence of the peculiar
structure of the neural arch, as belonging to the posterior dorsal and
lumbar vertebne of the former colossal reptile; and certain some
what angular verwbrae, also previously assigned to a species of Ce
tiosaurus, are presumed to be the middle and distal caudala of the
Iguanodon.
   The Sacrum, of which portions of several examples belonging to
individuals of much disparity in size have been obtained, is shown to
consist of six anchylosed vertebrae; not of <U+FB01>ve, as described by Pro
fessor Owen; and the typical specimen in the possession of Mr. Saull,
which the author <U+FB01>gures and describes, is adduced in proof of the
correctness of this opinion.    The anterior vertebra, and the two
posterior ones, are much larger and stronger than the three inter
mediate elements which occupy the centre of the arch of the sacrum.

                                  806
   Pectoral an-h.—A perfect scapula discovered in the strata of Til
gate Forest, and which corresponds with the coracoid bone, provi
sionally assigned to the Iguanodon in the memoir of 184-l (Phil.
Trans. Pl. IX. <U+FB01>g. 11), Dr. Mantell has been enabled to refer to that
reptile, by the fortunate interpretation of portions of two scapulae
which are preserved in the Maidstone specimen, but had not pre
viously been recognized as such.      As the clavicles were long since
determined, the essential elements of the pectoral arch are now as
certained, and the author gives a restored outline of this important
part of the skeleton, based upon these data.
    Humerus.—A humerus three feet long, discovered by Mr. Fowles
tone in thelsle of Wight, has been ascertained by the author to belong
to the Iguanodon, from the presence of a small but corresponding
bone in the Maidstone fossil.     This bone, from its disproportionate
size in comparison with the femur with which it is collocated—-being
one-third shorter—was formerly assigned by Dr. Mantell to the fore
arm; but the large humerus from the Isle of Wight, which, except
in magnitude, is identical with that from Maidstone, leaves no doubt
upon the subject. It is now therefore, for the <U+FB01>rst time, ascertained,
that in the Iguanodon, as in many fossil and recent reptiles, the an
terior extremities were much shorter and less bulky than the poste
rior. The radius and ulna are still undetermined, but the author
states that there are some imperfect bones in his former collection,
now in the British Museum, which he thinks will be found to belong
to the fore-arm.
    Ilinder ex-tremities.--The colossal magnitude of the Iguanodon is
strikingly shown by some femora- and leg-bones recently discovered.
 One femur is 27 inches in circumference, and must have been 4 feet
8 or 10 inches in length; and a tibia, found with the same, is
4' feet long.
   Dermal scutes aml .spines.—The author <U+FB01>gures and describes se
veral dermal scutes and spines, and states that a microscopical exa
mination of the large angular bones of the Hylaeosaurus (Phil. Trans.
184'l, Pl. X. <U+FB01>g. 1), supposed by him to be ossi<U+FB01>ed dermal spines,
but which Professor Owen regarded as the abdominal extremities of
ribs, proves the correctness of his own opinion ; their structure being
identical with that of the acknowledged dermal scutes.
   In the summary which concludes the memoir, Dr. Mantell states
that the facts described con<U+FB01>rm in every important point the phy
siological inferences relating to the structure and habits of the Igua
nodon and Hylaeosaurus, enunciated in his former communications;
and thus, after the lapse of a quarter of a century, he concludes his
attempts to restore the skeletons of the colossal saurian herbivores,
of whose former existence a few water-worn teeth and fragments of
                               ii
bones were the only indications, when, in 1825, he <U+FB01>rst had the ho
nour to submit to the Royal Society a notice on the teeth of the
Iguanodon.                                                 .

Part II.     B Henry Iiennessy,               Communicated      by Major
Beamish, F.Il.S.
   In this communication the author states that, having in Part I.
(read to the Society in December 184-6) endeavoured, by general
izing the hypothesis on which is usually founded the theory of the
earth's <U+FB01>gure, not only to improve that theory, but also to establish
a secure basis for researches into the changes which may have taken
place, within and at the surface of the earth, during the epochs of
its geological history, his object here is to discover relations between
the interior structure of the earth and phenomena observed at its
surface, and also the effects of the reaction of the <U+FB02>uid nucleus, de
scribed in Part        I.,
                     upon the solid crust.      This memoir       divided    is
into sections. each containing     distinct investigation; and the state
                                          a
ment of the geological results      given at the end.

                        of   the                                contact.     of
   In the investigation of these pressures the earth       supposed to  is
consist of nucleus of <U+FB02>uid matter inclosed in solid shell, the inner

and both shell and nucleus are supposed to consist of strata varying
in density according to some unknown inverse law of the radii. The
pressure at the inner surface of the shell    conceived to be due to
                                                            is                         a

pressure, arising from the difference   in form of the surface of the
nucleus and inner surface of the shell. On these suppositions, simple
expressions for the pressure on any stratum of the nucleus and on
the shell's inner surface are deduced.                                            '
           II.     T/re Variation        of   Gravity at
                                             the earth's surface.
     The author  does not assume  in this investigation that the laws of
arrangement of the particles composing the shell and the nucleus
are necessarily the same; so that the expression which he obtains
for gravity at any point on the earth's surface, besides being       func         a
tion of the latitude of that point, and of the radii and ellipticities of
the shell's inner and outer surfaces, contains functions depending on
the constitution of the shell and nucleus.       He states that this ex
pression for gravity      not merely speculative, but that
                              is                                  will be    it
found to assist in explaining certain apparent anomalies detected by
observation in the variation of gravity at the earth's surface, as well
as in pointing out the limits assigned by observation to the thickness
of the crust.
           III.    The Laws         Density
                                   of              ofthe    Slwll and Nucleus.
  According to the author's views in      subsequent section,
                                                        a        ap               it
pears that the solidi<U+FB01>cation of the earth could not proceed simulta

                                       808
neously from the centre towards the surface, and from the surface
towards the centre.         He therefore, in determining the laws of den
sity of the shell and the nucleus, restricts his investigations to the
latter case, in which the solidi<U+FB01>cation proceeds from the surface to
wards the centre.
                 IV.   The Forms     of the Strata of the Shell.
     The author conceives a surface to exist which may be called the
 effective surface of separation of the perfect <U+FB02>uid of the nucleus and
the imperfectly <U+FB02>uid portion adhering to the shell, the form of which
 surface will depend on the pressures which the <U+FB02>uid exerts. As it
 may be shown that the pressure of the perfect <U+FB02>uid will not be con
 stant, the surface of separation w-ill tend to assume a form different
 from that of the inner surface of the shell.           If we admit that the
 matter composing        the nucleus becomes denser in assuming the solid
 state, the author concludes that the inner surface of each stratum
 added to the shell will be more oblate than its outer surface; and
 that thus the tendency will always be to render the inner surface of
 the shell more and more oblate.             He then deduces an expression
 for the ellipticity of the <U+FB02>uid surface.
             V. The principal Moments of Inertia of the Earth.
      From his investigations the        author concludes that, as the thick
 ness    of the shell increases, the    difference between the greatest and
 the least moment of inertia of         the earth also increases; which con
 clusion is independent of any           knowledge of the absolute laws of
 density of the earth's interior.
         VI. On    the existence  of a Solid Nucleus within    the Earth.
      The conclusion arrived at here is, that if a solid nucleus existed,
  as the pressure      on it would be continually diminishing, while its
  temperature would remain nearly constant, this nucleus, instead of
  increasing in magnitude, would tend to return to its original <U+FB02>uid
  state.
  VII.    The directions of the Fissures in the Shell which might      be pro
               duced by the action of the pressures in Section I.
      The author states that the tendency of the variable pressure is in
  the <U+FB01>rst instance to produce <U+FB01>ssures parallel to the equator; that
  when such a <U+FB01>ssure was once commenced the tendency would be to
  propagate it along a parallel of latitude, until the force of the ten
  sions became su<U+FB02>iciently lessened by the separation of the extended
  portion of the shell; and that similar <U+FB01>ssures would be formed si
   multaneously and symmetrically on each side of the equator.            Sub
   sequently,   as  may readily   be  deduced   from Mr.  Hopkins's investiga
   tions, the tendency will be to form <U+FB01>ssures at right angles to those
   previously existing.       If, however, the constant pressure were far
   greater   than  the  variable, the directions of the <U+FB01>ssures would be go
   verned chie<U+FB02>y by accidental causes; but if a <U+FB01>ssure commenced, it

                                    809
would continue to be propagated in the great circle coinciding with
its <U+FB01>rst direction, unless accidental causes should alter its course.
  VIII.   On t/lc erisluw of a Zone of least rlislurbanve in  (he S/wll.
    The author investigates analytically the position of this zone, and
from the results of his investigation. points out the conditions under
 which it will exist, and also the consequences that will follow from
its non-existence.
   IX. This section is devoted to the calculation of some of the con
stants contained in the formulae of the preceding sections.
    The following arc the geological deductions from the foregoing
investigations :—
    1. The stability of the axis of rotation of the earth will progress
ively incrcasc during the process of solidi<U+FB01>cation.
   2. By employing the values of the constants obtaincd in Section
IX., it appears that the tliickncss of the earth's crust cannot be less
than 18 miles. and cunnot cxcced 600 milcs.
   3. The earth's primitive cllipticity, when entirely <U+FB02>uid, was less
than its present ellipticity; but their difference may be neglected.
   4-. Ifa zone of least disturbance existed ucar the parallel of mean
pressure, the directions of great lines of elevation should he in ge
neral parnllel, or perpendicular to the equator.      Its non-existence
there, which observation 5i-i-nn.- to show, proves at least that the va
riable pressure did not predominate over the constant. Since, as yet,
Observation goes to prove that such a zone does not exist on the
earth's surface, we must provisionally conclude that the constant
pressure greatly predominated over the variable, and, consequentl ,
that the directions of the lines of elevation must be comparatively
arbitrary.
   5. That great friction and pressure exist at the surface of contact
of the nucleus and shell, is shown from the conclusions arrived at in
Section lV., combined with the important result obtained by Mr.
Hopkins in his second memoir on Physical Geology (Phil. Trans.
1s4o, p. 207).
   6. The amount of elastic gases given off from the surface of the
nucleus rapidly decreases as the thickness of the shell increases.
   7. The expression obtained for the variation of gravity shows that,
if the angular velocity of rotation of the earth remained unchanged,
the waters on its surface would tend to accumulate towards the
equator, for the increase of gravity, in going from the equator to the
poles, would be less according as the shel|'s thickness increased.

                                 “ An Account of the Aurora Borealis

                                    810
of the 17th of November 184-8." By the Rev. Charles F. Watkins.
Communicated by the Marquis of Northampton, V.P.R.S.
    The author states that, “ About half-past 7 P.M. the sky assumed
the appearance which it usually does immediately preceding the ac
tion of what are called the Northern Lights.         In the northern half
it was quite clear for about forty-<U+FB01>ve degrees from the meridian, of
a pale blue, and covered with a faint light, such as generally ushers
in the moon at her rising.       Towards the east and west this light
gradually diminished, and south of those cardinal points the dimness
as gradually   thickened.
    “ Soon after eight the coruscations began by the usual lambent
strokes of a shining <U+FB01>lmy matter, like the sudden shooting forth and
instantaneous retroceding of a serpent’s tongue.         They commenced
in the north-east, and shot upwards in an angle of about 70 degrees
of inclination towards the south, and to about 60 degrees in length,
more or less, leaving the sky clear to the north, and in a manner
gradually chasing the clouds, upon whose receding bounds they
glanced further to the south.
    “In a short time the same kind of electrical action commenced
in the north-west quarter of the heavens, and continued simultane
ously with that from the north-east, both increasing in rapidity, in
tensity and depth of colour; till at length an entire hemispherical
arch of crimson and purple, but with uneven edges, spanned the
heavens from east to west, and remained suspended there for seve
ral minutes. By degrees this arch broke up into separate masses of
highly and parti-coloured clouds, resembling those which are seen
<U+FB02>oating about after the setting of an ardent sun. Mean-while the
lighter coruscations continued,—now glancing upwards on the north
ern edges of the clouds, which were still slowly receding to the south,
and now shooting up beneath them as they steadily retreated.           At
the same time others of a redder hue played now alternately, and
now in union with them.
    “ About a quarter past nine an
                                         extraordinary phenomenon oc
curred, such as I never before witnessed; the zenith assumed the
appearance of a crimson coronary apex to distinct but connected
bands of various shades of crimson, green and purple, in which the
crimson prevailed, <U+FB02>owing down from thence like a canopy, encir
cling the upper portion of the heavens, which to me presented the
inside view of a ribbed and vaulted cupola.         By degrees this beau
tiful creation dissolved, and the body of" clouds, against which the
electrical forces seemed to have been in hostile pursuit, <U+FB02>ed away to
the south; the elementary action ceased: a silent calm returned,
and nothing but the tranquil light, still shining in the north, re
mained to indicate the recent scene.         The wind had blown with a
fresh but steady breeze from the north-west, during the continuance
of the phenomenon. '
     “ Without
                entering at present into any disquisition upon the causes,
 I will now state the meteorological results which I immediately an
 ticipated and have seen to follow these atmospheric phenomena.
     “ I have observed,
                        and have stated my observations for some years

                                     811
past, that the certain result of all meteoric coruscations and irides
cences in the sky, is a fall of rain, snow or hai|,—on this general prin
ciple, that the condensation of the crystalline particles of <U+FB02>oating
vapours which ensues upon electrical action, must be followed by pre
cipitation; and these coruscations and iridescences are both the
re<U+FB02>ected evidences of such condensation of crystalline matter, and
therefore the harbingers of such precipitation.       lt is the case with
solar and lunar rainbows, falling stars, mock-suns, halos, lightning,
aurora, and that unde<U+FB01>ned pearly lustre which sometimes appears
in the neighbourhood of the sun.
   “Accordingly, on the following morning, Saturday the 18th, I
found the barometer had sunk considerably, and the wind had veered
round from north-west to south-west, against the course of the sun,
both in general, and especially when united, the forerunners of rain.
Accordingly at 2 o'clock e..\|. a smart shower came on in Northamp
ton, but was of short duration.       At 9 mu. a heavier shower was ex
perienced at Brixworth; and in the course of the night, but I cannot
say at what hour, I was awakened to a still heavier shower; but the
quantity of rain that had fallen did not seem to have affected the
ground much on the following morning, and therefore I conclude
that it was not great.
   “ Sunday the 19th was <U+FB01>ne and bright; the wind went up to the
westward, and the barometer rose rapidly—a general indication of
an early change.      Towards morning of Monday the 20th, another
shower fell, and the wind went back to the south-west with a falling
barometer.     In such cases I generally <U+FB01>nd that rain ensues about
midday,   or at  least when the wind and sun meet in the south-west.
But on this occasion it continued blowing strong all the day, and
for some time in the night with increased violence.        But at last the
wind fell, and was succeeded for awhile by heavy rain, thus verify
ing my anticipations on this particular occasion, and the general
theory which I have discussed."

       " Examination of the Proximate Principles of some of the        Li
chens."—Part II. By John Stenhouse, Esq., F.R.S.
                          G'1/rqahora pustulafa.
   The author   states that this lichen, which is the “ Tripe de Roche"
of  the Canadian hunters, has been long employed by the manufac
turers of archil, though the quantity of colouring matter contained
in it is by no means considerable, being little more than a twelfth
of that in the Roccella Mmztagnei.         The Gyrophora pustulata, on
which the author operated, was brought from Norway, where it is

                                                                '
                                     812
 annually collected in considerable quantity for the manufacture of
 archil. The colouring principle was extracted by maceration with
 milk of lime, and was precipitated in a gelatinous state by neutral
 izing the lime solution by muriatic acid, precisely in the way so fre
 quently described in the author's former paper (Phil. Trans. 184-8).
 The precipitate was gently dried, and then dissolved in hot spirits
 of wine. On the cooling of the liquid, the colouring principle was
 deposited in small soft crystals, which by digestion with animal
 charcoal and repeated crystallizations were rendered quite colour
 less.   This principle, to which the author has given the name of
  Gyrzy<U+FB02>zor-ic acid, is almost insoluble in either hot or cold water, and
 is also much less soluble in hot spirits of wine than either orsellic,
 erythric, or any of the analogous colouring principles.      It is neutral
 to test-paper, and possesses no saturating power, as the smallest
 quantity of an alkali gives its solutions an alkaline reaction. Gyro
phoric acid strikes a bright red fugitive colour with hypochlorite of
lime; and when liiacerated with a solution of ammonia, it is slowly
 converted into a purplish-red colouring matter, similar to that
 yielded by the analogous acids under the same circumstances. When
 subjected to analysis, the formula of gyrophoric acid was found to
 be Cae H18 O15
     Gyrophoric acid when boiled for some hours in alcohol yields an
 ether similar in appearance and properties to the erythric and leca.
noric ethers ; its formula is C, H5 O + C36 Hm 0,5.
    Gyrophoric acid unites with the alkalies and metallic oxides, but
 the compounds which it forms possess little stability and cannot be
 procured of an uniform composition.
                            Lecanora tartarea.
    This lichen, like the G3/rophora pustulata, has been employed
from an early period in the manufacture of archil. It is found in
considerable abundance in the hilly districts of the northern parts
both of Scotland and Ireland.         The lichen on which the author
operated came from Norway.           He found it also to contain gyro
phoric acid, in much about the same quantity as the Gyrophom
pustulata.     This fact was established by the analysis of the acid
itself and ofits ether compound.

he described a crystalline body obtained by cautiously adding bro
mine to an aqueous solution of orcine.           In this second part he
states that, in the ' Comptes Rendus’ for August of the same year,
Messrs. Laurent and Gerhardt describe the very same compound
obtained in precisely the same way, without even hinting that it had
been previously discovered.       These gentlemen however give a dif
ferent formula for the compound, viz. CH H,-Br, O4, or orcine in
which three equivalents of hydrogen are replaced by three equiva
lents of bromine; and the author is disposed to adopt this formula,

as, on repeating the analysis of the compound, he found that he had
somewhat over-estimated the amount of bromine contained in                         it,

   2. “General     Methods in Analysis, for the resolution of Linear
Equations    in Finite Differences and Linear Differential Equations."
By   Charles  James   Hargreave, Esq., LL.B., F.R.S. &c.
   The investigations presented in this paper consist of two parts ;
the <U+FB01>rst offers a solution, in a quali<U+FB01>ed sense, of the general linear
equation in <U+FB01>nite differences; and the second gives an analysis of
the general linear differential equation with rational factors, so far
as concerns its solution in series.
   The author observes that there does not at present exist any ge
neral method of solving linear equations in <U+FB01>nite differences of an
 order higher than the <U+FB01>rst; and that with reference to such equa
tions of the <U+FB01>rst order, we obtain insu<U+FB02>icient forms which are intel
ligible only when the independent variable is an integer. It is in
this quali<U+FB01>ed sense that the solutions proposed in this paper are to
 be taken; so that the <U+FB01>rst part of these investigations may be con
sidered as an extension of this form of solution from the general
equation of the <U+FB01>rst order to the general equation of the nth order.
   In the second part, the author points out a method by which the
results of the process above indicated may be made to give solutions
 of those forms of linear differential equations whose factors do not
contain irrational or transcendental functions of the independent
variable, or contain them only in an expanded form.
   This object is effected by means of the theorem, relative to the
interchange of the symbols of operation and of quantity, propounded
by the author in a former memoir published in the Philosophical
Transactions (Part I. for 1848, p. 31).      It is one of the properties
of this singular analytical process that it instantaneously converts a
linear equation in <U+FB01>nite differences into a linear differential equation;
so that whenever the former is soluble, the latter is soluble also,
provided the result be interpretable ; a condition satis<U+FB01>ed when the
functions employed are rational algebraical functions.
   Notwithstanding the quali<U+FB01>ed character of the solutions previously
obtained forlinearequations in <U+FB01>nite differences, the solutions obtained
from them by this process are free from all restriction. The solutions
in series can be Written down at once from the equation itself, inas
much as each series has its own independent scale or law of relation ;
and no di<U+FB02>iculties arise from the appearance of equalorimaginary roots
in the equation determining the incipient terms of the series. These
circumstances do indeed cause a certain variation of form; but they do
not compel us to resort to any special process in each individual case.
   The perfect separation and independence of the scales, or laws of
relation of the series enables the author to discuss the characters of
the series with reference to their convergency or divergency, and to
classify these equations into sets having peculiar and distinguishing
properties in regard to this subject.
   The <U+FB01>rst set includes those equations whose solutions can always
be found in convergent series of ascending powers of the independ
ent variable; and if in such case the equation be solved in series of
descending powers (which can be done by this process), those series
are certainly always divergent.

                                        815
   The distinguishing marks of this clase of equations are,-that the
factor of the highest differential coe<U+FB02>icient contains one term only;
and that (the terms being arranged in an ascending order) when
this term is zr, the factor of the next differential coe<U+FB02>icient must
not contain a term lower than .1-I—', the neirt not lower than 1"’,
and so on to the end.
   The second set includes those nations whose solutions can always
be found in convergent series of gacending powers of the independ
ent variable; and if in such case the equation be solved in series of
ascending powers, they are always dirvrgent.
   The distinguishing marks of this class of equations are,—that the
factor of the highest differential coe<U+FB02>icient contains one term onl ;
and that when this term is .2", the next factor must stop at 1"—',            the
next at 2"’, and so on to the end.
    The third set includes equations whose solutions can be found in
series ofawcnding powers which for some values of the independent
variable are convergent, and for other values divergent; and whose
solutions can also be found in series of descending powers which are
divergent for all values for which the other series are convergent, and
convergent for all values for which the other series are divergent.
    The distinguishing marks of this class of equations are,—that the
factor of the highest differential coe<U+FB02>icient contains two terms only,
and that with reference to the <U+FB01>rst of such terms the equation                is
under the restriction mentioned with regard to the <U+FB01>rst set, and that
with reference to the second of such terms      it   is under the restriction
mentioned with regard to the second set.
    The fourth set includes equations whose solutions are or may be
divergent for some values of z, both in the ascending and descend
ing series. In some cases, the ascending series            necessarily diver
                                                          is
gent,   and the  descending   series convergent   or  divergent  according to
the value of 1'; in other cases, the descending series              is
                                                                   necessarily
 divergent, and the ascending series convergent or divergent accord
 ing to value; and in the remaining cases, both series are convergent
 or divergent according to value, but not so as to be necessarily com
plementary to each other in this respect.
    The distinguishing marks of this class are,—that the <U+FB01>rst factor
 may contain more than two terms; and that either the restriction of
 the <U+FB01>rst set is  transgressed with reference to the highest term, or the
 restriction of the second set         transgrcssed with reference to the
                                       is
 lowest term.      In this set the divergency arising from value          of
                                                                         is   a
 <U+FB01>nite character; and, as the series approach without limit to ordi
 nary recurring series, there      is a probability that the passage from
 convergency to divergency        isnot attended with danger.
    The <U+FB01>fth set includes equations whose solutions, whether in as
 cending or descending series, are always necessa11'/1/ divergent.
    The distinguishing mark of this class      is,  that  ittransgresses both
 the restrictions to one or other of which the last set        subjected. In
                                                               is
 this case the divergency    is  in<U+FB01>nite, and appears to be of an unma
 nageable character.
    The analogy of the process leads to       a    presumption, that in all

                                      816
  cases of divergency, above referred to, the corresponding convergent

                                     “ On the Meteorology of the Lake
 District of Cumberland and Westmoreland."             By John Fleteher

    .S., &c.                                       -
     This paper contains the results of meteorological observations
 made during 184s8, similar to those made in the same district in
 preceding years, which were last year communicated to the Society.
 On these results, the author remarks that the fall of rain in the lake
 district, during the year 18418, greatly exceeds the amount in any
 other year since the register was commenced in 1844; and that
 there is a similar excess with reference to the number of wet days.
 The total depth of rain, in 184-8, at Seathwaite, the wettest station,
 was l60'89 inches; and of this quantity, 1M'32 inches fell in the
six months, February, July, August, October, November and De
cember.       In February there fell the unprecedented quantity 30'55
 inches.
    The mountains <U+FB02>anking the lake-district valleys increase in alti
tude with great regularity towards the head or eastern extremity of
the vale, and it appears that it is there that the greatest depth of
rain is invariably found.      The amount increases rapidly as the sta-
tions recede from the sea, and towards the head of the valley the
incremental ratio is exceedingly great. At Loweswater, Buttermere
and Gatesgarth, about two miles apart in the same line of valley,
               of rain were respectively 76 inches, 98 inches and 133'5
thehdepths
inc es.
    From the observations of the thermometer, the author concludes
that the climate in the mountain valleys in this district is milder and
more equable, not only than in the open country in their immediate
vicinity, but also than in that considerably to the south. This he
attributes to the lakes giving out during the winter the heat absorbed
by them in the summer, and to the radiation from the rocky moun
tain breasts in the valleys, but principally to the heat evolved in a
sensible form by the condensation of enormous volumes of vapour.
    Last summer a pair of Butherford’s self-registering thermometers

                                  817
were stationed by the author on the summit of Sca-Fell Pike. He
states that from the maximum thermometer no correct readings
could be obtained; but that the minimum gave the following :—
July,22°: August,'24-°; September, 18°; October, —6°; November,
 —6°; December,-9”.      It appears that on the night between the 2nd
and 8rd of January the minimum thermometer indicated the extra
ordinary low temperature -34-° Fahr.: at the same date a naked
thermometer on grass at Whitehaven fell to -l-4°, and one on raw
wool to —-2°'8.
   The author states that the results obtained from the mountain
gauges during the last year, are in strict accordance with those of
the two preceding years, and thus con<U+FB01>rm the correctness of the
conclusion drawn from them in his former paper, “that the quantity
of rain increases from the valley upwards to an altitude of about
2000 feet, above which it begins to diminish." He does not, how
ever, by any means infer that the law which appears to regulate
the distribution of rain in the mountain district of Cumberland will
equally apply to every similar locality.

         The   EARL OF ROSSE,         President, in the Chair.
   A  paper was read, entitled “A Report    upon further Observations
of the Tides of the English Channel made by order of the Lords
Commissioners of the Admiralty in 184-8, with remarks upon the
Laws by which the Tidal Streams of the English Channel and Ger
man Ocean appear to be governed."         By Captain F. W. Beechey,
R.N., F.R.S. Communicated by the Lords Commissioners of the
Admiralty.
   The author commences this report by observing, that the result
of the observations upon the tides in the English Channel, made in
the course of the summer of 184-8, had con<U+FB01>rmed in a satisfactory
manner the view he had taken of the tidal phenomena of the chan
nel, in the report communicated to the Royal Society last year, and
printed in the Philosophical Transactions (Part l. 184-8), namely,
that there is a meeting and a separation of the streams between
Alderney and the Start: that the whole space between the Start
and Scilly is under the joint in<U+FB02>uence of the channel and of<U+FB01>ng
streams: that from the vicinity of the Start to the vicinity of Hast
ings the stream runs true up and down the channel; and moreover
that this stream throughout turns nearly simultaneously with the
time of high and low water on the shore at the virtual head of the
tide, which he places in the vicinity of Dover; and lastly, that the
streams which meet off the Start are turned down into the Gulf of
St. Malo, and vice versd.

                                          818
  He then takes a comprehensive view of the tidal system of the
English Channel and German Ocean together, and considering them
as one great canal open at both extremities to the free admission         of
a great tidal wave, which might be supposed to meet and form a.
combined or stationary wave (art.l87, Encyclopedia Metropolitana),
he infers that in such a case, there ought to be in the eastern hagf
of such a canal, a recurrence of the phenomena which had been
found to exist in the western               He proceeds to explain that,
from a valuable series of observations in the German Ocean by Cap
tain Washington, R.N., and other authorities, it does appear that,
inverting the direction of the stream, there is a correspondence of
phenomena in almost every respect: that the o<U+FB02>ing and channel
streams meet off Lynn, as offthe Gulf of St. Malo, at the same hours,
and at the same distance nearly from the virtual head of the tide:
that the phase of the tide at Lynn corresponds with the phase of the
tide at Jersey: that there is an increased rise there also; and that
from the meeting of the tides off Lynn to the meeting of the streams
off Dover, there is, as in the former case, a stream which turns nearly
simultaneously with the high and low water on the shore at Dover;
the incoming and outgoing streams coinciding with the rising and
falling water there; and that there             is,
                                            in fact,   complete identity of
                                                           a
tidal phenomena in both parts of the supposed canal; of this an
illustrationis given in two plans.
    The author states that the meeting of the waves which enter the
canal at opposite points does not occasion          stationary point of per
                                                      a
manent slack-water, but one wave alternately prevails, so that the
point of slack-water oscillates between Ramsgate and Hastings nearly,
and occasions an inversion of the stream at about two hours before
that of the true stream of the channel. He thinks             convenient for
                                                               it
the purposes of navigation to consider this an intermediate stream,
although in reality    it   only
                            is      shifting of the place of the meeting
                                      a
and divergence of the opposite channel streams.            To illustrate this
part of the paper table
                   a          given, in which the courses of the streams
                                 is
in various compartments of the supposed canal are given at every
hour of the tide.
    The author thinks this system of tides su<U+FB02>iciently established for
the purposes of navigation, but with regard to the perfectly simul
taneous motion of the stream throughout the stationary wave, he           is
of opinion that nothing but simultaneous observations will be con
sidered satisfactory to science upon such point, and these -he hopes
                                                      a
will be supplied by the observations of the ensuing summer.
    The advantage of referring the motion of the stream to a standard
such as that of the Dover tide-table will,        appears, be sensibly felt
                                                      it
by the mariner, who will now have his course through the moving
waters of the channel rendered simple and plain, instead of being
perplexed with unsatisfactory references, and with calculations which
in too many instances,      it believed, have caused the set of the tide
                                 is
to be wholly disregarded.
    The want of standard to which desultory observations, made in
                 a

                                    8|!)
various parts of the channel, could be referred, the author believes
to have been the occasion of several erroneous iinpressions of a ten
dency somewhat dangerous to navigation. As such he considers the
following :——that the tide in all parts of the channel partakes of a
rotatory motion and is never at rest, and that a ship's reckoning will
never be far out in consequence, as she will never be carried far in
one direction: that n vessel arriving oif the Start at low water
could, by sailing seven or eight knots an hour, carry ten or eleven
hours’ favourable tide to Beachy Head: that in the German Ocean
the stream sets north-east on one side, whilst it is running south
 west on the other: that there is a tide and half-tide in the channel,
so that when the stream has done in shore, by standing out, a ship
will carry the stream three hours longer, or nine hours in one direc
tion : and lastly, that the stream runs strongest at high and low water
 throughout the channel, and is motionless at half-tide.
     These impressions do not appear to be justi<U+FB01>ed by the observa
 tions. The stream, when not diverted by rivers or estuaries, appears
 to run true up and down the channel, and from side to side nearly;
 between the Start and Hastings, in the English Channel, scarcely
 varying a point for nearly <U+FB01>ve hours; and in the German Ocean for
 about four hours; the varying of the stream there being due, in the
 author's opinion, to the in<U+FB02>uence of the Thames and the rivers of
 Holland. Al the stream turns nearly with the high and low water
 on the shore at Dover, there cannot be nine hours' current in one
 direction.    With regard to the time at which the stream attains its
 greatest strength, he states that all the observations agree in <U+FB01>xing
 it at about half-tide (Dover).
     The erroneous impressions above mentioned, the author considers
 have arisen from the times of the observations when made having
  been referred to the times of high water at places differing two or
  three hours from the time of high water at the head of the wave, or
  from an early popular opinion that the turn of the stream in the
  oiiing coincides with the rise and fall of the water on the shore.
      The paper concludes with some remarks on the forms of the tide
  wave between Cromarty and the Land's End, which are exhibited in
  two plans at every hour of the tide, obtained from a combination of
  the ranges and establishments of Dr. Whewell with those of M.
   Chazallon ; and attention is particularly drawn to the relative lengths
  of the stationary wave and the waves by which it is generated ; the
 former wave being only halfthe dimensions of the latter. These forms
   are exhibited on a reduced scale, but much exaggerated in height,
   and afford a comparison between the curve assumed by the stationary
   wave and that which the waves would have assumed had they rolled
   on in an uninterrupted course.

                                  “ On the Reduction of the Thermo
metrical Observations made at the Apartments of the Royal Society
from the year 1774- to 1781, and from the year 1787 to 1846."        By
James Glaisher, Esq. of the Royal Observatory, Greenwich.          Com
municated by John Lee, Esq., LL.D., F .R.S. &c.
    In this paper, the author states that he has examined all the ther
mometrical observations which have been made at the Apartments of
the Royal Society, with the view of ascertaining whether the diurnal
variations at different epochs were in accordance with those which
he had determined from the Greenwich observations, and which are
contained in his paper published in the Philosophical Transactions
for 1848. The result of this investigation was, that the corrections
contained in the tables in his former paper were applicable to the
observations of all the years since 1774.
    The author is led from these examinations to the conclusion,—
 lst, that the instruments used have been uniformly good; Qndly,
that the observations have been faithfully recorded as read from the
instruments; Srdly, that the readings have been taken with great care
with respect to the times stated; and lastly, that the observations
were well-worth the necessary labour of reduction. He <U+FB01>nds, how
ever, that some of the more recent observations of the self-register
ing instruments are liable to some uncertainty.
    Having satis<U+FB01>ed himself that the observations were well-worth
any amount of labour that might be bestowed on them, the author
was anxious to reduce them to a useful form, but, in consequence of
the great amount of work that would be required for the reduction
of so extensive a series, he for some time hesitated to enter upon
this labour.    Finding however that there was a demand for the re
sults of trustworthy observations extending backwards many years,
and having, besides, the hope of connecting the Greenwich series of
observations with these, he determined to perform the work. He
states that the mean temperature of every month was determined in
 the <U+FB01>rst instance from the observations which had been made during
 the day, and secondly, from the observations of the self-registering

                                     821
 instruments. Tables are appended to the paper, showing the monthly,
 quarterly and yearly nu-un temperatures, with those of groups of
 years, and other tables exhibiting the departure of every individual
 result from the mean of all.
     The author concludes by stating, that hitherto the mean tempera
 ture at Somerset House has been estimated u great deal too high.
 He does not here enter into the investigation as to whether the tem
 perature as now determined is too high for the geographical position
 and elevation of Somerset House, but proposes to do so, in a paper
 he is preparing with the view of connecting the Somerset House
 with the Greenwich series, and of bringing up all the results to the
present time.      He hopes also, at some future time, to present results
 from the barometrical observations arranged in u similar manner.

    The following communication was read :—" Remarks on M. Dc la
Rive's Theory for the Physical Explanation of the Causes which
produce the Diurnal VariutionIf the Magnetic Declination," in n.

       M!  nuns.  Sin,                           Woolwich, April I6, 1849.
    The Annalee    de Chimie ct de Physique for March last contains a
 letter from M. De la Rive to M. Arago, in which a theory is pro
 posed,   professing to explain on physical principles the general
 phenomena of the diurnal variation of the magnetic declination, and,
in particular, the phenomena observed at St. Helena and at the Cape
 of Good Hope, described in a paper communicated by me to the
 Royal Society in 1847. and which has been honoured with a place
 in the Philosophical Transactions.
    Although I doubt not that the inadequacy of the theory proposed
by M. De la Rive for the solution of this interesting problem will be
 at once recognised by those who have carefully studied the facts
which have become known to us by means of the exact methods of
investigation adopted in the magnetic observatories of recent esta
 blishment, yet there is danger that the names of De la Rive and
Arago, held in high and deserved estimation as authorities on such
subjects, attached to a theory, which moreover claims reception on
the ground of its accordance with “ well-ascertained facts" and
 “ with
         principles of physics positively established," may operate
prejudicially in checking the inquiries which may be in progress in
 other quarters into the causes which really occasion the phenomena
in question; I have thought it desirable therefore to point out, in a
very brief communication, some of the important particulars in which
M. De la Rive’: theory fails to represent correctly the facts which it
                                                             gs

                                   822
professes to explain, and others which appear to me to be altogether
at variance with, and opposed to it.
   1. M. Desla Rive’s theory, in a few words, is as follows :—
   In consequence of the inequalities of temperature in the higher
and lower strata of the atmosphere, electric currents are generated,
which in the higher regions proceed from the equator to the poles,
and return at the surface of the earth from the poles to the equator;
the return current causing in the northern hemisphere the north end
of the magnet to deviate in the one direction, and in the southern
hemisphere in the opposite direction; the deviation being at any
given place greatest at the hour (about 1h'30 am.) when the differ
ence of temperature in the upper and lower strata of the atmosphere
is greatest, and of course increasing until that hour, and subse
quently diminishing.
   That the north end of the magnet does thus deviate in the fore
noon towards the west in the northern hemisphere, and towards the
east in the southern hemisphere, and return in both cases in the
opposite directions in the afternoon, were facts known before the
establishment of the magnetic observatories; but M. De la Rive’s
explanation of them appears to have been suggested; and its appro
priateness, as he considers, is shown, by its a<U+FB02>irmed accordance with
the remarkable peculiarity in the phenomena made known to us by
the observations at the Magnetic pbservatory at St. Helena, and
communicated to the Royal Society in the paper referred to.       This
peculiarity is brie<U+FB02>y as follows: the deviation which constitutes the
principal part of the diurnal variation at St. Helena is not uniform
in its direction throughout the year; in one part of the year it is to
the west, and in the other part of the year to the east; and conse
quently during certain months of the year the movement of the
magnet is in the contrary direction to that which prevails at the
same hours during the other months of the year.
   Now St. Helena is situated within the tropics, and M. De la Rive
infers from his theory that in all places so situated, the diurnal va
riation should be in one direction when the sun’s declination is north
of the latitude of the place, and in the contrary direction when the
sun's declination is south of the latitude of the place : and hence he
too hastily concludes that his theory accords with the characteristics
of the diurnal variation at St. Helena. When however the facts are
more closely examined, it is seen that they do by no means accord
with M. De la Rive's supposition.
   That it may be quite clear that I do not misapprehend either M.
De la Rive’s theory, or his supposition in regard to the facts at St.
Helena, I subjoin his own expressions, which convey his meaning,
                                          do, with most commendable
    that gentleman's writings generally
as
precision.
   The <U+FB01>rst extract de<U+FB01>nes the limit which, according to his theory,
should separate the electric currents proceeding respectively from
 each of the poles to the equator; and should consequently separate
 the parts of the globe in which the diurnal variation is in the one
 dlmctiolh from the parts in which it is in the opposite direction;

                                      $123
whilst the second extract describes what       he believes to be the facts
of the phenomena at St. Helena.
                                  Extract  l.
    " La limite   qui sépare les régions occupées par chucun de ccs
deux grands courants n'est pas l'équateur propremcnt dit, car elle
doit étre variable : elle est, d'après la théorie que jc développc, celui
des paralleles compris entre les tropiqucs, qui ale solcil ii son zénith;
elle change par conséquent chaque jour."
                                 Ertract 2.
    “ A St. Helène, la variation diurne       a lieu à l’oucst tant que le
soleil est an sud   de l'ile, h l'est des quc le sulcil est an nord.   En
effet, dans le premier cas, ainsi quc j'ai remarqué plus haut, St.
Héléne doit faire partie de la region dans laquelle les courants élcc
triques vont sur la surface de la tcrrc du pole boréal aux régions
équatoriales; et, dans le second cas, de la région dans laquelle ces
courants vont du pole austral vers l'équateur."
    Whoever will be at the pains to refer to the paper printed in
the Philosophical    Transactions, describing the phenomena at St.
Helena, or to the volume containing the details of the observations
on the diurnal variation in each month during the <U+FB01>ve years in
which hourly observations were maintained day and night at' that
observatory, will perceive,—on evidence which admits of no uncer
tainty,—that the two portionsof the year in which the diurnal variation
is in contrary directions at that island, are not determined, as M. De
la Rive supposes, by the declination of the sun relatively to the la
titude of the place, but by the declination of the sun relatively to the
eqainoctial line. The sun is vertical at St. Helena, passing to the
south in the <U+FB01>rst week of November; and again when passing to the
north in the <U+FB01>rst week of February: consequently the two portions
into which the year is thus divided, are respectively the one of three,
and the other of nine months’ duration; but the actual portions in
which the contrary diurnal movements of the magnets take place at
St. Helena are of equal duration, and consist of six months and sir
months ; the dividing periods coinciding unequivocally, not with the
sun's verticality at St. Helena, but with the cquinoxes.
   2. But if M. De la Rive’s explanation be thus inconsistent in respect
to the dates of the transition periods of the phenomena at St. Helena,
it must be regarded as altogether at variance with, and opposed to,
the phenomena described in the same paper at the Cape of Good
Hope, where also they have been observed at the Magnetic Obser
vatory at that station with an exactness which leaves no uncertainty
whatsoever as to the facts themselves. The Cape is not situated within
the tropics; its latitude is 33° 56' south; the sun is consequently
throughout the year well to the north of its zenith; and therefore,
according to M. De la Rive’s theory, the deviations should be in one
and the same direction throughout the year. But the fact is not so;
for the same contrariety in the direction of the diurnal variation at
different portions of the year takes place at the Cape as at St. He

                                             r
                                     824
lena; the two portions of the year in which the opposite phenomena
 prevail, are also identical at the two stations ; and at both the
 change in the direction of the deviation takes place when the sun
 crosses the equinoctial line ; the deviation being to the west at both
 stations when the sun is in the northern signs, and to the east when
he is in the southern signs.
     3. But in considering a theory which comes before us, claiming
 the high distinction of a<U+FB02>brding a physical explanation of facts which
 are known to us by well-assured observation, we ought not to con
 <U+FB01>ne our view to those points only for which it professes to supply
the explanation: these are certainly tests as far as they go ;—and in
 the present instance the conclusion from them is not favourable to the
 theory proposed ;—but we should also notice the de<U+FB01>ciencies of the
 theory    ; or those points wherein  it neither furnishes, nor attempts to
 furnish, explanations of circumstances which are certainly amongst
 the most remarkable facts of the case. They may be possibly amongst
 the most di<U+FB02>icult to explain ; but no physical theory can be regarded
 as meeting the facts which does not at least attempt an‘ explanation of
 them. I may name as the most prominent in interest amongst these
 the striking fact, that the Cape of Good Hope should be one of the
 stations at which this remarkable peculiarity, of a contrariety of move
 ment at different periods of the year, takes place.
     It is known that it does not occur at places situated in correspond
 ing latitudes north of the geographical equator; at Algiers, for ex
 ample,—which is moreover nearly in the same geographical meridian
 as the Cape, and where the magnetic inclination is nearly the same
 towards the north as is the case at the Cape towards the south.          It
 may be quite correct perhaps to view the corresponding phenomena
 at St. Helena and the Cape as those belonging to magneticall1/-equa
 torial stations; but they are certainly not those peculiar to or cha
 racteristic of geographicaZly-equatorial stations, which would be the
  condition in M. De la Rive’s theory.        There are thus two parts in
  the problem which await a physical explanation; on the one hand,
  the cause is required of the contrariety of movement, as well as of
 the times at which the different movements occur, the latter having
  obviously a dependence on the sun’s position whether in the northern
  or the southern signs; and on the other hand, the cause must be
  shown why certain stations are thus affected and others not: a di
  stinction which obviously does not depend on situation in regard to
  the geographical equator or to the tropical divisions of the globe.
      I have myself been led to infer that the peculiarity in question re
  sults from and is indicative of proximity to the line of least mag
  neticforce, regarded as physically the separating line on the surface
  of the globe between the northern and southern magnetic hemi
  spheres; under this explanation the peculiarity would be strictly a
  magnetically-equatorial    one.
      It results from the present position of the four points of maximum
  intensity at the surface of the earth, that the intermediate line of
   least intensity departs considerably in the Southern Atlantic from the
   middle or geographically-equatorial     portion of the globe, and passes

                                   895
between    the Cape and St. Helena, and consequently not far from
either of those stations.
   As far as 1 have yet been able to examine, l have found that the
same remarkable peculiarity does exist at all other stations which
are near this line, and at none which are remote from it. But
however this may be, the accordance of the phenomena at the Cape
of Good Hope and St. Helena, and their dissimilarity from those at
other stations is a well-ascertained fact, of far too much bearing and
importance to be passed without notice; and we may safely anti
cipate that its cause must occupy a prominent place in the theory
which shall be ultimately   received, as afffording an adequate solution
of the problem of the diurnal variation.
                   Believe me, my dear Sir, sincerely yours,

   The following papers were read :—
   1. An appendix to a paper
                               “ On the Variations of the
                                                          Acidity of
the Urine in the State of Health"—“ On the In<U+FB02>uence of Medicines
on the Acidity of the Urine."   By Henry Bence Jones, M.D., M.A.,
F.R.S. &c.
   The variations of the acidity of the urine in the state of health
having been shown in the original paper, and the effect of dilute
sulphuric acid also traced; in this appendix, the in<U+FB02>uence of caustic
potash, of tartaric acid, and of tartrate of soda, on the acidity of the
urine is determined.
   One ounce of liquor potassie, speci<U+FB01>c gravity 1072, was taken in
distilled water, in three days.   It hindered the acidity of the urine
from rising, long after digestion, to the height to which (from com
parative experiments) it otherwise would have done; but          it,   by
                                                                      no
means, made the urine constantly alkaline; nor did        it  hinder the
variations produced    by  the state of the stomach from being very
evident.
   854- grains of dry and pure tartaric acid dissolved in water were
taken in three days.     The conclusion from the observations       that
                                                                   is
this quantity increased the acidity of the urine, but during that time
it did not render the effect of the stomach on the reaction of the
urine less apparent than when no acid was taken; and therefore,
that this quantity of tartaric acid, during this time, does not produce
so much effect on the reaction of the urine as the stomach does.
   Tartrate of potash in large doses produces the most marked effect
on the alkalescence of the urine.       I20 grains of pure dry tartrate
of potash dissolved in four ounces of distilled water made the urine
alkaline in thirty-<U+FB01>ve minutes.      In two hours the allialescence had

                                    826
disappeared, but after the next meal the effect of the tartrate of
potash was again apparent.    10 drachms of tartrate of potash taken
in three days produced but  little, if any effect, on the acidity of the
urine twenty-four hours after the last dose was taken.
   2. “ On the direct production of Heat by Magnetism." By
W. R. Grove, Esq., M.A., V.P.R.S. &c.
  The author recites the experiments of Messrs. Marrian, Beatson,
Wertheim and De la Rive on the phenomenon made known some
years ago, that soft iron when magnetized emitted a sound or musical
note.
   He also mentions    an experiment       of his own, published in January
.1845, where a tube was <U+FB01>lled         with the liquid in which magnetic
  oxide had been prepared, and surrounded by a coil; this showed,
 to a spectator looking through         it,   aconsiderable increase of the
  transmitted light when the coil was electrized.
     All these experiments the author considers go to prove that when
 ever magnetization takes place     a   change    isproduced in the molecu
 lar condition of the substances magnetized        ; and
                                                       it   occurred to him
  that, if  this be the case,     species oi' molecular friction might be
 expected to obtain, and     by a such molecular friction heat might be
 produced.
     In proving the correctness of these conjectures dif<U+FB01>culties pre
 sented themselves, the principal of which was, that with electro
 magnets the heat produced by the electrized coil surrounding them,
 might be expected to mask any heat developed by the magnetism.
 This interference, after several experiments, the author considers
 he entirely eliminated by surrounding the poles of an electro-magnet
 with cisterns of water, and by this means and by covering the
 keeper with <U+FB02>annel, and other expedients, he was enabled to produce
 ina    cylindrical soft-iron keeper when rapidly magnetized and de
 magnetized in opposite directions  a    riseof temperature several degrees
 beyond    that  which obtained  in  the  electro-magnet, and which there
 fore could not have been due to conduction or radiation of heat from
such magnet. A series of experiments with this apparatus         is   given.
     By <U+FB01>lling the cisterns with water colder than the electro-magnet,
the latter could be cooled by the water while the keeper was being
heated by the magnetization.
     The author subsequently obtained distinct thermic effects in        a
bar of soft iron placed opposite to a rotating permanent steel mag
net, using delicate thermo-electrical apparatus placed at his disposal
             a
by Mr. Gassiot.
     To eliminate the effects of magneto-electrical currents, the author
then made similar experiments with non-magnetic metals and with
silico-borate of lead, substituted for the iron keepers, but no thermic
                                    r
effects were developed.
    He then tried the magnetic metals nickel and cobalt, and obtained
thermic effects with both, and in proportion to their magnetic in
tensity.
    Some questions of theory suggested by the above experiments

                                  827
and relating to the rationale of the action of what are termed 'the
imponderables' and to terrestrial magnetism, are then brie<U+FB02>y dis
 cussed, and the author concludes by stating that he considers his
 experiments prove satisfactorily, that whenever a bar of iron or
 other magnetic metal is magnetized, its temperature is raised.

 the American minister :—
        MY DEAR SIR,                      3 Connaught Place, June 8, 1849.
     I have the honour to inform you, that at the annual meeting of
 the Royal Society, held the 7th inst., a communication was read
 from Admiral Sir Francis Beaufort, in which he apprised the So
 ciety that the American Government had nobly undertaken to send
 an expedition in search of Sir John Franklin.         Upon which a vote
 of thanks was moved by Sir Charles Lemon, seconded by Lord
 Northampton, and carried with the utmost enthusiasm, expressive
 of the gratitude of the Royal Society to the American'Government,
 and of their deep sense of the kind and brotherly feeling which had
 prompted so liberal an act of humanity.       Allow me to assure you,
 that it is peculiarly gratifying to me to have the honour of being
 the humble instrument in conveying to you the thanks of the Royal
 Society on this occasion, and permit me to express a hope that this
 most generous act of the United States may, if possible, draw closer
 the bonds of friendship between the two kindred nations.
   - That the United States may continue to progress with the same ex
traordinary rapidity in the arts of peace and civilization, and to hold
the same high place in the science and literature of the world, is         I
am sure the anxious desire of the Royal Society.
                                  I  have the honour to be,

                            Your most obedient humble Servant,
                                                         Rossrs, P.R.S.

     The following papers were read :—
     1. “ On Carbonate of Lime as an ingredient of Sea-water."           By
John Davy, M.D., F.R.S. Lond. & Ed., Inspector-General of Army
                                                                r
Hospitals, &c.
     The manner in which limestone cliffs rising above deep water are
worn by the action of the sea, as it were by a weak acid, such as we
know it contains, viz. the carbonic—the manner, further, in which
the sand on low shores where the waves break, becomes consolidated,
converted into sandstone, by the deposition of carbonate of lime

                                    899
from sea-water owing to the escape of carbonic acid gas,—are facts
clearly proving that carbonate of lime is as a constituent of sea-water
neither rare ofoccurrence, nor unimportant in the teconomy of nu
ture, inasmuch as the phaenomena alluded to,—the one destructive,
the other restorative,—have         been observed in must parts of our
globe where geological inquiry has been instituted.
    Re<U+FB02>ecting on the subject, it seemed to me desirable to ascertain
whether carbonate of lime as an ingredient of sea-water is chie<U+FB02>y
 con<U+FB01>ned to the proximity of coasts, or not so limited enters into
 the composition of the ocean in its widest expanse.
    On s voyage from Barbados in the West Indies to England in
 November last (I848), I availed myself of the opportunity to make
some trials to endeavour to determine this, the results of which I
shall now brie<U+FB02>y relate.
    First, I may mention that water from Carlisle Bay in Barbados,
 tested for carbonate of lime, gave strong indications of its presence;
 thus a well-marked precipitate was produced by ammonia, after the
 addition of muriate of ammonia in excess, that          is,more than was
su<U+FB02>icient to prevent the separation of the magnesia which enters so
 largely into the composition of sea-water; and     a  like effect was pro
 duced either by boiling the water so as to expel the carbonic acid,
 or by evaporation to dryness and resolution of the soluble salts.
    On the voyage across the Atlantic, the test     by  menus of ammonia
 and muriate of ammonia was employed, acting on about            u   pint of
 water taken from the surface. The <U+FB01>rst trial was made on the 15th
 of November, when in latitude 20° 30' N., and longitude 63° 20' W.,
 more than  a    hundred miles from any land; the result was negative.
 Further trials were made on the 22nd of the same month in lat.
 32° 58', long. 4-5° 10'; on the 24-th, in lat. 36° 28', long. 87° 21' on
                                                                      ;
the 25th, in lat. 87° 21’, long. 88° 34-’; on the 26th, in lat. 88° 28',
long. 80° 2'; on the 27th, when off Funchal of the Western Islands, in
 lat. 88° 82', long. 28° 4-0', abouta   mile and half from the shore, the
                                               a
 water deep blue,as it   alwaysis   out ofsoundings: in all these instances
 likewise the results were negative; the transparency of the water
 was nowise impaired by the test applied. The last trial was made on
 the 3rd of December, when in the Channel off Portland I-lead, about
 <U+FB01>fteen miles; now, slight traces of carbonate of lime were obtained,
 ajust perceptible turbidness being produced.
    'l'he sea-water from Carlisle Bay, the shore of which and the ad
joining coast are calcareous, yielded about per 10,000 of carbonate
                                              l
 of lime, after evaporation of the water to dryness, and the resolution
 of the saline matter.   A     specimen of water taken up on the voyage
 off the volcanic island of Fa al, about a mile from land, yielded a
 residue which consisted chiefly of sulphate of lime, with a very little
 carbonate of lime,—a mere trace; acted on by an acid          it   gave off
 onlya   very  few minute   air-bubbles.    A specimen  taken  up  off Port
land Head, about <U+FB01>fteen miles, yielded on evaporation and resolu
 tion of the saline matter only     a  very minute residue, about '4- only
 perl0,000;  it   consisted   in part of carbonate and in part of sulphate
of lime.

                                    830
   What may be inferred from these results? Do they not tend to
prove that carbonate of lime, except in very minute proportion, does
not belong to water of the ocean at any great distance from land ?
And, further, do they not favour the inference, that when in nota
ble proportion, it is in consequence of proximity to land, and of
land, the shores of which are formed chie<U+FB02>y of calcareous rock ? In
using the word proximity,   I    would not limit the distance implied to
a few miles, but rather to <U+FB01>fty or a hundred, as I am acquainted
with shores consisting of volcanic islands in the Caribbean sea de
stitute of calcareous rock, on which, in certain situations, sandstone
is now forming by the deposition from sea-water of carbonate of lime.
    Should these inferences be con<U+FB01>rmed by more extensive inquiry,
they will harmonize well with the facts <U+FB01>rst referred to, the solvent
power, on one hand, of sea-water impregnated with carbonic acid
on cliffs of calcareous rock in situations not favourable to the dis
engagement of carbonic acid gas; and the deposition, on the other
hand, of carbonate of lime to perform the part of a cement on sand,
converting it into sandstone, in warm shallows, where the waves
break under circumstances, such as these are, favourable to the dis
 engagement of this gas; and, I hardly need add, that the same in
ferences will accord well with what may be supposed to be the re
quirements of organization, in the instances of all those living things
inhabiting the sea, into the hard parts of which carbonate of lime
enters as an element.
    Apart from the (economy of nature, the subject under considera
tion is not without interest in another relation,—I allude to steam
navigation.    The boilers of sea-going steam-vessels are liable to
suffer from an incrustation of solid matter <U+FB01>rmly adhering and with
dif<U+FB01>culty detached, liable to be formed on their inside, owing to a
deposition which takes place from the salt water used for the pro
duction of steam.                             I
                       On one occasion that examined a portion of
such an incrustation taken from the boiler of the “Conway," a ves
sel belonging to the West Indian Steam Packet Company, I found
it to consist principally of sulphate of lime, and to contain a small
proportion only of carbonate of lime.          This vessel had been em
ployed previously   in  transatlantic  voyages, and also in intercolonial
ones, plying between Bermudas and the Island of St. Thomas, and
in the Caribbean sea and the Gulf of Mexico.
   The composition of this incrustation, like the preceding results
would seem to denote, if any satisfactory inference may be drawn
from  it, that carbonate of lime    is in small proportion in deep water
distant from land, and that sulphate of lime       is    commonly more
abundant.     The results of a    few trials
                                          I     have made, whilst rather
con<U+FB01>rmatory of this conclusion, showed marked differences as to the
proportion of sulphate of lime in sea-water in different situations.
That from Carlisle Bay was found to contain ll'3              10,000.  A
                                                          per
specimen    taken  up  in lat. 29° 19'  and  long. 50° 45 yielded about
                                                        ,
2  per 10,000, with a trace of carbonate of lime. A specimen taken
up off Fayal yielded about      9 per 10,000, also with a trace of car
bonate of lime. One taken up off Portland Head, about <U+FB01>fteen miles

                                   831
distant,   yielded, as already remarked, only '4 per 10,000, put of
which was sulphate, part carbonate of lime.
   By certain management, I am informed, as by not allowing the
sen-water in the boilers to be concentrated be ond a certain degree.
the incrustation, in the instances ofthe transatlantic steamers, is in a
great measure prevented. Perhaps it might be prevented altogether,
were sea-water never used but with this precaution, and taken up at
a good distance from land, and in situations where it is known that
the proportion of sulphate of lime is small. if this suggestion be of
any worth, further, more extensive and exact inquiry will be re
quisite to determine the proportion of sulphate of lime in different
parts of the ocean, and more especially towards land. lly the aid of
the transatlantic steam navigation companies means for such an in
quiry may easily be obtained; and it can hardly be doubted that
the results will amply repay any cost or trouble incurred.

   2. “ On the Universal Law of Attraction, including that of Gra
vitation, as a particular case of approximation deducible from the
principle that equal and similar particles of matter move similarly,
relatively to each other." By John Kiunersley Smythies,           Com
municated by T. F. Ellis, Esq., F.R.S.
    After stating the general object of his investigations and explain
ing the notation he employs, the author enters upon some prelimi
nary geometrical inquiries.     He gives the equation between the six
right lines drawn between four points in a plane; the solidity of a
tetrahedron in terms of its edges: the equation between the cosines
of the six angles made by four right lines meeting in a point; and
the equation between ten right lines drawn between <U+FB01>ve points, with
some formulae of veri<U+FB01>cation.       Giving some general rules for the
transformation and consolidation of series, he transforms the Inst
equation into one involving the solidities of tetrahedrons, and shows
how the sign of each tetrahedron in that equation is determined by
its position relatively to the least solid including them all; and then
gives the equation between all the right lines drawn between n
p oints.
    Having shown that the result of di<U+FB02>erentiating the product of n
variables, m times successively may be derived from the mth power
of the sum of the n variables, developed by the polynomial theorem
by substituting for every power of each variable its differential of an
order numerically the same as the power; and applied the theorem
to <U+FB01>nd the differential of the mth order of the equation between ten
right lines drawn between <U+FB01>ve points; the author gives the <U+FB01>rst four
successive differentials of the same equation in another form.
   Proceeding with his investigation he deduces the necessary equa
tion between the distances and central forces of <U+FB01>ve moving points,
and derives from it the general s 'stem of equations which determine
the motion of any number of spheres in terms of ¢ (the function of
the distance according to which the attractive force varies), their

                                   832
masses and mutugl distances.       After proving that any number of
spheres may move so that the central force shall vary directly as the
distance, he shows that only certain values of $5 are possible for an
in<U+FB01>nite number of spheres, giving the criterion of possibility; and
thence that the only possible law of central force for an in<U+FB01>nite
number of spheres ts that in which the force varies directly as the
 distance.
    The author then enters upon some general considerations on the
physical impossibility of an universal law, rigorously exact and ex
pressed by equations involving differentials of no higher order than
the second, and on the amount of disturbance by extraneous agen
cies. Having shown how all equations expressed by rectangular
coordinates may be transformed into others involving only the mu
tual distances 'of the spheres at m equal intervals of time, he gives
an equation of differences de<U+FB01>ning the motion of n points, such that
the distances and their differentials of every order not exceeding m
may have any assigned values.
    After deducing a general formula for transforming equations of
differences not exceeding the mth order into equations between the
distances at m equal intervals of time, the author applies it to the
last equation, and shows that the equations so found are possible for
any number of moving points and for every value of m; and that
the most general law, by which the motion of n equal spheres can
be determined, so that all move according to the same law at all
times, may be found by taking a proper value of m. He then shows
that these equations give a method of unlimited approximation to
any unknown law; and suggests the mode of extending the solution
of the problem to solids of any <U+FB01>gure and mass.        Finally, he gives
the mth differential of the distance between any pair of points mo
ving according to this law, in terms of the differentials of lower
orders including the distances.

    1. “ On the Anatomy and A<U+FB02>inities of the Family of Medusae." By
Henry Huxley, Esq. Communicated by the Bishop of Norwich,F.R.S.
    The author commences by remarking that no class of animals has
been so much investigated with so little satisfactory and comprehen
sive result as the family of Medusa (including under that name the.
Medusa, Monostomatw and the Rkizostomidw), and proposes in this

                                        888
paper to give a connected view of the whole class considered as
organized upon a given type, and an inquiry into its relations with
other families.       This he has been enabled to do through numerous
and peculiar opportunities for the investigation of these animals,
enjoyed during a cruise of some months along the eastern coast of
Australia and in l3ass's Strait *.
    The memoir is divided into two sections, of which the <U+FB01>rst treats
of the anatomy of the Medusae, and the second of their af<U+FB01>nities.
    The organs of the Medusae are formed out of two distinct mem
branes—foundation- membranes.                Both are cellular, but the inner
is in general softer, less transparent and more richly ciliated than
the outer, but contains fewer thread-cells.               The outer is dense,
transparent, and either distinctly cellular or developed into a ains
cular membrane. It may be ciliated or not, and is usually thickly
beset with thread-cells, either scattered through its substance or con
centrated upon more or less raised papillae developed from its sur
face. When the stomach is attached to the disc, the outer mem
brane passes into the general substance of the disc, while the inner
becomes continuous with the lining membrane of the canals. There
is a larger or smaller space, termed by the author the “common
cavity," between the inner aperture of the stomach and the openings
of the canals, with which both communicate.               This is the structure
of the    stomach      in  the  Cryptocarpae      and  Phanerocarpae; in the
Ilhizostomidae      it is fundamentally      the  same,  but the stomachs are
very   minute,   and collected    on  the   edges   and extremities  of the ra
muscules, a common stem. The             Ilhizostomes,   quoad their digestive
system, have the same relation to the Monostome Medusae that the
 Sertularian Polypes have to the Ilydrse, or the Coralline Polypes to
the Actiniae.      In consequence of a very irritable contractile mem
brane surrounding and overlapping the ori<U+FB01>ces of their stomachs,
they are seen with di<U+FB02>iculty.         This membrane consists of two pro
cesses, one from each side of the perforated edge of the branch.              In
Rltizosloma they generally remain distinct, but in Cephea they are
frequently united in front of and behind each aperture so as to form
a distinct polype-like cell.       In the structure of the disc there exists
no difference between the Monostome and Rhizostome Medusas.
 The author gives an account of his observations on the minute struc
ture of the disc.       The arrangement of the cavities and ca.nals of the
disc differs in the different sections.          In very many of the Crypto
carpae there is a circular, valvate, muscular membrane developed
 from the inner and under edge of the disc. In the Phanerocarpm
such a membrane does not seem to be present, but in Rltizostoma
and Cephea it is evidently replaced by the in<U+FB02>exed edge of the disc.
 In the Cryptocarpae the marginal corpnscles are sessile upon the cir
 cular vessel. They are spheroidal vesicles, containing a clear <U+FB02>uid,
and one or more strongly-refracting              bodies occasionally included
within a delicate cell. The marginal vesicles are placed between

the inner and outer membranes of the circular vessel.      In the Pha
nerocarpae the marginal corpuscles are pedunculated and protected
by a semilunar fold. The author describes peculiarities in this part of
the organization of Rhizostoma.      The excretory ori<U+FB01>ces, described
by   Ehrenberg    as general  in Medusa  aurita, were not detected by
the authorin Cephea ocellata.       Nor does he admit the supposed
nerves and intertentacular ganglia of that author to be such.
   Paragraphs 29 to 36 are occupied by a minute description of the
tentacles of Medusae.
   The generative organs of the three groups of'Medusae are always
portions more or less developed of the walls of the system of canals,
                                     "
and consist of the two “ foundation    membranes, in or between which
the generative elements, whether ova or spermatozoa, are developed.
This the author concludes from his observations on several genera,
which he gives in detail, and which add considerably to, and differ
in some respects materially from, what has been stated by previous
 observers.   In the ovarium, the two membranes develope between
them immense multitudes of ova with a dark granulous yelk and
clear germinal vesicle.      The ova are attached to the outer surface
of the inner membrane. In the testis the inner membrane is pro
duced into a vast number of thick pyriform sacs, which lie between
the two membranes, with their blind ends towards the inner surface
of the outer membrane; internally, they open each by a distinct
aperture on the <U+FB01>ne surface of the inner membrane.       The contents
of the sacs are spermatozoa, and cells in every stage of development
towards spermatozoa, which appear to be formed by the elongation
of the secondary cells contained in the large cells.
   The author's observations lead him to believe that the muscular
                                                         "
<U+FB01>bres are always developed in the outer “foundation         membrane.
 Each <U+FB01>bre in Rhizostoma is made up of very small and indistinct
<U+FB01>brils, which are transversely striated. He has not observed any
indubitable trace of a nervous system in the Medusae, nor of the
so-called blood-vascular system described by Will.
    In this section of the memoir the a<U+FB02>iuities of the Medusae are
considered.    In their essential characters,—viz. their construction
out of two membranes inclosing a variously-shaped cavity; their
generative organs being external and variously developed pro
cesses of the two membranes; and the universal presence of the
peculiar organs called thread-cells,_they present a striking resem
blance to other families of Zoophytes, as the Hydroid and Sertula
rian Polypes, the Physophoridae and the Diphydae         The disc of a
Medusa is represented by the natatorial organ among the Diphydae
and Physophoridae, but has no homologue among the Hydrae and
 Sertulariae.  The cell of the Sertularian Polype rather resembles the
“bract" of the Diphydae than the natatorial organ, and the latter
family forms a connecting link between the Medusae and the Phy
sophoridae. Of the two kinds of tentacles in the Medusae, the <U+FB01>rst
is represented in the Physophoridae and Diphydae, by the thickenings,
richly beset with thread-cells, that frequently occur in the lip of the
stomach; in the Sertularian Polypes by the tentacles of the margin

                                                                            335
   of the mouth.                         The second kind is homologous with the prehensile
    organs of the Diphydae and Physophoridu.-, and with the peculiar
   clavate processes of Plumularia.                                                All these organs commence their
   development as bud-like processes of the two joining membranes.
   The peculiar clavate organs of Plumularia are developed from the
   common tube independently of the stomach.                                                                       They have not been
   hitherto described, and were observed b the author in two species
   of Plumularia dredged at Port Curtis. They were of two kinds, the
   one attached to the cell of the polype, the other to the pedicle of the
   ovary.            To each species there were three processes of the former
   kind, two above proceeding from near that edge of the aperture
   which is towards the stem, the other below from the front part of
   the base of the cell.                             They were conical in one species, club-shaped
   and articulated in the other, and consisted of an external horny
   membrane open at the apex, and an internal delicate membrane in
   closing a cavity, all these being continuous with the corresponding
   parts of the stem.                          Al the apex of each, and capable of being pressed
   through the aperture, lay a number of thread-cells.                                                                                 The second
   kind of organ was present in the species with conical processes. lt
   consisted of a stem proceeding from the pedicle of the ovary, bearing
   a series of conical bodies, having the same constitution as those just
   described; the whole bearing a closc resemblance to the prehensile
   organs of the Diphyds.
       The following table exhibits the homologies of the several families,
   which must be regarded as by no means so distinct as hitherto sup
   posed, but rather as members of one great group, organized upon
   one simple and uniform plan, and even in their most complex and
   aberrant forms reducible to the same type.

   60° S. latitude, bein Contributions to Terrestrial Magnetism, No. 9.’
   By Lieut.-Colonel gdward Sabine, R.A., For. Sec.R.S., and printed
   in the Philosophical Transactions.
       In this Number of the Magnetic Contributions the author gives
   maps of the Magnetic Declination in the Atlantic in January 1840,
   between the parallels of 60° N. and 60° S. lat., founded on 1480 de
                                                                                                                                         3

                                    836
 terminations, by observers of different nations, all comprised between
 the years 1828 and 184'8 ; each determination being in the majority
 of cases a mean of several distinct and independent observations, and
 all reduced to the epoch of 1840, by the rates of secular change de
 rived from a comparison of Hansteen’s map of 1787 with the present
 state of the phenomena.
     A considerable portion of the determinations thus co-ordinated
 having been obtained on board ships in which measures were taken
 to supply the means of correcting the errors occasioned by the in
 <U+FB02>uence of the iron which the ships contained, the author in an ac
 companying memoir has discussed at some length the variable part
 of the corrections required for that purpose, being that portion of
 the correction which varies as a ship changes her geographical po
 sition. He infers from the observations generally, and especially from
 those of H.M.S. Erebus during the Antarctic Expedition in 1839
 184-3, that the disturbance occasioned by the iron is chie<U+FB02>y, if not
 entirely, due in wooden ships to the induced magnetism of the iron;
but that its changes are not so rapid as those of the terrestrial mag
netic Inclination and Force during changes of geographical position,
and that the magnetism of the ship is consequently at such times
liable to become more or less in arrear, if the expression may be
permitted, of the change which the magnetic inclination and force
have undergone; that in fact there are considerable portions of a
ship’s iron which are not permanently magnetic on the one hand,
nor perfectly soft so as to undergo instantaneous change with changes
of inclination and force on the other hand; and which derive mag
netism by induction from the earth, but conform gradually rather
than instantaneously to the changes of terrestrial magnetism corre
sponding to changes in the ship's place.
    The bearing which this new view ofa ship’s magnetism would have
on the endeavour to counteract the disturbance occasioned by the
iron, either by permanent magnets or by soft iron, is noticed, and the
conclusion is arrived at, that in order to correct magnetic observations
made on board ship, it is desirable to determine experimentally the
variable term in the correction formulae, at intervals of not many days
apart when a ship is changing her geographical position. An apparatus
and method of observation to accomplish this purpose are described,
which are stated to be extremely simple, to require no unusual cir
cumstances of weather and no reference to celestial objects, and to
occupy but a very few minutes.
    In conclusion, a comparison is instituted between the declinations
computed by M. Gauss’s general theory and those now derived from
observation over a <U+FB01>eld of considerable extent; and on this compa
rison the author founds the following remark, “that the general
theory will require to have its numerical coe<U+FB01>-icients reconstructed
before it can become available for practical purposes ; and that those
who desire to take a correct‘ view of the magnetic phenomena, must
for the present at least, have recourse to the maps constructed di
rectly from the observations themselves."

     3. “ On the Microscopic Structure of the Scales and Dermal
  Teeth of some Ganoid and Plucoid Fish." By \\'. C. Williamson,
  Esq. Communicated by Edwin Lankester, M.D., F.R.S.
     The author commences his paper by stating that the structure
 and modes of growth of fl$ll-B{'alrs have been studied by many ob
 servers, especially by Leeuwenhoek,         Agassiz, Mandi and Owen.
 The <U+FB01>rst of these considered each scale to consist of numerous
 superimposed laminae added successively to the inferior surface.
 This view has been revived, with some important modi<U+FB01>cations, by
 M. Agassiz, and especially applied to the scales of ganoid <U+FB01>sh;
 which he showed to consist of laminae of true bone, usually
 covered with enamel (email), the latter often resembling the den
 tine of <U+FB01>shes' teeth. M. Mandi denied that ganoid scales had
 been formed by such successive additions of laminae; and Professor
 Owen also opposed the idea, that they had merely been the result of
successively excreted deposition.       The author then proceeds to the
examination of the scales of the following genera and species:—
Lepidostelu osnus, Lepidolu: aerniserrahu, L. <U+FB01>lantelli, and L. <U+FB01>m
briahu, Senvinotsu rhombljer, P/aolidohu Leachii, P13/claohpis Bol
 lensis, Beryar, Dapidius orbs}, and I). granulonu; all of which ap
 pear to be constructed according to u common type—one singular
 modi<U+FB01>cation of which is seen in Palaonimu comptus and P. Beau
mmdi, and another in G1/r0duJ and Arpidorhgnclaus acutirontris.
 Still more elaborate complications occur in the scales of the Stur
geon and of Platysomus parvulus, the minute structure of which
is described.    Then follow detailed accounts of another interesting
group of structures found in the genera Megaliclztlrys, Holoptychiua
and Diploplerus, in which the osseous tissues and their super<U+FB01>cial
coverings are exceedingly beautiful and complicated. The next <U+FB01>sh
examined is Macmpoma Mantelli from the chalk.              In this the true
bony operculum      is  studded   over with  dermal   teeth, as is also the
posterior part   of   each  scale;  the  portion of  the  latter, however,
which is subjacent to these dermal teeth, is not oeseous, but consists
of thin lamime, which do not contain lacunae.           The hollow viscus
found in the interior of the Maevopoma, is shown to be a cylinder
of true osseous tissue, of asingular laminated structure full of lacunae.
The author rejects the idea of its having been e. stomach, but thinks
that it may have served the purpose of an air-bladder.
    The structure and arrangement of the dermal teeth from the skin
of the Dog-<U+FB01>sh are then investigated, and appear to resemble those
on the opercular bones and scales of Jllacropoma.        Similar teeth are
described in the fossil skin of Hybodus reticulatus, from the lias of
Lyme Regis.      In the latter, numerous small granules of calcareous
matter, having a concentric laminated structure, have been im
bedded in the substance of the soft cutis, under the dermal teeth.
The corresponding dermal teeth from the Raia clavata are described,
and also those covering the snout of the common Saw-<U+FB01>sh ; as well
as the very singular premaxillary bones of the Caslorhyncluu.
    From an examination of the dermal appendages of the <U+FB01>shes thus
cursorily enumerated, the author concludes
                                                              3*

                                    838
    That what   has hitherto   been  termed enamel, is in <U+FB01>shes a com
pound structure, separable into ganoin and kosmine (1:60-pew, to
adorn) ; the former being transparent and laminated, but otherwise
structureless, whilst the latter consists of minute branchin'g tubes re
sembling the dentine of true teeth.
    That the kosmine covering the osseous scales of so man.y ganoid
<U+FB01>sh, as in Lepidotus semiserratus, Megalichthys Hibberti, &c., is
homologous and identical with the substance composing the dermal
teeth of the true placoids, such as the Dog-<U+FB01>sh, Thornback, &c.,
only that, whilst in the former the areolae of kosmine are aggregated
upon bony scales, in the latter they are implanted in the soft integu
ment, without the intervention of any bony matter. It follows from
                                          "
this, that the distinction of “ ganoid      and “placoid" is scarcely a
physiological one, inasmuch as the scales of many so-called ganoid
<U+FB01>sh, such as Dapidim orbis, 'Acipenser,&c., exhibit little or no trace
of either ganoin or kosmine; that in many of the Placoids these sub
stances are very largely developed; and that a series of well-de<U+FB01>ned
links exist, passing through the common Thornback, the common
 Spotted Dog-<U+FB01>sh, Hybodus reticulatus, Macroporna Mantelli, Da
pidius granulosus, Holoptychius, Diplqrterus and Megalichthys, by
 which the ganoid and placoid forms merge in one another.
     That ganoid scales consist of variously modi<U+FB01>ed osseous lamellaa,
 the result of successive additions made chie<U+FB02>y to the lower surface
 of each; but also, under particular circumstances, either to a part,
 or to the whole of the upper surface.
     That these lamellae have not been the result of any process of
 excretion, or depositions from a secreting surface, as supposed by
 M. Agassiz, but that they have been formed by the calci<U+FB01>cation of
 the lower laminae of an investing vascular periosteum; and that
 consequently the phamomena attending the structure and growth of
  these ganoid scales contribute in a material degree to establish the
  correctness of the views recently promulgated by Professor Sharpey
  respecting the growth and development of human bone; the gra
  dual formation of Haversian canals being traced with great ease
  from the simple laminae seen in the scales of Lepidosteus, Lepidotus,
  &c., through Aspidorhynchus, Acipenser, Holoptychius, &c. to their
  high degree of development in Megalichthys.
     That the study of the microscopic structure of the dermal ap
  pendages of <U+FB01>sh may, when carried on with due caution, be made a
  valuable auxiliary, both in distinguishing between allied species, and
  in establishing the existence of important a<U+FB02>inities, even when ap
  plied to otherwise insigni<U+FB01>cant fragments; but that it is capable of
  being overstraiued, and of leading to erroneous conclusions, if any
  classi<U+FB01>cations are founded upon it irrespective of the other portions
  of the <U+FB01>sh to which the scales belong, because of the unequal ratio
  in which the various parts of an organism may have been developed.
   Thus, whilst Lepidosteus osseus presents one of the simplest forms
   of ganoid scales, it has the concavo-convex vertebral articulations of
  the Ophidians; on the other hand, in many species, as in Megalich
  tkys and Holoptychius, whilst the structure of each part of the exo

                                      889
skeleton is highly developed, the vertebrae appear to have the double
concave articulation common amongst <U+FB01>sh and enaliosaurs.
     The author, in conclusion, acknowled es his obligations to Sir

         “ On the Mechanical Equivalent of Heat."
     4-.                                                   By J. P. Joule,
 Cor. Associate R. Acad. Sciences, Turin, &c. Communicated by
 M. Faraday, D.C.L., F.R.S., Foreign Memh. Acad. of Sciences,
 Paris, &c.
     After passing in review the experimental researches of Rumfunl,
 Davy, Dulong, Faraday, and others who have successively discovered
 facts tending to prove that heat is not a substance, but a mode of
  force, the author mentions the papers he has already communicated
 to the Royal Society, and published in the Philosophical Magazine,
  in which he has endeavoured to show that in the production of heat
 by the expenditure of force, and rice versd, in the production of
force by the expenditure of /\eat, a constant relation always subsists
  between the two.       This relation he denominates the “ Mechanical
  Equivalent of Heat," and the object of the present paper is to advance
  fresh proofs of its existence, and to give to it the numerical accuracy
  requisite to <U+FB01>t it as a starting-point for further inquiries.
     In carrying out the above design, the author has determined the
  relation of work done to heat produced in the cases of the friction,
  lst, of water; Qnd, of mercury; and 8rd, of cast iron.
     In the experiments on the friction of the <U+FB02>uids, the liquid was
  contained in a covered cylindrical vessel of copper or iron, and the
  agitation was effected by vanes of brass or iron, <U+FB01>xed to a vertical
  axis revolving in the centre of the vessel, whilst <U+FB01>xed vanes pre
  vented the liquid being whirled in the direction of rotation.      In the
  experiments on the friction of solids, a disc of cast iron was rotated
  against another disc of cast iron pressed against it; the whole being
  immersed in a cast-iron vessel tilled with mercury.
      The force ezpended was measured by the descent of the weights
   employed in rotating the apparatus; and great care was taken to
   correct it for the friction of the axes of the pnllies employed, &c.
      The heat evolved by the friction was measured by exact thermo
   meters, and very laborious precautions were taken in order to elimi
   nate the effects of radiation or conduction of heat to and from the
   surrounding atmosphere. The corrected thermometric effect was
   then reduced to a known capacity for heat, by means of extensive
   series of experiments made in order to ascertain the speci<U+FB01>c heat of
   the materials in which the thermometric effect was observed.
      In this way the number of units of work, estimated in pounds one
   foot high, required to be done in order to develope one degree Fahr.
   in one pound of water taken at about 50°, was found to be as
   follows :—
         772'692 from friction of water, a mean of 4-O experiments.
         774-'083 from friction of mercury, a mean of 50 experiments.
         774,'987 from friction of cast iron, a mean of 20 experiments.

   5. “On the Nitrogenous Principles of Vegetables        as the sources
of arti<U+FB01>cial Alkaloids." By John Stenhouse, F.R.S.
   After observing that there are few departments in organic che
mistry which during the last six or seven years have attracted more
of the attention of experimenters than the arti<U+FB01>cial formation of the
alkaloids, and attributing this fact to the interesting nature of this
class of bodies both as regards their well-de<U+FB01>ned chemical properties
and the important medical virtuesvwhich many of them possess, the
author proceeds to state, that although attempts to form the natural
alkaloids, such as quinine, cinchonine, &c., by arti<U+FB01>cial means have
hitherto been unsuccessful, yet chemists have been enabled by various
processes to procure arti<U+FB01>cially a considerable number of true alka
loids very analogous to those which occur in nature.        The various
methods by which this has been effected, such as by acting on essen
tial oils with ammonia, by the destructive distillation of coal.and
animal substances, &c., are then enumerated and described.
   It is also remarked as somewhat singular, that while so many other
sources have been examined, no attempt should have been made to
procure alkaloids from vegetable albumen, <U+FB01>brine, caseine, &c., which
are so rich in nitrogen, and which occur in such abundance in many
plants.     What renders the neglect of these substances the more re
markable, is the consideration that coal has been one of the most
productive sources of the alkaloids, yielding them, as it does, four
other bases besides ammonia.       Now as coal is universally admitted
to be of vegetable origin, and to consist of the remains of a variety
of extinct vegetables, the nitrogenous principles of which must be
regarded as the sources of the bases which it yields, it seemed to the
author not unreasonable to expect, that, by acting on the nitrogenous
principles of recent vegetables, the same organic bases as those ob
tained from coal, or at any rate a series of analogous bases, would be
obtained in still greater abundance; and it subsequently appeared that
this latter expectation was not altogether without foundation.
    From the di<U+FB02>iculty of procuring vegetable albumen, <U+FB01>brine, &c.
in a state of even tolerable purity, those portions of plants (usually
their seeds) were selected which contain those principles in the greatest
abundance.
   In the <U+FB01>rst instance, a quantity of Phaseolus communis, or common
horse-bean, was destructively distilled in a cast-iron cylinder, and
the products collected by means of a large condensing Liebig's appa
ratus.     These products closely resembled those obtained from the
distillation of bones and other animal matters, comprising among
other substances acetic acid, empyreumatic oils, tar, a great deal of
ammonia and several organic alkaloids. The crude product was super
saturated with muriatic acid, and the clear liquid decanted after the
tar had subsided.     The acid liquor was next passed through a cloth
<U+FB01>lter, which removed the greater portion of the resinous matter.
 The clear liquid was then poured into a capacious still, and super
saturated with carbonate of soda. When the liquid began to boil,
much ammonia was disengaged, and a quantity of oily bases col
lected in the receiver.     Their amount increased as the distillation
 proceeded.     These bases were separated from the ammoniacal liquid

                                   84-1
by means of n pipette, and were puri<U+FB01>ed by suitable processes which
it is unnecessary to particularize.     These bases, though they were
found to vary very considerably in their boiling-points and some of
their properties, were very similar in other respects. They were
transparent colourlus oils, which were all of them lighter than water,
and refracted light strongly.     Their taste was hot, resembling that
of oil of peppermint. They all exhibited strong alkaline reactions,
and neutralized the acids perfectly, forming crystallizable salts. The
most curious circumstance respecting them was, that they wereappa
rently quite different from the series of bases obtained from either
bones or coal, and contained no aniline.
    One of these bases was isolated and subjected to analysis.          It
boiled between 150° and 155° C.         its formula was found to be
Cw Ho N, which differs only by two equivalents of hydrogen from
nicotine.     The only obstacle which has hitherto prevented the se
paration and examination of each of these bases individually, has
arisen from the di<U+FB02>iculty of procuring them in sutiicient quantity.
Not that beans when distilled yield bases in so much smaller quan
tities than bones and other animal substances ; but as both bones and
coal are distilled on the largest scale for commercial purposes, their
crude oils may be easily procured in any quantity, and from these
their respective series of bases may be readily prepared.       In regard
to the bases from beans and other seeds, the case is quite di<U+FB01>erent;
as the scienti<U+FB01>c chemist is compelled to distil these substances on
purpose, an operation which cannot be conveniently conducted in a
laboratory, since it requires an apparatus so large as to be almost upon
a manufacturing scale.
    Oil-cah.—As the Pluucolus communis was regarded as the type
of the Leguminosw, oil-cake, or the expressed seeds of Linum writa
tissinmm, was selected from that numerous class of plants in which
the starch of the Graminem is replaced by oil.      The products of its
distillation were very similar to those from beans, containing how
ever more ammonia and a somewhat smaller proportion of oily bases,
which, though similar, appeared to differ from those of the pre
ceding series.    They were also equally devoid of aniline.
    Wheat, Triticum In/bemum, and subsequently peat from the
neighbourhood of Glasgow, were also-destructively distilled.         Both
of these substances, in addition to ammonia, yielded a series of oily
bases, which also contained no aniline.
    Distillation of wood.—The author proceeds to state, that through
the kindness of an extensive pyroligneous acid manufacturer he
was enabled to examine considerable quantities of the crude acid
liquor obtained from the destructive distillation of beech, oak, and
other hard woods.      The stems and larger branches of trees are alone
employed for this purpose.      He found to his surprise that this acid
liquor contained scarcely a trace of ammonia or of any other organic
base, showing that the woody portions of the limbs and stems of
trees are nearly devoid of nitrogenous matter, in which respect they
differ extremely from peat, which in general contains two per cent.
of nitrogen; and he considers this circumstance as perhaps calculated

                                      842
to throw some light upon the origin of the coal-beds, which some
geologists believe to have been formed from the submersion of
forests and the <U+FB02>oating of uprooted timber into estuaries and lakes,
while others contend that they have been produced by the submersion
of beds of peat.      Irrespective therefore of other considerations, the
author urges in favour of the latter opinion, that wood is not capable
of furnishing the amount of nitrogen we <U+FB01>nd existing in coal, while
peat contains rather more than double the quantity required.              The
expectation    of procuring  aniline, picoline, &c., the coal series of bases,
from the distillation of peat, was disappointed; a result only to be
accounted for on the hypothesis, that the different genera of plants,
when destructively distilled, yield different series of organic bases.
    From the facts which have previously been stated, the authorcon
siders himself warranted in concluding, that when ammonia is pro
duced by the destructive distillation of either animal or vegetable sub
stances, it is always accompanied with the formation of organic
bases.   Now as ammonia is known to be procurable from these sub
stances by other methods than destructive distillation, it seemed
highly probable that on these occasions organic bases would also be
produced.      Beans, oil-cake and <U+FB02>esh, were therefore successively
boiled in a distilling apparatus with strong alkaline lyes. In every
instance, in addition to ammonia, a series of organic bases was also
produced.      Similar results were also obtained when the above-men
tioned substances were digested in strong sulphuric acid, the acid
solution supersaturated with an alkali and subjected to distillation.
The ammoniacal liquor which passed into the receiver was found
invariably to contain organic bases.
   Bases by putrefaction.—As putrefaction is almost the only other
means by which ammonia is readily procurable in quantity from
vegetable and animal substances, the effects of this process were also
examined in the <U+FB01>rst instance in the case of guano.             An aqueous
solution of Peruvian guano was saturated with carbonate of soda
and distilled.     In addition to much ammonia, a quantity of basic oils
was also obtained. Subsequent to this experiment, the effects of putre
faction on a quantity of horse-<U+FB02>esh were also examined, when a con
siderable amount of oily bases was found to have been generated.
   From the facts which have now been enumerated, the author con
cludes “tlrat whenever ammonia is generated in large quantity from
complex animal or vegetable substances, it is invariably accompanied
by the formation ofa larger or a smaller amount of volatile organic
bases."   If therefore researches similar to the present are actively
prosecuted, and if the seeds and leaves of the various genera of plants
are subjected to these or analogous processes, it seems not unreason
able to expect that the number of the organic alkaloids will ere long
be considerably increased.
   6. “On the Development and Varieties of the great anterior
veins in Man and Mammalia." By John Marshall, Esq. Commu
nicated by Professor Sharpey, F.R.S.
   The object of this paper is to state the result of observations on

                                    84-3
 the metamorphosis of the great anterior veins in Man and Mam
 malia, and on the relations existing between the primitive and <U+FB01>nal
 condition of these vessels, in different cases, both in their normal
 arrangement in animals, and their abnormal condition in the human
 subject.'
    From an examination of the form and structure of the sinus of the
great coronary vein, and of the arrangement of its branches and
 valves in Man and some of the Mammalia, and from a comparison
of those parts with the terminations of the great coronary and other
posterior cardiac veins in the other Mammalia, the roronmy sinus
 in Man and one set of Mammals, as the Dog, Cat, and Seal, is shown
 to be analogous to t/re lower part of the Iq<U+FB01> rema cava anterior found
in another set, represented by the Elephant, Rabbit and Hedgehog,
and to the lower-part oftlce le<U+FB01> vena azygos, found in a third set, as
exempli<U+FB01>ed in the Sheep, Ox and Pig.           The great coronary vein,
therefore, is shown always to end in a similar way, viz. in a larger
muscular venous channel, which, in all cases, ends in the right auri
cle of the heart, by a wide ori<U+FB01>ce situated in an exactly correspond
ing part of that cavity.
    The author remarks that a similar view has recently been published
by Bardsleben; but his own observations were completed, and his
deductions arrived at, quite independently.
    Re<U+FB02>ecting on the above-mentioned analogies and on the known
method of development of the great anterior veins in all the Verte
brato, as pointed out by Rathké, from four primitive lateral venous
trunks, viz. two anterior or jugular, and two posterior or cardinal
veins, the coronary sinus is demonstrated to be the lower persistent
portion of the left anterior primitive venous trunk, next to the heart.
 By Rathké, however, the whole of this left primitive trunk, from the
neck down to the heart, is supposed to become occluded and then
entirely to disappear in Man, and in such animals as are similarly
formed in respect to these great veins; but the author <U+FB01>nds that not
only does its lower part persist in a previous condition as the coro
nary sinus, but that other remnants or vestiges of this primitive ve
nous channel are to be found throughout life in Man, and in those
animals in which the great anterior veins undergo a like metamor
phosis.
    The inquiry thus opened is then systematically pursued, <U+FB01>rst, by
tracing the details of the metamorphosis of the great anterior veins
in the embryos of the Sheep and Guinea Pig, and in the human fcetus;
secondly, by a comparison of the adult condition of these great veins
in the entire class of Mammalia; and thirdly, by an examination of
the occasional varieties of the same vessels met with in the human
subject.
    1. Of the development of the great anterior veim.—After describing
at length the metamorphosis of these vessels, the author proceeds to
give an account of the remnants of the left anterior primitive vein
in the adult.
   These are indicated by the following parts, traced from the sinn
mit of the left thoracic cavity down to the back of the heart. Out

                                     844
side the pericardium, certain <U+FB01>ne bands of<U+FB01>brous tissue, which descend
 beneath the pleura, from the trunk of the left superior intercostal
 vein to the front of the root of the left lung; and inside the peri
cardium, afald of the serous membrane which passes down from the
left pulmonary artery to the subjacent pulmonary vein,—certain
opaque lines or streaks upon the side and hack of the left auricle,—
a small oblique auricular vein which is continued from thoe streaks
down to the coronary sinus,—and lastly, the coronary sinus itself.
 The fold of the pericardium, which hitherto has escaped observation,
is particularly described.     It is named by the author the vestigial
fold ofthe pericardium,    or,   from its having contained the canal of
 Cuvier   in the embryo, the Cuvierian fold.
    2. Under the second head, a comparison is instituted between the
great anterior veins Qf Man and the Mammalia generally.
    Having remarked that, as high up in the vertebrate scale as Birds,
no fundamental alteration occurs from the primitive condition of two
anterior and two posterior independent lateral venous trunks, the
author remarks that in all Mammalia one characteristic change is
met with, viz. the formation of a transverse branch across the root of
 the neck.
    The right anterior primitive vein in all cases persists as the right
 or ordinary vena cava superior; but the left vein either remains un
 occluded, and returns the blood from the left side of the head and
neck, from the left upper limb, the left side of the thorax, and from
the substance of the heart; or, owing to a partial occlusion, returns
 only the blood from the left side of the thorax and from the substance
 of the heart; or, owing to still further occlusion, from the substance
 of the heart alone. Hence three principal groups arise.
    a. In the <U+FB01>rst group a right and a left superior vena cava exist,
 connected by a cross branch at the root of the neck, as in the Mono
tremata, Marsupialia, the Elephant, most Rodentia, the Hedgehog
 and the Bat.
    b. -In another group a right superior cava and a left vena azygos
exist, as in the Sheep, Goat, Ox, Pig, Horse, Mole and Guinea Pig.
    c. In the third group there is found, besides the right vena cava
superior, only a left cardiac venous trunk or coronary sinus, together
with the vestiges already described, as in the Cetacea, Carnivora and
 Quadrumana, as well as in Man.
    In each of these groups subordinate varieties are shown and clas
si<U+FB01>ed.
    3. The almost numberless varieties of the great anterior veins in the
human subject are then arranged on principles similar to those adopted
in regard to the different conditions found among Mammalia; but
the groups are arranged in the inverse order, and the usual con
dition of the veins in Man is included as a necessary element in the
senes.
    In one large class of cases, comprehending three groups similar to
those of the different Mammalia already de<U+FB01>ned, the cross branch in
the neck is always present.
    a. In the <U+FB01>rst group there is a right vena cava superior, and a left

                                     84-5
cardiac venous trunk or coronary ainusf This is the ordinary con
dition.   1-'urthcr subdivisions arise, depending on peculiarities of the
vena cava itself, which are rare; of the azygoa system, which are
exceedingly numerous; and of the coronary vein and sinus, which
are again uncommon.         Transposition occasionally produces a   further
modi<U+FB01>cation, in which the superior cava         isfound on the left side;
whilst the coronary sinus, the oblique vein and the vestigial fold of
the pericardium, exist on the right.
  b.  In another group there might exist a right vena cava superior
and a   left vena azygos, as in the Sheep; but no example of this pos
sible variety has yet been met with in the human llt\lbje0l.
   c. In the third group  a    right and    left superior cava coexist, as
                                            a
in the Elephant, constituting what      istermed a double vena cava su
perior.     Thirty examples of this condition are adduced, of which
eleven only have occurred in adult and otherwise perfect hearts.
One of these wua met with by the author, and         isspecially described.
   Lastly, a separate or second clan consists of those cases in which
the cross branch     is wanting, and which are, accordingly, destitute of
the characteristic mammalian type, and present, as in Birds, the per

   The paper    is illustrated by original drawings, of the development
of the veins in the Sheep and in Man, of the vestiges of the left pri
mitive vein ordinarily found in the adult human subject, and of the
fresh example of double vena cava superior in Man met with by the
author.
  7.  "AMathemutical Thcoryof Magnetism."      By WilliamThomson,
M.A., F.R.S.E., Fellow of St. Peter's College, Cambridge, and Pro
fessor of Natural Philosophy in the University of Glasgow.
   The theory of magnetism was <U+FB01>rst mathematically treated in a
complete form by Poisson.   Brief sketehes of his theory, with some
simpli<U+FB01>cations, have been given by Green and Murphy in their works
on Electricity and Magnetism.     In all these writings     hypothesis
                                                            a
of two magnetic <U+FB02>uids has been adopted, and strictly adhered to
throughout.    No physical evidence can be adduced in support of
such a hypothesis; but on the contrary, recent discoveries, especially
in electro-magnetism, render    extremely improbable.
                                it                        Hence       it   is
of importance that all reasoning with reference to magnetism should
be conducted without assuming the existence of those hypothetical
<U+FB02>uids.
   The writer of the present paper endeavours to show that        com
                                                                  a
plete  mathematical  theory  of magnetism may    be  established  upon
the sole foundation of facts generally known, and Coulomb's special
experimental researches.    The positive parts of this theory agree
with those of Poisson’s mathematical theory, and consequently the
elementary mathematical formulae coincide with those which have
been previously given by Poisson.
   The paper at present laid before the Royal Society     restricted to
                                                           is
the elements of the mathematical theory, exclusively of those parts
in which the phenomena of magnetic induction are considered.

                                     846
    The author expresses his hope to lay before the Society a con
tinuation, containing some original mathematical investigations on
magnetic distributions, and a theory of induction, in ferromagnetic
or diamagnetic substances.
    8. “ On the Nitroprussides,    a new Class of Salts."   By Dr. Lyon
 Playfair, F.R.S., F.C.S.
    When nitric acid is made to act on yellow prusside of potassium,
 in the proportion of one equivalent of acid for every equivalent of
 potassium present in the salt, the following reactions are observed.
 The salt dissolves in the acid with a dark red, almost black colour,
 a very little nitric oxide is evolved, which soon ceases, and is fol
 lowed by a copious evolution of cyanogen mixed with nitrogen.
 The continued action of the acid causes the liquid to cease the usual
 reactions of red prusside of potassium; the addition of sulphate of
 iron now produces a slate-coloured instead of blue precipitate.      On
 allowing the solution to cool, abundance of nitrate of potash cry
 stallizes out, mixed with a little prussian blue, and about 5 per cent.
 of the original weight of the salt, of a white granular substance,
which is scarcely soluble in cold, and only very slightly so in boil
ing water. This white substance, on examination, proves to be the
remarkable body omarrtide, the production of which in an oxidising
medium is highly singular.
    The dark red supernatant liquor, being neutralized with an alka
line carbonate, and boiled, deposits a green precipitate and yields a
clear ruby-red solution.     This solution furnishes the new class of
salts, which is the subject of this paper.       It may be evaporated to
crystallization, and yields  the   nitroprusside of the base used in the
neutralization.
    The characters of the nitroprussides thus obtained are very
marked, and cannot be confounded with those of any known class
of salts.
    With soluble sulphurets, the nitroprussides produce the most
magni<U+FB01>cent purple-coloured        solution, and of such intensity, that
they form by far the best test for the presence of a sulphuret, and
betray its presence when the usual tests for a sulphuret are insu<U+FB02>i
cient to expose it.
    With a protosulphate of iron, the nitroprussides produce a salmon
coloured precipitate; with salts of silver, zinc and cobalt, a preci
pitate of a <U+FB02>esh colour; and with nickel, a dirty white precipitate.
With a salt of copper, the precipitate is of a. light green, and with
salts of lead, no precipitate is occasioned.
    Nitroprussic acid is obtained by adding muriatic acid to the silver
salt, and forms a dark red solution, which yields on evaporation in
vacuo, large and well-de<U+FB01>ned crystals.
    The nitroprussides of sodium, potassium, ammonium, barium and
calcium, are all soluble and crystallize readily, forming <U+FB01>ne large
red crystals, which have been measured by Prof. Miller of Cain
bridge, and are described in the paper.         The salts of barium and
calcium decompose on evaporation, and can after that no longer be

                                       84-7
obtained perfectly pure, having dissolved about one per cent. of the
products of decomposition, which are not removed by subsequent
crystallization.
    Potash and soda in the cold unite with the nitroprussides, and
form distinct salts, in which there is one equivalent of these nlkalies
for every equivalent of the barylc.                 These alkalies when heated
with the nitroprussides decompose them altogether, forming peroxide
of iron, hyponitrites, oxalic acid and ordinary ferrocyanides.
    Sulphuretted hydrogen and soluble sulphuretl also decompose the
nitroprussides.
    The formula of the nitroprussides is remarkably complex.                Well
accordunt analyses of all the salts permit no simpler relation between
their carbon and iron than 24- equivs. of the former to 5 equivs. of
the latter.      The simpler proportion of 25 to 5 or 5 to l, cannot be
drawn legitimately from their composition.                  Analysis, and also a
study    of their transformation,    show     that    they contain  nitrous oxide,
and have led to the complex formula
                             Fe,Cy,,.'$NO + 5R.
 This is obviously a conjugate formula, and allows itself to be divided,
 for reasons now to be given, into the more simple expression
                   2(Fe,Cy,NO+2R)+(FeCy,NO+R).
     The relation of nitropruasides to ordinary prusaides is supposed
 to be as follows :
     Both the ferrocyanides and the ferrideyanides are supposed to
 contain a common radical, one being quadribaaic and the other
 tribasicnjust as in the case of the modi<U+FB01>cations of phosphoric acid.
  A bibnsic modi<U+FB01>cation is therefore to be looked for. The formulae
  would be as follows:
                Ferrocyanides    . . . . . . . . . .    Fe,Cy, +4-R.
                 Ferridcyanides  . . . . . . . . . .    Fe,Cy, + SR.
                 Hypothetical compound            . .  (Fe,Cy,)+1R.
     The nitroprussides are supposed to correspond to the last of the
  series, in which one equivalent of cyanogen is replaced by one equiv.
  of nitrous oxide.      In the case of the beautiful purple compound
  produced by the soluble sulphurets on nitroprussides, this nitrous
  oxide is replaced by sulphuret of nitrogen.                   The hypothetical
  bibasic prusside necessary to establish this view has not yet been ob
  tained; but the author states that experiments made with this view
  have already been so successful, that he shortly expects to announce
  it to the Society.
     9. “ On the Structure of the Dental Tissues of Marsupial Ani
  mals, and more especially of the Enamel." By John Tomes, Esq.
  Communicated by Dr. Grant, F.R.S.
      The author of this communication, after examining microscopi
  cally the teeth of many marsupial animals taken from the majority of
  the families that make up the order Marsupialia,<U+FB01>nds that they possess
  a structural character by which they may be distinguished from other

                                    848
  mammalian teeth, subject only to one of two exceptions; in which
  exceptions, however, the teeth are small and may readily be distin
  guished from marsupial by their external character.       They are the
  teeth of the Hyrazc Capensis, the British Shrews, and the molar
  teeth of the Jerboa.
     The author states, that so far as he has had opportunities of ex
  amination, the teeth of the various species may also be distinguished,
  the one from the other.     He points out, for instance, that, on com
  parison, the teeth of Dasyurus ursinus may be distinguished from
  the D. macrourus.
     The peculiar characteristic of marsupial teeth exists in the con
 tinuation of the dentinal tubesinto the enamel; so far as the author
 has investigated them, he <U+FB01>nds but one exception, and that in the
 Wombat,—the representative of the rodents in the marsupial order.
 This creature, he <U+FB01>nds, has teeth that are nearly allied in structure
 as well as external form to the teeth of rodents, and more especially
 to the Hare and Rabbit.
     The author states, that he has observed that the dentinal tubes in
 the human and other teeth are sometimes continued for a short
 distance into the enamel. This he considers a rudimentary condi
 tion which is fully developed rin the marsupial teeth. The author
 observes that the dentinal and enamel pulp become <U+FB01>rmly united to
 each other previous to the commencement of calci<U+FB01>cation in either,
 and that it is highly probable that the linear columns of the two
 pulps are joined end to end, and that the columns of the enamel pulp
 so joined become developed into tubes instead of into solid enamel
<U+FB01>bres.      He considers this the more probable, as he has observed
that the enamel <U+FB01>bres in an early stage of development are partially
tubular in the teeth of several animals whose enamel <U+FB01>bres are ulti
 mately solid.
    The teeth described and <U+FB01>gured are those of the—
        Macropus giganteus.             Petanrus sciureus.
        Hypsiprymnus penicillatus.      Dasyurus macrourus.
              minor.                           ursinus.
        Phalangista vulpina.            Thylacinus cynocephalus.
        Phascolomys Wombat.             Didelphis virginiana.
        Petaurus taguanoides.                ,
    The author considers that the facts stated in his paper justify two
conclusions of a general character: <U+FB01>rst, that the existence of pro
longed and fully-developed tubes in the enamel, continuous with
those of the subjacent dentine, is common to the great majority, if
not all, of the marsupial animals, excepting the Wombat; and, se
condly, that the enamel and dentine are so closely related, that they
should be regarded as modi<U+FB01>cations of 'each other, rather than as
tissues of a wholly different naturer.
         “ On the Motion   of Gases."—Part II.
    10.                                            By Thomas Graham,
F.R.S. &c.
    The experiments described by the author in the former paper on the

                                     849
same subject, afforded grounds    for assuming the existence of a relation
in the transpirnbility of different gases, that is, their passage through
 capillary tubes, of an equally simple nature as that which is recog
nized among the speci<U+FB01>c gravities of gases, or even as the still more
simple ratios of their combining volumes.          Compared with solids
and liquids, matter in the form of gas is susceptible of small variation
in physical properties, and exhibits only a few grand features. These
differences of property, which are preserved amidst the prevailing
uniformity of gases, may well be supposed to be among the most
deep-seated and fundamental in their nature with which matter is
endowed.       Under such impressions he has devoted an unusual
amount of time and attention to the determination of this class of
numerical constants.      An the results, too, were entirely novel, and
wholly unprovided for in the received view of the gaseous constitu
tion, of which indeed they prove the incompleteness, it was the more
necessary to verify eve      fact with the greatest care.
   The most general anldyuimple of the results is, that the transpira
tion velocity of hydrogen gas is exactly double that of nitrogen gas.
These gases, it will be remembered, have a lea simple relation in
density, namely l to 14-. This was the conclusion of his former paper
respecting the transpiration of these gases, and he has obtained
since much new evidence in its favour.         The                      car
bonic oxide, like the speci<U+FB01>c gravity of that gas,  transpirabiligy<U+FB02>pf
                                                         appears       to be
identical with that of nitrogen.
   The result which may be placed next in point of accuracy and
importance is, that the transpiration velocity of oxygen is related to
that of nitrogen in the inverse ratio of the densities of these gases,
that is. as 14- to 16. In equal times it is not equal volumes but equal
weights of these two gases that are transpired, the more heavy gas
being more slowly transpired in proportion to ils greater density.
Mixtures of oxygen and nitrogen have the mean velocity of these
two gases, and hence the time of air is also found to be proportional
to its density, when compared with the time of oxygen.
   The relation between nitrogen and oxygen is equally precise as
that between nitrogen and hydrogen. The densities calculated from
the atomic weights of oxygen and nitrogen, namely, 16 and l4-,
being 1 for oxygen, 0-9010 for air and 08750 for nitrogen, the ob
served times oftranspiration of equal volumes of the same gases are
for oxygen 1, air 0'8970 to O'90l0, and for nitrogen 0'8’/'08. The
result for carbonic acid, which is perhaps next in interest, appears
at <U+FB01>rst anomalous.     It is, that the transpiration time of this gas    is
inversely proportional to its density when compared with oxygen, or
07272, the time of oxygen being          their velocities will of course be
                                          l,
directly as their densities.    It    to be remembered, however, that
                                     is
carbonic acid         compound gas, containing an equal volume of
                is
                a
oxygen. The second constituent, carbon, which increases the weight
of the gas, appears to give additional velocity to the oxygen in the
same manner and to the same extent as increased density from pres
sure or from cold increases the transpiration velocity of pure oxygen
itself.  A result of this kind shows at once the important chemical

                                     850
bearing of gaseous transpirahility, and claims for it a place with the
doctrines of gaseous densities and combining volumes. The circum
stance that the transpiration time of hydrogen is one-half of that of
nitrogen, indicates that the relations of transpirability are even more
simple in their expression than the relations of density among gases.
In support of the same assertion may be adduced the additional fact,
that binoxide of nitrogen, although differing in density, has the same
transpiration time as nitrogen.      Protoxide of nitrogen and carbonic
acid have one transpiration time; so have nitrogen and carbonic
oxide, as each pair has a common density.
    The transpiration of twenty other gases and vapours is experi
mentally determined, and shown to be uniform, like the preceding
gases, with tube resistances varying in amount from l to 1000. This
list includes protocarburetted hydrogen, ole<U+FB01>ant gas, ammonia, cya
nogen, hydrocyanic acid, hydrosulphuric acid, bisulphide of carbon,
sulphurous acid, sulphuric acid, chlorine, bromine, hydrochloric acid,
ether, methylic ether, chloride of methyl, coal-gas and the vapours of
water, alcohol and coal-tar naphtha.
    The principal results respecting the transpiration of these vapours,
and on the in<U+FB02>uence which pressure and temperature have upon the
transpiration of a gas, are summed up as follows :—
    The velocity of protocarburetted hydrogen is 0'8, that of hydrogen
being 1.
    The velocity of chlorine appears to be 1; that of oxygen; of bro
mine vapour and sulphuric acid vapour the same as that of oxygen.
    Ether vapour appears to have the same velocity as hydrogen gas;
their densities are as 37 to 1.
    Ole<U+FB01>ant gas, ammonia and cyanogen appear to haveequal or nearly
equal velocities, which approach closely to double the velocity of
oxygen.
    Hydrosulphuric acid gas and bisulphide of carbon vapour appear
to have equal or nearly equal velocities.
    The compounds of methyl appear to have a less velocity than the
corresponding compounds of ethyl, but to be connected by a certain
constant relation.
    The resistance of a capillary tube of uniform bore to the passage
of any gas is directly proportional to the length of the tube.
    The velocity of passage of equal volumes of air of the same tem
perature, but of different densities or elasticities, is directly propor
tional to the density. The denser the air, the more rapidly does it
pass under a constant propulsive pressure.
    Rarefaction by heat has a similar and precisely equal effect in
diminishing the velocity of the transpiration of equal volumes of air,
as the loss of density and elasticity by diminished pressure has.
    A greater resistance in the capillary is required to bring out the
law of densities, than appears necessary for the two preceding results;
and a resistance still further increased, and the highest of all, to
bring out the law of temperatures.
    Finally, transpiration is generally promoted by density, and equally
whether the increased density be due to compression, to cold, or to
                                  O

                                      85!
the addition of an element in combination. as the velocity of oxygen
is increased, by combining it with carbon without change of volume,
in carbonic acid gas.
    It did not enter into the plan of the author to investigate the pass
age of gases through tubes of great diameter, and to solve pneuma
tic problems of actual occurrence, such as those offered in the dis
tribution of coal-gas by pipes. llut he states that the results must
be similar, with truly elastic gases such as air and carburetted hy
drogen, whether the tubes be capillary or several inches in diameter,
provided the length of the tube be not less than 4-(XX) times its dia
meter, as in the long glass capillaries of his experiments.          The small
propulsive pressure applied     to coalgas     is  also favourable  to transpi
ration, as well as the great length of the mains; and he therefore
would expect the distribution of coal-gas in cities to exemplify ap
proximately the laws of gaseous transpiration.            The velocity of coal
gas    should  be P575.   that of  air  being   l,  under  the same pressure.
And with a constant propulsive pressure in the gasometer, the <U+FB02>ow
of gas should increase in volume with a rise of the barometer or with
a fall in temperature, directly in proportion to the increase of its
density from either of these causes.
     These laws, it will be observed, are entirely different from those
which direct the passage of gases through an aperture in a thin plate,
or their <U+FB02>ow into a vacuum as it is usually said, and could not be
deduced, like the latter, from our speculative ideas respecting the
elastic <U+FB02>uids.
     ll. “ On the Automatic Registration of Magnetometers and Me
teorological Instruments by Photography."—No. lll. By Charles
 Brooke, M.B., F.R.S.
     The author describes the construction of an apparatus for regis
tering the variation of the thermometer and psychrometer on one
sheet of paper. As in the apparatus for registering the vertical force
 magnetometer, described in a former paper, the photographic paper
 is placed between two concentric cylinders, placed with the axis ver
 tical, and carried round on a revolving plate or turn-table by the
 hour-hand of a time-piece, which makes half a revolution in twenty
 four hours; thus each half of the paper presents a record of the
 variation of one instrument during twenty-four hours.              The scales
 of the instruments are continuously impressed on the paper by placing
 <U+FB01>ne wires opposite each degree across the aperture through which
 the light falls on the stem; the light transmitted by the empty bore
 is intercepted by these wires, and the darkened portion of the paper
 is marked by a series of parallel pale lines corresponding to each
 degree: thus the distortion of the scale arising from the varying di
  rection of the pencils of light is corrected.         Every tenth degree is
  marked      a coarser wire, and therefore a broader line, as also the
           by
 points 32 , 54°, 76°, 98° ; one at least of these points will occur on
 each register, and the position of the extra broad line serves to iden
 tify the partof the scale to which the register relates.
   - An alteration in the mode of
                                       adjusting the wickof the camphine
 lamps   described  in a former  paper is mentioned, by which the chance
                                                                    4

of smoking is considerably diminished; likewise the successful ap
plication of naphthalized gas, and of an oil-lamp, to photographic
registration.
   The paper concludes with the description of a new method of de
termining the scale and temperature coe<U+FB02>icients of the force magne
tometers, by which a greater degree of accuracy is presumed to be
attained than by the methods ordinarily employed.       Two magnets,
designed for self-registering instruments for the observatories at Cam
bridge and Toronto, having been submitted to this method, gave con
sistent results which indicate the law of the temperature coe<U+FB01>icient to
 be sensibly different from that which has hitherto been assumed.
    12. “ On certain Properties of the Arithmetical Series whose ulti
mate differences are constant."     By Sir Frederick Pollock, Lord
Chief-Baron of the Exchequer, F.R.S. &c.
   This paper professes to investigate certain properties of the series
of whole numbers whose ultimate di<U+FB02>erences are constant, and inci
dentally to treat of Fermat’s theorem of the polygonal numbers, and
some other properties of numbers.     .
   Its object is to show that the same (or an analogous) property
which Fermat discovered in the polygonal numbers belongs to other
series of the same order, also to all series of the <U+FB01>rst order, and pro
bably to all series of all orders.  It also proposes to prove the <U+FB01>rst
case of Fermat’s theorem (that is of the triangular numbers) from
the second case of the squares (which had not before been done),
and to dispense with the elaborate proof of Legendre (Théorie des
 Nombres), <U+FB01>nally, to prove all the cases by a method different from
 that either of Lagrange, Euler, or Legendre.
    It is <U+FB01>rst shown that an analogous property belongs to all series
 of the <U+FB01>rst order (viz. common arithmetical series). The following
 propositions are then proved as the basis of future reasoning :
    1. Every triangular number greater than 6 is composed of 3 tri
 angular numbers.
    2. Every triangular number greater than 3 is composed of      tri
                                                                  4.-
 angular numbers.
              triangular  number may be expressed by the form
( u   ia+
        Any)?
        The sum of any two triangular numbers may be expressed by
t   eh4'.
      same form.
    5. Every number above        the sum of four triangular numbers
                                  7
                                  is
 exactly.
    6. Every number above 29      the sum of three triangular numbers
                                      is
 exactly.
     7. Every multiple of     composed of eight odd squares, and the
                               8
                            is is
 sum of any   8   odd squares
                            a   multiple of 8.
    8. The following general theorem     then proved :—
                                            is
    Ifp be any odd square, then
                      Ap’+ Bp’    +   Cp‘ + Dp” + &c.
 will equal   8   odd squares,   if
                            A+B+C+D+,            &c.

                                         858
equal 8, or any multiple of8 (A, B, C, D, 61c., 2, y, 1, &c , may be
any positive whole numbers).
   9. It is a corollary from this, that in any system of notation having
an odd square for its base, the sum of the digits will have the same
number of odd squares as the number itself; the number of odd
squares being in each case the minimum.
   10. Any number of the form Sn-+4 is composed of 4- odd squares.
   ll.  It follows from this that every number is composed of 4- tri
angular numbels, or 8, 2 or l.
   12. From this it is shown that every number is of the form
                                                                 i
                           (a"'ia-|>-11',   (."ic+ 11’).
   IS. And that every number of the form 4-n+2 (if n be greater
than 2) is composed of 4- square numbers, 2 even and 2 odd.
   14-. And that every number greater than 27 is composed of 8
squares exactly.
   I5. Every number (beyond a certain small limit) is composed of
2 triangular numbers + a square number, or 2 triangular numbers
+ a double triangular number.
   16. A proof is then offered that in the equation 8n+4=4- odd
squares, one of the four odd squares may be any odd square less than
811+-4-, and therefore 1 may be one of the 4- odd squares; and if so,
                     811+!-=1 +3 odd squares,
                      .'.8n+8=3 odd squares,
from which Fermat's theorem of the triangular numbers is an im
mediate corollary.
   l7. A proof (by a tabular series) is then suggested, that all the
other cases of Fermat's theorem may be deduced from the <U+FB01>rst, and
that it is not necessary to use more than four terms greater than
unity (as discovered by M. Cauchy, see Suppl. to Legendre's
Théorie des Nombres, p. 2|,
   18. A general expression for a succession of series is then given—
           1,(p+l),(Sp-i-1),(6p+l)&c.(n:g'np+l);
and it is proved that any number may be composed of not exceed
ing]1+2 terms of the series, of which three only are required to be
greater than unity.       If p=9, the series is l, I0, 28, 55, &c., that is
every third triangular number beginning with 1 ; and every number
of the form 9n+q consists of q triangular numbers not divisible by
8 (if q be greater than 2).
   Ifp=8, the series is l, 9, 25, 4-9, &c.
   I9. (The odd squares) and every number may be composed, ofnot
exceeding 10 odd squares. Ifp=6, the series becomes I, 7, 19, 37 &c.
(the differences between the cubes).              From the continued addition
of the terms of this series, the cube numbers may be formed.
   Ifp=4-, the series is 1, 5, 18, 25 &c., or
                     1,  (l  +4-), (4-+9),      (9+ 16), &c.
The continued addition of the terms of this series forms the octo
hedral numbers, viz.      1, 6, 19,   4-4-, &c.
                                                                   43

                                      854‘
    Every term of the    series is composed     of (p+ l) prior      terms ;  also
 if q be added to any term it will equal (q+ 1) prior terms.
    20. It is then proved that the property of the triangular numbers
 is not destroyed by adding any (the same) number to each term,                  it
 is merely postponed, and commences at a           higher number according
 to the magnitude of the number added.
    21. The same is proved in respect of the addition of any common
 arithmetical series.
    22. The paper concludes by suggesting a proof that every number
 may be composed of 4'triangular numbers, derived from the considera
tion that if the triangular numbers be indexed or numbered thus-—
                1      2       3       4       5 &c.    indices.
                1      3       6      10       15 &c. A“ nos.
 Any number between 2 triangular numbers can be formed by 4
triangular numbers, the sum of whose indices shall be not less than
 the sum of the indices of the4- triangular numbers that compose the
 smaller triangular number, and not greater than the similar indices
 of the larger; and generally (after a limited number of terms) the
 sum of the indices of any intermediate number will be exactly the
 sum of the indices of the smaller number: to illustrate this, all the
numbers between 91 and 105 (2 triangular numbers) are shown to
 consist of 4- triangular numbers, whose indices exactly equal 25,
 which is the sum of the indices of the 4- triangular numbers into
which 91 may be divided—
                                    6      6    6     7
                        thus  9I=2l     +21 +21 +28
the sum of the indices 6+6-l-6+7=25; and every number be
tween 91 and 105 may be composed of 4- triangular numbers, whose
indices added together will equal 25; but the nature of this inves
tigation cannot be made intelligible without reference to the table
itself, which the paper contains.
    If this attempt is successful, the whole of Fermat's theorem of the
polygonal numbers may be proved without reference to Lagrange's
proof of the case of the squares (the second case) derived from the
properties of the prime numbers. The writer intimates an intention
of making further communications on the same subject.
    13. “On the Analysis of Numerical Equations."             By   J. R. Young,
Esq., Professor of Mathematics in Belfast College.‘ Communicated
by Sir John W. Lubbock, Bart., F.R.S. &c.
    The object of this communication is to diminish the labour at
tendant upon existing methods for the analysis of numerical equa
tions.    As Budan pointed out intervals, within the bounds of the
extreme limits of the roots of an equation, in which all search for
roots would be fruitless, so here the author seeks for what he terms
“ rejective intervals" among those which Budan had retained. This
he proposes effecting by transforming the <U+FB01>rst member of every
equation X=0 into
          X={F+ ~/F?-X}          >< {F- s/F’-X}           .   .  .    .  .
                                                                             (1.)

which factors, F is entirely arbitrary. On account of this unre
stricted character of F, innumerable changes may be effected on a
pair of conjugate factors, without disturbing their product: but it
is from the following expression of these factors that the general
results in this paper are chie<U+FB02>y deduced: namely,
            X={F+f+                                                            (2)

                     ~/1s-+-1|-f+f'-x}}
from which it follows that, having decomposed           function  into    X
                                                               anly
a pair of conjugate factors (l.), we may always a terwards add any
quantity,    to the rational part of each factor; provided we, at the
            j,
same  time, introduce the expression 2lf/'+f* under the radical: and
it    upon this general truth that the results in the paper entirely
     is
depend, and from which the rrjec<U+FB01>ve interval: are discovered.
   The value of the principle      illustrated by examples taken from
                                              is
Sruau, Fouiusn, and others; and some general theorems are de
duced--applicable to all equations—in reference to the existence
of imaginary roots, which furnish some remarkably simple criteria.

imaginary.
   The paper concludes with some general propositions, derivable
from the principles established in the preceding investigations,
and which the author conceives to be of value in the analysis of
equations.
       “ On some Phenomena and Motions of Metals under the in
     14-.
<U+FB02>uence of Magnetic Force." By William Sykes Ward,             Com
municated by William West, Esq., F.R.S.
   In the course of some experiments relative to the principal phe
nomena of dia-magnetism, the author observed that the nature or
direction of the action upon many metals varied with the intensity
of the magnetic force, the effects being in accordance with the ob
servations of Professor Pl<U+FB01>cker; and in pursuing his researches with
the view to ascertain how far the magnetic and dia-magnetic forces
might be coexistent in the same metal, other phenomena dependent
on the power of the magnet presented themselves.
   On submitting gold, silver, lead, tin, zinc and cadmium to the
action of the electro-magnet when excited by an electric current of
moderate strength, or when the polar terminations of the magnet

                                  856
were at a distance not less than an inch, these metals pointed axially.
When the battery power was somewhat increased and the poles
brought nearer to each other, instead ofthe metal being more strongly
attracted, it became less sensible to either attraction or repulsion,
becoming very sluggish in its motions; but when the magnet was
well-excited and the polar terminations brought within a quarter of
an inch of each other, most of those metals pointed decidedly equa
torially, and were repelled as dia-magnetics.
   The author found that the phenomenon of revulsion, described by
Faraday and more particularly noticed by him in copper, was exhi
bited in nearly all metals which are less magnetic than platinum, or
less dia-magnetic than antimony, and noticed that the direction of
the revulsive motion is different in magnetic and in dia-magnetic
metals. He also noticed that in metals, whether pure or compound,
which changed from the magnetic to the dia-magnetic state, the di
rection of the revulsion changed.
   Experiments are next described which were instituted for the
purpose of ascertaining the order in which different metals are af
fected magnetically or dia-magnetically.
   Phenomena are also described which present themselves when
the polar terminations are from 0'25 inch to 0'1 inch apart, and
a disc of metal is so suspended that one-half of it is between
and the other half beyond these terminations.         If the metal be
amongst those classed as magnetic, or be magnetically affected by
the power employed, it is attracted, and after the <U+FB01>rst motion has
subsided, clings to one of the polar pieces; if the metal be dia-mag
netic, it is repelled and in many instances driven entirely out from
between the poles.     At the instant of the completion of the voltaic
circuit, the disc of metal moves transversely, with a tendency to pass
outwards from between the poles; and on breaking the circuit, the
disc moves transversely in the contrary direction. The directions of
these transverse motions are alike in all metals which do not become
so strongly attracted by the magnetic in<U+FB02>uence as to cling <U+FB01>rmly to
one of the polar terminations, being in the same direction with pla
tinum and palladium as with antimony and bismuth; but they are
exhibited with greatest force by those metals which decidedly show
revulsion.
    The author makes various hypothetical assumptions in order to
explain the phenomena he has described; and, in conclusion, states
his opinion, “that the metals which have been observed to change
from the magnetic to the dia-magnetic state are subject to three dif
ferent conditions of molecular arrangement: the <U+FB01>rst, one of mag
netic polarity, and which on its cessation only induces a feeble elec
tric current; the second, the intermediate or sluggish state, in which
the metal is not polarized so as to be either attracted or repelled by
the magnet, but in which there is nevertheless so great a molecular
disturbance that very powerful electric currents are induced on its
discontinuance ; and the third, in which the particles are so polarized
as to be repelled by the poles of the magnet which has induced such
condition, but which last condition does not, on its discontinuance,
induce powerful electric currents."

 r
     GENTLEMEN,
 Foa    some years there seemed to have been an increasing desire that
 the important business transacted on the 30th of November should
 be transferred to a meeting in June.
     Strong reasons were urged in favour of the change. It was said
 that when St. Andrew’s day was selected, the London season com
 menced much earlier than it now does, and that it was then probably
 the time when London was most full, and when there was reason to
  expect the largest attendance; that now, on the contrary, the Fel
 lows who reside a part of the year in the country, are almost all out
  of town in November, and that practically therefore the burden and
 responsibility of very important duties is thrown upon a section of
  the Society, that portion of the Fellows who permanently reside in
  London; that in awarding the Medals in November, just after the
  vacation, there was this great inconvenience, that very nice ques
  tions often arising in weighing the con<U+FB02>icting claims of different in
   dividuals, the Membersof Council were under the disadvantage of
  having had but few opportunities of mutually conferring on the sub
   ject, while they were without that assistance, which, if the Medals
   were awarded in June, they might derive from hearing the opinions

                                     K59
    of the many distinguished men of science, who, coming from the
   universities, or their varied occupations in the country, are usually
   to be found in the metropolis after En.-ter. Other reasons were
   assigned more or less cogent, and in ls-l5 it was announced that
   the Council had concurred in the expediency of changing the Anni
   versary from November to June.       In lb-lti nothing was done; but
   in I847 it was settled that there should be annually n General
   Meeting in Junic, the bilsirtces being the election of thc Fellows;
   the presentation of the Medals ; the annual Address of the President,
   and the annual Obituary. Great doubts having arisen whether, with
  out n new Charter, the time for the election of the Council and U<U+FB02>icers
  could legally be altered, in that respect no change was made.      The
  following year the <U+FB01>rst of the June meetings took placc ; the Fellows
  were then elected under the new regulations; and had my distin
  guished predecessor continued in otiice, with his long experience
  and thorough knowledge of the business of the Society, the changes
  resolved upon would probably have been fully curried out in June
  1849.     However, as June approached there were evidently di<U+FB02>icul
  ties; the time appeared to be too short for due deliberation in the
  award of the Medals, and even for procuring the necessary informa
  tion for the obituaries, and there seemed to be no other choice but
  to abandon the sttempt on that occasion of anticipating in June the
 business of the November Meeting.
      That the wishes of the Society were not fully carried out in June
  1849, was probably owing to my inexperience: it certainly was not
 owing to any want of zeal, or to an indistinct perception of the im
 portance of the change which had been resolved upon. To have con
 sidered uny change resolved upon by Council unimportant, would
 have been impossible; but in this instance the reasons which had
 been assigned for the change appeared to me to have been rather
 under than overstated.       Even the mere question of convenience,
 constituted as society is in this country, is of obvious importance.
 How many young men of great ability, and perhaps ample fortune
 and high position, destined, as we might have <U+FB02>attered ourselves, to
 render science essential service, who having obtained the honours
which our universities award to great scienti<U+FB01>c merit, have forsaken
science at once!       Had they sought admission here, no doubt we
should have gladly welcomed them ; and once fairly enlisted in the
cause and actively employed, there is something so inspiriting in
the example of others, something in the power of association so
eminently calculated to draw forth all the exertions of which human
nature is capable, that there would have been little danger of their
ever afterwards abandoning scienti<U+FB01>c pursuits.
     To such men, with their country pursuits, n November Session is
inconvenient; quite as much so as to a member of Parliament.          To
transact the most important business of       the  year in November,   is
almost perhaps to repel them from our ranks.
     The presentation of the Medals, and the reading of the Memoirs
of deceased Fellows, having been postponed till November, the Ad
                                                 r
dress was postponed also.                                    -

                                    860
    It would have been impossible, however, to have suffered the <U+FB01>rst
opportunity, that of the June Meeting, to have passed by, without
expressing to the Fellows then present my deep sense of obligation
for the honour they had conferred upon me, and without thanking
the Council individually and collectively, for the kind manner in
which they had been always most ready to assist. I am anxious now
in a more formal manner to return my thanks, both to the Society
and to the Council.
    It was not without considerable doubt and apprehension that I
ventured to undertake the duties of President: the doubts did not
arise from any exaggerated estimate of the di<U+FB02>iculty of the duties to
be performed, from any mistaken idea that acquirements at once the
most varied and the most profound were necessary. Had I thought
 so, without a moment’s hesitation I should have declined the o<U+FB02>ice,
knowing there were other Fellows whose quali<U+FB01>cations would have
 approached more nearly the required standard; but I did appre
 hend that it would not be in my power, or indeed in the power of
 any one actively engaged in the pursuit of practical astronomy, to
 give that amount of personal attendance during the winter months
 which might be required, not perhaps for the transaction of real
 business, but as a proper mark of respect from the President to the
 Society.    It is only during the long dark nights, when there is a
 clear sky and no moon, that effective search can be made in the re
 mote regions of the universe; and as favourable opportunities are
 rare, and once lost are sometimes lost for the season, frequent abs
 ence from the observatory during the winter would very seriously
 interfere with the progress of Nebular Astronomy. After Easter the
 nights are short; comparatively little can be done; the work is
 light, and may safely be entrusted to the care of an able assistant.
 When therefore it was intimated to me, most unexpectedly, that my
 name had been mentioned in connection with the vacancy about to
 be created by the retirement of Lord Northampton, I at once apprised
 my friends who were on the spot of the doubts and di<U+FB02>iculties I felt,
 and above all, that nothing would be to me a source of more pro
 found regret, than if elected, to <U+FB01>nd myself unable fully to meet the
 wishes of the Society.       In return, having received the strongest
 assurances, that under all the circumstances the Society would make
 great allowance, and that constant attendance after Easter, and
 attendance on such other occasions as real business required it,
 would be deemed quite su<U+FB02>icient, my doubts were removed, and I
 resolved, if elected, at least to do my utmost to meet your wishes.
 The soirées had previously been held before Easter; but in that
 there was no di<U+FB02>iculty, as all seemed to concur that after Easter
 would be quite as convenient.        To the soirées I attach much im
 portance : I think it very important that scienti<U+FB01>c men should have
 an opportunity of meeting each other: I think it very desirable in
 this country that classes should be brought together, and therefore
  l am convinced that my predecessor acted wisely in extending the
  invitations to his soirées beyond the precincts of the Royal Society.
  I further think that the soirées should be on such a scale, and so

                                   86l
conducted, as to appear to foreigners who honour them with their
attendance, in every respect suitable to the position our Society
maintains as the head of English science.
   The aoirfn were last season for the <U+FB01>rst time hold here. ln the
spring of I848, during the Presidency of Lord Northampton. the Uni
versity of London had been good enough to offcr to lcnd three rooms
adjoining our meeting-room for the President to hohl his soirér:. The
offer was gladly accepted, and in pursuance of that arrangement in
the spring of I849. the cards were issued for the <U+FB01>rst time from
Somerset House.      Herc there is nmplc space, and whcrc the invita
tions are so numerous there is a possibility of a larger attendance on
some one night than any ordinary lnndon house could contain,
without the greatest inconvenience.      Whether the change upon the
whole was pleasing to the great majority of the Socirty or not, I
have as yet been unable to ascertain; but at the <U+FB01>rst zoirés, hud
there been any trustworthy indication of the contrary, the thrcc rc
maining soirfes should have been held, as formerly, at the house of
the President.
    I have great pleasure in informing you that I have received a coin
munication from the First Lord of the Treasury which I have had
the honour of laying before the Council.        Lord John Russell pro
poses, that at the close of the year. the President and Council should
point out to the First Lord of thc'l'rcasury a limited number of per
sons, to whom the grant of a reward, or of a sum to defray the cost
of experiments, might be of essential service. He states. that the
whole sum he could recommend the Crown to grant in the present
year is one thousand pounds, and that he cannot be certain that his
successor would follow the same course.
    Your Council have gladly accepted the offer made to thcm, as a
means of promoting the advance of scienti<U+FB01>c knowledge; and they
have felt particularly grati<U+FB01>ed by it, as an indication of the conti
dence reposed in them by Her .\lajesty's Government.
    lt is a source of extreme regret to me that I am unable to con
 gratulate you on the return to his country of our long absent Fellow
 Sir John Franklin. who, with Captain Crozicr, also one of our Fel
 lows, and his other gallant companions, are now spending their <U+FB01>fth
 winter in the Arctic Regions. You will remember that it was partly
 at the recommendation of the Council of the Royal Society that the
 expedition under Sir John F ranklin’s command was desputehcd by
 the Admiralty, for the purpose of making one more effort to solve
 the problem of the North-West Passage, which has engaged the at
 tention of England for three centuries.
    We are therefore deeply interested in the successful issue of that
 enterprise. The researches of Sir James Ross prove beyond all rea
 sonable doubt, that the missing expedition must have succeeded in
 attaining the western or south-western side of Melville island ; foras
 Sir James Ross selected Port Leopold for his winter-quarters, which
 is at the junction of the four great channels of Barrow Strait, Lan
 caster Sound, Prince Regent Inlet, and Wellington Channel, it was
 scarcely possible for any parties from the missing expedition to have

/                                     862
  travelled eastward from Melville Island without falling in with Sir
  James Ross’s expedition.     If however SirJohn Franklin should aban
  don his ships and take an easterly course, it is most satisfactory to
  know that he will <U+FB01>nd at Port Leopold a store of provisions for twelve
  months, with fuel and other necessaries, together with the steam
  launch of the Investigator, which has been lengthened and made
  available for the transport of Sir John Franklin and his party to
  meet the whaling ships in Lancaster Sound.
     The great attention which the important subject of terrestrial mag
  netism has received from your Foreign Secretary, Colonel Sabine,
  and other members of the Society, leads me to mention that Lieu
  tenant M'Clintoch, under the instructions of Sir James Ross, availed
  himself of his proximity to the magnetic pole to make several mag
  netical observations which are of very great value.
     Sir John Richardson, with his companion Mr. Rae, examined the
  coast-line of North America, between the Mackenzie and Copper
  mine rivers, without <U+FB01>nding any traces of the missing ships, or hear
  ing any tidings of them from the numerous bodies of Esquimanx
  with whom they had interviews. Mr. Rae was instructed to resume
  the search in the summer of this year, and to direct his course north
  wards, between Victoria and Wollaston lands, and to penetrate, if
  possible, to the northern shores of Banks’s land. The results of this
  attempt will be known in England in May next.
     During the winter of 1848—49, Sir John Richardson and Mr. Rae
  were occupied in making experiments on the magnetic force and
  intensity with Lloyd’s declinometer, and they kept meteorological
  journals, including the record of the movements of a Delcros baro
  meter, which was carried without injury through the interior, and
  brought back in safety to England.
     It is scarcely necessary to assure you that your Council have
  watehed with very great solicitude, the efforts made by these emi
  nent and able oi<U+FB01>cers to relieve Sir John Franklin and his party; and
  although those endeavours have not produced the desired results,
  yet your Council is most unwilling to abandon hope, and they have
  felt it their duty to request the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty
  to call a meeting of those naval o<U+FB02>icers who have served in the Arctic
  expeditions, in order that they may deliberate and report to their
  Lordships respecting the best measures to be taken under existing
  circumstances, to continue and bring to a successful issue the search
  for the missing expedition; and feeling con<U+FB01>dent that every means
  will be tried which the vast resources and energies of this great na
  tion command, l do sincerely trust that it will be my pleasing task,
  when addressing you again from this chair at our next Anniversary,
  to report, that under the blessing of Almighty Providence, the en
  durance and skill of British seamen have triumphed over all those
  formidable di<U+FB02>iculties which make the Arctic Regions a scene of trial
  and danger.
     During the past year, or even for a longer period, the progress of
  scienti<U+FB01>c discovery abroad appears to have been less striking than
  usual.     The gentle excitement of science is too feeble to hold pos

                                        861$
   session of the mind amidst great political cliangcs, and politics no
   sooner intrude than science is forccd to retire. Still, under very un
  favourable circumstances, our neighbours, l think, have dls|llnvrtl a
  greater amount of scienti<U+FB01>c energy than perhaps the most stinguinc
  could have ventured to anticipate.
       \\'ithout attempting to give an outline of the progress of foreign
  science. which would occupy too much time, or prcten|ling to assign
  the order of merit to the achievements of the distinguished men to
  whom that progress is duc. it is impos.-ihle not to direct e.-|)eClnl
  attention to the remarkable I’estarCllcs of Weber on l'llectrodyna
  mical Measures; a work where we have a happy combination of
  applied mathematics. ingenious device, and judicious cxperimcnt,
  resulting in important discoveries. His work commcncvs with a de
  scription of a new and very ingenious instrument. which he calls an
  Electrodynamometer.        It consists of two coils of <U+FB01>ne wire. the smaller
  of which is suspended within the other by a bi<U+FB01>lar suspension, so
  that their centres coincide, and their axes are at right angles.         llc
 calls the latter " the multiplier," the other " the bi<U+FB01>lar (or rather sus
 pended) coil."       They are so connected, that the current to be exa
 mined traveraing the multiplier, passes by the suspending wires
 through the suspended coil, which turns by lllrir mutual action
 through an angle whose tangent measures the intensity of their ac
 tion.       The anglc is measured as in the German magnetometers, by
 observing with a telescope the rc<U+FB02>cxion of a scale placed at a con
 siderable distance in the mirror. carried by the bitilar coil. The
 action between the coils is as the square of the intensity of the cur
 rent, whilc that exerted on the needle of a rheomcter is simply as
 the intensity.
      lst. He obtains absolute measures of the intensity by the use of a
 small magnetometer, whose magnet is a steel mirror, which is placed
 at a proper distance. and de<U+FB02>ected by the action of the <U+FB01>xed coil,
 “ or
        multiplier," according to the principles laid down by Gauss, and
 thus refers them to the earth's magnetism as a standard.
     'lad. He applies this instrument to verify Ampi~rc's fundamental
law of electrodynamics, and from it he computes the action of u single
ring on another, in three different relative positions of their centres,
the last being where they coincide, as in this instrument; and <U+FB01>nally,
he computes the mutual action of combinations of such rings.               ln
each the action is as the square of the intensity multiplied by a con
stant, which is a function of the dimensions of the coils, and the
distance of their centres; and he <U+FB01>nds that the computed deviations
agree with the observed with an error never exceeding four seconds
of   space.
    3rd. He applies the instrument to measure the intensity of an in
duced current, thus :—Let the suspended coil be made to oscillate
round its vertical axis, while a constant current is passed through
the <U+FB01>xed coil; if the extremities of the former be connected. u cur
rent is induced in it, which changes its direction twice in each os
cillation, and which therefore shortens the aro of oscillation.          Ob
serve the decrements of this arc under the in<U+FB02>uence of the current,

                                   864
and of a pair of magnets placed symmetrically, and parallel to the
axis of the suspended coil; thus we have the relative intensi<U+FB01>es of
the induced currents, and the intensities of the inducing forces are
obtained by observing the de<U+FB02>ections which they produce on that
coil, excited by passing a feeble current through it.
    4th. The instrument may be applied in conjunction with the rheo
meter, to determine the intensity and duration of instantaneous cur
rents.   In the latter instrument the moment of rotation is as the
intensity; in the former as its square. The angular velocities gene
rated in them are as these moments and the time; but also as the
times of oscillation inversely, and the extreme swings of each di
rectly.   It follows therefore that we have two equations from which
the intensity and the time can be determined.              He illustrates
this by measuring the time of the discharge of a Leyden battery
through a moistened cord, and points out other applications of im
portauce.
    5th. The instrument differs from the rheometer in not being
afffected by the direction of the current; it therefore will measure
currents whose direction changes rapidly, and which therefore would
produce no visible effect in the rheometer, as they neutralize each
other's action in it. Such alternation currents may exist; they would
be a vibration of the electricity, not a progress of it.     He suggests
that the undulations of light might produce effects     of this kind, and
 gives as an example the action of the sound waves: a bar of steel
properly arranged being made to sound, de<U+FB02>ections of twenty or
 thirty divisions of the scale are produced. To go into the develop
 ment of the theory by which he deduces, from axioms given by ob
 servation, the laws of electrodynamic action, would occupy too much
 time; and I will only add, that he generalizes Ampére’s law, and
 transforms it into one depending on electric mass, velocity and di
 stance.   From this he deduces the theory of constant currents and
 that of Volta-induction in all its cases.   The slight account I have
 given of Weber's researches, conveys but a very inadequate idea of
 their importance ; a more detailed notice would have been unsuitable
 to the present occasion.
     A most important contribution has recently been given by Pro
 fessor Dove to the science of Meteorology—his maps of the monthly
 isothermal lines of the globe.     ln 1847 he communicated to the
 British Association a table of the mean temperature of 800 stations,
 for every month of the year, and to it he has since added 84 stations.
 From this table he has constructed his maps. In the memoir which
 accompanies the maps, he explains shortly, but clearly, his methods
 of proceeding; he had previously communicated them at length to
 the Berlin Academy. He also deduces from the facts brought to light
 by his extensive generalizations, new views of peculiar interest in
 their bearing on the science of Climatology.     To have separated the
 annual mean heat received from the sun into its invariable monthly
 proportions, or those of season, was, as it appears to me, a great step,
  the greatest probably that has hitherto been made in the science of
 Climatology.     It affords the key to the scienti<U+FB01>c understanding of

                                    f\'(i:'r
the conditions of climate, which arc found to vary so greatly cven
in the same latitude and at the same clcva!inns. and affect so im
portantly all organic creation.        The generalization of a vast muss
of material has been ably carried out, and in the true spirit of lnduc
tive philosophy.
    The <U+FB01>rst volume of s great work by the distinguished philosopher
Dr. G. S. Ohm has just reached us : he calls it his Molecular Physics,
and dedicates it to the Royal Society as an acknowledgement of his
obligations to us, for that praise and encouragement which sustained
him in his arduous labours.       He received the Copley Medal in l84l.
    While science has progressed abroad. at home it has not remained
 stationary.    Sir \Nilliam Hamilton's daring conception of a new
 system of imaginarics, and the successful application which he has
 made of it to the Geometry of three dimensions, have. as might have
 been expected. given rise to other speculations of the same nature.
 The <U+FB01>rst of these fruits of the theory of Quaternions was the triple
 algebra of Professor De Morgan (Cambridge Philosophical Transac
 tions, l8-l7).    The aim which the author proposed to himself was to
 frame systems of imaginary trinomials, in which the rules of operation
 should be the same as in ordinary algebra; and accordingly he makes
 it an essential condition that the cosunulatios property of multipliers
 (abandoned in the theory of Quatemions) should be maintained.
 The memoir is highly suggestive. The general and analytical cha
 racter of the author's treatment of the subject adds much to its in
 trinsic interest. Thc subject is however regarded on the algebraic side;
 and the'question of geometric interpretation is hardly considered.
     Professor Graves, on the other hand, has taken up the problem of
 the imaginary trinomials in its geosurtrical aspect (Proceedings of the
 Royal lrish Academy 1845); his object being " to frame for the Geome
 try of three dimensions a theory strictly analogous to that by which
 Mr. Warren has succeeded in representing the combined lengths and
  directions of right lines in a plane."     The new distribution symbols
  of operation employed by Mr. Graves are imaginary cube roots of
  positive unity.    His system is closely allied to one of those proposed
  by  Professor De  Morgan, but appears to lend itself more readily to
  geometric interpretations.
     This part of the subject comes under the head of "Symbolical
  Geometry,"-—a science, the <U+FB01>rst step of which was made by M. Ar
  gand, in the geometrical interpretations of the sign +, and which
  Sir William Hamilton has done so much to mature and perfect, in
  connection with his theory of Quaternions.
     A symbolical method differing in many of its details has been re
  cently proposed by Professor O'Brien (Cambridge Philosophical
  Transactions, 1847), and exempli<U+FB01>ed in its application to the theory
  of the vibratory motions of an elastic medium.
     The department of applied mathematics, which appears to have
  made the most important advances within the last few years, is the
  theory of the motions of <U+FB02>uids and elastic solids.         T he theory of
  <U+FB02>uid motions had until recently been restricted by the hypothesis,
  that the action of two adjacent elements was normal to the separating

                                        866
   surface.     It therefore failed to embrace the laws of those motions
   which depend upon the tangential forces called into play by sliding,
   and was accordingly inapplicable to many important cases of <U+FB02>uid mo
   tions; such for example as the motions of water in pipes and canals.
   M. Navier was the <U+FB01>rst to free the theory of hydrodynamics from
   this embarrassing restriction, and to give the corrected equations of
   <U+FB02>uid motion, friction being taken into account.              In this he was
   followed by     M.  Poisson,  in   memoir                in the  ' Journal de
                                    a          published
  l’Ecole Polytechnique       ;’ and  the subject     has  recently been ably
   handled by Mr. Stokes, in a paper published in the Cambridge
  Philosophical Transactions, 1847. In the same paper, the author has
  treated also of the theory of motions of elastic solids, and has cor
  rected some of the speculations of Poisson upon the subject.
      The theory of the motion of elastic solids is connected with, and
  taken in its most general form, embraces, that of the luminiferous
  ether; and accordingly we must date from the period of Navier's
  investigations, the laige and rapid generalizations which the wave
  theory of light has received from the hands of Cauchy, Green, and
  M'Cullagh; and the same theory (motions of elastic media) in the
  hands of Mr. Haughton (Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy,
  1849), based upon the comprehensive method of Lagrange, and freed
  from all that is arbitrary and hypothetical, has enabled its author to
  compare together from a higher point of view the theories of light
 just referred to, to explain the grounds of their resemblance, and to
 point out their essential distinctions.
      The connection which has just been referred to, between the theory
 of the motion of elastic solids, and that of the luminiferous ether,
 was long ago dimly perceived, and has ever been regarded as a dif
 <U+FB01>culty in the hypothesis of undulations.          Upon this curious subject
 we may refer to some interesting remarks by Mr. Stokes (Cambridge
 Philosophical Transactions, 1847) in a memoir already referred to,
 which go far to remove the dif<U+FB01>culty.         It is probable, as he remarks,
that the tangential force called into action by a relative displacement
 of the molecules, exists in all bodies; and there are good grounds
for believing that these displacements, in the case of the luminiferous
 ether, are much within the limit at which the molecules would as
 sume a new permanent arrangement, and thus exhibit the property
 of <U+FB02>uidity.
      Before leaving this subject, we must not omit to notice the new
treatment of the wave theory of light in the hands of Prof. Challis
(Cambridge Philosophical Transactions, 1847).               In this theory the
author regards the ether as a continuous <U+FB02>uid substance, and applies
to it the usual equations of hydrodynamics.            It is assumed to be of
the same uniform density and elasticity, within and without the
medium ; and the diminished velocity of propagation is supposed to
be due to the obstacles which the atoms of the medium oppose to
the free motion of the etherial particles.           A polarized ray in this
theory     is that in which  the  condensation  of  the  ether is unsymmetri
cal relatively to the axis of the ray.
     Instruments are essential in the purely experimental sciences; and

                                   367
even in the physical scienccs most dependent on applied mathema
 tics. sooner or later n stage is arrived at when for further progress
instruments are of vital importance.
     \\'ithout instruments even the theory of g'rnvitation would have
been little more than n sublime speculation; rind the lhcory of light
at the present moment is perhaps in that condition when that ma
thematicinn would effect the most who best prepared the way for
judicious and re<U+FB01>ned experiments.        Such being the importance of
instruments. this Society I nm sure cannot have failed to take n lively
 interest in the improvements in progress st (ircenwich.         In I8-13,
 the Astronomer Royal proposed that an altitude snd azimuth instru
 ment should be constructed with s peculiar adaptation of materials,
so ns to secure as fnr as possible exemption from change, and so make
it praeticahle to observe with great accuracy nt n distance from the
meridisn. The object wns n very important one; to procure n more
extensive. and n more complete series of lunar observations: and
when we recollect that Greenwich has had the honour of supplying
the world with the best series of lunnr observations extant, that upon
that series the lunar theory and the lunar tables rest, surely it was
an object, if not of national pride. at least of great scienti<U+FB01>c interest,
that in that department of astronomy at least nothing should be
wanting which could add to the e<U+FB02>iciency of the National Observa
tory. The instrument was soon after commenced, designed by the
 Astronomer Royal; it has now been for some time in use, and I
believe fully answers the purpose.
     lt had been found that the meridian instruments were of insu<U+FB01>cient
optical power for observing the minute planets, and the faint stars
used as stars of comparison.     In consequence, the Astronomer Royal
 designed n transit circle to carry an object-glass of eight inches
aperture, and twelve-and-n-half feet focus; to be made of cast iron,
 with the same precautions against change which had been found so
 effectual in the altitude and azimuth instrument.       Cast iron, being
 stiffer than brass and expanding less with heat, possesses greet ad
 vantsgee; and unless it shall be found to be more liable to permanent
 change of <U+FB01>gure under moderate strain, it will probably hereafter
 enter very largely into the construction of astronomical instruments.
 The great transit circle is in progress, and when completed no doubt
 it will be worthy of the place it is destined to hold among the
 Greenwich instruments.
     Important however as these new instruments will be as u menus
 of making better and more numerous observations at Greenwich, I
 think they are still more important to science, as unquestionable in
 dieations of progress in the construction of astronomical instruments
 in this country. Traditional routine seems here for many years to
 have kept us behind our continental rivals in this noblest department
 of mechanical art. Astronomers above-all other persons are apt to
 cling with pertinacity to the imagined perfection of their instruments
 and methods; and the artists who construct the instruments, con
 scious of their own practical skill, and not unfrequently de<U+FB01>cient in
 the high theoretical knowledge required to guide it, are still more

                                     868
likely to believe themselves infallible. Thus the mural quadrant
kept its ground, long after its liability to excentricity and change of
<U+FB01>gure had been recognized.         The zenith sector is only now losing
its authority; and it was the invariable practice of this country, at
least up to the last twenty years, to rely without examination on the
accuracy of divisions.      The splendid talents and high authority of
Troughton contributed mainly‘to this state of things, and accordingly
as long as it lasted we remained passive; while in other countries,
 especially Germany, they were developing new principles of con
 struction, and new modes of observation.
    Among these may be named,—lst, the system of engine division,
which possesses the advantage of being capable of progressive im
provement, each circle when examined giving the means of impart
ing greater accuracy to that which shall follow it; while original
 division must be liable to an amount of error which will never fall
 below an assignable amount, depending on causes that cannot always
 be estimated.     2nd. The principle of casting circles in one piece, and
 as far   as  possible avoiding that complication of pieces and screw
 work so fatal to permanence of condition, which has been the cha
 racteristic of English instruments.     3rd. The recurrence to extra
 meridional observations, and the use of the collimator in all its forms.
    Notwithstanding the brilliant success with which these changes
 have rewarded the labours of Bessel and Struve, we have been slow
 to recognize their value.     I have therefore had the greatest pleasure
 in directing your attention to the important improvements which
 the Astronomer R/oyal is eifecting in the instrumental apparatus of
 Greenwich : there the instrument-maker and the engineer are, as they
 should be, working imder the guide of high science; and even were
 these instruments, all or any, to be found on longer trial to fall short of
 their <U+FB01>rst promise, I should still regard them as important facts. An
 experiment, when wrought out under the guidance of high intellect
 and extensive knowledge, is scarcely less precious to science in its
 failure than in its success: it precludes further trials in an erring
 direction; it opens out new paths, and clears away impediments, so
 that the next step will far more probably be sure.
     The progress of Physiology and Anatomy during the past year has
 not been marked by any striking discovery, like that of the circula
 tion, or of the functions of the different roots of the nerves, or of the
 vibratile cilia of certain mucous membranes, or of the organization
 and development of the teeth and other supposed extra-vascular
 bodies.     It has been characterized rather by the comprehensive and
 philosophic spirit in which the very numerous, and hitherto perhaps
 too much insulated series of facts have been studied and expanded,
 through the attention of the able cultivators of those sciences being
 evidently attracted more to the points of resemblance and analogy
 than to those of individual and minute di<U+FB01>erences; and by the ra
 pidly advancing proof of the essential unity of the animal and vege
 table divisions of organic nature and of the importance of the ele
 mentary cell, or vesicular form of living matter in the development of
 the various tissues in animals as well as plants.

    The relations of the hepatic cells to the biliary secretion are dis
cussed and illustrated by microscopical examinations, in a paper by
Mr. \\'harton Jones. printed in the second Part of the Philosophical
Transactions for ls-t8; in which Professor Henlé's suggestion, that
the hepatic cells correspond to endogenous cells, is argued to be
correct.
    Dr. Robert Inc has communicated the results of his laborious dis
sections of the nerves of the heart, illustrated by drawings. the ela
borate beauty of which is exempli<U+FB01>ed by the engravings from them,

    A most valuable paper on the structure and development of the
liver, based upon a wide extent of research into its comparative unn
tomy, has been contributed by l)r.Hand<U+FB01>eld Jones to the same part
of the Transactions.
    The anatomical structure and physiology of the papille of the
tongue, in which resides the sense of taste. have received extensive
illustrations by the persevering and ingenious application of the mi
croscope to those organs in the living frog by Dr. \\'aller; the
 peculiar structure of the tongue of this animal adapting it for a
 scrutiny which in most instances can only be made upon the dead
 tissues of animals.
    The concluding paper in the <U+FB01>rst Part of the current volume of the
Transactions. by Professor Owen, gives the results of the application
of his principles for determining the homologies of the vertebrate
skeleton to the complex structures forming the carapace and plastron
of the Chelonian Reptiles; and may be considered as one of the most
 interesting and important links in the chain of illustrations of that
 great principle which is so identi<U+FB01>ed with his labours.     In this ela
 borate communication each element is clearly de<U+FB01>ned and distinctly
 named,——the precise amount of correspondence with the ordinary
 vertebrate skeleton is de<U+FB01>nitely determined to the extent of their
 modi<U+FB01>cati0ns,—and the nature of the supcradded parts is illustrated
 by tracing the growth of the whole from the embryo state.
     ln anatomy the parts must <U+FB01>rst be accurately observed and de
 scribed. but it is essential to its progress as a true science, contra
 distinguished from mere accumulation of recorded facts, that the re
 lations of the parts be determined, not only as they are connected
 with one another in the same body, but as they are modi<U+FB01>ed and re
 peated in different animals.
    When the same part is thus recognized under all its adaptive mo
 di<U+FB01>cations, a de<U+FB01>nite name may be applied to it, or it may be signi<U+FB01>ed
 by a symbol.      The anatomist thereby acquires the power of ex
 pressing propositions of the highest generality in his science in the
 briefest and clearest terms.    The possibility of such an approxima
 tion of anatomy to the nature of the exact sciences can only be
 doubted or rejected by those who have failed to discern, or who deny,
 that a common type or pattern has governed the construction of
 animal bodies.
    The evidence of this fundamental fact has been progressively accu
 mulating since the <U+FB01>rst stimulus to the inquiry was given by the

                                    870
early anatomical essays of the poet Goethe ; and it may con<U+FB01>dently
be stated that the most characteristic feature in the recent progress
of anatomical science, has been the establishment of the principle, as
applicable to the vertebrated classes, in the works,
                                                       “ On the Arche
                                          “
type of the Vertebrate Skeleton," and       On the Nature of Limbs," by
the distinguished author of the memoir already alluded to, On the
Homologies of the Skeleton of the Chelonian Reptiles.
   Several points of interest occur in the progress of Physiological
Botany during the past year.
   Profesor Schleiden, in the new edition of the <U+FB01>rst volume of his
" Grundziige der Botanik," modi<U+FB01>es the opinions he formerly held on
the subject of cell-formation.     He now admits with Néigeli, that the
originalcoating formed around the cytoblast is not the cell-membrane,
but a layer of protoplasin, the nitrogenous substance from which a
layer of cellulose is subsequently secreted.     He also admits the di
vision of cells by the separation of the nitrogenous lining of Mohl’s
'
  primordial utricle,’ into two halves, between which a cellulose
membrane is secreted. These views are very different from those
                                                              ‘
propounded in his earlier treatise on Phytogenesis.
   Count Suminski’s remarkable observations on the reproduction of
Ferns have attracted much attention.         The process of generation
described by that author has been questioned in an essay by Dr.
Albert Wigand, who has minutely investigated the subject.            Our
authors have adopted Suminski’s views, but apparently without
having made original observations.
   M. G. Thuret has described organs similar to the supposed an
theridia of Ferns, as found by him on germinating Equiseta.
   M. W. Hofmeister has published an elaborately illustrated memoir
on the Origin of the Embryo of the Phanerogamia; he concurs in the
views of Amici and Mohl.        Mr. Henfrey has communicated to the
Linnaean Society   a  series of  observations, by which he arrived at
similar results;  but  Professor Schleiden still maintains the doctrine
that the apex of the pollen-tube becomes the embryo, and M. Schacht,
who has obtained the prize offered by the Duteh Institute for an
Essay on Vegetable Embryology, advocates the same opinion.           On
the other hand, Professor Unger has published an essay on the de-
velopment of the embryo,in which he directly opposes Prof. Schleiden.
Various other memoirs of interest, on the subject of development of
special structures or of the organs of particular tribes of plants, have
appeared in the Botanical Journals, chie<U+FB02>y from German authors.
   The Discourse on Parthenogenesis, by Prof. Owen, contains points
of much interest to the physiological botanist.
   I have given a very slight and imperfect outline of some of the
recent contributions to the progress of human knowledge; of Che
mistry and of Geology I have said nothing : it would have been im
possible to have entered upon so wide a <U+FB01>eld without extending this
Address far beyond all reasonable limits. Enough, perhaps, has been
said to show that discovery is progressing in a continually accele

      In the absence of Colonel Sabine, who I deeply regret to <U+FB01>nd is
  prevented by severe indisposition from being present, permit me to
  request you to receive the Royal Medal for him. The Medal has been

  Magnetism in our Transactions.          Colonel Sabine has had the pe
  culiar merit of bringing the energies of many to bear upon this im
  portnnt subject. under circumstances the most favourable.
       He, thoroughly acquainted with the instruments best adapted for
  magnetic expeditions, and with their use, took care so to instruct
  the o<U+FB02>icers as to enable them to make observations of a character
  the most trustworthy.
       On shore, or on the ice, nothing more is required than care and
  practical dexterity; at sen there are great di<U+FB02>iculties, and of a new
   class.   The observations are affected by the polar magnetism, the
   momentary induced magnetism of the iron of the ship, and the changes
   of the polar magnetism.       All this was <U+FB01>rst brought to light by
   Colonel Sabine: means were devised by him for obtaining the ne
   cessary corrections, and thus observations at sea were made com
   parable in point of accuracy with observations made on shore.          In
   the theoretical part of this work Colonel Sabine had the valuable
   assistance of Mr. Archibald Smith.
       In Colonel Sabine’a last paper, he collects all the results relating
   to magnetic declination, and embodying them in s map compares
   them with theory, and so makes them at onee available for the use of
   the practical seaman, and the advancement of theoretical mag
   netism.
       l am most happy that the Royal Medal has been conferred on
    Colonel Sabine, not only on account of the great intrinsic value of
   his labours, but as marking the Royal Society's desire to encourage
    the reduction and discussion of the mass of magnetic observations
    which have been collected by government o<U+FB01>iccrs.

    The President then called upon Mr. Bell to read the biographical
notices of some of the deceased Members, which he then handed
to him.
    It is many years since the scienti<U+FB01>c world has had to deplore a
loss so severe as that which it has recently sustained in the death of
Berzelius, whose varied and indefatigable labours for <U+FB01>fty years in
the science of chemistry have rendered his name illustrious through
out the civilized world.
    Jons Jacoa Baaznmus was born on the 20th of August 1779,
the same year in which our own Davy <U+FB01>rst saw the light, at the vil
lage of Wafersunda in East Gothland.           His father was parochial
 schoolmaster in Linkiiping, but died before his son emerged from
boyhood.      At the age of 17 he entered upon the study of Medicine
in the University of Upsal, where, in the laboratory of Afzelius, a
 man little versed in experimental inquiry, and consequently possess
ing but little practical knowledge of his science, the <U+FB01>rst analytical
essays of Berzelius were made.        He was thus necessarily thrown
upon     his own  resources, and compelled to discover for himself, by
re<U+FB02>ection and reading, the explanation of the new and unforeseen
 phenomena which presented themselves in the course of his experi
 ments: with what success he thus applied himself he was soon to
 furnish ample proofs.     In 1798 he passed his examination in Phi
losophy, and shortly after he engaged himself as assistant to a
 physician residing at the baths of Medevi.        A chemical analysis
 of these springs furnished the subject of his <U+FB01>rst scienti<U+FB01>c publica
 tion, which ushered in a series of papers on a variety of most im
 portant topics connected with chemistry, and which followed each
 other in rapid succession during the remainder of his long and valuable
life.
     In 1804 he graduated as Doctor of Medicine, and shortly after
 established himself in practice at Stockholm.       He had already ac
 quired such reputation by his researches, that he was immediately
 appointed assistant to Spaurnau, then Professor of Medicine, Botany,
 and Pharmaceutical Chemistry in the University of the capital; and
 on the death cf the Professor, which occurred in 1806, he was elected
 to the vacant chair. Berzelius was by this appointment bound to
 give lectures, both upon Medicine and upon Chemistry; those he
             on Medicine were highly successful, but his early courses
 delivered
 of Chemistry were by no means popular, as, in conformity with the
                                            \

                                     BT25
gcneral custom at that time prevailing in Sweden, he contented him
self with reading his discourses, without attempting any experimental
illustrations. It was not until ufter his visit to England in the year
 I812, during which he wu present at some of the lectures delivered
by Dr. Marcet at Guy’a Hospital, that he altered his style.          lt is
related, that at the rcqucst of Bcrzcliua, Dr. Marcel furnished him
 with n list of experiments adapted for exhibition in the clan-room.
 On his return he immediately adopted the demonstrative method of
 teaching, and speedily improved upon and added to the hints which
 he brought with him from England, and soon rendered his course
 highly popular and attractive.
      F mm this time titles nnd decorations <U+FB02>owed in upon him; he was
 knighted, subsequently appointed Commander of the Order of \\’asa.
 and eventually was mode n pccr of the realm; and although these
 honours added nothing to the lustre of his name, they yet showed
 that his countrymen could appreciate n man who, by his numerous
 and important discoveries, no eminently adorned nnd digni<U+FB01>ed his
 native land.     In the year l8lZ! he was mode n Foreign Member of
  the Royal Society, nnd indeed he was elected before his death n
 fellow of almost every scienti<U+FB01>c society in the world ; amongst others,
  he became one of the eight Foreign Members of the French Academy
  of Sciences.
      At the age of 88 he was elected President of the Stockholm Aco
  demy of Sciences, and it was as Perpetual Secretory to that body, 0.
  post which he held till his death, that he published those valuable
  yearly critical reports upon the progress of Physics snd Chemistry
  which he commenced in I822, and which exercised so wholesome on
  in<U+FB02>uence upon the progress of research. These reports combined 1
  masterly review of di<U+FB02>erent important theories as they arose. with 1
  clear and concise retrospect of the advances made in the science in
  the intervals of their appearance.
      Berzelius did not marry till late in life.  In 1832 he resigned that
   Professorship   which  for six-and-twenty years he had held with such
   renown; he did not however relax in his zealous devotion to that
   science, the advancement of which had formed the chief business of
   his life, and was occupied till within a short period of his death in
   preparing for the press the <U+FB01>fth edition of his System of Chemistry,’
                                                   '
   a work in eight Svo volumes, which displays in a striking manner
   the laborious industry and minute accuracy which characterized him.
   During the last two or three years of his life his bodily powers began
   to fail, and about six or eight months before his death he was attacked
   with paralysis of the lower extremities; his mind however continued
   active and vigorous, but his strength gradually sank, and he expired
   tranquilly on the lst of August I848.
       ln person Berzelius is described as of stout make and of middle
    size, capable of much physical endurance ; he possessed a mild, agree
    able expression of countenance, and n peculiarly pleasing smile; his
    manners were extremely simple and unpretending, but at the same
    time courteous and polished.       It may be taken as n strong proof of
    his generous and candid disposition, and of the high respect enter
                                                                2

                                   874
 tained for him, that notwithstanding his <U+FB01>rm and unsparing criticisms
 on the labours of others, he was rarely involved in scienti<U+FB01>c con
 troversy of a personal nature.
     The mere enumeration of the labours of Berzelius, to whom as an
 individual Chemistry is indebted for a larger and more varied store of
 new facts and observations than have ever before been collected by
 one man, would involve a sketeh of the history of Chemistry in its
 more important phases during the last forty years. We must there
 fore content ourselves with mentioning a few of the more important
 topics that engaged his attention.
     Some of his earliest papers related to the physiological and che
 mical actions of the Voltaic pile, then recently discovered, and en
 grossing the attention of all philosophers.      The most important of
 these researches were connected with the decomposition of the alka
 line earths, by forming their amalgams, and included the discovery
 of that singular substance the amalgam of ammonium, in which the
 two gases hydrogen and nitrogen unite with mercury and form a
compound which still retains the metallic character.         From these
researches he was led to his Electro-chemical theory, the foundation
 of which was laid by Davy,ibut which received many important mo
 di<U+FB01>cations, and a systematic application to chemical combination in
general, from the hands of Berzelius.      In the year 1806, he, in con
junction with Hisinger, commenced a publication at regular intervals,
entitled ' Memoirs in Physics, Chemistry and Mineralogy,’ composed
of papers of great interest and importance in each of these branches
of science. This work was continued for twelve years, and contains
no fewer than forty-seven original papers from the pen of Berzelius.
Shortly after appeared his remarkable work 'Lectures on Animal
Chemistry,’ a treatise which abounds in original observations, and
which gave form to a branch of the science at once the most di<U+FB02>icult
and least understood.      This work furnishes a variety of new modes
of analysis, and details the experimental examination of most of the
secretions, of the chemical composition of which till then little or
nothing was known.
    It was indeed in the prosecution of analysis generally that the
consummate skill of Berzelius was eminently conspicuous.         Analy
tical chemistry may be said to have originated in Sweden under
Bergman; but it was entirely remodelled by Berzelius, who intro
duced a variety of new methods and a degree of precision and cer
tainty into its operations which were before unknown.
    Whilst Dalton was pursuing the train of investigation which led
to his celebrated atomic hypothesis, Berzelius, in ignorance of the
views of our countryman, was labouring in the same track; and in
following up the experiments of Wenzel and of Richter, the import
ant bearings of which he at once recognized, had been led to the
performance of a number of exact analyses, which completely con
<U+FB01>rmed the happy generalizations of Dalton.
    These results he published in an ' Essay on the Doctrine of De<U+FB01>nite
Proportions.’    The masterly style in which the subject was treated
contributed in no small degree to the rapid adoption of these new

                                    I   '-I
                                         qr
 and important views—views which furnish st once the foundation
 and the touchstone of all sccurute chemical unnlysis.          l-'rom this
 period he was for several years actively engaged in perfecting and
 applying the theory, and in detenninin|_' the chemical equivalents or
 combining proportionals of the elemiciitary substances. The progress
 of this long and laborious inquiry, which hus furnished the most
 valuable series of constants chemistry posse.-ses. obliged him to exc
 minc almost all the elementary bodies and the principal inorganic
 compounds then known. and which, besides enabling him to add
greatly to the extent and accuracy of our knowledge of these sub
 stances. was also the occasion of the discovery of multitude of new
                                                                n
 combinations.     His researches revealed to us the existence of three
 elementary bodies before unknown, viz. of selenium. the remarkable
 analogue of sulphur; of thoriuum and of corium, the metallic bases
 of two bodies of earthy character.     To him also we owe our know
 ledge of the properties of zirconium and of silicium; he         was who
                                                                        it
established the acid character of silica. a discovery which he subse
quently applied with such happy results to the systematic classi<U+FB01>ca
tion of minerals.    Among compound bodies which he investigated,
his careful examination of the <U+FB02>uorides, and of the compounds of the
sulphurets with each other,    is perhaps the most important.
    Having thus determined the chemical equivalents of the elements,
Berzclius proceeded to apply his results to the science of mineralogy.
His well-known treatise on the use of the blowpipe, an indispensable
manual for every one who desires to derive the full advantage from
the employment of this useful instrument, must be considered as one
of his most important contributions to the literature of mineralogy
and of chemistry.     But it   isthe systematic application of the doc
trine of de<U+FB01>nite proportions to the analysis of mineral bodies in ge
neral, which will be regarded as one of the most remarkable and
successful of his labours as   aphilosopher.’    So highly did the Royal
Society estimate this establishment of mineralogical classi<U+FB01>cation

   It will not excite surprise that the death of such a man was re
garded in Sweden as a national calamity, or that for two months the
members of the scienti<U+FB01>c societies of his native land wore mourning
as a tribute of respect to his memory.
   WILLIAM CLIFT was born at Burcombe, near Bodmin, on the 14th
of February 1775, and was the youngest of seven children of the same
parents.    His father, Robert Clift, died a few years after, leaving
his widow and family in narrow circumstances.      William was put to
school at Bodmin, and soon distinguished himself by the facility with
which he acquired and the tenacity with which he retained whatever
he was taught.      Having a strong natural talent for drawing, some
productions of his early pencil attracted attention, and brought the
youth under the notice of Colonel Gilbert of the Priory, near Bod
min; and the good disposition and promising abilities of the young
artist made him a favourite with both the Colonel and Mrs. Gilbert.
This amiable lady had been the schoolfellow of Miss Home, and main
tained a friendly correspondence with her after her marriage with
John Hunter. Thus Mrs, Gilbert became acquainted with the loss
which Hunter had sustained by the departure of his able anatomical
assistant and draughtsman William Bell; for Ceylon, in 1790: she
accordingly communicated to Mrs. Hunter the quali<U+FB01>cations of her
young protégé, and strongly recommended him as likely to prove a
satisfactory successor to Mr. Bell. Her advocacy was successful,
and William Clift was sent to London, approved of, and in the year
1792 was apprenticed for six years to John Hunter, who received
him into his house, without a fee,—the services of the youth, as
amanuensis, anatomist, and artist, being the sole equivalent expected
for this inestimable advantage at the outset of his career. Unfor
tunately John Hunter died, October 16th, 1793.        During the brief
period in which these relations subsisted between him and Mr. Clift,
they appear to have been most satisfactory to both.          There was
no lack of employment.        The young apprentice was roused at six
in the morning, and earlier in the summer season, to assist and
attend upon the great anatomist in the dissections which he carried
on before breakfast.    The coarser anatomical labours of maceration
and injection, the copying out of detached MSS. records, and
making sketehes and drawings of the parts displayed, occupied the
day; and in the evening he was called to the desk of his indefati
gable master to write from dictation, usually until midnight.
   This was a severe course of labour for a youth of seventeen: yet
such was the goodness of heart, the simple earnestness of purpose
and kindness of demeanour of the master, that no other sentiments
were engendered in the congenial mind of the apprentice save those
of the warmest affection and deepest reverence for the memory of
              he ever regarded as his best teacher, benefactor, and
Emicn (yvhom
        .
   “ From the
                very beginning," writes Mr. Clift, “ I fancied, without
being able to account for it, that nobody about Mr. Hunter seemed
capable of appreciating him.     He seemed to me to have lived before

                                     877
his time and to have died before he was su<U+FB02>iciently understood ;.....the
more l have seen, the more l have known, the more I have learned.
and the more I have thought. the stronger the conviction grows, that
l shall never look upon his like again." These sentiments and affec
tions were soon to be put to s severe trial.    Hunter died in di<U+FB02>iculty
and debt: the sole provision for his family was his museum.          The
executors, Dr. Baillie and Mr. Home, were young men struggling
against the di<U+FB01>culties that oppose the early progress of the physician
and surgeon.
   " I was left alone," writes Mr. Clift, in the memorandum already
quoted from,
                 " until the year 1800 in charge of the Collection, with
two gallons of spirit occasionally to keep it from decay, and with
seven shillings s week,—all, l was told snd believed, that could be
spared,—It a time when the quartern losf was, for n short period,
two                  Thus l had no obstruction to my studies. but un
lnckily no one to direct them. It is true, I had s large part of
Mr. Hunter's manuscripts put into my custody, and, having these
stores at my discretion, l naturally consulted them, having no other
books to read nor money to buy any ; and anxious to learn something
of the Collection left solely to my charge, I read them over and over,
and in this way msde myself somewhat acquainted with the end
and object of the Collection generally, and with the history of
many of the individual prepuntions; and every step thus acquired
made me desirous to acquire more."        ln the meanwhile, Dr. Baillie
gave   Mr. ('lift free admission to his anatomical lectures. and Mr.
Home (afterwards Sir Everard) occasionally employed him to assist
in his operations on private patients, or in the dissection of rare
animals.
   Mr. Hunter'a premises consisted of the residence in Leicester
square, a house in Castle-street, and the museum which he had built
in the intermediate space.       The house in the square was let to
lodgers; the house in the rear was inhabited by Mr. Clift and the
old housekeeper of the family; and with no other aid than this, Mr.
Clift undertook the custody of the museum until Government should
determine to accept or decline the terms on which it was offered by
the testamentary directions of Hunter.
   The <U+FB01>rst proposition in I794 had been ill-received by the minister.
" What! give £20,000 for bottles—we want the money to buy gun
powder!" was the reply of Pitt, when the subject was <U+FB01>rst broached
to him by Banks.        But Sir Joseph was not easily discouraged, and
his endeavours, with those of other friends of science and cherishers
of the memory of Hunter, were at length successful.         After seven
years’ siege   of  the Treasury, the Premier sanctioned the introduction
of a measure by which Parliament became the purchasers of the
Hunterian Collection for the sum of £15,000, and it was then trans
ferred to the Corporation of Surgeons, in n better state of arrange
ment and preservation than when it received in 1793 its last addition
from the hands of its immortal founder.
   I have digressed into these details in orderto place in its true light
the debt which science owes to William Clift, and what must eva

                                    878
be regarded as his chief merit, viz. his single-minded ful<U+FB01>lment of
arduous duties under peculiar di<U+FB02>iculties, and his noble self-devotion
to the achievements and memory of his great master, during the
period that elapsed between his decease and the ultimate transfer of
the Collection to its present worthy custodians.      Mr.iClift has de
scribed the almost solitary condition in which he suddenly found
himself with this great and important charge. At an age when the
passions are strongest, in a metropolis teeming with opportunities
and temptations,—not unconscious, moreover, of his own abilities and
of the advantage which his apprenticeship to Hunter would give him
in the pursuit of the practice of surgery,—neither pleasure, pro<U+FB01>t,
nor ambition, could make him swerve from the course of duty to
which he had devoted himself.
    The Corporation of Surgeons having accepted the Hunterian Col
lection on the terms proposed by Government, was very properly
re-incorporated by charter, dated 22nd March 1800, under the title
of the Royal College of Surgeons.
    One of the <U+FB01>rst acts of the College, in taking upon itself this new
bond of relation to the natural sciences, was to appoint Mr. William
 Clift Conservator of the Museum, under the superintendence of a
Board of Curators chosen from the Council. And the Board, elected
 on the 3rd of June 1800, in its <U+FB01>rst ' Report,’ expresses “its satisfac
 tion that the Conservator has manifested quali<U+FB01>cations for all the im
 portant o<U+FB02>ices under the distinctions of Arrangement and Description,
 as well as for his other duties," p. 7.   And in the <U+FB01>rst statement of
 the expenses of the Museum is the item—“ Salary and gratuity to
 the Conservator from Christmas 1799 "—the date of his appointment
 —“ to Midsummer 1801 "—£l45.
     From this time forwards the time and talents of Mr. Clift were
 exclusively devoted to the advancement of comparative anatomy and
 physiology, either indirectly by the preservation and increase of the
 Museum, or more immediately by anatomizing and depicting the
 structure of new or little-known animals.
     Sir Everard Home having undertaken the charge of preparing a
 catalogue of the Hunterian Collection, much of Mr. Clift’s time was
 occupied in assisting that gentleman in investigations which seemed
 to relate to the desired object.   The results of most of these labours
 have been recorded in the Transactions of the Royal Society, and,
 with few exceptions, the illustrations of the numerous papers on
 Comparative Anatomy, by Sir Everard Home, are from the accurate
 and elegant pencil of Mr. Clift.
     Pending the absence of catalogues, the preparations of the Mu
  seum were orally explained to visitors by the Conservator, whose
 style and matter bespoke the genuine Hunterian source from which
 he had derived his knowledge of the nature and scope of the Collec
 tion.    On every occasion, also, Mr. Clift’s time and knowledge were
 at the service of all who, in the investigation of any subject of
  anatomy, physiology, or palaeontology, had occasion to consult the
  Museum under his charge.        His own immediate contributions to
  science, at least those bearing his name, are but few.      Two only

                                         RTE!
  appear in the Transactions       of thc l{oyal Society; the <U+FB01>rst is cu
  titlcd " Experiments    to u.-CCr!i\ia  the in<U+FB02>uence of the Spinal Murrow
  on the action of the lluirt in Fishes," und is printed in the lU.',th
  volume of thc l,lldUbUphloa\l        Tran.-actions in the your 1815; the
  second and last contribution to thc Roynl Society was his “ Descrip
  tion of some Fossil Bones found in the (.'svcrns at Qrcston," printed
  in the volume for the yeur 1823.
     Both papers are characterizcd by the clcurncss iUld simplicity of
 the style in which the facts and cxpcrimvnts arc narrated, and by
 the soundness of the conclusions deduccd from them.
     By the judicious choice of the subject of his cxpcriments, and the
 care and skill with which they wcrc performed, Mr. Clift, in the
 <U+FB01>rst of thcsc pnpcrs, te,U\bllallud, in contraventiou of the conclusions
 to which M. l.c (iallois had nrrived, that thc action of the hcart con
 tinues long after the brain and spinal marrow are destroyed, and still
 longer when the brain is removed without previous injury to its sub
 stance ; together with some intercsting colluterul conclusions.
     Soon after the publication of thcsc memoirs, Mr. Clift was clccted
 a Fellow of the Royal Society, and served on thc Council of the So
 ciety in the years I533 and l.\'3-L llc communicated some memoirs
 to the Geological Society, two of which, " On thc Fossil ltemuins
                       "
 from the lrawnddi       and “ On the .\lcgathcrium." are published in
 the Transactions of that body. Most of the works or memoirs, how
 ever, on the fossil remains of the higher classes of animals, which
 have appeared since Sir Everard Home's <U+FB01>rst papcr on thc Protec
 saurus, in the Transactions of the Royal Society for I814, until
 within a recent period, are more or less indebted to Mr. Clift, cithcr
 for his determination of the fossils described in them, or for his accu
 rate and beautiful <U+FB01>gures of them.           Numerous and hearty are the
 acknowledgements by their respective authors to Mr. Clift for this
 valuable assistance. ln Dr. Mantull's original memoir on the lguano
 don, published in our'l'ransactious in 1625, the author says, “Among
 the specimens lutely collected, some, however, wcrc so perfect, that
 I resolved to avail myself of the obliging offer of Mr. Clift, to whosc
 kindness and libcrality l hold myself particularly indebted, to assist
 me in comparing the fossil teeth with those of the recent Laccrtae
 in the Museum of the ltoyal College of Surgeons. The result of
 this examination proved highly satisfactory, for in an lgunna we dis
covered teeth possessing the form and structure of the fossil speci
mens."      And Baron Cuvicr, in the concluding volume of his great
work on Fossil Remains, acknowledges his obligations for many
drawings,
             " fnites par M. Clift, dont lc beau talent a enrichi cc recueil
de tant de plauchcs non moins remurqunblcs par lcur cxécution quc
                                                                 '
par lcur <U+FB01>délité."
     To return, however, to the more immediate field of Mr. Clift's
labours, I <U+FB01>nd it recorded in the edition of the Synopsis of the .\lu
seum of the Royal College of Surgeons, published by the Council in
1845, that, “ under Mr. Clift’s superintendence the removal of the
Collection from Castle-street, Leicester-square, to a temporary place
of deposit in Lincoln’s lnn Fields, in 1806, and thence to the Mu
leum of the College in 1813, was effected without the slightest

           '
                                   sso
damage to any of the frail and delicate preparations of which it, in a
great part, consists."    And the best testimony to the exemplary ful
<U+FB01>lment by Mr. Clift of his responsible duties is a<U+FB02>brded by the present
condition of the Hunterian Collection, and the great accessions it has
received during his able conservatorship.      From the duties of this
o<U+FB02>ice Mr. Clift was allowed to retire with a full salary, which had been
progressively increased to 400l. per annum, a few years before his
decease, which took place on the 20th of June, 1849, six weeks after
 that of his wife, to whom he had been tenderly attached and united
more than <U+FB01>fty years.
    He has left an only daughter, married to his successor, who com
bines with the o<U+FB02>ice of Conservator of the Museum, that of Hunterian
 Professor to the Royal College of Surgeons; and this notice of the
worthy and estimable colleague whose loss we now deplore, cannot
better be concluded than in the words which his son-in-law has in
scribed upon his monument :—“ He carried a child-like simplicity and
single-mindedness to the close of a long and honoured career."
    Enwaan SrsnLxr, D.D., Lord Bishop of Norwich, and Clerk of
 the Closet to Her Majesty, was the youngest son of the late Sir John
Thomas Stanley, Bart., of Alderley Park, in Cheshire; whose eldest
 son, having inherited the baronetey by the death of his father, was
 subsequently created a peer by the title of Baron Stanley of Alderley,
and still survives, the oldest Fellow of the Royal Society.
    The late prelate was born on the lst of January 1779, and was
 consequently in the seventy-<U+FB01>rst year of his age at the period of his
 death.     He was partly educated at the grammar-school of Maccles
<U+FB01>eld, was afterwards entered of St. John’s College, Cambridge, and
 was a Wrangler at that University in 1802.
    His early predilection for the navy is well known, and it is be
lieved that it was not without reluctance that he yielded to the wishes
 of his family to forego a profession to which his youthful taste and
inclination so much attached him. But to whatever pursuit his
ardent and energetic mind was once directed, there was no after
 hesitation, no drawing back from the duties to which he had devoted
 himself, and no lukewarmness in the manner in which those duties,
 whatever they may have been, were ful<U+FB01>lled by him. In his position
 as a parish-priest, in the incumbency of the family-living of Alderley,
 and, in a still more remarkable manner, after his elevation to the
 Episcopal authority, his active and energetic mind seems to have
sought relaxation only in a change of labour ; and he retained to the
latest period of his life the same incessant occupation of mind and
 active bodily exertion which had characterized the earlier part of his
life. He was equally remarkable for the great simplicity of his heart,
 the unbounded charity and kindness of his feelings, and the cheer
fulness of his conversation and manners; and he possessed, in an
extraordinary degree, the power of attracting the respect and per
 sonal attachment of those even who differed from him in opinion on
 matters which too frequently tend to produce personal animosity,
 and lead to the breach of many a friendship.
    The Bishop very early evinced a great fondness for the study of

                                   88l
Natural History, which he never lost, although the occupations snd
labours of his subsequent life never allowed of his acquiring s pro
found knowledge of sny brunch of that science.       The only work be
ever published on natural history was 'A Familiar History of Bri
tish Birds,’ which was intended for young persons. It is written in
s pleasing and interesting style, snd evinces much of that kindness
of disposition for which its suthor was so much esteemed.
    He was many years President of the Linnran Society, and alwsys
 evinced grcst interest in the welfare of that Society. ss well ss of the
 British Association. to which he was attached from its commence
 ment.     He was elected s Fellow of the Royal Society in I840.
    The incessant labour snd excitement, both of mind and body,
 which had been for some time making secret inroads on his health.
 at length occasioned him to seek change and comparative repose in
 s visit to Scotland; but he was seized there with congestion of the
 brain, and died st Bruhan Castle, nenr Dingwall, on the 8th of Sep
 tember last.
    The Right Honourable Sir Auzxnmss Jon us-ror of Carnsolloch,
 in the county of Dumfries, was distinguished by a long snd glorious
 career of the most philanthropic and bene<U+FB01>cial labours for the ame
 lioration of the natives of Ceylon and of the continent of India. His
 early life was marked by many romantic incidents, and his educa
 tion in the East was carried on under such a concurrence of circum
 stances of the most unusual and remarkable kind, ss have perhaps
 scarcely been paralleled, and all tending in a most remarkable man
 ner to <U+FB01>t him for that career, to which circumstances apparently for
 tuitous afterwards conducted him. In his <U+FB01>fth year he had acquired s
 knowledge of the French language, having been with his parents in
 France from his infancy; and he accompanied them to India, whither
 his father went in n high o<U+FB02>icial appointment under Lord Macartney,
  then going out Governor of Madras; and it is remarkable that in
 that country he should have received the di<U+FB01>erent branches of his
  education from men who afterwards became themselves distin
  guished, and who from family attachment were ready to supply the
 want of regular school instruction to their young friend—such were
  Sir'l'homa.s Munro, General Leith, Colonel Mackenzie, and Schwartz.
  His early association with distinguished natives, and his father's
  anxiety to render his constitution strong and enduring, led to so
  extraordinary a pro<U+FB01>ciency in every kind of manly and athletic ex
  ercise, that he was o<U+FB02>ered a cornetey in Sir Henry Floyd's regiment
  of light dragoons, in his eleventh year. His mathematical studies,
  in which he became a pro<U+FB01>cient, were aided by his mother, herself
  a daughter of Lord Napier of Mcrchistoun, and a worthy descendant
  of the famous inventor of logarithms.
     On his return with his parents to England he pursued the study
  of the law, and having afterwards been called to the bar, went the
  home circuit for a short time.
     Circumstances however were preparing for him n change in his
  destiny, for which be was admirably suited, and in 1802 he accepted
                                                             1

                                    882
  the o<U+FB02>ice of Advocate-General in the King’s Court at Ceylon, then
  about to be established under the government of Lord Guildford.
  He had previously married Miss Campbell, the only daughter of Lord
  William Campbell, second son of John <U+FB01>fth Duke of Argyle. From
  this period Mr. Johnston bent all the powers of his mind to the one
  favourite object of his life, the introduction of such measures as
  should be the means of raising the moral and political character of
 the natives, <U+FB01>rst of the island of Ceylon, and afterwards of the con
 tinent of India. His appointment to the office of Chief Justice, which
 took place in 1805, and afterwards, in 1810, to the additional office
 of President of H.M. Council in Ceylon, gave him the power to carry
 out his great object with energy and effect. Of the manner in which
 his arduous and philanthropic duties and objects were ful<U+FB01>lled, the
 best attestation is to be found in the words of two distinguished
 statesmen who have respectively borne their testimony to his great
 merits; the late Marquis of Londonderry said, that he had “the
 great glory of having given freedom of conscience, of establishing
 trial by jury, and of abolishing the slave-trade throughout the island
 of Ceylon :" and Lord Grey observed in the House of Lords, that “ no
 person had ever before had the honour of introducing three such mea
 sures into any country, and that his conduct in the island of Ceylon
 had immortalized his name."        Sir Alexander returned’ to England
 in 1819, and in 1832 he was sworn of the Privy Council. He was
 one of the original founders of the Royal Asiatic Society, of which
 he was for some time aVice-President.       He was elected a Fellow of
 the Royal Society in 1810.      He latterly resided principally on his
family estate in Scotland, where he continued to exercise in private
life that benevolence which had been the leading characteristic of
his public labours.
     Gnonea Fowmzs, Ph.D., late Professor of Practical Chemistry in
 University College, who died of consumption on the 31st of January
last, before completing his thirty-fourth year, was the eldest son of
Mr. John Fownes of Coventry-street.        Dr. Fownes’s original desti
nation was for trade, but he early evinced a taste for science, and
when about seventeen or eighteen years of age he became a member
of the Western Literary Institution in Leicester-square, and with the
late Mr. Everett, Dr. Henry Watts and others, established a philo
sophical class, in which they contributed to their mutual improve
ment by lecturing and making experiments.          After 1837, when he
entered the laboratory of Mr. Everett, an accomplished analyst, who
was then chemical lecturer at the Middlesex Hospital, Dr. Fownes
devoted himself entirely to the pursuit of chemistry, spending a por
tion of 1839 under Professor Liebig at Giessen, and afterwards en
gaging as assistant for a year in the laboratory of University College.
He afterwards lectured successively at the Charing Cross and Mid
dlesex Hospital Medical Schools, and in the school of the Pharma
ceutical Society; and on the establishment in 1845 of the Birkbeck
Laboratory of Chemistry in University College, he was nominated to
its direction, upon the recommendation of his friend Professor Gra

                                    888
ham.      Here he sncceeded' in organizing an excellent system of prac
tical instruction. and was highly successful as a teacher, notwith
standing the declining state of his health for the last two years of
his life.
    The name of Dr. Fownes is connected with two popular worlrs
a Manual of Chemistry, and the Acton Prize Essay of the Royal
lnstitutiou, entitled ' Chemistry, as exemplifying the “fisdom and
Bene<U+FB01>eencs of God,’ published in 1843.       llut the high scienti<U+FB01>c re
putation   which   he  rapidly obtained  was  chiefly founded upon his
researches and discoveries in organic chemistry. which indicated
great clearness of perception and precision of analysis. and gave
promise of a distinguished career. The most important of these was
his paper on the Arti<U+FB01>cial Formation of Furfurinc, a substance evi
dently of the same interesting class as the natural vcgeto-alkalies,
which was published in the Philosophical Transactions for l8-I5. and
Ias rewarded by the Royal Medal in Chemistry. This was followed
by the discovery of another organic base, benzoline.         He has also
papers in the Transactions upon the Existence of Phosphoric Acid in
Rocks of lgneous Origin, and on the Value in Absolute Alcohol of
Spirits of different speci<U+FB01>c gravities. Several communications by him
were also published by the Chemical Society, in which Dr. Fownes
discharged for several years the otiice of Secretary.
    Dr. Ronrr Wanna Dsawin was born at Lich<U+FB01>eld on the 30th
 of May 1766, and died at Shrewsbury in his eighty-third year on
 the l3th of November H548.          He was the third son of Erasmus
 Darwin, author of the ' Zoonomia ' and ' Botanic Garden.‘       He was
 elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in i788, and in the year 1786
 contributed a paper to the Transactions on Coloured Spectra. Having
 commenced medical practice before he was twenty-one years old, he
 was unable to pursue any scienti<U+FB01>c studies, but was actively engaged
 in his profession for the unusual period of sixty years. In his youth
 he studied at Icyden, Edinburgh, and Paris; at the latter place he
 was encouraged to familiar intercourse with Franklin. then in the
 height of his glory; and at Edinburgh he spent much of his time with
 the celebrated Dr. Black. of whose extreme simplicity of character
 and kindness of heart he often repeated anecdotes.        In his private
 character Dr. Darwin was remarkable for aagacity. benevolence, and
 strong feelings of sympathy, which made him widely beloved by the
 poor and rich.
     SauceL Coona, late President of the Royal College of Surgeons,
 and Surgeon to University College Hospital. The general educa
 tion o'f his boyhood was received at the celebrated school of Dr.
 Burney.      His professional studies commenced at St. Bartholomew's
 Hospital about the year 1800, and he became a Member of the
 College of Surgeons in the year l803.       At an early age he entered
 the Medical department of the army, and obtained the appoint
 ment of a staff-surgeon; but it appears that his actual service in
 the army was con<U+FB01>ned to a limited period.          His subsequent pro

                                    884‘
 fessional career became one of considerable eminence and success.
 For seventeen years he was one of the Surgeons to University Col
 lege Hospital, where, to borrow the deserved eulogium conferred on
 him by an accomplished member of the same profession, “ his great
 surgical knowledge and the kindness and urbanity of his manners
 in his duties, both as Surgeon to the Hospital and as Professor of
 Surgery in the Medical School of the College, procured for him
 the warm attachment of the students."        He was for many years a
 Member of the Council of the Royal College of Surgeons, to which
 he was elected in 1827, and became also one of their Examiners;
 and in the year 1845 he was elected President of that body.
    It is, however, principally from the merits of his publications that
 his fame has been derived; and few members of the profession can
 boast of a more useful career in this respect than Mr. Cooper.      His
 <U+FB01>rst publication of importance was an Essay on the Diseases of the
                            J
 Joints, which gained the acksonian prize of the College of Surgeons
 in the year 1806. But the great work, by which he became most
                                               '
 extensively and honourably known, was his Dictionary of Practical
 Surgery,’ <U+FB01>rst published in the year 1809.      This work speedily be
 came and long continued the universal text-book for students, and
 so valuable a work of reference for older members of the profession,
 that scarcely a professional library will be found which does not
 contain it. This work was translated into the French, German,
 and Italian languages, and was also published in the United States
 of America; and in this country it passed through numerous large
 editions.    Mr. Cooper had published in 1807 a less elaborate work,
 entitled  ' First Lines of Surgery,’ which purported to be more par
ticularly founded on the results of his own practice. This work also
reached three editions in the course of six years.
    Mr. Cooper became a Fellow of the Royal Society in the year
 1846, and was a member of the Council in 1847—8.            He did not
contribute any paper to the Philosophical Transactions.      Latterly he
retired very much from professional and public life, and died at his
country-residence at Shepperton on the 3rd of December last.
    If, as must in truth be acknowledged, the literary and professional
labours of Mr. Cooper have not evinced a very high order of intel
lect, or any great originality of mind, or profound scienti<U+FB01>c research,
yet his course was one of great practical usefulness, and his works
have undoubtedly been highly bene<U+FB01>cial to the profession, of which
he was a deservedly distinguished member.
    Sir Gssvas CHAMNEY Hnnonrou was a native of Dublin, and the
son of Dr. Haughton of that city. Having, at an early age, gone to
India as a cadet, he acquired, at Fort William College in Calcutta,
the foundation of that profound knowledge of Oriental literature and
language, for which he was afterwards so distinguished.         In 1817,
having returned from India, he was appointed aProfessor at Hailey
bury College, but retired from that appointment in 1827. In the
year 1832 he was a candidate for the Boden Professorship of Sanscrit
in the University of Oxford, but resigned his claims in favour of Mr.

                                    R85
\Vilson   : his rctiremcnt was marked by a very high testimony to his
great merit, in a complimentary address, signed by no less than
two hundred Graduates of the University. including seven Heads
of Houses.
    Sir Graves Hsughton acted as Honorary Sccrctary to the Royal
Asiatic Society in 1832—33.         He became successively s Foreign
Member of the Asiatic Society of Paris, a Corresponding Member of
the Royal Society of Berlin. s Member of the Institute of France,
and of the Asiatic Society of Calcutta, and in 1833 he received the
honour of knighthood.        He was elected F.ll.S. in l82l.
     He edited the lnstitutes of Menu in the original Ssnscrit, with
s translation revised on that of Sir William Jones; he was also the
author of a Bengali Grammar. of a Becgali-Ssnscrit and English Dic
tionary, and other works, particularly s Prodromus of an intended
                         '

     Sir Graves died on the 28th of August last, at St. Cloud near
 Paris, in the 62nd year of his age.
     Enwuin Fonsrn, Esq., during many years the respected Tres
 surcr and s Vice-President of the liinnaeun Society, was the third son
 of Edward Forster,who was a distinguished merchant and for fifty-two
 years held the appointment of Governor of the Russia Company in
 London. He was born at “'althamstow in Essex. on the l'2th of
 October 1765, and resided in that neighbourhood during the whole
 of his long life. He was for many years a partner in the banking
 house of Sir John Lubbock, Forster and Company, and thus became
 closely associated with the present distinguished head of that house,
 long the valued Treasurer and Vice-President of the Royal Society.
     From a very early period of his life, Mr. Forster was zealously
 attached to the study of botany, and particularly to the cultivation
 of a knowledge of British plants, in which department of science he
 had attained to considerable eminence.       He became a Fellow of the
 Linmean Society in the yes: 1800, and from that period till his death
 he always took great interest in the welfare of that Society.        He
 was elected its Treasurer in 1816, and appointed one of the Vice
 Presidents in 1828.       ln 1821 he was elected s Fellow of the Royal
  Society, and served on the Council in the years 1839 and 1840.
     Mr. Forster did not contribute any paper to the Philosophical
 Transactions. He was the author of two papers on isolated botanical
 subjects, published in the Linnnsn Transactions, and of several con
  tributions to the scienti<U+FB01>c periodicals of the day. His knowledge of
  the species of British plants was remarkably accurate as well as ex
  tensive, but he had not devoted his attention, to any great extent,
  to the science of Botany, strictly so called,—to the minute anatomy,
  the physiology, and the af<U+FB01>nities of plants.
      He was, in private life, one of the most amiable and estimable of
  men, and arrived at a <U+FB01>ne old age, surrounded by the affection and
  reverence of numerous friends, who will long remember with regret
  the kindlincss of his spirit, the almost youthful warmth of his friend
  ship, and the pleasant playfulness, the simple and unaffected ur
  banity and courtesy of his manners.

                                      886
   He died of cholera on Wednesday the 21st of February in the
present year, at the advancedage of eighty-four, after an illness of
only a very few days ; and it is believed that the disease which
proved fatal to him was contracted at one of his frequent visits of
mercy at the Refuge for the Destitute, of which institution he was
one of the most zealous and e<U+FB02>icient supporters.
   After having been married nearly <U+FB01>fty years, Mr. Forster became
a widower about four years before his death.          He left no family.
   One who knew him well, has most felicitously applied to him'
these lines of Flaminius, of which every word is singularly appro
priate :—                                  -.,                           '

   Dr. Pmcnann was born at Ross, Herefordshire. In early life he
manifested a decided bent towards the studies which in after-years
occupied so large a portion of his time, and procured for him the
elevated rank which he took among men of science. He had great
readiness in acquiring languages; and history was his never-failing
delight.    He chose medicine as a profession, mainly because it was
most compatible with his position as a member of the Society of
Friends; but he subsequently joined the communion of the Church
of England.       After graduating in Edinburgh he spent a few terms
in Cambridge, and afterwards in Oxford. In the year 1810 he set
tled in Bristol. He became physician to St. Peter's Hospital and to
the In<U+FB01>rmary, and after a few years acquired a large practice, in
which he continued to labour till the year 1845, when he removed
to London, having been appointed one of the Parliamentary Com
missioners in Lunacy. Dr. Prichard was in full vigour of mind and
body when his fatal illness befell him, early in December of last year.
It was of comparatively short duration, as he died on the 22nd of
that month.
   In addition to the distinction which he had obtained as a Fellow
of the Royal Society, he was elected Corresponding Member of the
National Institute of France and of the French Academy of Medi
cine.    All the chief learned societies on the continent and in Ame
rica sent him diplomas of honorary membership; and in the year
1835 he received the highest honour which the University of Oxford
has it in her power to bestow,—the degree of Doctor in Medicine
by diploma.

                                   887
   The work by which Dr. Prichnrd's name is best known out of his
own profession. is entitled ' Researches into the Physical History of
Mankind.’ The <U+FB01>rst edition was published in llilri. but the germ
of it was his lnsugural Thesis ' De llnmuni (icneris Varietate,'
printed in I810.     lt went through two more editions, each having
been entirely re-written.    The third was extended into five closely
printed   volumes, and was only completed in the year I84-7. This
work is an extensive collection of fucts regarding the origin, dis
tribution, history and characters of the different tribes of mun;
but the facts are so arranged as to illustrate the great argument
which runs through the whole‘reatise, as to the unity of the species.
 He made s most comprehensive inquiry into the laws which govern
the origination and dispersion of all organized beings, especially as
to the question whether each species in the animal snd vegetable
world exists only as the progeny of one race, or has sprung origi
nally from several distinct sources; and arrived at the conclusion that
the various tribes of organized beings were originally placed by the
Creator in certain regions for which they are by their nature pecu
liarly adapted; each species having had its beginning in s single pair,
and the            hsving been left to disperse themselves according
to their progeny
           ocomotive powers, or their capabilities of bearing changes
of climate. He argued by analogy that if the races of men belong
to one species in the zoological sense, it is extremely improbable
that they have descended from more than one stock, especially as
their locomotive powers, sided by the resources of human sagncity,
are greater than those of brute animals.      That they are of one spe
cies, he proved by those criteria of identity of species which are sf
forded :—l. By the principal laws of the animal economy, particu
larly those governing the duration of life, the period of utero-gests
tion, and the phenomena of reproduction; 2. By like psthological
tendencies; 8. By the fertility of mixed breeds.         A very cogent
argument in the some direction was derived from the comparison of
the psychical qualities of species, as it appears that the species which
are most similar to each other and belong to the same genus, are
endowed with instincts even more distinct and characteristic than
peculiarities of bodily structure.  An extensive survey of the human
races in this point of view shows that even the most dissimilar are
all possessed of common nffections and sympathies, and are subjected
to precisely analogous laws of feeling and action, and that there
fore, in so far as this evidence goes, they belong to one species or
lineage.    As to the differences in colour, integument, hair, form
and structure, he showed that no remarkable instance of variation is
discoverable in mankind of which a parallel may not be found in
the varieties which arise in the species of the lower animals. These
several analogical arguments were con<U+FB01>rmed by the historical in
vestigation of the different races of men, in which the author took
occasion to show that all the different physical and psychological
characters, which had been before proved by analogy to be within
the limits of mere variation in species, have actually arisen in re
peated instances, and have generally displayed themselves under the

                                    888
in<U+FB02>uence of similar external agencies.      In tracing the genealogy of
nations, Dr. Prichard showed the most abundant and various erudi
tion, not only in his account of all that can be gleaned from historical
testimonies, but also in the evidence which he gathered from the re
lations of languages.
    Dr. Prichard, early in his literary career, distinguished himself by
his researches in Egyptian learning, having, in the year 1819, pub
lished a treatise on Egyptian Mythology.         The Chevalier Bunsen
has borne testimony to the high character of this work in the follow
ing passage:——“ Simultaneously with the <U+FB01>rst steps in the progress
of modern hieroglyphical discoverygaDr. Prichard, one of the most
acute and learned investigators of his time, had once more vindicated
the claims of Egypt to a primeval chronology, and suggested a col
lection of' the lists of Eratosthenes and Manetho as the true method
of elucidating the earliest period.    In the work on Egyptian chro
nology and mythology he shows that the continually recurring co
 incidences which they offer must represent a chronological canon."
    Not the least of Dr. Prichard’s contributions to science was his
 inquiry into the origin of the Celtic nations, in which he gave satis
 factory proof that their dialects are referable to the same stock as
 the Sanscrit, Greek, Latin, and Teutonic languages, and thus com
 plete the Indo-European group.
    Dr. Prichard enriched the literature of his profession with some
 very valuable works.      His treatise on Nervous Diseases presented
 the <U+FB01>rst systematic attempt at discriminating those forms of nervous
 disorder which owe their origin to irritation in organs remote from
 the cerebro-spinal centres.     His writings on Insanity will ever be
 remembered as having given distinct expression and proof to the
 idea that a large number of cases of mental disease are characterized
 by perversion of the emotions, sentiments, instincts and habitudes of
 action rather than by intellectual error.      To this form of mental
 disorder he gave the name of Moral Insanity.
    The remarkable intellectual endowments of this distinguished man
 are obviously inferrible from the fact that he produced works which
 in their several departments have attained the highest rank in the
 estimation of the learned of all countries.
    It only remains to be added, that in the domestic and social rela
 tions of life his character was conspicuous for integrity, goodness,
 benevolence and piety.       The honour with which his name was
 greeted abroad was well answered by the affectionate respect which
 attended it in private circles.   His removal from the world of sci
 ence, while it cannot but be deplored, is yet somewhat compensated
 by his great works ; but the loss to his friends is one that can never
  be repaired.                           .
    Major THOMAs HENRY SHADWELL CLERKE expired on the
  19th of last April, under an attack of paralysis, at his residence in
  Brompton Grove. Educated at the Royal Military College of
  Marlow, he there attained the distinction among his young associates
  of being a Cadet Of<U+FB01>cer. Major Clerke was appointed to the 28th

                                   839
Regiment in I805. He served with gn-nt credit and gallantry in
the 5th Regiment during the first yelrsof the Peninsular campaigns,
having been present at the general actions of Rolmin, Vimicro,
Cornnna, and Bunnco, and at the combats of Ahncidn, the Con,
Pombal and Redinhn, at the last-mentioned of which places he lost
his right leg on the l<U+FB01>lth of .\lnrch l8l l. Having becoine after the
conclusion of the war a Captain of the Staff Depot, he obtained his
mljorit in 1830, and was subsequently named n Knight Companion
of the Royal Guelphic order.
   Major C lerke was the founder of the United Service Journal, and
acted as Editor of that highly useful periodical from its commence
ment in I829 until I8-I-2, during which time he zealously seconded
every enterprise for the advancement of professional knowledge. lite
rature and science among naval and military of<U+FB01>cers. In carrying
out this object, he was further instrumental in establishing the United
 Service Museum, of which he became one of the munugers.
    At the time of his death Major Clerks was a l-'vllow of the Royal,
Geological, Royal Astronomical and Royal Geographical Societies,
and it is butjustice to his memory to say, that his loss is as deeply
deplored by his numerous friends in those bodies, as by his old asno
ciates in arms, for his good social qualities, his energy of character
and his warmth of heart.
   On the motion of Sir Harry Inglis, Bart, seconded by the Lord
Chief Baron, the best thanks of the Society were tendered to the
President for his excellent address, and his Lordship was requested
to permit the same to be printed and circulated to the Society.

   A. C. Ramsay. Esq., was admitted into the Society.
   The Bakerian Lecture was delivered by Professor Graham, F.R.S.,
“ On the Diffusion of Liquids."
   The apparatus used in studying the diffusion of salts and other
substances into water was very simple.        It consisted of an open
phial to contain the solution of the salt to be diffused, which was
entirely immersed in a large jar of pure water, so that the solution
in the phial communicated freely with the latter.      Phials cast in a
mould of the capacity of four ounces of water, or more nearly 2000
grains, were generally emplo ed, which were ground down to a uni
form height of 3'8 inches. The neck was 0'5 inch in depth, and the
                                                            1

                                       898
aperture or mouth of the phial 1'25 inch in diameter.         The phial was
<U+FB01>lled up with the solution to he diffused till it reached the point of
 a pin dipping exactly 0'5 inch into the mouth of the bottle.           This
 being the solution cell or bottle, and the external jar the “water
                                      “
jar," the pair together form a diffusion cell." The diffusion was
 stopped, generally after seven or eight days, by closing the mouth
 of the phial with a plate of glass, and then raising it out of the
 water-jar.     The quantity of salt which had found its way into the
 water-jar—the diffusion product as it was called—was then deter
 mined by evaporating to dryness.
     The characters of liquid diffusion were <U+FB01>rst examined in detail
 with reference to common salt.
     It was found, <U+FB01>rst, that with solutions containing 1, 2, 3 and 4a
 per cent. of salt, the quantities which diffused out of the phials into
 the water of the jars, and were obtained by evaporating the latter,
 in a constant period of eight days, were as nearly in proportion to
 these numbers, as 1, 1'99, 3'01 and 4'00; and that in repetitions of
 the experiments, the results did not vary more than I-4-Oth part.
 The proportion of salt which diffused out in such experiments
 amounted to about 1-8th of the whole.
     Secondly, that the proportion of salt diffused increases with the
 temperature; an elevation of 80° Fahr. doubling the quantity of
 chloride of sodium diffused in the same time
     The diffusibility of a variety of substances was next compared,
 a solution of 20 parts of the substance in 100 water being always
 used. Some of the results were as follows, the quantities diffused
 being expressed in grains: chloride of sodium 58'68, sulphate of
 magnesia 27‘4-2, sulphate of water 69'32, crystallized cane-sugar
 26'74', starch-sugar 26'94t, gum-arabic 13'24<, albumen 3'03.           The
 low diffusibility of albumen is very remarkable, and the value of this
 property in retaining the serous <U+FB02>uids within the blood-vessels at
  once suggests itself.      It was further observed, that common salt,
  sugar   and  urea,  added  to the albumen under diffusion, diffused away
  from the latter as readily as from their aqueous solutions.           Urea
  itself is as highly diffusible as chloride of sodium.
     In comparing the diffusion of salts dissolved in 10 times their
  weight of water, it was found that isomorphous compounds generally
  had an equal diffusibility, chloride of potassium corresponding with
  chloride of ammonium, nitrate of potash with nitrate of ammonia,
  and sulphate of magnesia with sulphate of zinc.        The most remark
  able circumsfance is that these pairs are “ equi-diffusive," not for
  chemically equivalent quantities, but for equal weights simply. The
  acids differed greatly in diffusibility, nitric acid being nearly four
  times more diffusive than phosphoric acid; but these substances
  also fell into groups, nitric and hydrochloric acids appearing to be
  equally diffusive; so also acetic and sulphuric acids.         Soluble sub
  salts and the ammoniated salts of the metals present a surprisingly
   low diffusibility ; the quantities diffused, under similar circumstances,
   of the three salts, sulphate of ammonia, sulphate of copper, and the
   blue -amrnonio-sulphate of copper being very nearly as 8, 4' and 1.

   When two salts are mised in the solution-cell, they diffusc out
into the water <U+FB01>lnnu.=pllert.' separately and imh-pemlently of each
other, according to their individual ditlnsihilities.  This is quite ana
logous to what happens when mixed |.{i\5e.- are diffused into air. An
important consequence         is,
                               that in liquid diffusion we have      new   a
method of separation or analysis for |nany soluble bodie.-, quite ana
logous in principle to the separation of unequally volatile substances
in the process of distillation. Thus,        was shown that chlorides
                                            it
diffuse out from sulphates and carbonates. and salts of potash from
salts of soda; and that from sea-u ater the salts of soda diffuse out
into pure water faster than the salts of magnesia. The latter cir
cumstance was applied to explain the discordant results which have
been obtained by differcnt chemists in the analyses of the water of
the Dead Sea. taken near the surface; the dilli-rent salts diffusing
up into the sheet of fresh water. with which the lake         isperiodically
covered, with unequal velocity.
     Itwas further shown that chemical decompositions may be pro
duced by liquid diffusion; the constituents of a double salt of so
much stability as common alum being separated, and the sulphate of
potash diffusing    inthe largest proportion.   in fact, the diffusive force
is one of great energy, and quite as capable of breaking up coin
pounds as the unequal volatility of their constituents. Many empiri
cal operations in the chemical arts,   it was said, have their foundation
in such decompositions.
   Again, one salt, such as nitrate of potash, will diffuse into         solu
                                                                           a
tion of another    salt, such as nitrate of   ammonia,   as rapidly as into
pure water; the salts appearing mutually diffusible, as gases are
known to be.
   Lastly, the di<U+FB02>hsibilities of the salts into water, like those of the
gases into air, appear to be connected by simple numerical relations.
These relations are best observed when dilute solutions of the salts
are diffused from the solution-cell, such as      4-,  or even
                                                        2          lper cent.
of salt. The quantities diffused in the same time from              per cent.
                                                                      4-
solutions of the three salts, carbonate of potash, sulphate of potash
and sulphate of ammonia, were l0'25, 10357 and 10°51 grains re
spectively; and similar approach to equality was observed in the
                    a
l,   2, and 61} per cent. solutions oi the same salts.       Italso held at‘
different temperatures. The acetate of potash appeared to coincide
in diffusibility with the same group, and so did the ferrocyanide of
potassium.      The nitrate of potash. chlorate of potash, nitrate of am
monia, chloride of potassium and chloride of ammonium formed an
other equi-diffusive group. The times in which an equal amount of
diffusion took place in these two groups appear to be as              for the
                                                                      l
second to 1'4-14-2 for the <U+FB01>rst, or as I   to the squane root of 2. Now
in gases, the squares    of the times of equal diffusion are !/re densities
of t/\e  gum.    The relation between the sulphate of potash and nitrate
of potash groups would therefore fall, to be referred to the diffusion
molecule or diffusion vapour of the <U+FB01>rst group having a density re
presented by   2,  while that of the second group        represented by 1.

the potash salts.
    The relation of the salts of potash to those of soda, in times of
equal diffusibility, appeared to be as the square root of 2 to the square
root of 8; which gives the relation in density of their diffusion mo
lecules, as 2 to 3. Hydrate of' potash and sulphate of magnesia were
less fully examined, but the <U+FB01>rst presented sensibly double the dif
fusibility of sulphate of potash, and four times the diffusibility of the
sulphate of magnesia.     If these times are all squared, the following
remarkable ratios are obtained for the densities of the diffusion mo
lecules of these different salts, each of which is the type of a class of
 salts, hydrate of potash 1, nitrate of potash 2, sulphate of potash          4-,
 sulphate of magnesia 16, with nitrate of soda and sulphate of soda 6.

  1. “ Experiments and Observations upon the Properties of Light."
By Lord Brougham, F.R.S. &c.
  The author states that the optical inquiries of which he here
gives an account were conducted in the <U+FB01>rst instance under the most
favourable circumstances, arising from the climate of Provence,
where they were commenced, being peculiarly adapted to such
studies: he further states that he subsequently had the great bene<U+FB01>t
of most excellent set of instruments made by M. Soleil of Paris;
   a

                                                                  is
for experiments of kind to depend upon nice measurements, and
                           a
that all the principles which he has to note in this paper as the
result of his experiments can be made with the most simple appa
ratus and without any di<U+FB01>iculty or expense. His statement of the
results of his experiments       thrown into the form of de<U+FB01>nitions
                                    is

upon the two rival theories, the Newtonian or Atomic, and the Un
dulatory.
   The following are the author's De<U+FB01>nitions and Propositions.
                                   DEFINITIONs.
   1. Flearion   isthe bending of the rays          of light out of their course
       in passing near bodies.

                                     fill
    2. Flexion is of two kind.~—irgf!¢.n'on, or the bending tonurds the
       body; dq<U+FB02>u-ion. or the bending from the body.
    3. Flexibility, dejleribilily. in<U+FB02>exibility express the di‘position of
       the homogeneous or colour-making rays to be bent, de<U+FB02>ected,
       in<U+FB02>ected by bodies near which they pass.
                               Paorostrlon I.
    The <U+FB02>exion of any pencil or beam, whether of white or of homo
geneous light, is in some constant proportion to the breadth of the
coloured fringes formed by the rays after passing by the bending
body.     Those fringes are not three, but a very great number, con
tinually decreasing as they reccde from the bending body, in de
<U+FB02>exion, where only one bending body is acting; and they are real
images of the luminous body by whose light they are formed.
                              PROPOsITION     ll.
    The rays of light when in<U+FB02>ected by bodies near which tln-y pass
are thrown into a condition or state which disposes them to be on
one side more easily de<U+FB02>ected than they were before the <U+FB01>rst tlexion ;
and disposes them on the other side to be less easily de<U+FB02>ected: uud
when de<U+FB02>ected by bodies they are thrown into a condition or state
which disposes them to be more easily in<U+FB02>ected, and on the other
side to be less easily in<U+FB02>ected than they were before the <U+FB01>nit <U+FB02>exion.
                             Pnorosiriou      Ill.
    The disposition communicated to the rays by the <U+FB02>exion is alter
native; and after in<U+FB02>cxion they cannot be again in<U+FB02>ected on either
side; nor utter de<U+FB02>exion can they be de<U+FB02>ected.           lint they may be
de<U+FB02>ected after in<U+FB02>exion, and in<U+FB02>ected after de<U+FB02>exion, by acting on
the sides disposed, and not by acting upon the sides polarized.
                             PROPOsITION      IV.
    The disposition impressed upon the rays, nrhethcr to be easily de
<U+FB02>ected or easily in<U+FB02>ected, is strongest nearest the <U+FB01>rst bending body,
and decreases as the distance increases.
                               PROPOSITION     V.
     The fringes made by the second hody acting upon the rnya de
 <U+FB02>ected by the <U+FB01>rst, must, according to the calculus applied to the
 case, be broader than those made by the second body de<U+FB02>ecting those
 rays in<U+FB02>ected by the <U+FB01>rst.
                              Pnoeoslr|o.\'    VI.
     When one body only acts upon the rays, it must,by de<U+FB02>exion, form
 them into fringes or images decreasing as the distance from the
 bending body increases.        But when the rays de<U+FB02>ected and disposed
 by one body are afterwards in<U+FB02>ected by a second body, the fringes
 will increase as they recede from the direct rays. Also when the
 fringes made by the in<U+FB02>exion of one body, and which increase with
 the distance from the direct rays, are de<U+FB02>ected by a second body,

                                     902
the effect of the disposition and of the distances is such as to correct
the effect of the <U+FB01>rst <U+FB01>exion, and the fringes by de<U+FB02>exion of the
second body are made to decrease as they recede from the direct
                                                                             r
rays.
                            Paorosrrrou VII.
     It is proved by experiment that the in<U+FB02>exion     of the second body
makes broader fringes or images than          its  de<U+FB01>exion,  after the de
<U+FB01>exion and in<U+FB01>exion of the <U+FB01>rst body respectively;           and   also that
the de<U+FB02>exion fringes decrease, and the in<U+FB02>exion fringes       increase  with
the distance from the direct rays.
                            PROPOsITION     VIII.
     The joint action of two bodies situated similarly with respect to
 the rays which pass between them so near as to be affected by both
 bodies, must, whatever be the law of their action, provided it be in
 versely as some power of the distance, produce fringes or images
 which increase with the distance from the direct rays.
                             PROPOsITION     IX.
      It is proved by experiment that the fringes or images increase as
 the distance increases from the direct rays.
      These propositions are illustrated by particular instances, and their
 truth is shown by experiments and by some mathematical investiga
  tions. The author concludes his paper by a few observations tending
  further to illustrate and con<U+FB01>rm the foregoing propositions, and for
  the purpose of removing one or two di<U+FB02>iculties which had occurred
  to others until they were met by facts, and also of showing the
  tendency of the results at which he had arrived.
      2. “ Electro-Physiological Researches."—7th Series. By Signor
  C. Matteucci. Communicated by W. R. Grove, Esq., F.R.S.
      In this memoir, Prof. Matteucci, after recapitulating the results of
  his previous researches on electro-physiology, published in the Philo
  sophical Transactions, proceeds to the relation of new experiments.
  He <U+FB01>rst shows that nervous <U+FB01>laments made to conduct an electric
  current in a liquid are not capable, like metallic wires, of acting as
  electroids, and giving rise to electro-chemical decomposition.         The
  solution employed was that of iodide of potassium; the nerves, two
  large ones taken from a living animal, each of which was separately
  attached to the metallic extremities offa pile of <U+FB01>fteen couples.       No
   trace of decomposition followed; and he concludes from hence, that
   the conductibility of nervous matter is due to the liquid part of the
                                                 r
  matter itself.
       He then gives further experiments on the relative conductibility
   of muscles and nerves, withralview to ascertain whether, when a
   current was impelled through a 'mass of muscle, any part of the cur
   rent might have passed through the nervous <U+FB01>laments spread through
   that muscle.    For this purpose he inserted the nerve of a galvano
   scopic frog into a hole made in a piece of dead muscle, through which
    he then passed a very powerful current: no contraction followed

                                    90:!
in the galvanoscopic frog. When muscles still retaining their irri
tability wcre substituted fur the dead muscle, induced contractions
occurred in the gnlvanoscopic frog during the passage of the current.
He concludes that when the poles of a pile of twenty-<U+FB01>ve or thirty
elements are applied to the surface of the muscles of n living animal,
the phenomena produced by the passage of the current must depend
either on the direct action of the current on the muscular <U+FB01>bre, or
on the indirsd action or iv!/lumos of the electric current transmitted
by the muscular <U+FB01>bre to its own nervous <U+FB01>laments, or rather to the
nervous force existing in those <U+FB01>laments.
   Referring then to an experiment related in a preceding paper, in
which the lower limbs of a frog, united to the spine only by the
lumbar nerves, are placed astride two glasses containing water, with
each foot immersed, and in which a current, after traversing the two
limbs, and consequently the two nerves, in opposite directions, so
modi<U+FB01>es at length the excitability of the nerves, that, on opening the
circuit, only the limb in which the current has been passing inversely
contracts, he shows that if in this state what may be called the 'in
verse’ nerve be touched by a piece of muscle, although the circuit is
continued, yet the limb contracts as though the circuit had been
broken. In fact, the muscle, by its greater conductibility, becomes
traversed by thc current in place of the nerve.        Again, if after the
former part of the experiment has been performed, the portions of
nerve which had hitherto been buried among the crural musclea be
dissected out, it is easily seen that their excitability has not been af
fected like that of the lumbar nerves. because the current in place
of traversing them has traversed only the crural muscles. The nerve
has had its excitability modi<U+FB01>ed in only that part of its course in
which, being laid bare and isolated, it has necessarily conducted the
current.
   M.Du Bois Reymond(Comptu Rendua)has related an experiment
seeming to lead to the inference that section of the spinal marrow
increases the excitability of the lumbar nerves, at lcast during a
certain period of time. In order to test the accuracy of this con
clusion on so important a point, ;\‘l. Matteucci institutes a number
of very accurate experiments, in whieh he measures the excitability
of the lumbar nerves after section of the spinal marrow, by means
of the             of Breguet, used and described by him in a former
            is <U+FB01>rst results show that “the contraction excited in the
paper. applaratus
muscles of a frog, of which the spinal marrow has been divided from
twelve to eighteen hours, is stronger than that obtained under the
same circumstances from the muscles of a frog just killed, without
having been previously subjected to any injury to its nervous system."
But subsequent experiments have satis<U+FB01>ed him that this result de
pends not on the separation from the spinal marrow, but rather on
the repose in which the muscle has been permitted to remain; for
without division of the manow, nearly the same force of contraction
existed alter the same interval of time.       lle <U+FB01>nds indeed that the
only  alteration  which the  excitability of a nerve   undergoes by sepa
ration from the nervous centres, consists in its being more readily

                                  .904
 exhausted under the action of stimulants, the longer the period that
 has elapsed since its detachment.
    The author then proceeds to relate the nature of the strict analogy
 existing between electricity and nervous force.    As electricity is de
 veloped under the in<U+FB02>uence of the nervous current in the organs of
 electrical <U+FB01>shes, so, as a converse of this phenomenon, electricity
 may develope the nervous force.     After adverting to the well-known
 analogy subsisting in every particular between the phenomena of
 the electrical organ and those of muscles, he adverts to the old ex
 periment of passing a current through the muscles of the thighs of
 a living animal, the positive pole being placed now above, now below,
 so that it may be supposed that the current passes in the two cases
 in opposite directions as regards the nervous <U+FB01>laments distributed in
 the muscles. He then points out that the effects of a current
 directed downwards, in the direct course of the nerves, are a strong
 contraction of the muscle traversed, and also of the muscles of the
 leg below; while the effect of a current in the opposite, or inverse
 direction, is pain, together with contractions less violent and always
 con<U+FB01>ned to the muscles traversed.       The contractions (especially of
 the parts below) indicate a current of nervous force propagated to
 wards the muscles, while the pain indicates a current towards the
 nervous centre.     Now, bearing in mind that it has been proved by
 direct experiments that an electric current traversing a muscle never
 quits the muscular <U+FB01>bre to enter the nervous <U+FB01>laments, it seems clear
 that the phenomenajust spoken of are exclusively owing to the in
fluence exerted by the electricity passing through the muscles on
 the nervous force contained in the nerves; and also that this nervous
 force acts peripherad or centrad according to the direction of the
 electric current which excites it. The great importance of the con
 clusions drawn from these experiments consists in this, that they lead
 to the same law which establishes the analogy between nervous force
                                -ii
 and the electrical discharge of <U+FB01>shes. The paper concludes with
 some further considerations intended to con<U+FB01>rm this law.

    A  paper was read, entitled
                                “ Researches
                                              respecting the Molecular
 constitution of the Volatile Organic Bases." By Dr. A. W. Hofmann.
 Communicated by Sir James Clark, Bart., F.R.S.
    Chemists, although all acknowledging the existence of an intimate
 relation between the vegetable alkaloids and ammonia, are nevertheless
 divided in their opinions respecting the nature of this connection,
 two theories having been propounded upon the subject.       According
 to the one, that of Berzelius, the bases would have to be considered
 as conjugated ammonias in which ammonia still pre-exists as such ;
 while according to Liebig’s views, these substances are represented as

                                       Ell'a
amides, i.e. as ammonia in which one equivalent of hydrogen is
eliminated and replaced by an equivalent of a compound radical.
    The researches of the author prove that the theory of Berz\lll.ls is
inadmissible, at all events for the volatile organic bases, inasmuch as

 the means of increasing the number of these substances to an inde
 <U+FB01>nite extent.      This method consists in exposing ammonia to the
action   of  the  chlorides,     bromides or iodides of the alcohol radicals,
which remove     l    equivalent of hydrogen of the latter, as hydrochloric,
 hydrobromic,      &c.  acid, while the remaining constituents, assuming
the   alcohol-radical,     give rise to the formation of an organic base
 which unites     with   the   hydrogen acid.
    By subjecting the new base itself to              similar treatment, another
                                                      a
 equivalent of the two remaining equivalents of hydrogen may be
 removed,   a  second organic base being formed, which in its turn gives
 rise toa   third.

    1. “Observations on the Freezing of the Albumen of Eggs."         By
James Paget, Esq., Professor of Anatomy and Surgery to the Royal
 College of Surgeons.       Communicated by Thomas Bell, Esq., Sec.
 R.S. &c.
    The object of this paper is to illustrate a peculiar property of the
 albumen of the eggs of birds, a property which seems to have its pur
 pose in preserving them from the injurious effects of very low tem
peratures.
    Mr. Hunter observed that a fresh egg will resist freezing longer
 than one which has been previously frozen and thawed; and he re
 ferred this fact to the ' vital power’ of the egg in the <U+FB01>rst case, and
 the destruction of that power by freezing in the second.            The
author's experiments con<U+FB01>rm those of Mr. Hunter, and prove, also,
that when fresh eggs are exposed to very low temperatures, and also
in the case of eggs which are decayed, or putrid, or the contents of
which have been much altered by mechanical force or by electricity,
a shorter time is su<U+FB02>icient for the freezing of such eggs, than is
necessary for the freezing of those which are uninjured.
    An examination of the rates at which heat was lost by the several
eggs, exposed to temperatures varying from zero to 10° Fahr., showed
that fresh eggs, though they resist freezing longer than any others,
yet lose heat more quickly; and that their resistance to freezing is
due to the peculiar property of their albumen, the temperature of
which may be reduced to 16° Fahr., or much lower without freezing,
although its proper freezing-point is at or just below 32°.       Other
than fresh eggs lose heat comparatively slowly, but freeze as soon
as their temperature is reduced to 32°; fresh eggs lose heat more
quickly, but may be reduced to 16° or lower; then, at the instant of
beginning to freeze, their temperature rises to 32°.
    That this peculiarity of fresh eggs is not due to vital properties,
is proved by experiments which show that certain injuries, such as
mechanical violence, addition of water, and others, which spoil their
powers of resisting freezing, do not prevent eggs from being deve
loped in incubation.     By the same and other experiments, which are
related, it is made probable that the peculiarity depends on the me
chanical properties of the albumen ; for, whatever makes the albumen
more liquid than it is naturally in the fresh egg, destroys the power
of resisting freezing.

    Monsieur ct cher ami,-qle suis heureux de pouvoir vous annoncer
que l'observatoire physique central, dont le projet a été con<U+FB01>rmé par
S. M. FEmpereur. il y a deux ans, tst achevé, et son activité a com
mencé des le    l" Juillet.
    Cet établissement est destiné. comme j'ai déjà eu le plaisir de vous
écrire il y a longtemps. ù former un point central pour nos observa
toires magnétiques et météorologiques, et en général               tout ce qui
se fait, dans l'étendue de l'i-'.mpire de llussie, pour pour  a météorologie
et le magnétisme terrestre; il y a un emplacement suf<U+FB01>samment grand
pour contenir plusieurs salles d'observation, pour loger lc directeur
et son secrétaire et plusieurs calculateurs, pour une bibliothèque ct
l'archive des observations magnétiques et météorologiques envoyées
de ditïcrens points de Viimpirc. Le directeur de l'observatoire phy
sique central cxerce une surveillance active sur toutes les stations
magnétiques et météorologiques de l'E|npire; il fail. de temps en
temps des voyages d'inspection ; les observateurs qu'on emploie dans
ces stations reçoivent leurs instructions de l'observatoire de pliy
sique; les instrumens qu'on leur fournit sont véri<U+FB01>és et comparés
aux instrumens de l'observatoire; des instrumens également véri<U+FB01>és
et comparés sont deiivrés il tous les physiciens faisant partie d'ex
péditions ordonnés par le gouvernement; toutes les observations
magnétiques et météorologiques qu'on fait dans l'étendue de l'Empire
sont adressées au directeur de l'observatoire, appréciées, calculées ct
imprimées par ses soins: on essaie à l'observatoire central toutes les
nouvelles méthodes d'observation avant de les mettre en pratique, on
s'y occupe de leur perfectionnement; en<U+FB01>n on y trouve réunis tous
les moyens nécessaires pour faire des recherches dans toutes les
 branches de la physique qui sont dans un rapport plus ou moins direct
avec la physique de la terre, et qui exigent une exactitude dif<U+FB01>cile ou
impossible à atteindre dans les cabinets de physique ordinaires.
    Maintenant je n'ai qu'un seul vœu à. former, c'est que l'exemple
de notre gouvernement soit bientôt suivi par le gouvernement
anglais, qui a déjà fait de si grands sacri<U+FB01>ces pour le magnétisme
 terrestre.   Une longue expérience a du vous apprendre, comme elle
 me l’a appris, qu'un tel établissement est une néceuité, lorsqu'on

                              i
                                  908
a une si vaste entreprise a diriger que la notre, et lorsqu'il s’agit
de tirer an clair tous les résultats qu’elle promet.     Combien ne se
perd-il pas d’-argent, de temps et de peines, par des efforts isolés, qui
coordonnés convenablement et dirigés vers un but commun porte
raient les plus beaux fruits? Combien de données précieuses pour la
science ne voient jamais le jour, faute de moyens de les publier?
   Je n’hésite pas de dire, que la fondation d’un observatoire phy
sique central en Angleterre me parait étre d’une grande nécessité
dans l'état actuel des sciences d’observation, et que l’exemple donné
par le gouvernement anglais et par le notre serait bientot suivi par
les autres états.

   3. A Letter from Captain C. M. Elliot, Madras Engineers, to
Lieut.-Col. Sabine, For. Sec. R.S., transmitted through the Court
of Directors of the East India Company. Communicated by Lieut.
Col. Sabine.     .                                .
   Having   undertaken  the magnetic survey  of the   Indian Archipelago
at the  recommendation   of the  Royal Society, I   think a slight sketeh,
detailed  as  brie<U+FB02>y as possible, of my operations may not be unin
teresting to Sir John Herschel and the Committee of Physics of
which he is Chairman, prior to the publication of the Survey.           I
trust likewise I have acted strictly in accordance with the wishes of
those who so kindly recommended 1ne for the Survey, and I hope
that my earnest efforts to do my duty will gain for me that appro
bation which I have under no ordinary di<U+FB02>iculties incessantly striven
to obtain.
                                                           I
   I will in the <U+FB01>rst place mention the different stations visited, and
then describe in a few words, the way in which the observations were
taken.                                      ~
   I have made a most complete survey of Java. At Batavia               I
established an observatory where observations, magnetic and meteoro
logical, were taken hourly from 3 A-M. to 9 P.M. for nine months.
In addition, about <U+FB01>fty stations, where observations of dip, of total
intensity, of latitude, longitude, and declination were taken; these
were always made by myself, and I am certain they can be depended
u on.
   pIn
      Borneo an observatory was established at Sarawak, where ob
servations were taken quarter-hourly for three months, besides visiting
the Duteh settlements of Sambas, Pantianak and Succadana on the
western coast.
   In Sumatra four months of observation at Padang, besides mag  a
netic survey comprising about thirty stations.  I   crossed the equator
here as well as at Pantianak in Borneo.
   At Singapore compared the portable instruments with the <U+FB01>xed
                I
instruments of the observatory, besides determining the horizontal
intensity and dip, which had not been accurately determined pre
viously from insu<U+FB02>iciency of means.

                                          51)!)
    At   the Cocos or Keeling Islands. sir weeks of observation.
    At   Sambooangsn, in the Island of Mindanao, upwards ofa week.
    At   Keemah in Celcbes, the same.
    At Penang, the same.
    At hloulmein, the same.
    At the Nicobars, the same.
    At Bencoolen in Sumatra, the same.
    I will now mention the instruments and the mode of observation at
the observatories.      The following instruments were registered every
hour from 8 .\.u. to 9 P.M- Two declinometen. and latterly a third
made by Jones; s bi<U+FB01>lar magnetometer and its thermometer; a
standard barometer and its lhcnnometer by Newman; a standard
thermometer and a dry and wet bulb.
    On the survey, I employed for the observations four dipping
ncedles; a portable declinometer with altitude and azimuth instru
ment for the declination and for latitude; a sextant, arti<U+FB01>cial hori
zon and chronometer for the error and rates of the wateh, which
 was but a poor one.
     I began work generally st 6 A.u., put up the portable declinometer,
 and allowed the brass weight and stirrup to swing for a couple of
 hours thoroughly to take the torsion out of the thread, adjusting it
 from time to time so that the stirrup might ultimately take up a po
 sition in the magnetic meridian; during this period I took the dip.
 At 8 A.M. I took sights with the sextant, and putting in the collimator
 magnet, I adjusted the altitude and azimuth to                it,
                                                             and took altitudes
 and azimuths of the sun, three on the limb direct, and three on the
 limb reversed, noting the reading on the horizontal limb at the same    ;
 time this gave me the reading of the true meridian; the magnetic
 axis of the collimator magnet was then read off; these observations
 were usually completed       by      A..\|.: by
                                   9,‘,               ll
                                                      A..\I.   had <U+FB01>nished my
                                                                I
 observations for horizontal intensity.        The small collimator magnet
 being suspended, the large collimator magnet was placed at four dif
 ferent distances east and west, and the de<U+FB02>ecting collimator magnet
 was then vibrated and 800 oscillations taken.
      At ll  A.l\I. observed altitudes and azimuths of the sun with the
                I
 altitude and azimuth instrument for equal altitudes.           At noon took I
 circummeridional      altitudes of the sun, thrcewith the limb direct,
 and three with the limb reversed. for latitude; at P..\I.      I   again took
                                                                         I
 altitudes and azimuths.
     By equal altitudes from the mean of the times, was enabled to   I
 check the results given by the sextant for time; and by the azimuths
 corresponding to the equal altitudes,          checked the observations for
                                                  I
 the true   meridian  taken   at
                               9  A..\l. for the declination.    By this means
I   was always certain     of the results by using    different  modes  of veri
 <U+FB01>cation.
     If stopped another day at the stations repeated the observations
     I                                                I                          ;
if
 I     was going to move off,  I    packed up the instruments and struck
 the   tents, which generally took me the afternoon and the greater
 part of the evening, for had no one to assist me.
                           I
      At sea, whenever an opportunity offered, took meteorological
                                                           I
 observations, viz. the standard thermometer, the dry and wet bulb,

                                   910
 and the temperature of the air and sea at 3 A.M. and 1>.M., and at 9
 A.M. and P.M.; sights for longitude at 9 A.M. and 3 P.M., and latitude
 at noon, besides the dip three times, and sometimes <U+FB01>ve times a day ;
 every absolute determination was made by me.
    Thus on shore as well as at sea, observations were commenced at
 3 A.M., and never terminated till 9 P.M.: I had for my assistant an
 Indo-Briton.
    I will not trouble the Council of the Royal Society with stories of
 the dif<U+FB01>culties I met with; su<U+FB02>ice it to say, that a stranger amongst
 the Duteh, the necessity of conciliating the natives in seeing me em
 ployed in a manner so strange to them, travelling in the monsoons
 and in all weathers, sometimes for hours wet in the saddle, living
 in huts for weeks, the only shelter being cocoanut leaves, and at sea
 in a leaky old schooner that was perpetually in danger of foundering,
 with a captain who was scarcely ever sober,-it is not surpriing
 that once or twice I fell sick. I am now but slowly recovering from
Java and Car Nicobar fever caught in the execution of my duty.
 I take the liberty of adding for the information of the Council of the
 Royal Society, that I never took a single observation unless I was by
myself and m attention undisturbed.       If strangers were importunate,
I waited untilthey left me. If the weather was against me, I took
no observations until it settled.    I made it a rule never to be in a
hurry, and always to <U+FB01>nish one set of observations before I commenced
another, and to be as comfortable as circumstances would admit.
I am certain that an observation is the more valuable in propor
tion to the mind being not only at ease, but able to <U+FB01>x itself with
undivided attention on the observations. I never, for instance, would
think of taking an observation whilst bored by an intruder, or a high
wind, or a heavy shower of rain falling. I preferred under such
circumstances invariably to sacri<U+FB01>ce the observation rather than
to record it.
    I have the honour of sending to the Council as a specimen of the
way in which the work was carried on, some of the absolute deter
minations made at the Cocos or Keeling Islands; they will be able
to see that often after the labours of the day had commenced at
3 A.M., they were not terminated at 9 P.M.; and in order to observe
moon-culminating stars, I had sometimes to remain up the greater
part of the night, for I had no one on whom I could place any de
pendence to awake me at the proper time.
    Paper A contains the way and order in which the instruments of
the observatory were registered.

the author states that he now brings forward an experiment which
proves, not that water in a compound, but rcully x simple element,
the generator of oxygen and hydrogen, since, without being decom
posed, a volume of water being given, it may be entirely transformed
at will, either into oxygen or into hydrogen.        Thus, he considers, it
is no longer a decomposition of pre-existing elements which is ef

which are formed at the cxpcnse of the water, by the transposition
of its combined or coeroitive electricity which places itself in excess
in the water which becomes oxygen, at the cxpcnac of another
volume which becomes hydrogen.             He considers that this will, no
doubt, appear very extraordinary, but that nevertheless it is now
“ un fait xccompliet acquis il la science."
    After describing the experiments which he considers support his
doctrine, the author concludes by observing that these experiments
prove,—lat, that contrary to the indefensible theory, a compound
electric <U+FB02>uid which is decomposed and recompooed, there is u true
transfer of <U+FB02>uid in the current, which besides would be su<U+FB02>iciently
evident by its motive powcr.        2nd. That the electric <U+FB02>uid is really
the cocrcitive agent of cohesion.         8rd. That Water in not a com
pound, is not an oxide, but truly x <U+FB01>rst clement, the generator of
oxygen and of hydrogen.        4-th. ln <U+FB01>ne, it reveals a power unknown
until now, and that very likely many other bodies are in the same
case as water.
    In a second communication the author states that he had occa
sionally met with some anomalous results on repeating his expe
riments, nnd then points out how them are to be obviated.

     1. “ An account of a remarkable Aurora Borculis seen at hlontrcnl
 on the 18th of August 18-t-9."      By Mr. Thomas M"Ginn.         Commu
 nicated by Thomas Bell, Esq., Sec. R.S., &c.
    The author having witnessed a singular aurora on the 18th of
 August, in this communication gives a description of the phreno
 menon. He states that, on the evening in question, the whole north
ern hemispherc was screened by thick dark clouds, which, though
 very small, were closely packed together.         Shortly after sunset (7"
84-“)    it became  quite dark,  and   at  8 o'clock  the existence of the

                                     912
meteor was indicated by a mellow luminous tinge which appeared
through the openings of the clouds in the north.
    About half-past eight a similar luminous glow was observed
through the clouds which were fast disappearing in a heavy dew.
This light appeared like a belt of 2° broad, extending across the
sky from a point almost due east directly to the west, and reaching
within 5° or 6° of the horizon.        As the clouds disappeared, which
they   did very rapidly, the  true character  of the aurora became more
perfectly developed.      In the  north  the usual  dark arch from which
the columns of light ordinarily appear to issue, was for the greater
part of the time wanting; and the luminous columns seemed to rise
from the earth, extending upwards occasionally to the pole star,
beyond which no trace of them was visible.             A brown vapoury
cloud,the only one now visible, extended along the horizon fromN.N.E.
to a few points south of east, and maintained apparently a motion
less position, the lower part appearing to rest upon the earth, and
the upper edges, which seemed uniform, rose about 6° above the
 horizon.   Immediately in the east, and apparently issuing from this
 cloud, rose the belt or zone of light already noticed, forming a mag
 ni<U+FB01>cent arch.    The light emitted from this zone was of a milky
 whiteness, and the matter of it seemed to be much more compact
 than any portion of an aurora ever seen by the author; but imme
 diately in the zenith, where it intersected the Milky Way, it ap
 peared to be far less compact.        At this point, where alone motion
 was observable, a constant current was seen, presenting the appear
 ance of light <U+FB02>eecyclouds driven by a strong wind, and following
 each other in such close succession as to appear in contact.         This
 stream of the aurora was maintained undiminished for more than an
 hour, during which time the eastern part of the zone did not appear
 to lose either in volume or brilliancy, nor did the western seem to
 gain in either of these respects. After an hour, the dark cloud
 seemed to diminish slowly, and with it the zone began to lose its
 brilliancy. In about another hour this cloud and also the zone,
 which throughout had maintained apparent contact with it, vanished.
 The conclusion, that the dark cloud served the purpose of a con
 ductor and fed the zone drawing off the matter of the aurora from
 the north, seemed to the author inevitable.        The cloud did not ap
 pear to him to be more than forty or <U+FB01>fty miles distant.       In conclu
sion he remarks that none of the prismatic tints were observable on
 this occasion.
    2. “ On the Development of the Retina and Optic Nerve, and of
 the Membranous Labyrinth and Auditory Nerve." By Henry Gray,
 Esq., M.R.C.S. Communicated by William Bowman, Esq., F.R.S.,
 &c.
    The author has divided the observations contained in this paper
 into two parts :—the <U+FB01>rst of which treats of “ The Development of
 the Retina and Optic Nerve; the second, of the Development of
 the Membranous Labyrinth and Auditory Nerve."
    In the observations on the development of the retina, which have

                           '            {H3
been made on the embryo       of thc chick, the author demonstrates its
mode of evolution, and also the mode of dcvelnp||ncnt of the various
layers of which this membrane is formed.        They commence at the
early period of the thirty-third hour of incubation, at which time
the cephalic extremity of the embryo prcscnts a slight protrusion of
its walls, which by the thirty-sixth hour is very considerably in
creased, having become more clongated and protruded outwards,
presenting a somewhat dilated cud, and being somewhat constricted
at its connection with the antl'rior ccrcbrul cell from which it ariscs.
 This is the <U+FB01>rst indication of thc develop|ncnt of this membrane.
    At the forty-sixth hour this protrusion (which the author culls
 the optic vesicle) was still morc distinct. and the cavity in thc cere
 bral cell, from the wall of which it arises, was \vl'll sccn, and it was
 observed to communicate with the cavity of the optic veIlCle which
 was also hollow.    This description of the mode of development of
 the retina the author considers as con<U+FB01>rmatory of the observations
 made by Buer, but not in accordance with that gin-n by Wagner
or lluschke.
   The author then proceeds to tlctttd very miuuti-ly    thc consccutive
stages of the development of the retina and parts in     immediate con
nection with  it, until the seventh duy, when he stun-a  that on making
a section  of the eyc,it  was separated from thc other   tunirs as per   a
fectly distinct laycr.    The  optic nerves were also    now complctely
formed, being united to form the chiasma, and passed iu\vt1rt.ls in
the direction of the under surface of the corpora qundrigeminu.
    The author in the next placc procccds to consider Ihc develop
ment of the various layers of thc retinal membrzmc,          point which
                                                                 a
appears not to have been pn-\iou‘ly noticed                 by
                                                       any physiologist.
This membrane on the eighth day of incubation can lu- s13o!], by the
naked eye, distinct from the other tunics.     lLs choroidul surface         is
composed of mass of globular nuclci about the size of the rcd cor
              a
puscles of the blood, which form at this period about one-half the
entire thickness of the retina, the decpcr surface consisting of some
 <U+FB01>ne granular matter and     mass of pale and delicate nucleated cells
                               a
similar to those found surrounding the <U+FB01>brous lamina in the normal
structure of the membrane.
    The “ Membrana Jacobi"        <U+FB01>rst observed on the thirteenth day
                                    is
 asa  <U+FB01>ne pale granular stratum which covers in the globular nuclei
 already described. In this, at‘ about the <U+FB01>ftecnth day, some brilliant
 yellowish granules are imbedded; they vary        size from the 50(X)th
 to the 8000th of an inch, and around them           n in
                                                    delicate cell-waIl       is
 traced; they soon acquire an oval shape; then become more clon
 gated; and about the eighteenth day the almost perfect rods arc
 formed.    They are now disposed in an imbricated manner, and their
 nuclei, which are of  a bright yellow colour, are placed generally at
 the apex, but sometimes in the middle of the rods.       On the twenty—
 <U+FB01>rst day this membrane      similar to what
                               is                sccn in the full-grown
                                                   is
 bird.
                                                                     '
    The <U+FB01>rst trace of the “ <U+FB01>brous lamina"         is seen between the four
 teenth and <U+FB01>fteenth days, as       a    <U+FB01>ne pale granular lamina marked by
                                                                  0

                                     9l4'
 numerous faint longitudinal       striae. On the eighteenth day this
 membrane when separated from the other layers is seen composed
 of numerous <U+FB01>brillated meshes, in which are deposited the nucleated
 vesicles which are formed as early as the eighth day. From these
  observations it is seen that the retina is formed as a protrusion from
 the most anterior cerebral cell, being hollow and communicating with
 its cavity; that it subsequently assumes a pyriform shape, presenting
 a dilated end, thert'uture retina, and a tubular portion, the optic
 nerve.    As the tubular portion becomes solidi<U+FB01>ed so as to form the
 optic nerve, then no communication can be traced between the op
 tic vesicle and the cavity from which it is an offset.       By degrees
 the spherical end of the protrusion is absorbed, and the retina, being
 now fully formed, becomes attached to the margin of the lens. The
 optic nerve is then traced to be connected not only with the anterior
 cerebral cell, but, uniting with its fellow at the under surface of the
 optic lobes, is seen partly to terminate in those bodies.   The deduc
 tions from these observations may be thus brie<U+FB02>y stated :—
    1st. They confirm the observations on the structure of the retina
 made by Bowman, who has shown that the essential part of this
 membrane is analogous to the cineritious matter of the brain, and is
 composed like it of a <U+FB01>brous mesh intermingled with vesicles of
 grey matter, being, in fact, a portion of the cerebrum pushed out
 wards and connected with the brain by its appropriate commissure,
 the optic nerve. The mode of development of this membrane
 would show this to be the correct view of the structure of this
 essential part of the retinal expansion, and at the same time disprove
the statements of Henle, who believed it to be more analogous to
 epithelium.
    2nd. The origin of the optic vesicle from the anterior cerebral
cell, would show the incorrectness of the opinion of those anato
mists who have stated that none of the <U+FB01>bres of the optic nerve
could be traced to the optic thalami.      The thalami being developed
from the same centre from whence these vesicles arise, would render
it exceedingly probable that the optic nerves had some connection
with those bodies.
    The second part of the paper describes the development of the
membranous labyrinth and auditory nerve.
    The essential part of the auditory apparatus, viz. the membranous
labyrinth, consists, like the retina, of a membranous lamina formed
of the terminal axes cylinders of the nerve tubules in intimate con
nection with a layer of closely-set nucleated cells; like it also, it
may be regarded as a portion of the brain protruded outwards, and
connected with an appropriate apparatus which receives and trans
mits its peculiar impressions; its mode of development also shows a
striking analogy between it and the retinal expansion.
    At the <U+FB01>ftieth hour of incubation,-there is seen on either side of
the medulla oblongata, (which is.not closed in above and presents
an operfshallow cavity,) the <U+FB01>rst rudiment of the auditory sac, in
the form of a small circular-shaped protruded vesicle, communi
cating with the ventricular cavity from the lateral wall of which it

                                        915
 is an offset.    The vcsiclc was hollow, ch-sr and pcllncid, and of u
 <U+FB02>attened circular form.        At the lilly-sixth hour it lmd incrcnscd in
 size and prc.-icnted n pcnr-slmpcd tignrc: so that nmv the narrow
 contracted tubular portion appeared the <U+FB01>rst stage in the devrl0p
 ment of the audilory ncrrc; thc dilated portion, the auditory sac or
 rudimentary vestibule; and the cavity still existing in its interior
 and communicating with the ventricular cavity from which it arises,
 by means of thc tubular prnlungaliml, the auditory ncrvc.                   The
 aperture of co|n|nunicnlion soon b\'ol)n|\'s pnmllcr and more con
 tracted, and this incn-n.-rs as lhc scpuration behvecn the auditory
 vesicle and its parcnt-ct-ll tukcs plucc.        At the sixty-tifth hour, be
 sides a great incrcaw in the sizc of the var-bulb. thc auditory ncrve
 has l.-ccoine more distinctly        fornml, and is quite solidi<U+FB01>ed, so
 that no communication can now he lrured bel\H'\'n thc ventricular
 cavity nnd the vestibular sac.        It is in this stage of the developincnt
 of the auditory apparatus that n great siinilarity is to be observed
 between it and the normal condition of the smnc part in some of
 the lower animals.       Tlicrc are, in fact, now formed the two clement
 ary portions    of  the auditory apparatus, the auditory In-rve and tho
 simple   vrstibular  sac.    Such is tln- simplc condition of the organ in
 the Crustacea and Ccphalopod Mollusks.                At the seventy-secoml
 hour, the vestibular sac has lost its oval form and presents a con
 traction around its cntire circumfcrence.           This is the <U+FB01>rst indication
 of  the separation   of thc  vestibule  from   the  membranous    semicircular
 canals which are ultimately formed         from   the  terminal portion of the
 vesicle.
    The minute examination of the development of thcse structures,
 of which a consecutive detail is given, leads the author to remark
 on the almost precise similarity in structure of the membranous
 labyrinth to the retina in its various stages of development, for it
 consists like it of n delicate <U+FB01>brous mesh in the arcolzc of which is
deposited granular matter and numerous nucleated cells, its outer
surface being composed of globular-shaped nuclei arranged similar
to those covering the outer surface of the retina at an early period
of its devebpment.
    From this description a marked similarity may be observed be
tween the origin of this membrane and that of the retina.               ln both
cases they arise as a protruded portion of the cerebral mass, being
hollow and communicating with the cavity of the parcnt-cell.                   In
process of time, a gradual separation takcs place betwccn them and
the parts from whence they arise. They then assume a pyritbn|n
shape, but still communicate with the ccrcbral cavity.            As, liowcver,
the nerves become solidi<U+FB01>ed and the separation betwccn them is
more fully efli-cted, then no communication can be traced between
the two cavities.
    8. “Tide Researches.         Fourteenth Series.        On the Results of
continued Tide Observations at scveral places on the British Coasts."
By the Rev. W. Vlfhewell, I).D., F.R.S. &c.
    Tide observations made at several different parts of the British
                                                                  gs

                                     916
and neighbouring shores, and in some instances continued for a con
siderable period, having been discussed by Mr. D. Ross of the
Hydrographer's O<U+FB02>ice, with great labour and perseverance, a brief
statement of the results which his labours afford is here presented
by Dr. Whewell.
   The discussions here referred to relate to the height of high water,
and the variations which this height undergoes in proceeding from
springs to neaps, and from neaps to springs.            It is found, by ex
amining the observations at 120 places, and throwing the heights
into curves, that the curve is very nearly of the same form at all
these places.    Hence the semi-mensual series of heights at any place
affords a rule for the series of heights at all other places where the
difference of spring height and neap height is the same.             For in
stance, Portsmouth, where the difference of spring height and neap
height is 2 ft. 8 in., is a rule for Cork, Waterford, Inverness, Bantry,
Arcachan on the French coast, and other places: and the tables of
the heights of high water at one of these places suf<U+FB01>ces for all the
others, a constant being of course added or subtracted according to
the position of the zero-point from which the heights at each place
are measured.                                                           .
    The series of heights of high water for a semi-lunation also agrees
very exactly, as to the form of the curve, with the equilibrium
theory.    A very simple construction is given for the determination
of this curve. The properties deduced according to theory from
this construction are, however, in actual cases, modi<U+FB01>ed in a manner
which is then described.
    1. The tides in these discussions are not referred to the transit of
the moon immediately preceding, but to some earlier transit, namely,
the second, third, fourth or <U+FB01>fth preceding transit, it being found
that in this way the accordance with the theory becomes more
 exact.
    2. According to this construction, the difference of springs and
 neaps would be to the height of neaps above low water springs as
 10 to Qt, a constant ratio for all places; but in fact this ratio is dif
 ferent at different places: and the observations under consideration
 show that the ratio is smaller where the tide is smaller.
    In consequence of the law of the high water, given alike by the
 theory and by the observations, the spring high waters are above the
 mean high water for a longer period than the neaps are below it.

    These observations prove that, contrary to the opinion of Home
and Cuvier, the Wart-hogs have deciduous teeth, succeeded verti
cally by premolar teeth; in the P/mcocbmrus .Eliani, at least,
three deciduous teeth arc, in some individuals, succeeded             as                                           by
many premolar    teeth;  and, as   general  rule,  two deciduous
                                                           a       tccth
are displaced vertically by two premolars.     The <U+FB01>rst tuIe molar                                                      is
remarkable for its unusually early development, which          followed                                       is
by an unusually early abrasion and expulsion, when its place         ob                                            is
literated by the second true molar being pushcd lorwards into con
tact with the last premolar.     This tooth       as remarkable for its                      is
longevity, and remains after the wearing away and shedding of the
second true molar, when the last true molar advances into contact

                                     918
  with the last premolar, and the place of both the previously inter
   vening true molars is obliterated.     This unusual order of shedding
   of the molar teeth has given rise to the idea of the last large and
   complex   true molar  of the  P/zacoc/zaerus  being the homologue      of
   boththe last and penultimate grinders of the common Hog, which
  the author's observations refute; and he, also, is able to point out,
  by re-examination of the original specimen <U+FB01>gured -by Home in the
  Phil.Trans., the source of the erroneous idea that the common Hog
  had an additional true molar behind the large one symbolised by
  m 3, in the author's system of dental notation.
     The nature and signi<U+FB01>cation of the symbols proposed are ex
  plained and illustrated by a series of drawings.      One of the fruits
  of the determination of the homology of a part is the power of gi
  ving it a name, and signifying it by a symbol applicable co-exten
  sively with such homology.       The limits are shown within which
  the homologies of individual teeth can be determined: they present
  the requisite constancy of character in a large proportion of the
  class Mammalia.      Certain members of this class, e. g. the order
  Bruta and the Cetacea vera, have teeth too numerous and alike in
  form and mode of development to admit of being determined indi
  vidually from species to species. Such mammalia have but one set
  of teeth, and the author proposes to call them 'Monophyodonts.’
  On the other hand, the orders Marsupialia, Insectivom, Rodentia,
  Ruminantia, Pack}/dermata, Carnivora, Cheiroptera, 'Quadrumzma
  and Bimana have two sets of teeth, and might be called collectively,
  'Diphyodonts.’ Of the permanent teeth of this division of mam
  malia, some succeed the deciduous teeth vertically, others come into
                                                           The ' incisors
                                                                           ’
 place behind one another in horizontal succession.
 are determined by a character of relative positionito the jaws and
 to each other: so likewise the ' canines.’     The remaining teeth are
 divided into those which are developed in vertical relation to the
 deciduous molars, and push them out, and those that have not such
 relation, but follow each other horizontally: the term ' molar’ is re
 sfricted by the author to these latter teeth, and that of ' premolar’
 to the former ones, which are always anterior to the molars. There
 is a remarkable degree of constancy in the number of these different
                                                                           '

the author regards as the typical formula of dentition in the great
proportion of the mammalian class above de<U+FB01>ned.             It was rarely
departed from by the primaeval species that have become extinct,
and is modi<U+FB01>ed chie<U+FB02>y by defect or loss of certain teeth in the ex
isting species. When the grinders are below the typical number,
the missing molars are taken from the back part of their series,'and
the premolars from the fore part of theirs: the most constant teeth
being the fourth premolar and <U+FB01>rst true molar; these are always
determinable, whatever be their form, by the relation to them of the

                                     Til?!
last tooth of the deciduous       series.   Thus determined,    the homo
logies of the other grinders are trsccrtained by counting the molars
from the <U+FB01>rst backwards, I, Q, 3; and the premolars from the last
forwards, -1-. 3, 2. l. The symbols am made by adding the initial m
to the numbers of the molar teeth, and the initinlp to those of the
premolar teeth. The author concludes by pointing out the advan
tages of this system of anatomical notation.

Berthon, M.A. ('ommunicmcd              by Sir Francis Beaufort, I-'.l(.S.
&c., on the part ol the Lords Coinn|i.-sioners of the Admiralty.
   The object of this invention is to ohtain u ;'\'gi‘lor of the speed
of ships, by a column of mercury. in such a manner that the height
of the column shall depend upon the velocity alone, and not be
a<U+FB02>ected by any disturbing causes, such as alteration of draught of
water, pitehing nnd rolling, dc.
   The principle embraces that of Pitofs tube, inasmuch as the
force of the resistance due to the velocity is communicated through
a small pipe projecting into the water below the bottom of the ship:
this force, acting upwards, C0nn|)rr.'\"-e<U+FB01> a portion of enclosed air in a
small cylinder, which air communicating by means of n little pipe
with the bulb of a glass tube—bent like a common barometer
raises the mercury in the tube, by depressing it in the bulb.
   But as any single column of water and air thus acting upon the
surface of the mercury in the bulb alone must depend not only upon
the resistance due to the velocity, hut also upon the distance of!/ac
eylindn <U+FB01>-om t/ic water-Um', which distance or height varies with
every sea, and alters more permanently as the draught of water
changes, a compensation was necessary; and the inventor has found
one, which he considers perfect for all these variations, by applying
n second column of water and air to press upon the Ol/I07' nzrfucc of
the mercury, viz. that in the glass tube.         This second column is
precisely  like the  <U+FB01>rst as regards  the  pipe and cylinder, and commu
nicates with the sea by an aperture or apertures, presented in such
a direction that velocity does not produce any increase ofpreuure.
Thus the mercury in the indicator is placed belwcm 1-wo column:
of water and air, which are always u/ual to car/| ol/ier in length, and
the mercury rises according to the djffermce between the pressures
upon its two surfaces, the result of resistance or velocity alone.
   The air-pipes may he conducted in any direction, and the indi
cator, which swings upon gimbals, may be placed in any part of
the ship.     The two water-pipes are conducted into one tube in the
bottom of the ship, divided into two separate chambers for the dif
ferent forces.
   In addition to the speed, the true course or leeway of the vessel
is indicated upon a horizontal segment divided into degrees, over
which a needle is moved by a rod connected with the nbove-men
tioned double tube; and the whole is kept continually in the true
direction of the ship's motion by a <U+FB02>oat or vane attached to the
lower end of the tube in the water.

   1. “ Supplementary Observations on the Structure of the Belemnite
and Belemnoteuthis."      By Gideon Algernon Mantell, Esq., LL.D.,
F. R.S., Vice-President of the Geological Society, &c.
    In this communication the author describes his recent investiga
tions on the structure of the two genera of fossil Cephalopoda, whose
remains occur so abundantly in the Oxford clay of Wiltshire,
namely, the Belemnite and Belenmoteuthis, as supplementary to his
memoir on the same subject, published in the Phil. Trans. 184-8. In
that paper evidence was adduced to show the correctness of the
opinion of the late Mr. Channing Pierce as to the generic distinction
of these two extinct forms of Cephalopoda.
    As however several eminent naturalists had expressed doubts as
to some of the opinions advanced by the author in his former memoir,
<U+FB01>gures and descriptions are given in the present notice, of beautiful
and instructive specimens lately discovered in Wiltshire, and which
he conceives establish his previous conclusions.      Dr. Mantell then
states as the result of his examination of several hundred examples,
that our knowledge of the organization of the animal of the Belem
nite is at present limited to the following parts, viz.—
    1. An external Capsule or periostracum which invested the osse
let or sepiostaire, and extending upwards, constituted the external
sheath of the receptacle.
    2. The Osselet, characterized by its <U+FB01>brous radiated structure,
terminating distally in a solid rostrum or guard, having an alveolus,
or conical hollow, to receive the apical portion of the chambered
phragmocone; and expanding proximally into a thin cup, which
became con<U+FB02>uent with the capsule, and formed the receptacle for
the viscera.
    3. The P/zragmocone, or chambered, siphunculated, internal shell ;
the apex of which occupied the alveolus of the guard, and the upper
part constituted a capacious chamber, from the basilar margin of
which proceeded two long, flat, testaceous processes.
    These structures comprise all that are at present known of the
animal to which the fossil commonly called “ T/ze Belemnite,"
belonged.
    Of the Belenmoteuthis, the fossil cephalopod which Prof. Owen
regards as identical with the Belemnite, many examples of the body
with eight uncinated arms, and a pair of long tentacula, having an
ink-bag and pallial <U+FB01>ns, have been discovered.       The osselet of this
animal, like that of the Belemnite, has a <U+FB01>bro-radiated structure,
investing a conical chambered shell; but this organ, for reasons
fully detailed in the memoir, the author considers could never have
been contained within the alveolus of a Belemnite; the soft parts
of the animal of the Belemnite are therefore wholly unknown.
    Many beautiful specimens of Belemnites and Belemnoteuthis were

     The author had for a long \\ hilc entertained the ides, that among
the remains of colossal nepiilcs obtained from the W1-alden strata,
there were indications of sevl'ral gs-ncrn of ternestriul sauriuns,
besides those established by hiinsq-lf and other geologists.              The re
cent discovcrv of an cnormous arm-bome, or hu|ncrus. of an unde
scribed reptile of the crocodilian type, in u quarry of Tilgatc Foni-st
 in Sussex, where Dr. .\lnntell had |nuny years since collected nume
 rous teeth and bones of the lguunodon, llylmosaurus, &'c., and some
 remarkable vertebrae nnt referable to known genera, induced him to
embody in the present communication the fact-1 which his latc rc
searchra have brought to light                                      .
     The humerus above-mentioned was found ln\lbedtll'd in sandstone,
 by Mr. Peter Fuller of Lewes, at about 20 fect below the surface;
 it presents the usual mincralized condition of the fossil boncs from
 the arenaccous strata of the \\'calden. lt is four and a half feet in
 length, and the circumference of its distal extremity is 32 inches l It
 has a ml'dullary cavity 3 inches in diameter, which at once separates it
 from the Cetiosnurus and other supposed marine saurians, while its
 form and proportions distinguish it from the humerus of the igua
 nodon, Hyhicosaunis, and .\legnlosaurus.              lt approaches most nearly
 to the   Crocodilinns,   but possesses characters distinct from any known
 fossil genus.     Its size is stupendous, far surpassing that of the cor
 responding bone even of the gigantic lguanodon; and the name of
 Pelorosaurus (from sréhup pclor, mon.-ter‘) is therefore proposed
 for the genus, with the speci<U+FB01>c term Coni/beuri, in honour of the
 paleontological labours ofthc Dean of l.landaff.
      No bones have been found in such contiguity with this humerus,
 as to render it certain that they belonged to the same gigantic rep
 tile; but several very large caudal vertebrae of peculiar characters,
 collected from the same quarry, are probably referable to the Pelo
 rosaurus; these, together with some distal caudals which belong to
 the same type, are <U+FB01>gured and described by the author.
      Certain femora and other boncs from the oolite of Oxfordsliire,
 in the collection of the Dean of Wcstiiiinster, at Oxford, are men
  tioned as possessing characters more allied to those of the Pelo
 rosaurus, or to some unknown terrestrial saurian, than to the Ce
 tiosaurus, with which they have been confounded.
      As to the magnitude ofthe animal to which the humerus belonged,
  Dr. Mantell, while disclaiming the idea of arriving at any certain
 conclusions from a single bone, states that in a Gavial 18 feet
  long, the humerus is I foot in length; i. e. one-eighteenth part of
  the length of the animal, from the end of the muzzle to the tip of

                                     922
the tail. According to these admeasurements the Pelorosaurus would
be 81 feet long, and its body 20 feet in circumference.        But if we
assume the length and number of the vertebrae as the scale, \ve
should have a reptile of relatively abbreviated proportions; even in
this case, however, the original creature would far surpass in mag
nitude the most colossal of reptilian forms.
    In conclusion, Dr. Mantell comments on the probable physical
conditions of the countries inhabited by the terrestrial reptiles of the
secondary ages of geology.         These highly-organized colossal land
saurians appear to have occupied the same position in those ancient
faunas as the large mammalia in those of modern times. The trees
and plants whoseremains are associated with the fossil bones, mani
fest, by their close af<U+FB01>nity to living species, that the islands or con
tinents on which they grew possessed as pure an atmosphere, as
high a temperature, and as unclouded skies as those of our tropical
climes.     There are therefore no legitimate grounds for the hypo
thesis in which some physiologists have indulged, that during the
“Age of Reptiles” the earth was in the state of a half-<U+FB01>nished
planet, and its atmosphere too heavy, from an excess of carbon, for
the respiration of warm-blooded animals. Such an opinion can only
have originated from a partial view of all the phenomena which
these problems embrace, for there is as great a discrepancy between
the existing faunas of different regions, as in the extinct groups of
animals and plants which geological researches have revealed.
    The memoir was illustrated by numerous drawings, and the gi
gantic humerus of the Pelorosaurus and other bones were placed
before the Society.

    1. “ On the Extension of the Principle of Fermat’s Theorem of
the Polygonal Numbers to the higher orders of series whose ultimate
differences are constant. With a new Theorem proposed, applicable
to all the Orders."      By Sir Frederick Pollock, Lord Chief Baron,
F.R.S.                           i
   The object of this paper professes to be to ascertain whether the
principle of Fermat’s theorem of the polygonal numbers may not be
extended to all orders of series whose ultimate differences are con
stant. The polygonal nnmbers are all of the quadratic form, and
they have (according to Fermat's theorem) this property, that every
number is the sum of not exceeding, 3 terms of the triangular num
bers, 4‘ of the square numbers, 5 of the pentagonal numbers, &c.
   It is stated in this paper that the series of the odd squares 1, 9, 25,

   It    manifest that this series
          is                           of such form, that by varying
                                                        is                         a

nect together by a regular gradation (as is well known) any such
arithmetical series with a geometric series, whose common ratio is
the 2nd term of both series. The theorem may be stated without
the series thus :—
    If any geometric series (having l for its <U+FB01>rst term) and (1 +12)
for its common ratio, be stayed at the (p+l)th term and discon
tinued as a geometric series, but be continued from that term as an
ari<U+FB02>zmetic series of' the pt/z order, by forming it with the pth differ
ence as the constant difference, and the other di<U+FB01>erences (which
will be ac, .112, av’, &c. . . . . 1"'). The resulting series will be
the series stated in the theorem above, and any number may be
formed by not exceeding (pn+l) terms, that is (pn-|-1) will be
the notation-limit oi’ the series; ifp becomes inde<U+FB01>nitely great, the
limit of the series is a geometrical series, and it would become capa
ble of expressing any number according to a system of notation
Whose base or local value would be (1 +11).
    The proof of the theorem seems to depend upon this, that the no
tation-limit assigned by the theorem is actually the notation-limit
of all the geometric terms and one more, at least, while the geometric
terms alone <U+FB01>x the law of the series and ascertain its elements (that
is, the <U+FB01>rst term and the successive differences); and as the com
 binations necessary to enable the series to ful<U+FB01>ll its law, and carry
 on the notation that belongs to    it, are regulated by the series next
 below  it,  viz. by the <U+FB01>rst rank of differences, while the supply of
 new combinations (as the series advances and the number of terms
 that may be used increases)  is  indicated by even higher series than
                                                       a
 itself, the new combinations are always greater, and at length inde
 <U+FB01>nitely greater, than the number required.       If therefore within the
 range of those terms that ascertain and <U+FB01>x the law of the series the
 law of its notation-limit can be obeyed,     itmust always (dfortiori)
 be obeyed as the series proceeds to      agreater number of terms and
 to a variety of combinations increasing in        higher ratio; and the
                                                   a
 series will furnish the numbers requisite to carry on the notation by
 the new and more numerous combinations which must of necessity
 be of the same numerical kind with those which have preceded them.
 Itis   shown at length, that the new combinations, as the series ad
  vances, do actually increase in an increasing proportion compared
 with the numbers required.
   2. “Experiments on the section of the Glossopharyngeal         and
Hypoglossal Nerves of the Frog, and Observations of the altera
tions produced thereby in the Structure of their primitive <U+FB01>bres."
By Augustus Waller, M.D. Communicated by Professor Owen,
F.R.S. &c.
   After describing the natural structure of the tubular <U+FB01>bres of the
nerves, the author states the results which he observed to follow
the section of the nerves of the frog's tongue.   To this organ two
principal pairs of nerves are distributed; one of these, issuing from
the
     cranium along with the pneumogastric and distributed to the
fungiform papillae,  isregarded as the glossopharyngeal; the other,

                                  925
arising from the anterior part of the spinal cord, and               through
the <U+FB01>rst intervertebral foramen, the author (following      passing
                                                                    iurdach)
names the hypoglossal.       Section of the glossopharyngeal           ncrves
does not cause any perceptible loss of motion or of colmnon sensa
tion, and this fact, together with its distribution to the fungiform
papill|e, leads the author to consider this nerve as the nerve of
tasting.     On the other hand, when the hypoglossnl nerves are
divided, the tongue is no longer sunsible to mechanical irritation.
and its motions are entirely aboli-hed.         Siii|nlluricous division of
the right and left glossopharyngrul n|-rvm is followed by the death
of the animal in a few days, and the same 1-<U+FB02>fcclen~ucs after division
of both ll)’p0glUs-nls. This result, which lakes plucc more speedily
in summer than in winter, the author is disposed to ascribe to a
disturbance of the mechanicnl process of respiration, in which, mi is
 well known, the muscles of the frog's mouth and tongue take a
 large share.
     To ascertain the changes which take place in the nerve-<U+FB01>bres
 after division of lhc trunks to which they belong. lhc operation was
 confined to the nerve of one side only, and the <U+FB01>bres of the unin
jured nerve of the other side scrved for comparison. These changes
 ensue more speedily, and go on more rapidly in summer than in
 winter, commencing usually in uhout <U+FB01>ve days. The pulp contained
 in the tubular nerve-fibres, originally transparent, becomes turbid,
 as if it underwent u sort of coagulation, and is soon converted into
 very <U+FB01>ne granules. partly aggregated into small clumps, and partly
 scnltered within the tubular inembrnnc.       The'e granules are at <U+FB01>rst
 abundant, and render the nerve-<U+FB01>bre remarkably opaque; but in pro
 cess oftimc they diminish in number, and, togi-lhcr with the inclosing
  membrane, at length disappear, so that nt l.1st the <U+FB01>nest rami<U+FB01>cations
  of the nerves which go to the papillm, or those going to the muscular
  <U+FB01>bres of the tongue (according to the nerve operated on), ltfu
  altogether lost to view, in consequence of the destruction und eva
  nescence of their elementary <U+FB01>bres.      The disorganization begins at
  the extremities of the <U+FB01>bres, and gradually extends upwards in the
  branches and trunk of the nerve.      The other tissues of the tongue
  remain unaltered.    When the cut ends of the nerve are allowed to
  reunite, the process of disorganization is arrested. and the nervous
  <U+FB01>bres are restored to their natural condition.        The author ascribes
  the disorganization and <U+FB01>nal absorption of the nerve-<U+FB01>bres to an
  arrestment of their nutrition caused by interruption of the nervous
  current, and considers his experiments as affording most unequivocal
  evidence of the dependence of the nutrition on the nervous power.

      1. “ Sequel to a Paper on the reduction      of the Thermometrical

                                     926
  Observations made at the Apartments of the Royal Society, with an
  Appendix." By James Glaisher, Esq., F.R.S.
      The principal object of this paper is the connexion of the results
  deduced in a former paper from the observations at the Royal So
  ciety’s Apartments, with the observations at the Royal Observatory
 at Greenwich, in order to determine mean numerical values, and to
  establish the laws of periodic variation from this lon'g series of obser
  vations; the two series of observations are here reduced to one and
  the same series.
     The observations at the Royal Society having been discontinued
 between the years 1781 and 1786, it was necessary to supply this
 link in the series, more particularly as these years were distinguished
 by very severe weather, and their omission would have a sensible
 effect on the results.   The de<U+FB01>cient observations have been supplied
 by a comparison of- the observations which were made at Somerset
 House, with the observations during the corresponding years made
 by Mr. Barker at Lyndon in Rutlandshire, from 1771 to 1799, cor
 rections being thus obtained for reducing the Lyndon observations
 to those at Somerset House.
     By a comparison of the temperature of the air at Somerset House
 and at the Royal Observatory for every month during the years
 1833 to 1843, corrections necessary to be applied for reducing the
 mean values at the'one place to those at the other, are deduced.
     Thus the results of the observations at Somerset House are re
 duced to those at the Royal Observatory, and a table is given showing
 the mean temperature at the latter place of each month in every year
 from 1771 to 184-9 inclusive.     By taking the means of the several
columns in this table, the mean temperature of each month is deduced
 from all the observations.     From these mean monthly temperatures
a table is constructed showing the excess of the mean monthly tem
perature at Greenwich for each year, above the temperature of the
 month deduced from all the years.
     Tables are next given showing the mean temperature in quarterly
periods for the year, and for successive groups of years at the Royal
 Observatory at Greenwich, from the year 1771 to 184-9; and the
excess of the quarterly and yearly mean temperatures in every year,
and for groups of years, above the means from all the years.           The
author remarks that the numbers in these tables do not at all con<U+FB01>rm
the idea that a hot summer is either preceded or followed by a cold
winter, or vice verszi; but on the contrary it would appear that any
hot or cold period has been mostly accompanied by weather of the
same character, and instances are cited in support of this conclusion.
    Tables are also given, based upon the readings of the self-registering
thermometers, exhibiting the extreme readings at Somerset House
and at the Royal Observatory.
    Incidentally the author goes into an inquiry respecting the relative
temperature of London and the country in its neighbourhood.          From
the observations made by Mr. Squire at Epping from 1821 to 184-8,
and also from thoseht Lyndon, he concludes that the general fact
of a higher winter temperature and lower summer temperature at

the Royal Society's Apartments is satisfactorily proved, and that the
same cause has hcrn in operation nt both seasons; this cuusc he
considers to be the vicinilv of the river Thames to the place of ob
servation.   \\rith the vicw of showing the extent to which this cause
operates, u table is given of the mean monthly temperature of the
water of the 'l'lmnn .-, and a comparison is |nnde bctwccn thc results
of observations mmlv on board the ' Dreatlnought' Hospital Ship, at
the height of $2 fu~l above the wnter, with simultaneous observa
tions at the lloyal ()b.-ervall\rv.   From this comparison it is con
cluded, that at all srn-ons' of the ycur the temperaturc at the ' Dread
nought' is above that at the Observatory during the night hours,
and that it is below during the mid-day hours only : at times of ex
treme tempcruture the \'ll\'oL\l of thc water upon the temperuturc of
the air is very great.
   The pupcr is accompanied by dingrains exhibiting to the eye, by
means of coordinates, the numerical rcsulta given in the tublca.

in the Crocodiliun llrptilcs."    By llichard Owen, l'Is<|., l-'.ll.S. &c.
    A<U+FB02>er citing the descriptions by Cuvier, Kuup, Bronn, and Dc
Blainville of the l-Iustachian tulu-s and the foraminn in the base of
the cranium of the rcccnt and extinct Crocodiles, the author gives an
account of the nerves. arteries, wins and nir-tubes that traverse these
different foraminu, and thus determines the truc position of the ca
rotid foramina and posterior nostrils in the 'I'elc0-muri and other
fossil Crocod|'l|'a, which hud been a matter of controversy amongst
the authors citcd.     In the course of tliesc researches the author dis
covercd a distinct system of liustachian canals superadded to the or
dinary lateral Eustachian tubes, which he describes as followin
   “From cach tympanic cavity two passages arc continued down
wards, one expands and unites with its fellow from the opposite side
to form u median canal which pa<~es from the hasisphenoid to the
suture between that and thc ha-iioccipital, whcre it terminates in the
median canal continued to the ori<U+FB01>ce described by M. Dc Blainville
as the posterior nostril.    The second passage h-ads from the <U+FB02>oor of
the tympanic cavity to a short canal which bends towards its fellow,
expands into a sinus and divides: onc branch descends and termi
nates in the small lateral fommen at the lower end of the suture be
tween thc basioccipital and the bnsisphenoid: the other branch
continues the course inwards and downwards until it meets its fellow
at the median line of the basioccipital, and it forms the posterior
primary division of the common median canal: this soon Joins the
anterior division, and the common canal termimites at the median
opening below.       Membranous tubes are continued from the three
osscoua ones, and converge to terminate <U+FB01>nally in the single Eusta
chian ori<U+FB01>cc on the soft palate behind the posterior nostril.          The
mucous membrane of the palate lines the various osscoos canals
above described, and is continued by them into the lining membrane
of the tympanum."
   With regard to the homologies of the above described air-passages,

                                   928
the author states that the lateral canals answer to the simple      Eusta
chian tubes of Lizards and Mammals, and that the median              canal,
with its dichotomous divisions, is a speciality peculiar to the    Croco
dilian reptiles.

    A  paper was read, entitled “On the application of Carbon de
 posited in Gas Retorts as the negative plate in the Nitric Acid
 Voltaic Battery."     By Christopher Leefe Dresser, Esq. Commu
 nicated by Thomas Bell, Esq., Sec. R.S. &c.
    In the retorts used for the destructive distillation of coal to obtain
 the carburetted hydrogen gas for the purposes of illumination, after
 a certain time a deposition of carbonaceous matter takes place, and
 which at length accumulates to such an extent as to <U+FB01>ll up a portion
 of the retort with solid substance, and to line the whole with a
 coating varying from the thickness of paper to several inches.
    After describing several forms in which this substance occurs,
 and which vary considerably both in density and hardness, the au
 thor states that he found one of great hardness, very little, if at all,
 porous, and of a stony fracture, to be best adapted for the negative
 conductor of his nitric acid battery.    The most convenient form for
 the negative conductor is the prismatic, 1% inch square on the side
 and about 7 inches long, which is immersed 4 inches in the acid,
 and used with round porous cells, the zinc cylinder being 3 inches
 in diameter and 4% inches high.
    The carbon is cut into thin plates or prisms by the machine of
 the marble cutter, at a cost of about lid. each. The prisms may
 be easily obtained 12, 14-, or 18 inches long.
    The only precautions necessary in using this form of carbon, are,
 after using the plates to immerse them for a few moments in boiling
 water, to take off the adhering acid, and then to dry them before a
 <U+FB01>re or in a stove.
    Having used the same plates and prisms for months, the author
 detected no deterioration of their conducting power, nor any de
 composition or alteration.    The connexion was made by soldering
 a strip of sheet copper to the zinc, and pressing this strongly against
 the carbon with a clamp.
    Comparing these plates with plates of platinum, the author could
 detect little difference in action, but the carbon appeared rather
 superior.    He states that his battery of 100 plates cost under £l,
 whilst one of platinum of equal power would have cost £60 or £70.
 From the cheapness and durability of this substance, he considers
 that it will make a valuable addition to our voltaic apparatus.

     The reading of Dr. Faraday-'s paper. entitled “ Experitnental Re
searches in Eh-ctricity. Twenty-third Series. §'.'9. ()n the Polar
or other condition of Diumagnetic Bodies :" was resumed and con
cluded.
     The author, whilst developing, on a former occasion, the pheno
 mena of diamagnetic action, said that all the results might be ac
 counted for by assuming that bismuth, phosphorus, &c., when in
 the magnetic tield. became polar as iron is polar, but with the poles
 in the contrary direction.        This view has since tlacn been adopted
 by Weber and      others, nnd supported by rertain experimental results.
 In the present paper these results and that view are brought under
 very close examination.       An apparatus was constructed by which it
 cylinder of any given metal could be muvetl to and fro through
 about two inches in the direction of its axis. In doing this it
 approached close up to, and then ri-lre(llod from the pole of nn
 electro-magnet, and also moved within a helix of covered wire which
  was <U+FB01>xed in relation to the magnet.          Now the action of such a piece
  of metal upon the helix is very different in theory, and also in reality,
  according as it is dependent upon a polarity, magnetic or dinmng
  netic, acquired by the metal, or upon induced currents existing in
  the mass; and the question was to ascertain by experiment whether
  the latter were the cause of the results obtained by \\'eber and
  others.    The various diamsgnetic metals gave the results looked for
  at the indicating galvanometer; but then these were almost insensiblc
  with bismuth, and were greatest with gold, silver, copper, and the
  better conductors, being indeed in proportion to the conducting
  power.     Such results were in favour of induced currents rather than
  of polarity.    Division was next resorted to as a distinguishing test
  of the polar or current action; thus a cylinder made up of lengths
  of wires acted as well as a solid cylinder, if the metal were one
  acquiring a polar state as iron; but such a division interfered with
  the existence of induced currents in the mass, and it was found that
  such wire cylinders of copper, &c. lost all power.             On the other
  hand,division of the cylinder into innumerable discs interfered greatly
   with polarity, but not at all with the induced currents, nor with the
   action of the diamagnetic metals. The places of maximum and
   minimum action of a cylinder of metal are very different according
   as that metal acts by a polar condition, or by currents induced in the
   mass: it is shown by experiments with the diamaguetic metals that
                                                                    3

                                   930
their places of maximum and minimum action aqpord with the effects
of induced currents.     Time has great effect over results produced
by currents induced in the mass, and none over those due to
polarity. By this test the effects of the diamagnetic metals are
found due to induced currents.
    The phenomena produced by the use of the present apparatus
are then shown to be in close and direct relation to the phenomena
of revulsion formerly described by the author: the parallel is closely
carried out and extended, and both sets of effects referred to one
and the same cause.
    The author endeavours to repeat an experiment described by
Reich, but without success; and he <U+FB01>nds that even when iron is
used no arrangement of magnets can produce any test of polarity
at all comparable to the use of an astatic needle or to suspension
 between the poles of a powerful magnet, and thinks that arrange
 ments which are thus less sensible with iron are not likely to be
more sensible with diamagnetic metals, even if they are polar.
    Finally, the author does not consider that the idea of diamagnetic
polarity has gained as yet any additional proof beyond the fact that
 diamagnetic bodies, such as bismuth and phosphorus, are repelled
 by one or both magnetic poles; he does not 'reject the idea of
polarity, but his opinion or judgment remains the same as at the
 time of its announcement in 1845.
  A  paper was also read, entitled “ Contributions to the Chemistry

   The de<U+FB01>nition given of chylous urine      is,   that

      On <U+FB01>ve differ;-m. mornings. by rising early or lute, and by col

     The conclusions from these experiments are,
     l. That so-called chylous urine, besidea fat, may contain albumen,
<U+FB01>brin, and healthy blood-globules.
    2. That, although the fat pauses off in the urine after food is taken,
yet the albumen, <U+FB01>brin and blood-globules are thrown out before
any food has been taken.                    During perfect rest the albumen ceases
to be excreted: and it does not appear in quantity in the urine even
after food is taken, provided there is perfect rest.                      A short time after
rising early the urine may coagulate spontaneously, although no fat
is present; and this may happen previous to food, when the urine is
free from fat.
    8. Though the urine made just before and a short time after
bleeding was as milky as it usually was at that hour of the day, yet
                                                                               30

                                        932
the serum of the blood was not milky: it did not contain a larger
quantity of fat than healthy blood does.
     The general results are,—
     1. That the most important changes in the urine in this disease
take place independently of the in<U+FB02>uence of digestion.
     2. That the urine in one respect only resembles chyle, and that
 is in containing, after digestion, a large quantity of fat in a very <U+FB01>ne
 state of division.      The supposition that the disease consists in an
 accumulation of fat in the blood, which is thrown out by the kidneys,
 carrying with it albumen, <U+FB01>brin, blood-globules and salts, is altogether
  disproved, both by actual analyses of the blood, and by the frequent
  occurrence of a jelly-like coagulum in the urine when no white fatty
  matter can be seen to be present.
      3. The disease consists in some change in the kidney by which
  <U+FB01>brin, albumen, blood-globules and salts are allowed to pass out,
  whenever the circulation through the kidney is increased; and if at
  the same time fat is present in the blood, it escapes also into the
  urine.     That this change of structure is not visible to the naked eye
  on post-mortem examination, Dr. Prout long since demonstrated;
  and in a case of this disease which was in St. George’s Hospital, and
   was examined at Plymouth, no disease of the kidney was observed.
   From the total absence of <U+FB01>brinous casts of the tubes from the urine,
   it is not improbable that by the microscope a di<U+FB02>erence may be de
   tected in the structure of the mammary processes, rather than in
   that of the cortical part of the kidneys.

      PROFESSOR OWEN,             Esq., Vice-President, in the Chair.
    Lieut.-Colonel Sykes's paper, entitled “ Discussion of Meteorolo
gical Observations in lndis," was resumed and concluded.
    The author adverts to a fonucr papcr “On the “cteorology of
the Deccan," published in the Hiilosophical Transactions for 1835,
and after referring to the conclusions at which he arrived in that
communication, states that, in the discussion of the meteorological
observations which form the subject of the prcscnt paper, and which
were made over a very extended area, at different heights, some
being hourly and running through several yeurs at the same station,
 It is very satisfactory to <U+FB01>nd that the fully establish the accuracy
of the former deductions.        He remarhs that, as some of the obser
vations now discussed were hourly records continucd through con
siderable periods of time, an opportunity has been afforded of in
vestigating abnormal conditions, which the former limited number
of diurnal observations did not permit; and gives the following
review of what appears to be normal and abnormal conditions.
    The annual and daily range of the barometer diminishes from the
sea-level up to the greatest height observed, 8640 feet at Dodabetta,
from a mean annual and mean daily range at .\Iadras of 0-735 and
0'12? respectively to 0'4-l0 and 0060 at Dodabetta;—the annual
range would appear to increase, about and beyond the northern
tropic, as the annual range at Calcutta (not by hourly observations)
is 0'9l1; but the diurnal range is somewhat less (0'll5) than at
Madras.      At no one of the places of observation, even taking the
maximum pressure ofone year with the minimum pressure ofanoti.-er
year, does there appear to have been a range of pressure equivalent

                                     934
to an inch of mercury; nevertheless in the Cyclones, or rotatory
storms, there occurs at times arange of pressure of nearly two inches
of mercury within forty-eight hours; but it is shown from a compa
rison of the simultaneous records on board ship, where these great
depressions were noted, with the records at the observatories on shore,
that the great depressions occurred within very limited areas.
    The author had formerly shown that the times or turning-points
of ebb and <U+FB02>ow (if the term be permitted) of the aerial ocean,
were occasionally retarded or accelerated, although the means <U+FB01>xed
 the turning-points within certain limit hours; but he was not then
aware that in the ebb or <U+FB02>ow of the four daily tides, they ever
 retrograded or halted in their onward or retiring course. The hourly
 observations now show that abnormal conditions are of no infre
 quent occurrence,—that     the tides at times <U+FB02>ow or ebb for four,
<U+FB01>ve, six or even seven and eight hours (one instance at Aden of
 nine hours),—-that frequent instances occur of retrograde move
 ments for short periods of time, as if the tide had met with a check
 and been turned back; and at the turning-points there are numerous
instances of the atmosphere being stationary for a couple of hours.
    The maximum pressure of the atmosphere is in the coldest months,
 December or January, but the minimum pressure is not in the
 hottest months, but in June or July.       The barometric readings,
 when protracted, shown gradual curve from December or January
 descending to June or July, and then ascending again to December
 or January, there being an occasional interruption in October or
 November.      As the curves at Madras, Bombay and Calcutta,
 correspond, and as Madras has no south-west monsoon, while
 Bombay has a south-west monsoon, andis destitute of the north-east
 monsoon of Madras, itwould appear that the general movements of
 the atmosphere are little in<U+FB02>uenced by any conditions of its lower
 strata; but the curve of pressure would seem to have some relation
 to the sun’s place in the ecliptic.
    The normal conditions of daily<U+FB02>temperature are, that it is coldest
 in India at sunrise, and hottest between the hours of 1 and 3 P.M.;
 but the tables show many aberrations from this rule.          The re
 gular increment or decrement of mean monthly heat from the maxi
 mum or minimum period is somewhat remarkable, as the curve is
 independent of the south-west monsoon at Bombay and the north
 east monsoon at Madras; and the passage of the sun twice over
 both places does not derange the curve.         The anomalies of the
 annual mean temperature of Madras, Bombay, Calcutta and Aden,
 not diminishing with the increase in the latitude of the respective
 places, are pointed out, and numerous instances are given of the
  very great power of the slanting rays of the sun beyond the tropic.
  As is the case with the barometric, so do the heat tables indicate
  that the annual and daily ranges of the thermometer diminish with
  the elevation of the place of observation above the sea-level, the
  elevated table-laud of the Deccan however being an exception to
  this rule.  At Mahabuleshwur, at 4500 feet, the temperature of the
  air was never below 45° with a maximum and minimum thermo

                                   935
meter; and at Dodsbells   the temperature of the air was never below
35°25, nevertheless at both places iceand hoar-frost were frequently
found on the ground at lunrlsv, resulting from the separate or con
joined effects of radistiou and cvnporntion.
    After stating the want of contidentQ- he has in observations of the
 wet-bulb thermometer as 1 means of determining the dew-point,
and that he greatly prefers Dnnicll's hygrometer for this purpose,
the author observes that he will not venture to say more with re
spect to normal conditions of nn)lstUr\' in lndin than that the air of
the sea coast has always a much greater fraction of saturation than
the lands of the interior; and that the elevated plateau of the Dec
can is periodically subject to very high degrees of dryness.
   Some very unexpected plicnoinena with reference to the distri
bution of rain are pointed out.           found both on the sea coasts
                                    ll.
                                    is
and on the table-lands ot'_lhe I)eccsn, that within very limited areas,
the differences in the fall of rain may be very great.         With nine
rain-gauges employed in the small lslund of Bombay in the months
of June and July, in the monsoon of l8.l-tl, the quantity collected
in the different gauges ranged in July from -H|' incln-s to l0'! inches,
and in June from l9 inches to 46 inches.            At Suttarah, in the
Deccan, with three rain-gauges within the distance of        a  mile, they
differed in their contents several inches from each other; and at
 Mshahuleshwur and Pannchgunny, nearly.on the same level, the
latter place being only eleven miles to the eastward of the former,
the annual fall of rain was '2.'rl- inches and 50 inches respectivelyl
The normal conditions are, that there     iss  much greater fall of rain
on the ses coasts than on the table-lands of the Deccan, but that the
Ghats intervening between the coasts and the table-lands have three
times the amount of the fall on the coasts, and from ten to <U+FB01>fteen
times the smonnt of the fall on the table-lands of the interior; the
paucity of the fall of rain st Cape Comorin and in the mouths of the
Indus would also appear to be normal conditions.                          -
   The tables must be referred to for the winds; the normal states are
those of the south-west and north-east monsoons, and the in<U+FB02>uence of
the latter is periodically felt at the height of 864-0 feet at Dodabetts,
which height would appear just at the upper surface of the stratum of
sir constituting the south-west monsoon but hourly observations for
                                           ;
lengthened periods are necessary at Dodabetta, to determine what
really are the periodical winds at that height. From the points other
than those between south and west, and north and east, there        is also
at the several stations a  certain amount of periodicity in the winds,
the winds that are common to ditférent stations having only        a  slant
more or less at the different stations; for instance, the south-west and
north-west winds of Bombay blowing in the summer months in Cal
cutta incline rather to be south and north winds, than south-west and
north-west winds; but the author observes that to be enabled to speak
with any precision upon this branch of the meteorology of India, and
indeed upon most other branches with      n  comprehensive and philoso
phical object, hourly observations are necessary,—simultaneously
taken with previously compared instruments by zealous observers;

                                   936
and having the records in a form common to all the observers, so
as to admit of rigid comparisons:—when        this is done, not only in
India but in Europe, meteorologists will be in a better condition
to generalize and propound normal conditions, than the state of our
knowledge at present would justify.
    The author states that he is indebted to that very able and zeal
ous meteorologist, Dr. Buist of Bombay, for the protracted curves
of pressure of the barometer appended to his paper.

       paper was also read, entitled
Ligamentum rotundum Uteri, with some observations upon the
change which takes place in the structure of the Uterus during
Utero-gestation."      By G. Rainey, Esq., M.R.C.S.E., Demonstrator
of Anatomy, St. Thomas’s Hospital. Communicated by Joseph H.
Green, Esq., F.R.S.
    The author <U+FB01>rst refers to the discovery of the difference which
exists between the two classes of muscles; the voluntary, or those
with striped <U+FB01>bres, and the involuntary, or those with unstriped
 <U+FB01>bres.    He then notices that the opinion which is entertained re
specting the round ligaments being composed of the unstriped variety
of muscular <U+FB01>bre is incorrect, these organs consisting chie<U+FB02>y of the
                                                      r
striped muscular <U+FB01>bre
    In support of the acguracy of this assertion, the author alleges
the following facts :—
    First, that the round ligament arises by three tendinous and <U+FB02>eshy
fasciculi; one, from the tendon of the internal oblique, near the
symphysis pubis, a middle one from the superior column of the
external abdominal ring, the third from the inferior column of the
same: from these points the <U+FB01>bres pass backwards and outwards,
and uniting form a rounded cord—the round ligament; after which,
traversing the broad ligament, they go to be inserted into the angle
of the uterus.
    The striped <U+FB01>bres are principally situated in its centre, and extend
 from its origin to within an inch or two of the fundus uteri; as they
approach which, the <U+FB01>bres gradually lose the striated character and
degenerate into fasciculi of granular <U+FB01>bres of the same kind as those
of the Dartos muscle; both these <U+FB01>bres presenting similar micro
scopic characters when acted upon by glycerine.
    The author then states that the round ligament does not pass
through the external ring to be lost in the labia and mous veneris;
and argues from the fact of their consisting mainly of striped <U+FB01>bres,
&c., that their use cannot be merely mechanical or subservient to
the process of utero-gestation, and therefore he concludes that its
function must be connected in some way with the process of copula
tion.
    He also adverts to the necessity of examining    the round ligament
 by the microscope in glycerine in preference to any other <U+FB02>uid; as
this substance renders the cellular tissue mixed with the <U+FB01>bres more
 transparent without diminishing the distiuctness of their character
 istic markings.     The author next states his views on the changes
                                                                  1

                                   937
which take place in the uterus during utero-gestation, and observes,
<U+FB01>rst, that there is no similarity b\'l\\'l'cln the <U+FB01>bres of thc round liga
ment and those of the nnimpri-gnan-d uterus, the latter being made
up of spindle-shaped nucleated <U+FB01>bres, contained in n matrix of
excecdin ly coherent granular matter; that these <U+FB01>bres are best
examined in portions which have been broken up by needles, in
preference to thin sections; and that this tiuue is well seen in the
larger mammals, as in the Cow, &c.               In the impregnated uterus
the <U+FB01>bres are found much increased in size and distinclnesn, but
devoid of nuclei and comparatively loosely connected; and the en
largement of these <U+FB01>bres is of itself su<U+FB02>icicnt to account for the
increased volume of the gravid uterus, without supposing that a sct
of muscular <U+FB01>bres are formed in it de n0r0.
   Hence he reasons that the unimprcgnatcd uterus consists probably
of little more than an assemblage of embryonic nucleated <U+FB01>bres, in
active until the ovum is received into            after which their develop
                                                 it.
ment commences and continues simultaneously and progressively
with that of the fmtus; so that when this last has arrived at state      a
requiring to be expelled, the utr rus has acquired its greatest expulsory
power. Lastly, the author observes, since the fully-developed <U+FB01>bres
cannot return to their former embryonic condition, they necessarily
become absorbed, and      anew set of embryonic <U+FB01>bres are formed for
the next ovnm, so that each fetus           is furnilhed with its own set of
expulsory   <U+FB01>bres;  which    view  is   in    perfect accordance with the
statements of Drs. Sharpey and Weber, with regard to the mem
brana decidua.

   Robert Stephenson, Esq., was admitted into the Society.
  The following papers were read        :
   1. “ On the Solution of Linear Differential Equations." By the
Rev. Brice Bronwin, M.A. Communicated by S. Ilunter Christie,
Esq., Sec. R.S.
  The methods employed in this paper to effect the solution or re
duction of linear differential equations consist of certain peculiar
transformations,and each particular class of equations        transformed
                                                               is
by  a   distinct  process peculiarly  its own.   The reduction     effected
                                                                    is
by  means     of certain general  theorems  in the calculus of operations.
   The terms which form the <U+FB01>rst member of the <U+FB01>rst class of equa
tions are functions of the symbols u and -r, the latter being     function
                                                                    a
of .2', and the former function ofz.-and D, .2 being the independent
                      a
variable.      This member of the equations contains two arbitrary
functions of w, and may therefore be of any order whatever.               It
likewise contains two simple factors, such for example as w and
w-1-nk, which factors are taken away by the transformation em

                  \
                                    938
ployed, and consequently the equation is reduced an order lower;
it is therefore integrated when of the second order. There is a se
ries of equations of this class, each essentially distinct from the rest,
yet all reducible by a similar process.
    These equations contain two arbitrary functions of .21. The num
ber therefore of particular practicable forms, which may be deduced
from each, is very great, a circumstance which renders our chance
of putting any proposed equation under one of these forms greater
in the same proportion.       On account of the very large number of
particular integrable equations which each general example furnishes,
selection would be very dif<U+FB01>cult, and all could not be given; the au
thor has therefore refrained from giving any.
    The second class of equations may be deduced from the <U+FB01>rst by
the interchange of the symbols D and .12, and changing 1' into 1"'.
The second general theorem can be deduced from the <U+FB01>rst in like
manner; and this class may be transformed and reduced by it in a
manner exactly similar to that by which the former class is reduced
by the <U+FB01>rst general theorem.       The solution therefore of the one se
ries may be deduced from that of the other by the interchange of
symbols only.       But in the second series the solutions obtained are
not always practicable, that is to say, they cannot always be inter
preted in <U+FB01>nite terms. They have therefore been reduced by the
introduction of new arbitrary functions of D, which render them
practicable; this process however necessarily diminishes their gene
ralit   .
    Vtlihen reduced to the ordinary form, these equations are somewhat
complicated; but by giving suitable forms to the arbitrary functions
of D which they contain, we may derive from them particular ex
amples of a form as simple as we please, and by introducing as many
arbitrary constants as possible, these examples may be made very
general of the class to which they belong.        In the integration of
linear equations, the coef<U+FB01>cients of which are integer functions of x,
they may prove very useful.
    Next, an equation, a particular case of which was treated by Mr.
Boole in the Cambridge Mathematical Journal, is here integrated
under its most general form. . Instead of integer functions of x, the
coe<U+FB02>icients may be any functions whatever, consistent with the con
dition of integrability, which is ascertained, and the formulae of re
duction assumed by Mr. Boole are shown to be universally true.
An additional function of the independent variable is also introduced
into the operating symbol-1:.     The equation therefore, independently
of the condition of integrability, contains two arbitrary functions of
2:, and consequently gives rise to a considerable number of particular
integrable examples.
    Here also the interchange of the symbols D and an is made, both
in the equation to be integrated and in the general symbolical
theorem by which it is reduced, and the same reduction to prac
ticable forms as before is likewise made.                              ,
    The next class of equations results from the generalization of an
 other equation integrated by Mr. Boole in the Cambridge Mathema

                                    U159
tical Journal.     llere the symbol D of .\lr. lloolc is replaced by the
general symbol      I. and morl'over llle <U+FB01>rst nn\fnIbl'l' of euch equation

    Hero likewise, by the interchange of the symbols l) and .r, another
series of equations with their solutions or reductions is obtained, und

 It is not n litllo remarkable that this inn-rclinuge of r)'n\lb0ls in all
these cases should be found lNi5siblr, it will lmwcvur be found poo
siblc in another case to be hereafter dewcribed.
    The last class of equations disco.‘used in this paper is transformed
 by means of a general tin-on-in of n very ilitil-nent kind from any of
 those which have been cmployed in reducing and intvgruting any of
 the previous Ohll'-\‘s-    By means of this triinsfonnuliou, the symbol
 I,  of which the <U+FB01>ral nu-mber of lllt‘.-\' equations is a function, is
 placed in n position to opeiute upon the whole of that member, n
 certain equation of condition among the cocliiciciits being previously
 admitted.      Hence by operating upon both members with the inverso
 of this symbol, the equation is once integrated, and, if it be of the
 second order only, completely solved.
    Here too the interchange of symbols may be made both in the
 equation and its solution, and the solution so changed will be the
 solution of the equation changed in like manner.          The general sym
 bolical  theorems,   which  here consist  of n  series of terms, may be de
 rived the one from the other in the same way, and by changing the
 signs of the alternate terms.                                     ,
    Reductions of the arbitrary functions of 1), similar to those before
 made, are made here also; and by particularizing some of the func
 tions so reduced for the sake of simpli<U+FB01>canon, several very singular
Jesultiug equations are obtained.         lf in these we assign to the re
 maining arbitrary functions, particular forms, and introduce as many
 arbitrary constants as we can, we may <U+FB01>nd particular examples
 which may be of great use in the integration of equations with
 coe<U+FB02>icients containing only integer functions of 1-.
    By a very obvious substitution an arbitrary function         of:  may be
 introduced into any of this kind of equations, and also another func
 tion of D, and the last often with great advantage.
    Q.  “ On the Oils produced by the action of Sulphuric Acid
                                                                         upon
 various classes of Vegetables."      By Jolm Stenhouse, Esq., F.R.S.

                                    940
    Nearly thirty years ago Diibereiner observed, when preparing for
mic acid by distilling a mixture of starch, peroxide of manganese and
sulphuric acid, that the liquid which passed into the receiver con
tained a small quantity of oil which rendered it turbid. To this oil
Dobereiner gave the fanciful name of “arti<U+FB01>cial oil of ants," though
the very limited quantity in which he was able to procure it pre
vented him from determining almost any of its properties.
    The author's attention was <U+FB01>rst directed to the subject in 184-O,
when he found that the oxide of manganese was unnecessary, and
that the oil could be readily prepared by operating on most vege
table substances with either sulphuric or muriatic acid.      The oil, on
analysis, was found to have the formula C1, H6 O6, and to contain
oxygen and hydrogen in the proportions to form water, while all
other oils and fats contain an excess of hydrogen.
    The late Dr. Fownes took up the subject in 184-5, and made the
interesting discovery, that when the oil which he called furfurol is
heated with ammonia, a crystalline amide is formed.           When this
amide is boiled with caustic lyes, it is changed into the crystallizable
base furfurine.     The paper then describes the best mode of pre
paring furfurol, and also the method of purifying it from an oil with
which crude furfurol is always accompanied, and to which the name
of meta-furfnrol has been given. Meta-furfurol is the cause of the
bright red coloration which impure furfurol instantly produces when
it is treated with muriatic or sulphuric acids in the cold. This por
tion of the paper concludes with some new observations on furfurol,
and an examination of some of the salts of furfurine.
    It has been pretty satisfactorily ascertained that the constituent
of plants which yields furfurol is the matiére incrustante of M. Payen,
viz. the matter with which the interiorrof the cells of plants is lined.
This is an amorphous granular substance which has been gradually
deposited from the sap in its passage through the tissue of the plant.
It is most abundant in hard woods, such as oak and teak, especially
in the oldest portions which lie nearest the heart of the tree.   As the
author of the paper was led to conjecture that the matiére incrustante
of the different great classes of vegetables would be found on exa
mination analogous but not identical, he thought it likely that the
oils derivable from them would also prove not identical with furfurol,
though probably very analogous to it in their nature and properties.
 The algae or sea-weeds, whose structure is very different from that
of ordinary herbaceous plants, were employed to test the truth of this
hypothesis.     They yielded an aromatic oil to which the name of
fucusol was given.       Though essentially different from furfurol, it
closely resembles that oil in its properties, being also isomeric with
it.   Fucusol forms a crystallizable amide with ammonia, called fucus
amide, which, when it is boiled with alkaline lyes, is also converted
into an organic base—fucusine, which is likewise isomeric with fur
furine.    Fucusine is a rather di<U+FB02>icultly crystallizable base; but some
of its salts, especially the nitrate, may be readily procured in large
crystals. In solubility and crystalline form they differ from those
of the corresponding base.

                                    9-H
  The paper contains an analysis of these salts.
  The mosses and lichens were also found to yield fucusol.             The
ferns, on the other hand, yield n peculiar oil, which differs both from
fucusol and furfurol, possessing properties intermediate between
them.
   The results of these experiments scam to indicate some curious
botanical relations, as it appears highly probable that the usaliére
ina-rustmsle is the same in all phanerognmous plants as they yield
 furfurol. On the other hand, lhc nmhtre iucruslante in the Algae,
 mosses and lichens, as it yields fucusol and not furfurol, though the
same in each of thesc t-lm‘|\‘'n, in evidently di<U+FB02>i-rent from that of pha
 nerogainous plants.    The matiérv inn-ustnnte of ferns appears how.
 ever to be dissimilar from either of the others, as it yields an analo
 gous but peculiar oil.

    I. “ On the Temperature of Steam and its correspondin Pressure."
 By John Curr,        Communicated by J. Scott ll usscll, €Lsq., F.l{.S.
    The author states that it is intended in this paper to propose a
 simple law to determine the pressure of steam corresponding to any
 given temperature, irrapectirely of aperimml, taking as the sole
 datum, that the vaporizing point of water under a given pressure is
 100 degrees, that number being taken to correspond with the scale
 of Celsius; also to construct   formulae in accordance therewith; and
 afterwards to compare their resultswith the actual experiments of the
 Academy of Sciences of Paris.       He further states that the rationale
 Of the subsequent formulae is expressed as follows.       Let it be con
 ceived thata given quantity of water is vaporized under the condition
 that the pressure thereon is increased in the same ratio that the vo
 lume is increased, or that at intervals of temperature l, 2,     &c. the
                                                                 fl,
 volume     isincreased the same or in equal proportions; the tempe
 rature of the volume will be increased exactly as the square of the
 temperature indicated by the thermometer, supposing the instrument
 to be  n  true measure of temperature, and as the square of the vo
 lume; and the same of the pressure.
     Steam being generated from an inde<U+FB01>nite quantity of water and
  con<U+FB01>ned within a limited space, as       the usual boiler, he considers
                                          in
  the foregoing case  is reversed; for the volume being constant, the
  action of the <U+FB01>re  is entirely exerted in producing increased elastic
  tension of the vapour; therefore the temperature of the steam at the
  interval  1 to 2 degrees is  increased inversely in the duplicate ratio
  of the ratio in the case <U+FB01>rst described; that       is,
                                                       the pressure    in
                                                                       is
  creased directly at the square of the square, or fourth power of the

 temperature; whence the following law.       The pressiire of steam
 generated in the usual steam-boiler is directly proportional to the
 fourth power of its temperature, when measured by a true scale.
    lfbeing assumed that 100 degrees is the temperature of steam
 when its pressure is in equilibrium with a column of 30 inches of
 mercury, or with the pressure of one atmosphere, then F being the
 pressure in atmospheres, at any temperature t,

    A  comparison is instituted between theoretic experiments of the
 Academy of Sciences and the results of this formula, from which it
 appears that the temperatures deduced from the formula are inva
 riably in defect, the greatest difference being 3'51, and the least
 2'02.
    2. “ On the means adopted in the British Colonial Magnetic Ob
servatories for determining the absolute values, secular change, and
annual variation of the Magnetic Force."       By Lieut,-Col. Edward
 Sabine,   R.A., For. Sec. R.S.
    The determination of the mean numerical values of the elements
of terrestrial magnetism in direction and force at different points of
the earth’s surface (the force being expressed in absolute measure,
intelligible consequently to future generations, however distant, and
conveying to them a knowledge of the present magnetic state of the
globe), and the determination of the nature and amount of the se
cular changes which the elements are at present undergoing, are, as
the author states, the <U+FB01>rst steps in that great inductive inquiry by
which it may be hoped that the inhabitants of the globe may at some
date, perhaps not very distant, obtain a complete knowledge of the
laws of the phenomena of terrestrial magnetism, and possibly gain
an insight into the physical causes of one of the most remarkable
forces by which our planet is affected.
    After stating the inadequacy of the instruments originally pro
posed by the Royal Society, to the attainment of all the objects for
which they had been designed, the author refers to the modi<U+FB01>cations
which had been introduced, in the instruments and methods of ob
servation for the determination of the absolute values, and the secu
lar changes of the horizontal component of the magnetic force. He
then gives the series of the results of the monthly observations at
Toronto from January 18415 to April 184-9 as relatively correct; and
from this series, regarding each monthly determination as entitled
to equal weight, and taking the arithmetical mean of all the values
as the most probable mean value, obtains 3'5304-3 as the mean value
of the horizontal force at Toronto,with a probable error of i'O0055;
and the probable error of i'O0+0 for each monthly determination.
    This is on the most simple hypothesis, in which neither secular
change nor annual variation is supposed to exist. The monthly re
sults however distinctly indicate a secular change, and by means of
them, on the hypothesis of a uniform secular change, the author

at Toronto, shows at llobarton             ilu-rea.-e of mu!/| inclination of

0"b'S) on the average of the months from April to August lneln.-lvo,
that is, in the southern winter; and an increase ofO"85 from October
 to February inclusive, that is, in the southern summer.
    The series of observations on the horizontal force shows an annual
variation of the same character as rP.-pcct-4 the seasons, and almost
 identical in amount with that at Toronto.              In the months from
October to Fehruary inclusive, or in the summer months at Ho
barton, the horizontal force         -0017 greater on the average than its
                                               is
 mean amount; and from April to August inclusive, or in the winter
 months at Hobarton,              on the average 'O0l3 less than its mean
                                     it   is
amount.
    The infcrcnccs drawn from these variations of the inclination and
 horizontal force, taken jointly as respects the total force at lloharton,
 are that this force       subject to an annual variation, being higher
                                is
than its mean amount from October to February, and lower than its
 mean amount from April to August.
  It   thus appears that in the months from October to February the
 magnetic needle more nearly approaches the vertical position, both
at Toronto in the northern hemisphere, and at Ilobarton in the
 southern ;   and that the total force         greatest at both stations from
                                                           is
 October to February, and least from April to August.

                                  944
   It is much to be desired, the author states, that so remarkable a
result should receive a full con<U+FB01>rmation, by the continuance of the
observations at Toronto and Hobarton for such an additional period
as may appear necessary for that purpose ; and that the general con
clusion, indicated by the observations at those stations, should be
veri<U+FB01>ed by similar investigations in other parts of the globe, especially
at the observatories which now exist. He conceives that these facts
indicate the existence of a general affection of the whole globe
having an annual period, and would appear to conduct us naturally
to the position of the earth in its orbit as the <U+FB01>rst step towards an
explanation of the periodic change. He further urges the importance
of following up without delay, and in the most effective manner, a
branch of the research which gives so fair a promise of establishing,
upon the basis of competent experiment, a conclusion of so much
theoretical moment.
   In conclusion the author adverts brie<U+FB02>y to considerations which
may give a particular importance to accurate numerical values of the
magnetic elements and their secular changes at Toronto, namely the
proximity of that station to one of the two points on the northern
hemisphere, which are the centres of the isodynamic loops, and are
the points of the greatest intensity of the force (on the surface of

    The following papers were read :
    l. “ On the Meteorology of England during the years 18-#7, I848
 and 1849."      By James (ilaisher, I-l.~q., I-'.lt.S.
    At the commencement of this paper the author states, that during
 the three years ending December 18-t9, meteorological observntions
 on a uniform system have been taken at nearly forty diili-rent
 places, situated between the latitudes of +9¢§° and 5.3", and between
 the longitudes of l§° east and 5}" west of Greenwich, at elevations
 varying from SO to 850 feet above the level of the sen.
    .\lany of the instruments which have been used he has himself
 selected, and prior to their use has determined their index-errors;
 he has also visited the greater number of the stations, and examined
 their localities, the position of the instruments, &c.
    The results from each station at the end of every quarter were
 forwarded to him; these he tested in every possible way; and those
 returns only which were found good enough to stand this examina
tion were published at the end of every quarter in the Quarterly
 Reports of the Registrar-General. The object of this paper, the
author states, to be not only the deduction of mean values from the
combination of all these published results, but also the deduction
from them of formulas, for the purpose of testing the accuracy of
the observations generally, and thus ascertaining the degree of con
<U+FB01>dence which may be placed in meteorological observations as now
carried on, and if possible the deduction of the errors of the read
ings of those instruments which had not been directly compared
with standards.
    He then gives the mean numerical values for the years 184-7, I84-8
and 184-9 in different parallels of latitude.        By comparison of these
he deduces general formulae, and then compares the results as found
from observation with those deduced from calculation, for every
place of observation in the year I84-9. Proceeding to the con
sideration of the difference between these two sets of numbers, he
<U+FB01>nds them to be mostly small; and hence concludes that the instru
                                                                 1

                                  946
ments are generally good, and that the observations have been care
fully made. In three instances, however, he <U+FB01>nds that
 of the barometer are almost one-tenth of an inch too <U+FB01>hehreadénlgs
                                                            ig , an     e
purposes to use the differences thus found as index-errors in the re
 duction of future observations made by these instruments, till their
 actual index-errors are determined by direct comparison with a
standard barometer.     In <U+FB01>ve instances the mean temperature of the
 year from observations differed almost one degree from that found
 by calculation.   At one of these places only have the instruments
 been compared with standards, and hence it is very probable that
 the difference found at this place may be due to local causes, of
 which this difference is a measure.
    He <U+FB01>nds also, that, notwithstanding the decrease of temperature
 with increase of latitude, the temperature of the dew-point, at all
places at about the same elevation, and distant from the in<U+FB02>uence of
the sea near the south coast, is almost alike, and hence that the
actual amount of water distributed in the atmosphere is the same :
this result was unexpected, and if con<U+FB01>rmed by subsequent observa
tions will be important.
    The author observes that the tables fully explain the peculiarity
of the weather in the counties of Cornwall and Devon, and near the
sea; the periodical ranges of temperature in these localitie
much less than in others, thou h the are found to enjoy on lbeiplg y t e
mean annual temperatures duegto theii latitudes.
    He remarks that the agreement between the observed and calcu
lated values being found to be so close, the mean meteorological
elements for the year 184-9 for any place in England may be com
puted, with a close approximation to the truth.
    To his paper are appended some sheets of curves
the simultaneous results from all the laces, and these ezylhibitilng
                                                              s ow t at
if any two or more places be taken in    ailsame latitudes, the curves
are nearly parallel; but, that if curves of places whose latitudes are
different be compared, the one   is found to be much bolder than the
other.    He considers that these sheets show in      very satisfactory
                                                      a
manner that ver considerable con<U+FB01>dence ma be placed in the re
                 ay
sults, and that    great advance has taken plaiie within the last few
years  in the care and attention to meteorological investigation.
  2.   “On the Temperature of Man within       the   Tropics."   By John
Davy, M.D., F.R.S., &c.
   In former paper which was published in the Philosophical Trans
       a
actions for 1845, the author gave the results of an inquiry on the
temperature of man in England, as measured under the tongue by
a thermometer made for the purpose, and using certain precautions
necessary to ensure accuracy.     An inquiry of the same kind and
with the same instrument he has conducted in the West Indies,
extending over  a  period of nearly three years and    half.
                                                          a  This     is
the subject of his present communication.    For the sake of compa
rison, he has followed in itnearly the same order as in the former.
The results are given in a tabular form, divided into sections, and
are followed by an appendix in which are recorded the daily obser

                                    947
vations ln monthly sequence, accompanied by observations on the
pulse. respiration and atmospheric temperature.
   The following are the principal conclusions which seem to be
warranted by the results:
   l. T hst the temperature of man within the tropics, on sn average,
is nesrl   l° higher than in s temperate climate, such as that of
England.
 r
   2. Thst it is constantly <U+FB02>uctuating, in health, within s range of
from 1° to 2° in the twenty-four hours.
   8. That the order of its <U+FB02>uctustion is not the same as in England,
being lowest in the early morning, alter the night's met, and not as
in            st night, before going to rest.
     England,
     4-.  st all exertion, whether of body or mind, except it be very
gentle, varies  the temperature; that gi-ntle exercise, as carringc ex
ercise or slow walking, has a depressin in<U+FB02>uence.
   5. That between the temperature olsthc surface of the body and
that of the deep-seated            there is little difference, not exceeding
                            parts,
on  the  average   2° or  8  , and  often less; with which there appears
to be  connected   increased    activity of the function of the skin and s
diminished action of the kidneys.
   6. That in s healthy state of the system, increase of temperature
from exercise or any other exciting cause, is of short duration,
rapidly subsiding on rest, and commonly followed by some depres
sion,   0. below its average degree.
        |'.
   7. That in sea-sickness, except when severe, the tendenc                to
                                                                           is
                                                                       if of
equalization of temperature; but when severe,1o increase                tem
perature, the msrkcd effect of deranged health, with few                 any
exceptions.
   8. That     sea voyage without sea-siclmcss, has also an equalizing
               a
in<U+FB02>uence on the temperature, not preventing however its increase
with increase of atmospheric temperature, and its lowering with di
minution of atmospheric temperature.
   The author expresses belief that the results obtained admit of
practical application in relation to hcalth and disease: on this part
of the subject, however, as unsuitable to the occasion, he docs not
dwell, reverting only to the circumstance pointed out in his former
paper and now con<U+FB01>rmcd, that variation, not equability of the tem
perature of man within certain limits, however produced,           is condu
cive to health, presenting therein an instance of happy adaptation
as regards his mode of life and sphere of action.
     The Society then adjourned to the 16th of May.

terrestrial Mollusca; and on the modi<U+FB01>cation of their calcifying
functions according to the local physical conditions         the

                                 948
species occur." By Lovell Reeve, Esq., F.L.S. Communicated by
Gideon Algernon Mantell, Esq., LL.D., F\R.S.
   The preparation of a monograph of the terrestrial genus Bulimus
having enabled the author to collect good authentic data concerning
the localities and circumstances of their habitation, this memoir
embodies his observations on their general distribution under types‘
and provinces of types, and on the relation between the substance
and colouring of the shell, and the differences of vegetation, tempe
rature, and other physical conditions under which it is formed.
   Bulimi being of less fugitive habits than most tribes of animals,
are distributed over the equatorial, tropical, and warm temperate
regions of the earth in assemblages of species limited in their range,
and, so far as regards the shell, of very distinct typical character.
The soft parts are much less variable, and being naturally sluggish,
with few means of transport, little migration occurs even where there
are no such natural boundaries as seas, deserts, or mountain chains.
Owing to their arboreal habits the author considers the Bulimi <U+FB01>tter
subjects for investigating the laws of geographical distribution than
the Helices which live more in the earth, and are less in<U+FB02>uenced by
the conditions with which they are surrounded.          The few Bulimi
of ground habits differ typically but little in countries very remote
from each other.      The localities of about <U+FB01>ve hundred species are
known, and the majority are registered with their circumstances of
habitation.    Their area of geographical distribution lies between 40°
south and 35° north in the New World, and between 42° south and
60° north in the Old World ; that   is,  between the southern extremity
of Chili and Texas in the former, and between Van Diemen’s Land
 and Sweden in the latter; and there      is no country within this area
 of which the Bulimi do not form part of the zoology. Regarding
 the shell with reference to its distinctions of form, composition, and
 system of colours, for the little variation in the living animal seems
 inadequate to the purpose, the Bulimi are distributed over this area
 in seven provinces of about forty typical assemblages of species, of
 which three-<U+FB01>fths inhabit the western hemisphere, and the remaining
two-<U+FB01>fths, with  a  wider range and greater local variety of character
 in conformity with the more varied arrangement of theland, inhabit
the eastern.
    The author distinguishes the typical provinces of distribution as
 Venezuelan, Brazilian, Chilian, Bolivian, Caucasian, Malayan and
 African, and passes through the consideration of each in detail.
 The conditions most favourable to the calcifying functions of the
Bulimi are an abundance of decaying vegetable matter, with an
 equable temperature of from 80° to 85°, in dark, close, humid woods,
among shady thickets or in ravines. Near the sea-level in thin cal
careous soil, and in sandy plains, where the vegetation   is  scanty and
parched, or in grassy savannahs, the shell        light
                                                    is  and often vividly
coloured.    In species which burrow in the earth, the shell   is mostly
colourless, and often of glassy tenuity.
    The highest condition of the genus         in intertropical America,
                                               is

                                    9+9
 and its northern limit ranges in both hcmisplicrcs with thc panllcls
 of equal temperature laid down by Humboldt. The calci<U+FB01>ed condi
 tion of the genus corresponds also with the curves northward in the
 isothermal lincs along the west coast of South America and those
 bending southward on the cast side; the Bulimi having a colder
 aspect in Chili from the cold precipitated by the great Antarctic
 current of cold water which <U+FB02>own nearly to the Gallapogos Islands,
 than those of the opposite Brazilian cont which are affcctcd by the
equatorial current.     In Patagonia the genus is suddenly arrested in
 a tropical condition by the rcccnt geological changes that have taken
 place in that now barren and |'lvl'l'll's\' country.  The memoir pro
 ceeds to show that in the distant i-lunds of the Paci<U+FB01>c the Rulimi
are curiously represented by oiln-r g--in-ra of tern-striul mollusks;
 whilst the species of islands approximating to continents, such as
 Trinidad, partake of the character of llloaL' of the main land.
    The European species belong to the Caucasian type. which has its
centre in Asia ;\linor, where the shell is mostly colourless, owing to
the dry, juiceleas, thorny character of the vegetation which affords
little nutriment, and the Bulimi live mostly under blocks of wood or
atone. This type reaches ncarly to the south-eastern corner of Asia,
where it is suddenly met at Birmah and in the Malacca peninsula
by the richly-coloured Malayan type, which is so abundantly and
beautifully represented in the islands of the Eastenn Archipelago.
The distribution of the genus among thcsc islands is remarkably
local. The Buliuii of North Africa partake of the character of those
of Europe, whilst those inhabiting south of the equator belong to a
totally different type.
    The precise localities and circumstances of habitation of the
various genera of Mollusca have as yet been too imperfectly noted
by travellers to aid much in determining the laws relating to geogra
phical distribution.    The present summary of collected facts may
prove suggestive of more careful observation, and, in the hands of
those who are acquainted Will!’ the geological and physical history of
the earth's surface, lead to important and interesting results.
    The paper is illustrated with a map constructed with tints of
shade, colours, and isothermal lines.
    2. “ On the in<U+FB02>uence of Physical Agents on the development of
the Tadpole of the Triton and the Frog."         By John Higginbottom,
Esq. Communicated by Thomas Bell, Esq, Sec. R.S.
    Mr. Higginbottom's experiments were made in different positions
and degrees of temperature, many of them in a rock cellar 80 feet
deep, where no solar light ever entered, and where the temperature
varied only in the course of the year from 4-8° to 55° Fahr.
    The results of numerous experiments showed that the development
of the tadpole was principally hastened or retarded by temperature
and the supply of food, and that, contrary to the opinion of many
other observers, the presence or absence of light did not appear to
exercise any perceptible in<U+FB02>uence upon their development.

    3.  “On the Algebraic Expression of the Number of Partitions of
which a given number is susceptible." By Sir John F. W. Herschel,
Bart., K.H., F.R.S. &c.                                              .
    The object of this paper is to exemplify and extend the mode of
analysis explained by the author in two former communications to
the Royal Society
                     “ On the Development of Exponential Functions,"
and    “ On Circulating Functions," to a case in the theory of numbers
in which they afford remarkable facilities, viz. that of the partitions
of which a given number is susceptible. The separation of the
symbols of operation from those of quantity, in the mode explained
in the former of those communications, allows of the expression of
the sums of certain series entering into this theory, under a form
susceptible of resolution (by a theorem here given) into two portions,
one of which, a rational function of the independent variable or
number to be subdivided, expresses approximately, as a rational frac
tion, the number of partitions; the other, a periodic or circulating
function, expresses the fraction, less than unity, by which the other
portion differs from an exact integer number, and which, applied
with its proper sign to that former portion, reduces it to an integer.
In the mode of procedure here followed all subdivision into cases
according to the numerical constitution of the number to be subdi
vided is avoided, and a uniform treatment is carried throughout.
                              May   30, 1850.
           The  EARL OF ROSSE,          President, in the Chair.
     Sir Benjamin C. Brodie, Bart., gave notice, that, at the next or
 dinary Meeting of the Society, he would propose the Right H0
 nourable   Lord Londesborough     for election into the Society.
    Mr Weld    communicated the following particulars respecting the
 original model of the safety-lamp which was presented to the Society
 at this meeting by Joseph Hodgson, Esq., F.R.S.
    In November 1815, Sir Humphry Davy read a paper before the
 Royal Society ' On the Fire damp of Coal Mines, and on Methods
 of lighting the Mines so as to prevent its Explosion.’ In this commu
 nication he described a safe light, “ which became extinguished when
 introduced into very explosive mixtures of <U+FB01>re-damp :" but as this
 fell short of the philosopher's wishes, he instituted e. fresh series of
 experiments, which resulted in his invention of the safety-lamp
 described in a paper read before the Society in Januar            1816.
 “ The invention," he say, “consists in covering or surrounding the
 <U+FB02>ame of a lamp or candle by a wire sieve;" and he adds, “when a
lighted lamp or candle screwed into a ring soldered to a cylinder of
 wire gauze, having no apertures except those of the gauze, is intro
 duced into the most explosive mixture of carburetted hydrogen and
 air, the cylinder becomes <U+FB01>lled with a bright <U+FB02>ame, and this <U+FB02>ame
 continues to burn as long as the mixture is explosive."      The model
 in the possession of the Royal Society answers in every respect to

                                     951
  this description, and to the representation of the lamp which accom
  panies the paper.     it was made by Sir                   own hands, and
 given by him to Dr. Lee, now Loni             Humphry's
                                                     of A Ianchester, whose
  father was Aasistant Secretary to the Bishop
                                            Roya Society at the time of
  Davy's Presidency.      The  excessive  simplicity  of the contrivance is
  most remarkable; but thls is one of the greatest advantages which
  attended the invention.      As the author remarks in the paperjust
 quoted,   “ All  that the  miner  requires to ensure security, are small
  wire cages to surround his candle or lamp, which may be made for
 a few pence, and of which various modi<U+FB01>cations may be adopted.
  And the application of this discovery will not only preserve him
 from the <U+FB01>re-damp, but enable him to apply it to use and to destroy
 it at the same time that it gives him n useful light."       A month after
 the invention Sir Humphry informed the Society that his cylinder
 lamps had been used in two of the most dangerous mines near New
 castle with perfect success.
     The following papers were then     rend :
     1. " On the Structure of the Dental Tissues of Rodentia."          By
 John    Tomes, Surgeon-Dentist      to Middlcsex      llospiuil.  Commu
 nicated by William Bowman, E~t|.. F.R.S.
     The author in this paper relates the results obtained from an ex
 tensive series of investigations on upwards of sixty of the more
          members of the order Rodentia. He <U+FB01>nds, that not only are
 typical
 t e teeth of animals of this order distinguished by strongly marked
 structural peculiarities (hitherto not                   from other mam
 malian teeth, but also that the teeth recoglniscd)
                                            of t e several larger groups
 are distinguished front each other by modi<U+FB01>cations in what may be
 called the rodential type of dental tissue. Mr. Tomes pointed out,
 in a paper published in Part 2 for I849 of the Phil. Trans., that in
the teeth of marsupial animals the dentinal tuhes arc continued into
the enamel. in the present communication he shows that the struc
 tural peculiarities which characterise and are con<U+FB01>ned to the teeth
of rodents are also mainly resident in the enamel. The earlier pages
of the paper arc devoted to a description of those structural condi
tions which are common to the teeth of the whole order.           Amongst
these, the author <U+FB01>nds that the extremities of the dentinal tubes,
which in the lower part of the tooth communicate with the pulp
cavity, become in the extruded portion sealed up by the development
of a layer of non-tubular tissue which is formed at and near the
apex of the pulp-cavity.      This closure of the dentinal tubes is not
however con<U+FB01>ned to the teeth of liodentia, but occurs in all teeth in
those parts exposed to wear. A similar condition is found to obtain
in the osseous tissue which forms the antlers of the Deer-tribe.         If
a portion of an antler previous to its losing its periosteinn be exa
mined, ordinary Haveisian s stems are found: but if an antler which
has been shed be examined), each of the larger Haversian systems
will be found to be lined by a layer of transparent tissue destitute
both of lacunae and canaliculi.       The author considers these condi
tions to indicate the existence of a general law, viz. that dense
tubular tissues, when about to be exposed to wear or about to be

                                   952
cast o<U+FB01>', are previously deprived of their connection with nutrient
<U+FB02>uids by the development of a layer of non-tubular tissue between
them and the vascular surface, with which they were originally con
nected and from which they derived their nutriment.
   In order to facilitate description, Mr. Tomes proposes to use
several terms as indicative of the arrangement and number of the
component tissues of teeth, which he de<U+FB01>nes and describes at length.
   A minute description of the dental tissues of upwards of <U+FB01>fty
species of rodents forms the larger part of the paper.         They are
taken in the order proposed by Mr. \Vaterhouse in his arrangement
of Rodentia published in Johnston's Physical Atlas. The author
has followed this arrangement, because he <U+FB01>nds that it accords with
the modi<U+FB01>cations of the dental tissues.      The incisors are described
as possessing the most strongly marked and constant characters.
   The anterior surface of the incisors of many rodents has a deep
brown colour, which has been attributed to the presence of a layer
of coloured cementum. The author states that the enamel <U+FB01>bres
can be traced through this coloured part to the surface of the tooth,
and hence regards the colour as a stain resident in the terminal ends
of the <U+FB01>bres, and derives the presence of cementum in this part of
the tooth.
   The great distinguishing structural feature in this order of qua
drupeds consists in a lamelliform arrangement of the <U+FB01>bres of the
enamel in the inner division of that tissue.
   The author then enters into an elaborate and detailed account of
the peculiarities of this structure, as exhibited in the Sciuridrz, in
the different members of the family Zlluridre in the Hystricine family,
the Leporidze, &c., and <U+FB01>nally considers the following conclusions
as established by these details :—
   “ That the teeth of some species of the order have speci<U+FB01>c struc
tural characters by which they can be distinguished from any other
known teeth. That in the teeth of all the Rodentia, excepting the
family Leporida, a portion of the enamel has a lamelliform arrange
ment of its <U+FB01>bres; that the enamel lamellae have a diffe-rent and
distinctive character in each of the larger groups, and that the variety
of structure is constant throughout the members of the same group ;"
—“ and that the variety in the structure of the dental tissues, with
a few isolated exceptions, justi<U+FB01>es and accords with the arrangement
of the members of the order into the several divisions proposed by
Mr. Waterhouse, and deduced by him from the relations of the
several parts of the skull."
   It is stated at the conclusion, that the author purposes in a future
communication entering into the development and the special adap
tation of the peculiarities of the dental tissues which it has been the
business of this paper to lay before the Society.

Westmoreland, with a continuation of the results of experiments
on the fall of Rain at various heights, up to 3166 feet above the
Sea-Level."     By J. F. Miller, Esq., F.R.A.S. Communicated by

    ln this communication are given the results of the observations of
the quantity of rain which has fallen during the year 184-9 at twenty
stations in the valleys, and six mountain stations, varying in altitude
above the sea from 500 feet to 3l(i6rfeet. There is also given s
table of the tempcrature at Scsthwaite in Borrowdalc during the
year I849.
    With reference to the mountain gauges, the author observes that,
on the whole, the results arc similar to those of the three preceding
years, but, as might be looked for in s dry year like the past, the
quantities of rain deposited at the various plstions are more nearly
equal than usual. Willi respect to the temperature, he observes that
the statement he made in his last communication, that “ the inhabit
ants of the Lake District Valh'vs enjoyed n milder and more equable
climate than the residents in the open country, and particularly in
the winter months," is con<U+FB01>rmed by the thermometrical results of
the present winter (I84-9%).

Greenwich." By        J.  F. Miller, Esq., I-'.R.A.S. Communicated by
Lieut.-Col.   Sabine,   R.A.,  For. Sec. R.S.
     After pointing  out   the importance of the hygrometer, both in is
scienti<U+FB01>c and a practical point of view, the author goes into the
   uestion of the advantages and disadvantages attending the use of
 f)aniell's hygrometer, and the relative merits of this instrument
 and the dry and wet-bulb thermometers.           Although satis<U+FB01>ed of the
 accuracy of Mr. Glaisher's Tables (founded on the Greenwich Ob
 servations), which show at once the relation of the temperature of
 evaporation to that of the dew-point, he was unwilling to abandon
 the use of Daniell's apparatus for that of the wet and dry-bulb ther
 mometers, slight as is the trouble of observing them, without personal
 experience of the correctness of the tables from which the dew-point
 was to be deduced.      lle therefore instituted a series of perfectly com
 parable observations by the two methods, and in this commumcation
 gives the results obtained from them during a period of twenty
 months.     From s comparison of the dew-points determined by the
 two methods, he concludes that the results show in s striking man
 ner the extreme accuracy of Mr. Glaisher's Tables, and afford ad
 ditional testimony to the value of the Greenwich Hygrometrical
 Observations, and the resulting formula on which those tables are
 founded.
     The author then refers to the subject of evaporation, and gives
 the results of his own observations at Whitehaven during six years,
 viz. from 184-3 to 184-8 inclusive.      From these he states that the
 mean annual amount of evaporation is 3()'Oll inches; and the mean
 quantity of rain for the same period being 45955 inches, the depth
 of the water precipitated exceeds that taken up by evaporation, on
 the coast in latitude 54-§°, by l5'24--t inches.

   1. “  On Dynamical Stability, and on the Oscillations of Floating
Bodies."     By the Rev. Henry Moseley, M.A., F.R.S., Correspond
ing  Member     of the Institute of France.
   The position into which a body willjirst roll by the action of any
force tending to incline it from its position of equilibrium is essen
tially different from that in which it will <U+FB01>nally rest. It is never
theless with reference to the latter only that the stability of <U+FB02>oating
bodies has hitherto been considered.        The object of this paper is to
discuss the question of stability with reference to the former; to
compare the stabilities of different vessels as regards rolling; and to
determine under what conditions of form and loading a vessel will,
when subject to given disturbing causes, roll the least. The sta
bility of a body understood in this sense the author calls its dyna

                                       956
stieol stability.   It is s second object of the psper to determine the
conditions of quicl and slow rolling.
   The remarksble disparities observed between different vessels in
rapect to rolling in the recent experimental squadrons give great
interest to this in uiry. it is moreover of much practical import
ance on account of the detriment to which ships are liable by reeson
of their wear snd tear from quick rolling, snd its interference with
their qualities ss ships of sear.
   When n ship heels over its centre of gravity is vertically displsced,
and also the centre of grsvity of the wster it displaces (technically
called its lmnneI\il0n); snd the author, in the <U+FB02>rst place, shows that
the difference of these vertical displacements. with reference to n
given inclinstion, multiplied by the wright of the ship, is n measure
of its dynnmical stability; so that if there be any number of ships,
and n common inclinstion (ssy 20’) be assumed for all, if this
difference be calculated in respect to each ship. and multiplied
by the weight of the ship, then that in respect to which this product
is the greatest would be dynamically the most stable ship, or would
heel the least, if all were subjected to the ssme force of the wind or
the wsves under the same circumstances. Ststed fully snd under its
most general form, this theorem is ss follows :—
   “ The work0 which must be done
                                              upon a ship to cause it to heel
through   n given angle,      is equal  to   that  necessary to raise it bodily
through   s  vertical height equal     to  the  difference    of the vertical dis
placements (when thus heeling) of its centre of gravity and that of
the water it displaces."
   The Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty having directed that
this theorem should be subjected to the test of experiment, experi
ments were undertaken for that object by Mr. Finchsm, Master Ship
wright of ller Majesty's Dockyard, Portsmouth, snd by Mr. Rswson,
the particulars of which are given in this paper.
    it was necessary for this veri<U+FB02>cation to do a given amount of work
upon a <U+FB02>oating body, causing it to incline through n given angle,
and then to ascertain whether, as the theorem states, this amount of
work was that necessary to raise the vessel bodily through n height
equal to the difference of the vertical displacements of its centre of
          and that of its immersion whilst in the not of so inclining.
gravity,
  or this purpose n. model vess<U+FB02> was <U+FB02>oated in a tsnk, and being
<U+FB01>tted with n msst and long yard, n weight was attached to one ex
tremity of this yard, snd the vessel allowed to heel over under the
in<U+FB02>uence of this weight.         The extreme inclination towhich it heeled
was then accuratyly ascertained by an ingenious method devised by
Mr. Rnwson, and the vertical descent of the de<U+FB02>ecting weight mea
sured.    The product of this descent by the de<U+FB02>ecting weight gave
the work done upon tl\e body to incline it from its position ofeqm'Ii
brium, and by the theorem this should beequal to the wei ht of the
vessel, multiplied by the difference of the two vertical displacements
spoken of above.       The forms of the vessels experimented on were
so selected that the positions of the centres of gravity of their im
                       '  llsssnred in lbs. raised one foot-.
                                                                                  ‘

                                   956
mersions could in every position be readily determined, and this
difference therefore ascertained.      Thus the veri<U+FB01>cation of the theo
rem became in every experiment practicable, and in all the accord
ance of the experiment with the theorem was remarkable.             Did not
the demonstration of it rest upon a mathematical basis, these experi
ments would indeed themselves be su<U+FB02>icient to establish it.
     In its general application to the conditions of the stability of a
vessel, the author places this theorem under an analytical form suffi
ciently simple to be applied in practice, and involving no other data.
than such as may be determined by methods familiar to naval archi
tects and generally assumed in their calculations.
     With reference to the conditions of quick and slow rolling, the
discussion of which is the object of the second part of the paper, it
is necessary in the <U+FB01>rst place to determine geometrically the position
of the axis about which the vessel     is, at any given period of its incli
nation, rolling. It   is   shown to be perpendicular to two lines, one of
which  isa    vertical line passing through the centre of gravity of the
plane of <U+FB02>otation in that position, and the other         a  horizontal line
passing through the centre of gravity of the vessel and parallel to
the plane in which any point of the body         is rolling. The position
of the axis of rolling being thus known, the determination of the
time of rolling is   comparatively easy.
     The author gives formulae for the times of rolling and pitehing,
 which, like those for the angles of rolling and pitehing, have been
 subjected to the test of experiments detailed in the paper, and have
 in like manner been con<U+FB01>rmed.
     The apparatus used for determining the times of oscillation of the
models was contrived by Mr. Fincham.            An arm was <U+FB01>xed in the
direction of the length of the <U+FB02>oating body so as to project from its
extremity, and to the end of this arm a pencil was <U+FB01>xed vertically.
 The vessel being then prevented from displacing itself laterally whilst
in the act of oscillating on an axis passing through its centre of
 gravity and of which the extremities were received between vertical
guides, as the vessel oscillated  a   line was traced by the pencil upon
a   piece of paper adjusted upon   a    board curved of   a  suitable form,
 which was carried along by clock work with           a uniform motion in
 the direction of the length of the vessel upon a carriage, that tra
 versed a    railroad resting upon the edges of the tank.         A zigzag
 line was thus described on the paper, each turn in which corre
sponded to an oscillation, and the distance between two successive
 turns determined—from the known rate of the motion of the carriage
 —the time in which the oscillation was made.
     The formulae given for the amplitudes and the times of oscillation
 a<U+FB02>brd the means of determining these, from the limes of ships, before
they are constructed; and the author suggests that a vessel being
<U+FB01>xed upon whose properties in respect to rolling are known,      it   would
 be expedient to compare with them those of all others which are
 proposed to be constructed;     it   being  a possible thing (by the aid
 of such formulae) to determine whether these will roll under the like
  circumstances through greater angles, or quicker than the standard

                                    957
vessel, and to alter their lines so as to satisfy the conditions    of sta
bility and slow rolling to any required extent.

House, near Nottingham, during the last nine years." By Edward
Lowe, Esq., F.R.A.S. Communicated by John Lee, Esq., LL.D.,
F.R.S. &c.
   The thunder-storms referred to in this communication are recorded
in a tabular form, arranged according to their dates.       In this table
are given the date; the hour of the commencement of the storm;
the mean height of the barometer to tenths of an inch; whether it
is rising, stationary, or falling ; the direction of the wind before the
storm, during its continuance, and after its cessation; the maximum
temperature on the day of the storm and on the day after; the mi
nimum temperature on the night before and on the night after; and
general remarks on the storms.        This table is followed by remarks
on particular storms recorded in it. In conclusion the author gives
the results of his observations with reference to the number of storms
in each year; the number in each month. with the hours at which
they mostly occur in particular months; the number that have oc
curred with a rising, stationary, or falling barometer; the number
in respect to the direction of the wind and of the current in which
the storms moved; the number of storms that have occurred at the
various heights of the maximum, and also of the minimum thermo
meter; the number in which the peculiar breeze that suddenly
springs up on the commencement of thunder-storms has been well
marked; the change in the direction of some of these storms, and
indications of rotatory motion; and <U+FB01>nally, the different atmospheric
phenomena which have accompanied these storms.
     S. “ On a Dorsal dermal Spine of the H laeosnurus recently
 discovered in the Strata of Tilgate Forest."        lly  Gideon Algernon
 Mantell, Esq., LL.D., F.R.S. &c.
     ln the <U+FB01>rst discovered specimen of the remains of the fossil rep
 tile named Hyheosaurus by the author, there were associated with
 the recognizable parts of the skeleton    u   series of thin, long angular
 processes, six or seven of which extended in a line nearly parallel
 with the upper part of the vertebral column: these bones are from
 four to seventeen inches in length. There are also several imbedded
 in various parts of the same block of stone; and in another specimen
 of this reptile, consisting of considerable portion of the distal part
                                a
 of the vertebral column, similar angular bones are associated with
 the spine.    The truc nature of these processes, from their great size
 and osseous character, was deemed very problemstical       :   Dr. Mantell,
 in his original memoir in 1832, regarded them as dorsal dermal spines
 that had formed    a   serrated crest which extended along the back of
 the llylaeosaurus, in the same manner as the horny dermal fringe in
 many species of Iguana, Cyclura, &c.           Professor Owen, in his re
 ports   on British fossil reptiles, expressed his dissent from this opinion,
 and considered    it   more probable that the bones in question were
  abdominal ribs.

                                    958
 .  In a memoir on the Iguanodon and Hylseosaurus (Phil. Trans.
 1849), Dr. Mantell states that he had been able to obtain slices of
 one of these spines for microscopical examination, and that their in
 ternal structure was identical with that of the acknowledged dermal
scutes of the same reptile.      Still the true form of the articulating
surface of the base of these spines was unknown, every specimen
being imperfect in this respect. At length, after the lapse of eighteen
years, Dr. Mantell obtained, through the liberality of Mr. Peter Fuller
of Lewes, from the very quarry in which the original specimen of
Hylaeosaurus was found, the spine <U+FB01>gured and described in this
communication, in which the base is su<U+FB02>iciently entire to show that
the mode of implantation in the skin was identical with that of the
true dermal scutes; thus con<U+FB01>rming the author's original interpreta
tion of these remarkable appendages having constituted a serrated
crest along the back of the Hylaeosaurus.        The specimens, and the
microscopical   sections, were  exhibited  to the Society.
    4‘. “On the Variations   of the Sulphates and Phosphates in the
Urine in Disease."     By Henry Bence Jones, M.D., F.R.S.
    The object of the paper is to show whether the sulphates in the
urine are increased or diminished in any class of diseases. The
corresponding variations of the phosphates were determined.         The
particular conclusions may be thus stated :—
    1. In three cases of acute chorea the most remarkable increase
was observed in the amount of sulphates in the urine.       In the same
cases the quantity of urea was very much increased.        The quantity
of urine made in twenty-four hours was not excessively diminished,
and the total amount of earthy and alkaline phosphates was below
the average amount, sometimes remarkably less than in health.
   2. In delirium tremens and in other delirium a remarkable in
crease in the amount of sulphates in the urine was frequently ob
served, and the total amount of phosphates was in the same cases
occasionally remarkably diminished; and the resemblance to the
state of chorea was still closer, inasmuch as occasionally a very great
excess of urea was found in these cases also.
   3. In acute in<U+FB02>ammatory affections of the nervous structures, du
ring the most febrile symptoms, an increase was observed in the
amount of sulphates in the urine; and the total amount of earthy and
alkaline phosphates in these diseases was increased in the same pro
portion as the sulphates were increased.                              '
   4. In some slight and chronic diseases of the nervous structures
no increase in the amount of sulphates in the urine was observed,
excepting when sulphate of magnesia had been taken.
   5. In acute diseases, in which neither the nervous nor the muscular
structures were chie<U+FB02>y a<U+FB01>ected, no increase in the sulphates or
phosphates was observed, except after sulphate of magnesia.
   6. In chronic diseases, in which neither the nervous nor the mus
cular structures were chie<U+FB02>y affected, no decided increase in the
sulphates or phosphates (n the urine was observed, except after
sulphate of magnesia. One case of exostosis may be regarded as a
doubtful exception to this statement.

                                    959
    The genera conclusions are
    That in acute chorea, in which the muscles    are in excessive action,
the sulphates and urca in the urine arc greatly increased.
    That in delirium tremens the same state of urine is frequently
met with when the hosphatea are not at all increased.
    That in acute inll)ammalion of the nervous structures sulphates
and phosphates am both increased in the urine.                  .
    That in chronic diseases of the brain, and in other acute and chro
nlc in<U+FB02>ammaticns, no increase of the sulphates is observed except
after sulphate of magnesia.
    The result is that muscular action increases the sulphates in lhc
urine without increasing the phosphates; and that in<U+FB02>ammation of
the brain increases the sulphates as well as phosphates in the urine.
    5. “ Second Appendix to a paper on the Variations of the Acidity
of the Urine in Health."      By Henry Hence Jones, M.D., F.R.S.
    In a previous paper and appendix, the effect of different diets, of
sulphuric and tartaric acids, of caustic potash and tartrate of potash
on thd acidity cl' the urine was traced.       In this appendix tartrate
and carbonate of ammonia are the substances whose in<U+FB02>uence is do»
terrnined, the object being to examine the comparative effect of <U+FB01>xed
and volatile alkalies.
    The <U+FB01>rst day two drachma of tartrate of ammonia were taken in
distilled water, the second day 288 grains were taken, and the third
day 177 grains.
    Comparative experiments were made when no tartrate of ammonia
was taken; the result was that tartrate of ammonia caused no per
ceptible diminution of the acidity of the urine.       The differencc be
tween tartrate of ammonia and tartrate of potash may be shortly
stated thus: two drachms of tartrate of potash made the urine al
 kaline in thirty-<U+FB01>ve minutes after it was taken, whilst three drachms
of tartrate of ammonia produced no perceptible effect on the acidity
of the urine.
    The scsquicarbonate of pharmacy was then tried. The <U+FB01>rst day
 18 grains were taken dissolved in distilled water, the second day 40
grains, the third day 80       rains.   Comparative experiments were
made without the volatile afkali, and it was found that in these doses
carbonate of ammonia did not diminish the acidity of the urine; on
the contrary, the acidity was higher than usual, and it was increased
for twenty-four hours after the volatile alkali was taken.
    Further experiments were made with 80 grains of carbonate of
ammonia on two different days: no diminution of the acidity of the
urine was produced on either day. The <U+FB01>rst day the quantity of
urine was much increased, and thus probably an increase in the
acidity of the urine was not evident.     The second day on which the
                                         I
carbonate of ammonia was taken the increase in the acidity of the
urine was perceptible.
   Thus the effect of volatile alkali on the acidity of the urine is to
tally distinet from the effect of <U+FB01>xed alkali} and the author considers,
that by determining the variations of the nitrates in the urine, the
cause of this di<U+FB01>erence will be discovered.

    6. “ On the Temperature of Steam, and its corresponding Pres
 sure."    By John Curr, Esq. Communicated by J. Scott Russell,
 Esq., F.R.S.
    In this paper, which is a continuation of a former paper bearing
the same title, the author states that the law given in that paper, in
reference' to steam when superincumbent on the water in the boiler,
 may be rendered applicable to the determination of its pressure
when insulated therefrom, as in the case of the expansive engine,
 of which the cylinder being in part <U+FB01>lled with steam of the same
 temperature as that in the boiler, the communication is suddenly
 cut oil', and the stroke is completed by the pressure on the piston
 of the steam whilst expanding within the cylinder.       He considers
 that the power of expansive engines has been greatly overrated, in
 stancing those of the Great Britain, which were of the estimated
 power of 1200 horses, but which he states he can prove did not
 exceed in actual power that of 300 horses. This he attributes to
 the inapplicability of Mariotte’s law without a particular limitation.
 Having premised that “it is assumed that, by nature’s law in the
 generation of steam, of the temperature 100° and of a pressure of
 15 lbs. on a square inch, the density of the Matter of Heat, is to
 that of atmospheric air of the same temperature and pressure ex
 actly as 1 to 2," he then gives general laws, by means of which, he
 considers, the pressure of steam when cut off from its generating
 source may be correctly estimated.
    “ In conclusion," the author states, “ it may be said that, this and
the former paper, both professing to give laws relative to the pres
sure and temperature of steam, independently of e.z'_periment, the
 theories proposed must in general be accepted as absolute truths, in
 case of being veri<U+FB01>ed by experiment, or taken as vain attempts to
subvert laws already <U+FB01>rmly or su<U+FB02>iciently established."
    7. “ An Experimental Inquiry into the strength of Wrought Iron
Plates and riveted Joints as applied to Ship-building."        By Wil
liam Fairbairn, Esq., F.R.S.
    The object of the author was to determine by direct experiment
the strength and value of rolled iron plates and bars of different
forms in reference to their application to ship-building, and the con
struction of other vessels exposed to severe strain.
    The experiments described in this paper were conducted with
 great care, and the irons used were purposely selected from those
districts where the largest quantities were manufactured.            The
relative strengths of each kind, as also the deductions, are given in
the order-in which the experiments were made.
    The author found the tensile strength. of plates, when torn asunder
in the direction of the <U+FB01>bre, and when torn asunder across the <U+FB01>bre,
as nearly as possible the same.     This fact is derived from twenty
distinct experiments, and he attributes this equality to the improved
method of manufacture which of late years has been introduced.
This new system is described as rendering the plate more uniform
by crossing the layers in the process of 'piling,’ thus forming an
alternate series of laminae, whose <U+FB01>bres cross each other in the body
of the plate.

                                        96l
    Having ascertained the comparative value of the di<U+FB02>brent manu
factures of plate-iron, the author. by another class of oXpt.-riInoIIL!,
investigated the different methods in use ofjoiuing the plates together
by rivets. This appears to be an important suction of the inquiry, as
the relative strength of each description ofjoint within reach of the
experiments is clearly ascertained, sud their relative values ofstrcngth
determined in rell-rcncc to each other, and to the plates thcmwlves.
These were found after a careful investigation to be nearly as the
numbers I00, 70 and 56; that is to say, the plate being taken at l()(),
the double-riveted joint wu TO, and the single-riveted joint 56.
    The resisting powenu of plates, and the ditii-rent kind ofjoints by
which they are united, having been                    the paper gocs on to in
vestigate  the  value  of                   proved,
                            the di<U+FB02>i-nent inda of timber uhcn applied to
a similar purpose, and by s careful comparison of the results, it is
ascertained that thc tensile powers of each, compared with iron,
amber representing unity. arc in the following ratio, viz.
                          Ashas               l : 2'91
                          Tcak    as....      l:3'33
                          I-'ir (good) as     l :  4'16
                          Beech as . .        l :  4'84
                          Oakas               l:5'O()
    From the above it is inferred by the author, that iron being <U+FB01>ve
times stronger than oak, a vessel built of that material is neither so
strong, nor yet so secure, as the iron ship.
    The next subject of inquiry is the transverse strength of angle
iron, '1'-iron and olhcr sectional forms which enter into the con
struction of the beams, frames and ribs of ships.             These combina
tions were likewise put to the test of experiment. In this part of the
inquiry it was soon ascertained that bars of angle-iron used for that
purpose are not of the best form, but exhibited great weakness when
compared with wrought-iron beams of the            I   form, having <U+FB02>anges on
both sides. From these results the author recomnumds that a com
bination of angle-iron should be used lor these objects, as explained
in the paper, and shown in the diagrams which accompany it.
    In order to render the inquiry of practical value, experiments
were made on the resisting powers of plates, by forcing a blunt in
strument with hemispherical cud of three inches diameter through
the plates.    These experiments were again repeated under similar
circumstances upon timber, and a comparison is drawn from there
data as to the resisting power of each.           These experiments are in
teresting  so far  as they    establish  the superior strength of iron when
exposed    to  severe  strain,   as frequently occurs in vessels taking the
ground upon      boulder-stones,     or any uneven surface.
    These results being obtained, the author closes the paper with a
series of experiments made at Woolwich Dockyard on the strengths
and elongation of iron-bars.         In this department some curious results
are obtained, such as the fact that an iron bar, when elongated to a
considerable diminution of its sectional area, was not reduced but
 rather increased in strength ; and after repealed experiments, it was
 found that wrought-iron bars, when elongated or wire-drawn, were
                                                                    2

                                   962
considerably improved in their powers      of resista<U+FB02>e to  a  transvers
strain.
    8. “ On extraordinary Oscillations of the Sea; with an account of
some Observations in Mount's Bay."         By Richard Edmonds, Jun.
Communicated by Sir Charles Lemon, Bart., F.R.S.
    In this communication the author notices many remarkable oscil
lations of the sea which had been observed nearly a century ago in
Mou11t’s Bay and Plymouth Sound, and also elsewhere.             He then
particularly  describes  some  which   have  occurred  more   recently at
the former places. Of these the following are the principal :—
    On the morning of the 31st of May, 1811, the sea was observed
to rise and fall rapidly from 4- to 8 feet.
    On the 5th of July, 1846, the author witnessed oscillations of the
 sea in Mount’s Bay.
    In the evening of the 30th of October, 1843, oscillations of the
 sea were observed in Mount’s Bay and at Plymouth.
    On the morning of the 5th of July, 1846, immediately after a ter
 ri<U+FB01>c thunder-storm, oscillations of the sea were observed at Mara
 zion.   The author remarks that the great storm which passed over
 England on this day raged in the Atlantic during the night of the
4th of July.
    On the morning of the 1st of August, 1846, the sea at Penzance
pier was observed suddenly to rise between 1 and 2 feet, and as
 suddenly to rush back.    It is remarked that London and its vicinity
 were visited on this day by a most destructive hail- and thunder
 storm.
    On the 28rd of May, 1847, there were extraordinary oscillations
 of the sea, and a slight motion of the ground was felt on the cliff
                                                  '
between Newlyn and Mousehole.
    After referring to the theories which have been advanced in ex
planation of these phenomena, the author observes, in conclusion,
that, from what he has stated on the subject, and from the fact of
earthquakes, as well as extraordinary oscillations of the sea, having
so frequently occurred during thunder-storms, he sees no di<U+FB02>iculty
in the supposition, that all the oscillations to which he has referred
may have resulted from submarine shocks of the earth, occasioned
by electrical discharges between the earth and the atmosphere, or
between oppositely electri<U+FB01>ed portions of the earth.
                            June 20, 1850.
         THE EARL OF ROSSE,             President, in the Chair.
    The following papers were read :—
    1. “ Observations on the Nebulae."      By the Earl of Rose, Pres.
R.S., &c. &c.
    The object of this paper is to lay before the Royal Society an ac
count of the progress which has been made, up to the present time,

                                     968
 in the re-examination of Sir John Herschel's Cstalogue of Nebula
 published in the Phil. Trans. for 1883.
     Before describing any of the interesting objects the peculiar fes
 turcs of which the extraordinary powers of the telescope emplo ed
 for their examination has brought to our knowledge. the author
 enters upon some delsils concerning the instrument itself.           This
 telescope, which for n rture and the consequent power it possesses
 for the examination ofxfaint details must for s considerable time, st
 least, remain unrivalled, has s clear aperture of 6 feet, with s focal
 length of 53 feet.    lt has hitherto been used as s Newtonian, but
 by the easy spplication of s little additional sppsratus it may be
 conveniently worked ss s llerschelisn; and the sulhor thinks it not
 improbable thst, in the further examination of the objects of most
 promise with the full light of the speculum uadiminislcodby a second
re<U+FB01>aioss, some additional features of interest will come out.
     The tube repose st its lower end upon a very massive universal
joint of cast iron, resting upon s pier of stonework buried in the
 ground, and it is counterpoised so that it can he moved in polar
 distance with grest facility. The extreme range of the tube in right
ascension at the equator is one hour, but greater as the polar distance
 diminishes.     By s little subsidiary spparstus the movement of the
 telescope can be rendered almost exactly equatorial ; but up to the
 pruent time this apparatus has not been used, es, without          it, the
 movement was found to be su<U+FB02>iciently equatorial for such measure
 ments ss have been required.         The whole mounting was planned
 especially with  s view of carrying on    sregular system of sweeping;
 hut as yet the discovery of new nebulae has formed no part of the
 systematic work of the observatory, the known objects which re
 quire examination being so numerous that hitherto the observers
 have been fully occupied with them.
    A   clock movement was part of the original design, but as yet the
 telescope   isnot provided with one, and the wsnt of     it has not been
 ve     much felt.
    various micrometers have been tried, but, upon the whole, the
 common wire micrometer with thick lines has been found to succeed
 the best; for the faint details of the nebulae are extinguished    by any
 micrometrical contrivnnce which either diminishes the light of the
  telescope or renders the <U+FB01>eld less dark; and thick lines have been
  found to be visible without illumination in the darkest night.
     The telescope has two specula, one about three and        u half, and
  the  other rather more than four tons weight.    Each  isprovided with
a    system of levers to afford   it   an equnble support.      Upon this
  systemit   was placed before  it  was ground, and has rested upon       it
  ever since.    The systems of levers with the mode of applying them
  in the support of the speculum are described in the paper, and also
  the precautions taken to guard against strain and consequent <U+FB02>exure
  of the metal. Notwithstanding these precautions, undoubted evi
  dences of <U+FB02>exure in the speculum have occasionally shown them
  selves.It    has not, however, been found that tlexure, even to the
  extent of materially dis<U+FB01>guring the image of    a  large star, interferes
                                                               2!

                                   964
much with the action of the speculum on the faint details of nebulae,
although it greatly lessens its power in bringing out minute points
of light, and in showing resolvability where, under favourable cir
cumstances, resolution had been previously effected.
    It is stated that, in the spring of 184-8, the heavier of the two
specula, for nearly three months, performed admirably, very rarely
exhibiting the slightest indication of <U+FB01>exure. It then remained in
active for some time before and after the solstice, and when obser
vations with it were again commenced, it was found to be in a state
of strain. On cautiously raising it a little by screws, for the pur
pose of readjusting the levers, it was found that the unequal strain
of the screws had produced permanent <U+FB02>exure, so that the speculum
did not again perform well until after it had been reground.           Re
cently   an  alteration has been made  in  the  mode   of  supporting  the
lighter   of  the  two  specula, which  now   rolls freely  on eighty-one
brass balls that support it nearly equably.      After referring to other
causes of unequal action, among which the varying state of the
atmosphere is one of the most serious, the author remarks that the
Society will not be surprised should it be in his power at a future
time to communicate some additional particulars, even as to the
nebulae which have been most frequently observed.
    The very beautiful sketehes which illustrate the paper, are, it is
remarked, on a very small scale, but are suf<U+FB01>cient to convey a pretty
accurate idea of the peculiarities of structure which have gradually
become known.         In many of the nebulae they are very remarkable,
and seem even to indicate the presence of dynamical laws we may
perhaps fancy to be almost within our grasp.
     On examining these sketehes, it will at once be remarked, as stated
by the author, that the spiral arrangement so strongly developed in
H. 1622, 51 Messier, is traceable more or less distinctly in several of
the sketehes. More frequently indeed there is a nearer approach
to a kind of irregular interrupted annular disposition of the luminous
material, than to the regularity so striking in 51 Messier; but it can
scarcely be doubted that these nebulae are systems of a very similar
nature, seen more or less perfectly, and variously placed with refer
ence to the line of sight.     The author adverts to the description of
this nebula by Messier, Sir William Herschel and Sir John Herschel,
 and remarks, that taking the <U+FB01>gure given by Sir John, and placing
 it as it would be seen with a Newtonian telescope, we shall at once
 recognise the bright convolutions of the spiral which were seen by
 him as a divided ring: thus with each increase of optical power the
structure has become more complicated, and more unlike anything
 which we could picture to ourselves as the result of any form of
 dynamical law of which we <U+FB01>nd a counterpart in our system. After
pointing out the importance of measurements and the dif<U+FB01>culty of
taking them satisfactorily, the author states, that of a few of the
stars with which the nebula is pretty well studded, measurements
with reference to the principal nucleus were taken by his assistant
Mr. Stoney in the spring of 184-9, and that these have been repeated
this year during the months of April and May, and also some mea

                                      965
sures taken from the centre of the principal nucleus to the apparent
boundary of the spiral coils in different angles of position.    A hope
is then expremed that, as several of these stars are no doubt within
reach of the        t instruments at Pulkova and at Cambridge, U.S.,
the distinguisifee‘fastronomers who have charge of them will consider
the subject worthy of their attention.
   The spiral arrangement of 5| .\lessier was detected in the spring
of l845, and in the following spring an arrangement, also spiral,
but of a different character. was detected in 99 Messier.‘ The author
considers that 8239 and '.Z:tT() of llerschel's ' Southerh Catalogue’
are very probably objects of a similar character; and as the same
instrument does not appear to have revealed any trace of the form
of 99 Messier, he docs not doubt that they are much more conspicu
ous, and therefore entertains the hope that, whenever the southern
hemisphere shall be re-examined with instruments of great power,
these two remarkable nebulae will yield some interesting result.
   The author brie<U+FB02>y refers to the other spiral nebuhn discovered
up to the present time, which are more di<U+FB02>icult to be seen, and to
clusters in the exterior stars of which there appears to be a tendency
to an arran ement in curved branches.          He then passes to the re
gular Cn||nllflr nebulae, in which, although they are perceived at once
to be objects of a very different character, there still seems to ho
something like a connecting link.
   Among the nebulous stars two objects are stated to be well
worthy of especial notice—No. 4-50 of Sir John Hen.-chel's Catalogu
and i Orionis. A representation of No. 4-50, as seen with the six
feet telescope, is given. lt has been several times examined, but as
yet not the slightest indication of resolvability has been seen.    The
annular form of this object was detected by Mr. Stoney when ob
serving alone, but Lord Ros-se has since had ample opportunities of
satisfying himself that the object has been accurately represented.
A representation of iOrionis is likewise given. The remarkable
feature in this object, the dark cavity not symmetrical with the star,
was also discovered by Mr. Stoney when observing alone with the
three-feet telescope. Lord Rosse has since seen it several times and
sketehed it.    A small double star n.jIi has similar openings, but
are not so easily seen.     These openings appear to be of the same
character as the opening within the bright stars of the trapezium of
Orion, the stars being at the edges of the opening.       Had the stars
been situated altogether within the openings, the suspicion that the
nebula had been absorbed by the stars would perhaps have suggested
itself more strongly.      As it is, the author thinks we can hardly fail
to conclude that the nebula is in some way connected with these
bright stars, in fact that they are equidistant, and therefore, if the
inquiries concerning parallax should result in giving us the distances
of these bright stars, we shall have the distance of this nebula.
   The long elliptic or lenticular nebnlm arc stated to be very nu
merous, and three sketehes of remarkable objects of this class are
given.
   In proceeding with the re-examination of Sir John Herachel's

                                 966
Catalogue, several groups of nebulae have been discovered, in some
of which nebulous connexion has been detected between individuals
of the group, in others not. Sketehes of some have been made and
measures taken; but although the subject of grouped or knotted
nebulae is considered one of deep interest, it has not yet been pro
ceeded with far enough to warrant entering upon it in the present
paper.
   The conclusion of the paper is occupied with remarks relating to
each <U+FB01>gure, in order to render the information conveyed by it more
complete, and these are stated to be for the most part extracts
selected from the Journal of Observations.
   2. “ Electro-Physiological Researches.--Ninth Series." By Signor
Carlo Matteucci. Communicated by WV. R. Grove, Esq., F.R.S.
   In the <U+FB01>rst portion of this paper the author refers to a work re
cently published by M. Du Bois Raymond
                                               “ On the law of Muscular
Current, and on the modi<U+FB01>cation which that law undergoes by the
effect of Contraction ;" which work M. Matteucci states obliges him
to transmit to the Royal Society certain researches the publication
of which he would otherwise have wished to delay. He then refers
to his previous researches published in the Philosophical Transactions
for the years 1845 and 1847, and in the Annales de Chimie for
October l84'7. From the experiments detailed in those papers, and
from certain points of doubt which he indicates, he considers him
self authorized in concluding that the development of electricity by
muscular contraction still remains to be demonstrated by experiment,
and that the phenomenon of induced contraction is still that which
leads most directly to this result.
    He then gives a series of experiments illustrated by <U+FB01>gures, and
from them deduces the following conclusions :—
    lst. The cause of induced contraction, according to all analogies,
is the same as that which produces contraction of the galvanoscopic
frog in several of the experiments given.
    2ndly. The cause of these contractions is evidently an electrical
phenomenon developed in the act of contraction, and which consists
 in a different state of electricity in the different points of the con
tracted limb.
    3rdly. This electrical phenomenon, like the contraction which
 produces  it, lasts only for an instant.
    4-thly. These electric states, developed by contraction, tend to
 produce electrical currents which circulate in opposite directions
 acrossa    conducting arch interposed between the two limbs, which
 contract at the same time.
    The author further states, that, whatever the theory of these phe
 nomena may be,   it   is  certain that they demonstrate the production
 of an electrical disequilibrium in the act of muscular contraction.
 Upon the question whether the cause of the species of discharge de
 scribed is   a phenomenon analogous to that of electrical <U+FB01>sh, or Q
 change in the natural conditions of the muscular current, the author,
 though leaning to the former alternative, forbears to express  a   posi-

                                    967
  tlve opinion, as further experiments are wanting to furnish suiilciont
  grounds for a decision.
      3. “On the Condition of certain Elements at the moment of
  Chemical Change."      By B. ('. Brodie, Esq., F.R.S.
      This paper contain! an experimental inquiry, founded upon cer
  tain theoretical considerations as to the condition of bodies at the
  moment of chemical change, with the discussion of which the intro
  duction ls occupied.
      The author considers that the peculiar combining properties of
  the elemental particles of which chemical substances are composed,
  are due to a chemical polarity of the acting masses, which takes
  place at the contact of the bodies, und have only a remote relation
  to the electro-chemical nature of the isolated clement.    ln support
  of this view are cited thephmnomena of double decomposition, and
  the properties of the so-called “nascent" elements, which could
  never be inferred from the nature of the clement when once isolated
 and formed.      Double decomposition the author considers to he the
 true type of nll chemical action.      In the case of the bodies called
 compound, this polarity is manifested by the division of the sub
 stance into two parts, which are universally considered to stand to
 one another in a certain positive and negative relation; and also by
 the synthesis, which corresponds to this division.
     The object of the paper is to point out that an analogous polar
 relation exists, at the moment of chemical change, between the par
 ticles of which the elemental bodies themselves are composed, of
 which condition we have evidence both when the isolated clement
 is chemically acted on by other bodies, and also in certain cases of
 the formation of the element from its compounds, in which we have
 a division and synthesis of the element corresponding (so far as this
 polar relation is considered) to the division and synthesis of a com
pound body. The evidence of these statements is, that when the iso
 lated element is chemically acted upon, we may observe in it (as mani
 fested by its combining properties) the same polar or nascent state
 as is developed in compound bodies; and also that we have certain
remarkable canes of the synthesis of the element, to account for
which we must assume the same combining relation between its par
 ticles as between the particles of which a compound substance is
formed.      These statements are supported by numerous instances.
     The experimental inquiry relates to a remarkable case of the
formation of oxygen, in which the author considers that the mutual
attraction of the particles of that element determines the decompo
sition of the substances from which it is evolved.     The experiment
in question is the mutual decomposition which the peroxide of hy
drogcn and certain metallic oxides, <U+FB01>rst discovered by Thénard,
undergo when in contact.       Thus the author regards, in this case,
the decomposition of the metallic oxide as a phaenomicnon which
may be represented thus :—
               no,+mo,=i16665;.=r1o+o,+m0,

                                  968
the metallic peroxide being reduced by the polar particle of oxy
gen, as in other cases it might be by hydrogen itself.       The proof
that such a chemical relation really exists between    the particles of
oxygen, would be found in the proportion in which the two sub
stances were reduced.      The paper contains an elaborate inquiry on
this point in the case of the chloride and of the oxide of silver; the
general result of which is, that these substances are capable of being
reduced in various but de<U+FB01>nite proportions, according as the con
ditions of temperature and mass are varied.     All the terms of this
series of ratios have not been determined; but it is ascertained that
the relative loss for the two substances proceeds by intermittent
steps, and that the whole action is con<U+FB01>ned between the limits of
the ratio of equality on the one hand, and the purely catalytic ac
tion (in which the metallic oxide would suffer no reduction) on the
other ; neither of which limits is ever absolutely reached.
   The constant loss of oxygen from the decomposing bodies in
equal equivalent proportions is found in the reaction of the peroxide
of barium with iodine in the presence of water. In this experiment,
the water in the presence of the iodine is reduced just as the per
oxide in the other experiments; but here the loss is constant, and

corresponding fact to the formation of the iodous acid, which takes

       “ The
   4'.        Calling of the Sea." By Richard Edmonds, Jun. Com
municated by W. J. Henwood, Esq., F.R.S.
   In this communication the author states, that in the neighbour
hood of Penzance there is often heard inland a murmuring or
a roaring noise, locally termed “the calling of the sea," which on
some occasions extends to the distance of eight or ten miles; whereas,
at other times, although to a person on the shore the sea may be
equally loud, and the state of the weather may appear equally
favourable, no sound from the sea can be heard at the tenth part of
that distance. From his observations during six years, he concludes,
that when the calling of the sea proceeds from a direction different
from the wind, or when it occurs during a calm, it is usually fol
lowed within six hours by a wind from the quarter from which it is
heard.
   5. “ On the Structure of the Membrana Tympani in the Human
Ear.” By Joseph Toynbee, F.R.S. &c. &c.
   In this paper the membrana tympani is described as consisting of
the following layers, which are quite distinct from each other, both
as regards their structure and functions :—

                                     969
    l. Epidermis.
   2. The proper <U+FB01>brous layer, composed of
           a. The lamina of radiating <U+FB01>bres.
           6. The lamins of circular <U+FB01>bres.
   S. Mucous membrane.
    One of the principal objects of the paper is to describe the struc
ture and functions of the <U+FB01>brous lamine.          Since the time of Sir
Everard Home, who pronounced the layer of radiating <U+FB01>bres to be
muscular, anatomists have tliffcrcd in their views of the nature of the
<U+FB01>brous clement of the membrana tympani. The lamina of radiating
<U+FB01>bres, the outer surface of which is covered by the epidermis, is
described as continuous with the pt'rlUsteLnnn of the external meatus.
With the exception of the uppermost <U+FB01>bres, which on account of
their being somewhat <U+FB02>accid have been considered as a separate
tissue under the name of “membrana <U+FB01>nccida," the radiate layer is
composed of <U+FB01>bres which extend from the circular cartilaginous ring
to the malleus, and they interlace in their course.     These <U+FB01>bres are
from the 't000th to the 5000th part of an inch in breadth.
    The lamina of circular <U+FB01>bres consists of circular <U+FB01>bres, which arc
<U+FB01>rm and strong towards the circumference, but very attenuated
towards the centre.     These <U+FB01>bres are so attached and arranged as
to form a layer of    membrane,     which in a quiescent state is saucer
shaped.     The <U+FB01>bres composing the circular are smaller than those
of the radiate lamina, being from the 6000th to the l0,000th part
of an inch in breadth.
    The facts that appear to be adverse to the idea of the <U+FB01>bres of
either layer being muscular nre
    l. The absence of distinct nuclei in the <U+FB01>bres.
    2. Their great denseness and hardness.
 It is next shown that the four laminae forming the membrana tym
 pani are continuous with other structures, of which they appear to
 be mere modi<U+FB01>cations, and that not one is proper to the organ.
    The tensor tympani ligament, which had not been previously
 noticed by anatomists, is particularly described; it is attached ex
 ternally to the malleus, close to the insertion of the tensor tympani
 muscle, and internall    to the cochleariform process.
    The latter part  oly                          by
                         the paper    isoccupied     observations on the
 functions of the <U+FB01>brous laminae and of the tensor ligament of the
 membrana tympani; and     it   is shown that by these two antagonistic
 forces, the one tending to draw the membrana tympani inwards, the
 other outwards, this organ  is   maintained in
                                              a   state of moderate ten
sion, and is  always ina    condition to receive ordinary sonorous un
dulations.
  6. “Investigations into the Structure and Development of the
Scales and Bones of Fishes."    By W. C. Williamson,          Com
municated      W. B. Carpenter, M.D., F.R.S.
               by
   In this memoir the author <U+FB01>rst points out the discrepancies that
exist between the opinions of M. Mandi and M. Agassiz respecting
the structure and growth of cycloid and ctenoid scales; and after

                                         970
 referring to the peculiar views entertained by each of these ichthy
 ologists, he enters upon the investigation of a number of examples,
 including the Carp, Perch, Gray Mullet, Pike, Salmon, and espe
 cially the large scale of an unknown <U+FB01>sh from the Bay of Dulse on
 the western coast of Mexico.         The results of this inquiry lead the
 author to conclusions which diiler considerably from those of both
 M. Agassiz and M. Mandi. He points out the existence of tkfee
 distinct vertically-disposed structures in each of these scales: a lower
 one, consisting of membranous laminae; a middle calcareous one,
 having :1 very peculiar structure and growth; and an upper one,
 also calcareous, but very distinct from the last, and which is variously
 disposed in different scales.       In all it contributes the peculiar cy
 cloid and other markings which ornament their surfaces; Whilst in
 ctenold scales, isolated portions of it appear to form the charac
 teristic teeth which project from their posterior margins.
    The author then developes in succession the peculiar and beauti
 ful structures seen in the scales of Dactylopterus, Balistes, Loricaria,
 and various forms belonging to the Ostraciant group. Whilst these
 examples exhibit singular diversities of structure, they appear to be
 all modi<U+FB01>ed forms of one cohilnoii type.
    From this branch of the inquiry the author proceeds to examine
 the other calcareous tissues existing in <U+FB01>shes, commencing with the
 endo-skeletons of the Sharks and Rays' (Plagiostoines). He shows
 that the entire osseous elements of these vertebrates are constructed
 of a peculiar form of bone, which he designates “ch0ndriform,"
 being wholly developed either within the soft tissues of true carti
 lage, or of a modi<U+FB01>ed form of cartilage. Fossil remains, having the
 same structure, have been fodlid in the lias at L 'me Regis and in
                                                            I)-Ie
 the coal-measures near Manchester and Leeds.                    then examines
 in succession  a    number of the bones of the Common Pike, and
shows that whilst all the osseous elementsof these skeletons are
developed in connexion with       a   cartilaginous matrix, their tissues are
of two kinds, which remain permanently distinct.               One of these   is
of the same chondriform character as that seen in‘ the Plagiostoines,
being developed in the interior of the cartilage; the other, which            is
produced either at the outer surface of the cartilage or in cavities
left by the absorption of the latter tissue, the author terms “mem
braniform," being formed within the lamella-2 of <U+FB01>brous membrane,
                                                       a
of which the primary origin         is  doubtful.     The peculiar relations
which    these  various  structures  bear    to one  another    in the' different
stages    of  growth   are  explained.     The   same   process of inquiry    is
applied to many      of the   bones of  the   Perch,  Cod,   Haddock, Sharp
nosed    Eel,  Salmon,   &c., in each  of  which   peculiarities exist. in the
latter example especially the entire skeleton consists of           a   modi<U+FB01>ed
fdfm of chondriform bone, of which              exhibits two kinds.
                                               it                         One of
these resembles that of the Pike and other examples, both in its
aspect and in the situations in which           occurs. The second form
                                               it                             is
more peculiar; whilst the way in which its growth            is   accomplished
closely resembles that of membraniform bones produced by the cal
ci<U+FB01>cation of <U+FB01>brous periosteal membranes, its internal structure

                                     97!
shows that it is of the chondriform type, being developed in s thick
leathery pcricstcum of <U+FB02>bro-cartilage, and which appears to be con
tinuous with the true cartilage wherever the two come into contact.
     It is not possible to give any de<U+FB01>nite ides of the detailed observa
tions contained in s memoir of which so large s portion is devoted
to minute investigation.       The inferences which the author deduces
from his facts src given in connexion with esch of the several topics
discussed; and in the concluding portion of the memoir he points
 out the bearing which they have upon some general questions in
 physiology. A close resemblance is shown to exist between the pro
 cesses ofcaloi<U+FB02>cation, as carricd on in the <U+FB01>brous tissues of <U+FB01>sh-scales,
 in cartilages and in <U+FB01>bro-cartilages, in all of which the phmnomenn
 closcly correspond ; and the author thinks that the bones and teeth
 of mammals, in which the process is far less obvious than in these
 ichthyal structures, may be calcified in s similar wsy.
     The important bearing cl’ tho membraniform kosmine structures
 (which closely resemble the different varieties of dentinc) upon the
 generally received hypothesis respecting the growth of teeth is also
 discussed; and the author thinks there are such sufficient reasons
 for doubting the correctness of that hypothesis, as to render a review
 of the evidence upon which it is based very desirable.
      The pcculiar modi<U+FB01>cltions which the homologues of the Haver
 sisn canals of nnthrcpotomists present amongst different groups of
  <U+FB01>shes are pointed out, as well as the very near af<U+FB01>nity which exists
  betwecn bone, dentine, gsnoin, kosmine, enamel; and the proba
  bility of s closcr relationship between cartilage, <U+FB01>bro-curtila e and
  <U+FB01>brous periosteum, is also suggested as s subject deserving girther
  investigation.    The <U+FB01>eld opened out to the physiologist and the
  microscopist in the department of ichthyology is almost boundless,
  being comparatively unexplored, whilst it promises a rich harvest to
  those who labour in it.
      7. “ On the impregnation of the Ovum in the Amphihia."            By
  George Newport, F.R.S., F.L.S. &c.
      The author states that this communication to the Royal Society
  is part of n series cf investigations on development, on which he has
  been for some ycnrs engaged, and which was commenced in a paper
  on that of the Myrispcds, published in I84-I, in the Philosophical
  Transactions.      The plan followed in these investigations has been
  to combine observations on the natural history of the animals with
  others on the conditions which affect their development, as the best
   mode of arriving at correct conclusions.       The history of the dis
   covery of what can now be proved to be the direct agent of impreg
   nation, the spcrmatozoon, is then traced; and it is shown, that
   although within the last few years an opinion has been gaining
   ground that the spermatozoon, and not the liquor seminis, as for
   merly supposed, is the means of impregnation, no acknowledged
   proof has hitherto been given of the correctness of this opinion, and
   no refutation afforded to the theory that the liquor scminis is the
   part of the seminal <U+FB02>uid immediately concerned.        The question of

                                   972
the agency of the spermatozoon has thus remained open; and it is
to this question, with a view <U+FB01>rst to supply proof from direct expe
riments of the fact of the agency of this body, as well as to examine
into the circumstances under which this agency is exerted, in<U+FB02>uenced
or impeded, that the present communication is especially devoted.
   The author then traces the changes in the ovum within the body
of the Amphibia, from a short time before the disappearance of the
germinal vesicle to the period when the ovum is expelled before
impregnation.     The structure of the germinal vesicle in the ovarian
ovum is shown to be an involution of cells, as stated by Wagner
and Barry; but the author differs entirely from the latter respecting
the mode of disappearance of the vesicle, and also respecting the
part played by its constituents in the production of the embryo.
He believes the included cells are liberated by the di<U+FB02>luence of the
membrane of the germinal vesicle in the interior of the yelk, not in
the centre of the yelk, but much nearer to the upper or dark surface
than to the white or inferior, and at the bottom of a short canal, the
entrance to which is in the middle of the upper or black surface at
a point already noticed by Prevost and Dumas, Rusconi and Boa;
and he thinks that it is due to the di<U+FB02>iuence of the envelope of the
vesicle in this situation that the moment of disappearance has not
yet been observed.      The germinal vesicle in the Amphibia always
disappears   before  the ovum leaves the ovary, and escapes into the
cavity  of the abdomen.    The mode in which the ovum, after leaving
the ovary, is believed to arrive at the entrance of the oviduct is then
stated, and the structure of the entrance in the intermedial space,
as shown by Swammerdam, described.
   The author then traces the changes in the impregnated and in
the unimpregnated ovum after spawning, from the <U+FB01>rst minute to
the segmentation of the yelk in the former, and shows that the ap
pearances in the two are almost identical during the <U+FB01>rst ten or
twelve minutes, but that after that time the changes in the unim
pregnated ovum cease, while further changes take place in the im
pregnated.     The yelk at the end of from twelve to <U+FB01>fteen minutes
invariably then rotates, so that the dark surface becomes uppermost;
and it constantly afterwards returns to this position, however much
or frequently this may be changed.      In about three hours the yelk
becomes separated on the upper surface from the vitelline mem
brane, and a space or chamber is formed between the two.            The
yelk then becomes depressed on the upper surface, but is slightly elon
gated to an obtuse oval form, in the horizontal,direction; and in
about half or three-quarters of an hour afterwards begins to divide
in the margin of the central spot or ori<U+FB01>ce, from which point the
division, as already known, passes outwardly and around the yelk
until the mass is divided into two portions.    These changes do not
take place in the unimpregnated ovum, which merely becomes some
what oval, but does not divide; so that segmentation may be re
garded as a proof that the egg has been impregnated, a fact that
was of great use as a test in the following experiments.      The sus
ceptibility of the ovum to become impregnated, and the circum

                                   978
stances which affect this, are then shown to depend on the degree
of expansion of the envelopes, the imbibition of <U+FB02>uid, the tempera
ture of the surrounding medium. and the degree of ai.-'ration.        The
envelopes expand    and  imbibe  <U+FB02>uid  most  rapidly during the  <U+FB01>rst half
hour after the egg has been laid, and the susceptibility is diminished
in the inverse ratio of the expansion and imbibition.      It is greatest
during the <U+FB01>rst three minutes, but is very feeble at the end of half
an hour.     These conditions are greatly modi<U+FB01>ed by temperature,
and in a much less degree by the ai.-ration of the ovum.          Experi
ments in proof of these facts are detailed, especially with reference
to the number of eggs segmented and of embryo produced, and their
earlier or later appearance in proportion to the higher or lower tem
perature of the medium. In “arch 18-i-9 the author put to the test
the agency of the spermatozoa in impregnation, by an experiment
long since employed by Spallanzani, and more recently by Prevost
and Dumas, namely, by carefully separating the spermatozoa of the
 Frog from the liquor remind: by <U+FB01>ltration. and employing these,
with the <U+FB01>lter-paper on which they had been collected, in experi
ments on some sets of eggs, and the liquor in others; and the result
 was, that almost every ovum became impregnated in the former, but
scarcely a single ovum in the latter.     The production of a very few
 embryos in the sets to which the liquor seminis was added, Ire
attributes to the fact that the whole of the spermatozoa had not
 been removed.     These experiments he has repeated during the pre
 sent spring with still more decided results; not a single ovum be
 coming segmented, nor a singlc embryo produced when the liquor
 seminis was completely freed of spermatozoa. The author states that
 these experiments had been completed, and he was engaged in pre
 paring the paper for presentation to the Royal Society, before he
 was aware that the physiologists above named, Spallanzani <U+FB01>rst, and
 afterwards Prevost and Dumas, had obtained similar results by <U+FB01>l
 tration of frog’: semen, although the fact of their observations has
 been almost overlooked.      To them therefore he resigns the credit
 of the results; but as his own investigations have been so com
 pletely independent of theirs, from which also they differ in some
 respects, he has felt it to be desirable still to give them in detail in
 this paper.
    The direct agency of the spermatozoa in impregnation being
 thus proved, the author proceeds to investigate its nature.       He first
 shows that the ova are not impregnated after the motive power in
 the spermatozoa has ceased.      The period of duration       this power
                                                             o_f
 he <U+FB01>nds to be much shorter than supposed by Spallanzani and by
 Prevost and Dumas; and he attributes the difference in length of
 time as observed by these authors and himself, to their having
 adopted the objectionable mode of procuring the seminal <U+FB02>uid by
 vivisection from the testes as well as the vesicular seminales, by
 which he conceives that spermatorial cells were obtained as well as
 mature spermatozoa, and that the former became matured only at         a
 late period of the experiments.     He differs also from Prevost and
 Dumas, and Dr. Martin Barry, with regard to the supposed pene

                                  974a
tration of the spermatozoon bodily into the ovum. All the observa
tions he has been able to make on the ovum of the Frog, both mi
croscopically and experimentally, are opposed to the belief that any
<U+FB01>ssure or perforation exists in the envelopes of the ovum, as de<
scribed by Dr. Barry in the ovum of the Rabbit, and through which
the spermatozoon was supposed to enter. Neither is he able to con
<U+FB01>rm the statements of Prevost and Dumas, that the spermatozoa
penetrate into the substance of the envelope of the egg either of the
Frog or the Newt; and he thinks these distinguished observers
must have supposed that spermatozoa which they saw on the ex
terior of the ovum were in the interior.         The author has put this
question to the test in the ovum of the Newt, Lissoériton punctatus.
 He extracted an ovum, which he had reason to believe had not been
impregnated, from the oviduct, and placed it with seminal <U+FB02>uid in
water, and immediately afterwards examined it with the microscope.
 Spermatozoa were detected upon it in less than one minute after
immersion; but neither then, nor at any subsequent period, could
even a single spermatozoon be seen within        it, although the whole
 interior of the egg was brought within focus of the microscope, and
 distinctly recognised. This egg was preserved         in small glass cap
                                                            a
sule beneath the microscope, and watehed until the embryo was
produced.       Spermatozoa were recognised on the exterior during
the <U+FB01>rst forty-eight hours.
    But although spermatozoa do not enter the interior, they are in
 variably found in contact with the surface of the impregnated ovum,
 and this contact is   essential to their agency. The author also shows
that the envelopes of the ovum are essential to its fecundation, and
 that ova taken from the ovary, or from the cavity of the body after
 they have left the ovary, but have not yet entered the oviduct and
 acquired their gelatinous coverings, are not susceptible of being im
 pregnated.      The coverings imbibe water by endosmose, but do not
 usually admit solid particles of matter equal    in  size to spermatozoa
 into their texture, as was proved by immersion in solution of carmine.
     The author then enters at length on an examination of the agency
 of the spermatozoa as affected by chemical media. Availing him
 self ofa fact ascertained during a     chemical analysis of seminal <U+FB02>uid
 by Dr. Frerichs, that the spermatozoa are decomposed by caustic
 potash, he conceived the possibility of so employing this agent as to
 renderit   a  test in experiment.    Ova were passed from the body of
a   frog on a    dry surface, without being in contact with water, until
 seminal <U+FB02>uid mixed with    it    was applied to them.     After the lapse
 of a given time, solution of caustic potash, of su<U+FB02>icient strength to
 decompose the spermatozoa immediately, was also applied, and as
 quickly as possible afterwards was again diluted and removed with
 water, before the potash, as found by other experiments, acted pre
judicially on the ova. The result was that segmentation of the yell:
 usually took place even when the interval of time between the ap
 plication of the seminal <U+FB02>uid and the solution of potash was only
 one or two seconds, but no embryos were produced.            When, how.
  ever, the interval was <U+FB01>ve seconds, a   very few embryos were formed;

                                   975
but when the interval was <U+FB01><U+FB02>ean or morcseconds, they were pro
duced in greater number.       The conclusion deduced from these and
similar experiments with nitrate of potash was, that impregnation is
commenced almost at the instant of contact of the spermstozoon
with thc ovum; but that duration of contact, and possibly also dif
<U+FB02>uence of tho spennatozoon and cndosmosis 'of its substance, is
necessary for fruitful impregnation.      The experiments were varied
by the application of the solution of potash before that of the seminal
<U+FB02>uid, in which casc the results were more unfavourable.             With
nitrate of potash, applied before as well as s<U+FB02>er the seminal <U+FB02>uid,
the formation of embr 'os was not unfrcquent.        None however were
produced when dilutczl ncctic acid was used. This acid acts quickly
and most unfavourably on the cnveloprs of the ovum.
   The agency of the impregnating bodies was then tested in a
similar way,      the sp licaticn of solutions of gum-arsbic and of
starch, the sctbyon of which is merely mechanical.      The results were
similar to those with the potash.
   When the gum or starch was applied, as in the case of the potash,
q<U+FB02>er the application of seminal <U+FB02>uid in water, embryos were con
stantly produccd, even when the interval between the two applica
tions was onl one second ; but when either of these was applied to
the ovum be<U+FB01>irs the seminal <U+FB02>uid, then segmentation, if it occurred
at all, took place very tardily. In general, however, no segmentation
occurred, and no embryos, or but very few indeed, were produced.
   These experiments, compared with those with potash, seemed to
show that impregnation is commenced in s very short space of time,
and that the spermatozoon is the agent immediately concerned; and
that this agency is material in its operation, as seems to be shown in
the fact that it can be prevented by the application both of chemical
and of mechanical means to the ovum.         We are thus led to infer,
that although the spermatozoon does not bodily penetrate into the
ovum, its <U+FB01>rst effcct may have some relation to catalytic notion, in
inducing the segmentation of the yelk; and, having proof that
<U+FB02>uids permeate the coverings of the ovum, we may hereafter <U+FB01>nd
that the process is completed by the di<U+FB02>iucnce of the impregnating
body, and the substance into which it is dissolved, by imbibition
into the ovum by endosmosis.

son, Esq., M.A., F.R.S.E., Fellow of St. Peter'a College, Cambridge,
and Professor of Natural Philosophy in the University of Glasgow.
   The Theory of Magnetism was <U+FB01>rst mathematically treated in a
complete form by Poisson.       Brief sketehes of his theory, with some
simpli<U+FB01>cations,   have been given by Green and Murphy in their
works on Electricity and Magnetism.        In all these writings a hypo
thesis of two magnetic <U+FB02>uids has been adopted, and strictly adhered
to throughout.     No physical evidence can he adduced in support of
such a hypothesis; but, on the contrary, recent discoveries, especially
in electro-magnetism, render it excessively improbable.       Hence it is

                                    976
                                                   'x    \
of importance that all reasoning with reference to magnetism should
be conducted without assuming the existence of those hypothetical
<U+FB02>uids.
   The writer of the present paper endeavours to show that a com
plete mathematical theory of magnetism may be established upon
the sole foundation of facts generally known, and Coulomb's special
experimental researches.
   The <U+FB01>rst part of the paper contains a general theory of magnets;
the theory of magnetic induction, or of magnetization being reserved
for communications which the author proposes to offer subsequently
to the Royal Society.    The <U+FB01>ve chapters which have already been
communicated   bear  the following titles :
CHAP. I. (§§ 3—20). Preliminary De<U+FB01>nitions and Explanations.
CHAP. II. (§§ 21—31). On the Laws of Magnetic Force, and on
                            the Distribution of Magnetism in Mag
                            netized Matter.
Crmr. III. (§§ 32—4-4‘). On the Imaginary Magnetic Matter by

                            netized Body may be represented.

CRAP. V. (§§ 65—84). On Solenoidal and Lamellar Distributions
                            of Magnetism.
   In the second chapter the method of specifying, by “intensity and
direction of magnetization" at every part of      the magnetism of a
                                                   it,
magnet,  is  given being founded on the elementary phenomena, and
                  ;
Coulomb's laws of magnetic force, which are explained in Chap.         I.
and the beginning of Chap. II.
   In the third chapter, by strictly synthetical investigation, cor
                               a
responding closely with that investigation of “the equation of con
tinuity" in <U+FB02>uid motion which      is analogous to Fourier's investigation
of the equation of motion of heat in conducting solid, a certain distri
                                        a
bution of“ imaginary magnetic matter" consisting of equal quantities
of positive and negative, or northern and southern matter each occu
pying <U+FB01>nite portions of the body or of its surface separated from those
occupied by the other,  is  shown to represent the polarity of magnet
                                                               a
accbrding   to the assumed properties of this magnetic matter. The for
mulae by means of which the resultant action between two entire mag
nets of <U+FB01>nite dimensions is  determined are much simpli<U+FB01>ed by this con
ventional  method    of representing polarity. The result of the inves
tigation agrees   with  what  isexpressed by a   certain formula of Pois
son's, deduced by a process of integration    by  parts, from his elemen
tary expression for the function   since called               “
                                                by Green the potential,"
at any point in the neighbourhood of a magnet.         Hence the investi
gation of Chap. III. leads, as     is  shown at the commencement of
Chap. lV., to strictly synthetical proof of that remarkable formula.

given, or determined by the preceding formula from a -pecitication
of the magnets to which it is due, by which the mathematical treat.
ment, according to one method, of the problem which forms the
subject of the chapter is completed. The chapter is concluded with
the statement ofa method ofexprceuing the mutual action between
two magnets by means of the ditii-rcntial cm-<U+FB02>ieicnts of a function of
their n-lative pmition. which is of importance chie<U+FB02>y boonu.-:e the
principles on which it is founded lend to anew <U+FB01>eld of investiga

    The <U+FB01>fth chapter contains, in the first place, explanations of the
principal properties of the peculiar tlistributlons to which the author
has given the names ofrolerioillnl and lumellur.         solenoidal distri

   In the concluding part of Chap. V. three new methods of ana

special forms  of distribution, and constituting,  with Poisson's method
mentioned above, a system ol' four expressions for the magnetic force
connected with one another by certain analogies, are given.       One
of these (Poisson's) expresses the force at any point in terms of
double integrals for the surface (the components of the force due to
the super<U+FB01>cial polarity); and triple integrals for the whole interior,
involving ‘-11+-‘£2-+2,               and vanishing          when this vanishes,      1'.   e.

                              is        The analogue of this expresses
the force in terms of double integrals for the surface (the components
of the force due to the super<U+FB01>cial representative galvanism) and
triple integrals for the whole interior, involving
                     dB—d-y              d'y_da        da_d<U+FB02>

and vanishing when these                 vanish, i.c. when the distribution                 is
lamellar. Of the two remaining methods, one                       is   con<U+FB01>ned to solenoi
                                                                                3

point, or at anyjnternal point in an in<U+FB01>nitely small crevass tangential
to the lines of magnetization, as the resultant of a certain distribution
of tangential magnetization in an in<U+FB01>nitely thin shell, coinciding with
the surface, and occurred to the author as the analogue of a method
which he had long before found for expressing the force due to a
lamellar distribution.     In this last-mentioned method, which is
con<U+FB01>ned to lamellar distributions, the force at any external point, or
at any interior point in an in<U+FB01>nitely small crevass perpendicular to
the lines of magnetization, is expressed as the resultant of a certain
distribution of normal magnetization in an in<U+FB01>nitely thin shell coin
ciding with the surface.
    9. “Les Causes du Magnétisme terrestre prouvées.", Par M. Pierre
Beron. Communicated by John Lee, Esq., LL.D., F.R.S. &c.
    The author considers the elements of terrestrial magnetism to be,
that the force with which the magnetic needle maintains its position is
not everywhere the same, and that its declination and inclination vary
from one region to another. These elements, he states, undergo very
different modi<U+FB01>cations, which may be reduced to the following :
    1. Variations with reference to the position of the sun to the south
or to the north of the equator; 2. diurnal variations in different
regions of the earth; 3. disturbances which proceed from changes
of weather, and from volcanic irruptions, and those which are ob
served during the appearance of the aurora borealis; 4-. secular
variations.
    Adopting the views which have long since been put forward, but
without adverting to the opinions of others who have preceded him
in the same path, the author refers all the phaenomena of terrestrial
 magnetism to the action of thermo-electric currents, and states, that
 as \ve know from climatology the regions of the earth which have
 the most hetero-thermal seasons, we have data for determining the
intensity and direction of the thermo-electric currents in every region
of the globe.
    The hetero-thermal regions being marked by the isothermals of
the most hetero-thermal months, the author distributes the thermo
 electric currents into four magnetic systems, in each of which the
currents are directed towards the middle, marked by the culmina
tion of the isothermals. He then endeavours to trace out the general
connexion between the thermo-electric currents which he assumes
and the magnetic phaenomena as observed in what he terms the
American, the Asiatic, the Australian, and the Gallipagos' magnetic
systems.
    The extraordinary disturbances in the direction of the needle, he
attributes to changes in the regular order of the distribution of solar
heat, which give rise to corresponding changes in the thermo-elec
tnc currents; and the secular variation to the amelioration of cli
       ansing from the culture of the soil in different regions of the
gaii
   r .
   The author concludes his memoir with the following remark          :_

   10.   “ On the Physiology and Pathology of Phosphate and Oxalate
of Lime, and their relation to the formation of Cells." By William
Benekc, i\l.D. Communicated by Sir James Clark, Bart., F.R.S.
   In this paper the author commences by referring to a work re
cently published by him, entitled
                                        “ Der Pbosphoriisurc Kalk in
physiologischer   und thcrapcutischvr llcziehung." (iiittingen, 1850,
in which he believes that he has established the indispensable neces
sity of phosphate of lime to the formation of cclls in man, as well as
in animals and plants; its de<U+FB01>ciency as a cause of disease; and its
ef<U+FB01>cacy administered internally as n means of alleviation or cure in
the treatment of such disease. He cites from Liebig various proofs
of the necessity of the presence of phosphate of lime for the forma
tion of nitrogenous compounds in plants; and from Carl Schmidt,
that it has an intimate relation to the formation of cells in inverta
brute animals; and argues from his own experiments, that it has the
same relation to the formation of cells in the higher classes of ani
mnls and in man. These experiments consisted, <U+FB01>rst, in the chemi
cal examination of various pathological cxudations, such as the
serum produced by blisters, the secretions of wounds, ulcers, &c.,
the result of which satis<U+FB01>ed him, that, wherever a formation of cells
took place, phosphate of lime was present in considerable quantity;
and wherever it was absent, he could not detect any phosphate. He
believes that from a mixture of albumen, pure fat and phosphate of
lime, put in n sand-bath at 104°, he has succeeded in arti<U+FB01>cially
producing cells, which he describes and <U+FB01>gures in various stages.
He further adduces, in proof of his theory, the bene<U+FB01>cial results of
the treatment of various diseases connected with dyscrasia, by the
administration of phosphate of lime. in such diseases he states that
a much larger quantity of the phosphates is removed from the (eco
nomy by the urine than in the normal state ; and this he determines
by a multitude of observations conducted on a method of analysis
proposed by Dr. Heinz of Berlin. This increased elimination of the
phosphates he attributes to the presence of oxalic acid, the existence
of which in the urine be regards as always indicative of disease. On
this subject he refers to the works of Dr. Prout, Dr. Golding Bird
and Dr. llence Jones, and compares the results of his own observa
tions with those of the authors cited, giving <U+FB01>gures of the various
forms of oxalate of lime. and diagrams of the diurnal variations of
the acidity of the urine, of its speci<U+FB01>c gravity, and of the phosphates
and oxalate: of lime contained in  it,  in two remarkable cases. From
                                                            3*

                                    980
a series of experiments on bones, he comes to the conclusion, that
oxalic acid is the solvent for the phosphates in the animal oeconomy ;
and deduces the production of oxalic acid, and especially of its hy
pernormal quantities,—<U+FB01>rst,      from a hypernormal quantity of non
nitrogenous food, such as sugar, starch and farinaceous substances ;
and secondly, from want of sui<U+FB01>cient oxygen taken from the air, as
in malarious situations, or in the cases of persons suffering from
disease of the lungs.      The results of the author's observations are
<U+FB01>nally summed up in the following terms :
     1. That in the human oeconomy, as well as in plants and in the
 inferior animals, the production of cells indispensably requires the
 presence of phosphate of lime.
     2. That a de<U+FB01>cient formation of cells in morbid affections of the
 system almost invariably indicates a de<U+FB01>ciency of phosphate of lime;
 and that the administration of phosphate of lime has proved most
 bene<U+FB01>cial in such affections.
     3. That this de<U+FB01>ciency of phosphate of lime is proved really to
 exist by the hypernormal quantities of phosphates eliminated by the
 urine in almost all the cases in which a de<U+FB01>cient formation of cells
 or a want of <U+FB02>esh exists.
     4-. That this elimination   of phosphates is caused by the oxalic
 acid which is produced in the ceconomy in health as well as in
 disease, and causes the elimination as well of the normal as of the
 hypernormal quantities of the phosphates.
     5. That the production of oxalic acid in preternatural quantities
 depends on different causes, the principal of which are,—the use of
 abandant quantities of saccharine and farinaceous food; the want
  of su<U+FB02>icient reception of oxygen by the lungs; a morbid decompo
 sition of uric acid into urea and oxalic acid; and very probably the
 presence of abundant quantities of alkali in the blood.
     6. That, consequently, by putting a stop to the production of
  hypernormal quantities of oxalic acid, we shall stop the elimination
  of hypernormal quantities of the phosphates, and consequently pro
  mote the formation of cells, supposing a su<U+FB02>icient quantity of nitro
  genous and non-nitrogenous substances to be present.
      11.  “Supplementary Observations on the Diffusion of Liquids."
  By Thomas Graham, Esq., F.R.S., F.C.S.
     The former experiments of the author furnished strong grounds
  for believing that isomorphous salts possess a similar diffusibility.
  All the salts of potash and ammonia, which were compared, ap
  pear to be equi-diffusive; so also were the salts of certain magnesian
  bases.    A single preliminary observation on the nitrates of lead and
  baryta, however, opposed the general conclusion, and demanded
  further inquiry. It is scarcely necessary to say that any new means
  of recognizing the existence of the isomorphous relation between
  different substances, must prove highly valuable. The investigation
         also extended to several new substances, such as hydrocyanic
  was
  acid,          acid, sulphurous acid, alcohol, ammonia and salts of
          acetic
  orgamc bases, without reference to isomorphous relations.

   Hydrobromic acid appears therefore to coincide in diffusibility
with hydrochloric acid at this temperature.             remarked that                     It      is
these three acids, hydrochloric, hydrobromic and hydriodic, do not
exhibit the same correspondence in another physical property,
namely. the densities of their aqueous solutions containing the same
proportion of acid. The densities of     per cent. solutions of hydro
                                                                 2
chloric and hydriodic acids appear to be respectively l'Ol04- and
 1'01!-8, at 60° F., and that of hydrobromic acid       an intermediate                      is
number.      The same acids are also known to differ considerably in
the boiling-points of solutions containing the same proportion of
acid.    A considerable diversity of physical properties appears here
to be compatible with equal diffusibility in substances which are
isomorphous.
    The diffusion-time of bromine was made ten days, or double the
time of hydrobromic acid. Two cells contained together          diffusate                                     a
of 5'80 grs. of bromine; another two cells diffusate of 5'88 grs.;                   a
 mean 5°84 grs. at 60"'l F.; or 6'76 grs. for       per cent. solution.              a   I
 Doubling the last result, l5'5'.7 grs. are obtained for       per cent.                                 a   2
solution, which       still considerably under the diffusate of hydro
                       is
 bromic acid (l6'58 gm.) in half the time.
    Hydrocyanic acid appeared less diffusive than hydrochloric acid,
at the same temperature 59°'7, as 12'-4-5 to 16-55, or as 75'‘2 to I00,
and not to belong therefore to the same class of diffusive substances.
    Nitric Acid.-Time of diffusion also <U+FB01>ve days. The quantity of

                                     982
this acid diffused was determined with great exactness by neutrali
zation by means of a normal solution of carbonate of soda.
    The diffusion of the different proportions of this acid at one tem
perature is as follows.

                                                                              -

          From 8 per cent. solution     . .  . . . . . .  57'92       7'86
    The 2 per cent. solution is taken as the standard of companson
for the ratios, instead of the 1 per cent. solution, from the greater
accuracy with which the di<U+FB02>hsion of the former can be observed.
    The usual approach to equality of diffusion, between chlorides
and nitrates, is observable in hydrochloric and nitric acids, at least
in the 1 and 2 per cent. solutions.
    Sulphuric A(id.—The time of diffusion arbitrarily chosen for this
and the three following acids was ten days. The diffusate of this
acid was determined in the same manner as that of nitric acid.
    The diffusion of the different proportions of sulphuric acid is as
follows.
    Diffusion of sulphate of water in ten days at 49°'7; two cells :—
                                                            Grs.      Ratio.

          From 8 per cent.   solution   . . . . . .   . . 68'96       8'16
    The diffusibility of different strengths of this acid appears to be
pretty uniform, but with a slight tendency to increase in the higher
proportions, like hydrochloric acid.
    Sulphuric acid is greatly inferior in velocity of diffusion to hydro
 chloric acid, but still appears to possess considerably more than half
 the diffusibility of the latter.
     Clzromic Acid.—The diffusate of the 2 per cent. solution was
 22-43 grs.of chromic acid, in two cells, at 67°'3.               The diffusion of
 sulphuric acid at 63°'5, was 19'73 grs., which would give about
 21 grs. of that acid at 67°'3.
    Acetic Acid.—This acid cannot be determined accurately by the
 acidimetrical method, owing to the acetates of potash and soda being
 essentially alkaline to test-paper, like the carbonates of the same
 bases, although neutral in composition.              The weight of carbonate
 of baryta dissolved by the acid was had recourse to.

    The diffusibility diminishes with the larger
                                                             proportions of acid.

  acid.

     Ammonia appears to have            a diffusibility approaching to that of
 hydrate    of potash.    lt appears very similar to hydrocyanic acid at
 the same    temperature; or to possess about three-fourths of the dif
 fusibilit   of hydrochloric acid.
    Alcolal.——'lri|ne of diffusion ten days. The quantity of alcohol
 diffused was determined by careful distillation.                       The density of the
 alcohol solutions in the phinls was always made to exceed that of
 the water in the jars, by the addition of chloride of sodium to the
 former.

    Alcohol does not appear to belong to the same class of diffusive
 substances as acetic acid, which might be expected from their simi
 larity of composition, but possesses a considerably lower diffusibility.
    Diffusion from 2 per cent. solutions in ten days:—

    The diffusion of alcohol approaches to one-halfof that of sulphate
of water at nearly the      same temperature.
    Alcohol   may be substituted for water to dissolve certain salts, and
at the same time be made an atmosphere into which these salts are
allowed to diffuse. From experiments which have been commenced
on this subject, it appears that the diffusion of hydrate of potash,
iodide of potassium, chloride of calcium and others is about four
times slower into alcohol of density 0'8/10 than into water. The salts
likewise often exhibit the same relations in their diffusibility in alco

   acidulated with acetic acid.

   On comparing solutions of chloride of calcium and nitrate of lime,
it appears that the correspondence between the 1 and 2 per cent.
solutions is su<U+FB02>iciently close, but that in the 4- and 8 per cent. the
salts diverge, as happens also with hydrochloric and nitric acids
themselves.     The nitrate in both cases falls off, while the chloride
sustains throughout the high diffusibility of the lower proportions.

   Sesquicliloride of Iron.—A series of observations was made upon
the diffusion of the different proportions of this salt from l to 8 per
cent., but in all of them decomposition was determined by the diffu
sion, with turbidity also in the solution phial except in the 8 per
cent. solution.
   The mean diffusion from the 8 per cent. solution, at 68°'8, was

                                        986
  55'88 grs. of sesquichloride of iron, with 6'66 grs. of free hydro
  chloric acid, in two cells. It appears from this that perchloride of
  iron approaches the chloride of calcium in diffusibility.              That the
  proto- and persalts of the magnesian metals should have a similar
  rate of diffusion, is not unlikely from other analogies which they
  exhibit.
      Sulphates of Magnesia and Zinc.—The time chosen for the dif
  fusion of these salts, namely, 16166 days, is a multiple by 2 of the
  time of sulphate of potash, and by 4- ofthe time of hydrate of potash.
  The diffusate was evaporated to dryness and weighed.

     It  Is remarked    that the diffusion  of   these two isomorphous salts,
 sulphate of magnesia and sulphate of zinc, differs so much, in the
 1 per cent. solution, as 8'75 per cent.         This, however, is considered
 to be an accidental error, the disturbances from changes of tempe
 rature and other causes of dispersion being in direct proportion to
the duration of the experiment, and therefore much increased with
long times; while the 1 per cent. solution also, from its low density,
is the proportion most exposed to such errors. The sulphate of zinc
appears to be the truest throughout, in its diffusion, of these two
salts. The approach to equality becomes close in the 4- per cent.
and larger proportions of salt, particularly with the unusually high
proportions of 16 and 24 per cent., which were observed in these
salts.      The diffusion of both salts falls off remarkably in the higher
proportions.        The result of the comparison of these two magnesian
sulphates      is no doubt favourable to the similarity of diffusion of
isomorphous salts.

     Aremarkable approach to equality in the diffusion of the bicar
bonates of potash and soda, in the times chosen, is observed equally
in all the proportions of salt from 1 to 8 per cent.
   The times chosen for the bicarbonates of potash and ammonia is
to that of the bicarbonate of soda, as the square root of 2 to the
square root of 3, and the remarkable agreement observed in the dif
fusion of these salts gives support therefore to that -relation.      In
alluding to this relation, it    however, added that the carbonates of

has a real foundation,     must be masked in the salts last named by

     12.                                                    Physical Forces."
 By William B. Carpenter, M.D., F.R.S. &c.
     The purpose of the author in this communication is to show that
 the same kinds of “Correlation" as has been pointed out by Prof.
 Grove to exist among the physical forccs,—light, heat, electricity,
 magnetism, chemical a<U+FB02>inity, and mechanical motion,—exists also
 between these forces and those which operate in the development of
 living beings, and in the production of all their vital actions.
     1. In some introductory remarks, the author brie<U+FB02>y rccapitulates
 the leading ideas which have been entertained by physiologists with
 respect to the relations between the physical and vital forces; and
 states it to be the doctrine at present in vogue, that vital forces are
 the manifestations of the dormant properties of organized structures,
 called into activity by the physical forces which operate as stimuli.
     2. He then examines into the mutual relations of the several vital
 forces; and adduces facts and arguments to prove that the forces of
 assimilation, organization, chemico-vital transformation, and histo
 logical transformation, which are concerned in the development and
  maintenance of living organisms, are so many modes of one and the
 same vital force, whose most general operation is seen in cell;forma
  tion.    And he then goes on to show that the production of the ner
  vous and muscular forces, and of ciliary movement, are due to the
  same agency.      Lastly, he points out that the nervous forcc, origi
  nating in one nct of cell-formation, can in its turn in<U+FB02>uence other
  acts of the same kind, and can thus modify every other kind of vital
  operation.     Whence he concludes that all these vital forces are
  “ correlated.”
      8. The author then investigates the relations of the vital and
  physical forces to each other. Taking the nervous force as the most
  characteristic example of the former, he shows that it is correlated
  to electricity, heat, light, chemical a<U+FB02>inity, and mechanical motion.
  He then endeavours to prove that the same correlation exists be
  tween heat and the organizing forces; so that the latter may be con

                                   990
sidered as in reality due to a transformation or conversion of heat
by its passage through an organized structure; just as heat, acting
through a certain mixture of metals, manifests itself as electricity.
Hence he concludes that the physical forces are as closely corre
lated to the vital, as those of each category are to each other; the
chief distinction between their respective operations being esta
blished by the speciality of the instruments through which they
manifest themselves.
    13. Letter from Lieut. Gillies, U.S.N., to Lieut.-Col. Sabine, R.A.,
 For. Sec. R.S.
                                          U.S.N. Astronomical Expedition,
                                         Santiago de Chile, 20th Jan. 1850.
    Dear Sir,—I had the pleasure to receive your letter of Aug. 3rd
by the last monthly steamer from the north, and greatly lamented
I  could not answer it by the mail, which left Dec. 30th. Leaving the
United States on the 16th of August, want of aproper amount of <U+FB01>re
surface in the boilers of the steam-ship, caused my arrival at Chagres
only on the day (27th) when the mail for Chile left. A month was
thus unavoidably lost; for in anticipation of a passage through
without delay, all instruments, except an aneroid barometer and
thermometer, had been despatehed round Cape Horn.              With these
such observations were made, until arrival here, as their construction
permitted.    From the indications of the aneroid there is a region
extending from 200 miles to the S.S.W. of San Domingo to about
1° of north latitude on this side of the continent, where the pressure
rarely exceeds 29'85O in., nor was the barometer but once in that
whole distance as high as 29'900 in. At Panama the mean is
29'795 in. from observations at 9 A.M., 3 P.M., and 9 P.M., with a
mean diurnal fall from the <U+FB01>rst to the second hours of '08 in.         The
temperature for the same hours was 81°-0 with a range of 2°'9, and
almost constantly saturated with moisture, though rain fell no more
frequently than often occurs during the same period in the United
States. As evidence of the hygrometric condition of the atmosphere,
it was found impossible to dry clothing in my room after several days'
open exposure, and they were <U+FB01>nally exposed to the direct rays of
the sun. Leather moulds in forty-eight hours.            The light wind
experienced   was   almost constantly  from   the  northward    and west
ward during the day, and variable at night.          I think Lieut.-Col.
Emery made observations for declination and dip en route for Cali
fornia, but nothing is known to me of the results, and I must await
our return to give you data on these points.      Should nothing inter
vene to change present intentions, I contemplate making observations
at each of the <U+FB01>fteen ports where the steamer touches between Valpa
raiso and Panama.      Nothing of note occurred during our passage
to Chile.   There was time to glance at Buonaventura, Guyaquil,
Pflyi<U+FB02>i Huanchaeo (part of Truxillo), Casma, <U+FB01>ve days at Lima,

poses of the expedition, and the Uovernment              here having ucted
promptly and with most commendable liberality on all points, there
was no hesitation in sch-cting this city as iny il|lllun. You know it is
situated on a plain varying in width from twclve to forty miles, which,
commencing just north of 31$', with s slight interruption in 34-Q“,
extends to the (iulf of Oncnd in -H P. The sea range of the Cor
dilleras, from which Santiago is distant from four to <U+FB01>ve leagues,
has an elevation of 3000 to 4000 fert nbove the ocenn, whilst the
msin chain to the cnstward Varies from l(),0()0 to 17,000 or 18,000
feet, and is distant about six leagues at the base.            Interrupting
the esstern horizon ns they do, the interfcrcncc with observations
on the planet "1.-nus in the morning twilight rcndercd so near an
approach objectionable;      but there was no locality in the vicinity of
s proper residence free from this obstacle, and no place in the in
terior offering the facilities p0i.-o,58t'\l by Santiago. If l mistake not,
in one of my former letters I stated that the const wus impracticable,
on nccount of very frequent fog and mist; and this was the opinion
of the most observant residents here. There were two positions
offered for our use by the (iovernment,—a hill (Santa Lucia) in the
eastern pert of the city, with such rooms in the Castle, about half
way up, as might be needed, and the plnin in the soutbern suburbs.
The former has sn clcvatiou of some 200 fcct, whilst the latter is
half submerged during the rainy season, and almost inaccessible to
pedestrians. Many reasons inclined me to prefer Santa Lucia, could
its rocky crest be leveled, and this the Government at once under
took.
    On the 9th of November, the ship having reached Valparaiso a few
days sfter me, all the instruments nearly, together with the observa
tories, were deposited in the Castle, distant 100 miles from the ocean,
having been conveyed in huge carts of the country drawn by <U+FB01>ve
yokes of oxen.     (Jhronometers, magneticnl, meteorological, and all
delicate  instruments,  were suspended by hide cords inside the carts,
so as to swing free of each other, and ever thing came safely except
three black bulb-thermometers, which Mi-. Barrow had packed In
sand.    On opening the outer case (for the <U+FB01>rst time) the sand was
found to have <U+FB01>ltered through crevices in the packing-box, leaving
the bulbs JVl'tolly unsupported.         The fourth one was accidentally
broken s few days after, and we are now with only one spirit ther
mometer for radiation, one of them having been, unfortunately,
broken also. Our larger equatoreal was placed on its pier on the
6th of December, and on the 10th commenced the series of observa
tions on Mars; since which time I have made more than 1100
differential measures. The superb meridian circle, made by Pistor
and Martins, arrived here only at Christmas, and as it is an instru
ment of exceedingly limited adjustment, it has only been adjusted
to the meridian a day or two.           Instability of our <U+FB02>oor rendering

                                    992
  additional support necessary for the joists when the extraordinary
  weight of the instrument is transferred to the receiving carriage,
  has rendered impracticable the adjustment of our microscopes thus
  far.   But I hope to have the instrument fully at work by the 25th,
 stays having been driven in beneath the joists.     A more exquisitely
 <U+FB01>nished instrument was never turned out of a workshop.
     Immediately after our location, meteorological observations were
 commenced, embracing eight periods of the day, at equal intervals,
 viz. at 3, 6, 9, 12 A.M. and P.M. Nothing is so striking to the
 stranger as the great dryness of the atmosphere and its almost perfect
 transparency, the ordinary difference of' the dry and wet thermome
 ters being above 12°, and, except over the Cordilleras to the N.E.,
 clouds being rarely seen at this season of the year.    Our barometer
 is of Mr. Hassler's form of construction, with a capacity above 0'6 in.
 Taking from the volume containing astronomical observations (no
 other being at hand), the means between 9 P.M. and meridian for
 the last twenty-one days of December, they are 28126 in. ; air 70°'3 ;
 wet 5'7°'8; and <U+FB02>uctuations during the same period respectively,
 28947 in. to 28023 in.; 74°'4' to 65°'6; 6l°'9 to 51°'3. From
 10 A.M. till noon is the warmest period of the day; then a breeze
 sets in from S.W., which moderates the <U+FB01>erceness of the sun’s rays
until he sets. Our vicinity to the snow on the Cordilleras, N.E. from
the city, renders night always pleasant, and indeed the temperature
is never oppressive when not exposed to the direct action of the sun.
    On unpacking the magnetical instruments, no top could be found
for one set of the legs sent by Mr. Jones, and as it would be
next to impossible to have a triangle made for securing them to
gether, much time is unavoidably lost. One of the 3'67 in. mag
nets, too, is so greatly oxidized, I shall not use it until I hear from
you again ; and as there are no tidings of the altitude and azimuth
instrument, the declinometer also must remain in its case. The hill
on which the observatories have been erected being very decidedly
polar, our observations for the horizontal force and dip have been
made in a vineyard a few hundred yards to the eastward, and where
we shall continue to make them for the present. Our own residence
would have been greatly preferable; butthe two portions being only
about 16 feet square each, and having windows on at least two
sides protected by stout bars of iron, it has been deemed objection
able. When the winter comes on it is probable a small abode house
will be put up for them; at present we use them in the open air.
The periods assigned for observation are, the lst, 11th, and term
day of each month, commencing about 11 A-M. and ending about
4 P.M. This is all which my force will permit me to do; but if
we can obtain means to mount the other tripod stand, so as to avoid
loss of time in the vibration experiments, we shall have abundant
leisure for the vertical and total forces as you suggest. Were the
brass rings for determining the magnetic moments of the de<U+FB02>ecting

   Since November lst we have experienced <U+FB01>ve or six tremblings
of the earth, principally during the <U+FB01>rst three wcclu of that month.
To my great mortitication, the sciunoineter made no record either
time, for this terrible visitant is of earnest interest to every one in
Chile, and the object of the instrument, though greatly perverted,
was a subject of much talk among the people of Santiago.          The in
verted pendulum has been made as sensitive as possible, and the
recording pencil only pressed against the segment in the sliglitwt
manner to secure a mark—yct it has left no sign. True, the sllorks
were of no great violence, though strong enough to crcak the ceil
ings overhcnd, and on one occasion to start every one into the
street.   Of the last I was warned by the rumbling noisc,sn<U+FB02>i(-iently
long, to take out my wateh and note the periods and intervals of
its two shocks.    To the best of our estimation the motion of the
earth unke is invariably from the westward. and more frequently
from tlV.S.\\'. than any other direction since .\'ovember.       One only
of the phaenomena, since our arrival, proved of serious injury;
viz. that of November l8th, which kept the earth in motion in the
vicinity of (Yoquimbo for the space of 84- seconds. Very slight
injury was sustained by the houses from this cause; but it was
immediately followed by n wave l6 feet above high-water mark,
overwhelming the buildings and smelting furnaces on the shores of
the bay. ln Santiago I was roused from sound sleep (6" lO"' .\..\|.)
by the rocking of my bed and creaking of the timbers overhead, to
<U+FB01>nd all the inmates of the hotel <U+FB02>ying to the streets. At Coquimbo
shocks were repeatedly felt on the ltith. l8th, 19th and 20th, scve
ral each day. Dr. Lamont suggested an instrument to be formed
of three upright cylinders wrapped with photographic paper and
moved by clockwork; three beams suspended horizontally by two
parallel threads each and a lamp in the centre.         The subject was
talked over with Prof. Henry prior to leaving the United States;
and as I have since written him respecting the instrument here, it is
greatly hoped one will be made after Dr. Lumont's suggestion and
sent out to us.
   I trust to hear from you as often as your leisure will permit, and
you may feel assured your suggestions will always be gratefully rc
ceived and carefully followed.

  P.S. 28th.-The most violent earthquake felt occurred on the
night of the 20th, just before midnight.      As usual, there were two
shocks; noise with the <U+FB01>rst or preceding           and the second most

Standing  erect, the direction from   which   the  noise   and wave came
was undoubtedly    near W.S.W.,   and  this position  was  assumed at the
earliest symptom, that these facts might be more easily appreciated.

Series.   On the possible relation of Gravity to Electricity.      By
Michael Faraday, Esq., D.C.L., F.R.S. &o.
   Under the full persuasion that all the forces of nature are mu
tually dependent, and often,      not always, convertible more or less
                                      if
into each other, the author endeavoured to connect gravity and
magnetic or electric action together by experimental results, and
though the conclusions were, when cleared from all error, of     nega            a
      nature, he still thinks that the principle followed and the ex
tive
penments themselves deserve to be recorded. Considering that some
condition
           of the results produced by gravity ought to present itself,
having    a         to the dual or antithetical character of the mag
           relation
 netic or electnc forces,     seemed to the author that the approxi
                                 it

                                    905
mation of two gravitating bodies ton ards each other, and their separa
tion, were the only points which offered this kind of coincidence;
and therefore. using the earth as one gravitating body, he employed
a cylinder of metal, glass, resins, or other substances, as the other, and
endeavoured to ascertain when the latter was allowed to fall, being
surrounded by a helix of wire, whether any clcctric current was
generated.      Sometimes the cylinder was allowed to fall through the
helix; at other limes with thc helix; and occasionally the helix was
made the falling body. But when the various sources of error which
sprung up were gradually removed, no traces ofclectric action re
mained which could be referred to the power of gravity.
   In order to obtaiu a greater effect, an aparatus was employed (being
nearly that used in the '.1$nl Series of these Researches) by which
the effect of raising a body from the earth could be combined with
that of a falling body by the <U+FB01>t use of commutators (if any action at
all were produced).      The apparatus was very good, and gave ex
ceedingly delicate results, as was shown by other consequences of
its action ; but in respect of gravity it produced no effect whatever.
Notwithstanding     his failure in obtaining any experimental relation
between gravity and magnetic or electric force, the author still ex
presses his conviction that there is a relation, and his hopes that it
may be hereafter practically demonstrated.

        “ Experimental Researches in Electricity." Twenty-<U+FB01>fth Series.
On the Magnetic and Diamagnetic Condition of Bodies. By Michael
Faraday, Esq., D.C.L., F.R.S. &c. Received September 9, I850.
     As the author could <U+FB01>nd no polarity in diamagnetic bodies when
under magnetic in<U+FB02>uence (a result described in the '23rd Series of
these Researches),    he endeavoured to discover some other physical
condition of them, and of magnetic bodies, by which he might obtain
an insight into their respective natures, aml establish the true place of
the magnetic zero; and considering the power with which a magnetic
body moves, or tends to move, from weaker to stronger placesof action,
and that ofa diamagnetic body to pass from stronger to weaker places
of action, he hoped to obtain some results of condensation with the
<U+FB01>rst class, and ofexpansion with the secoiul,when they were subjected
to very strong magnetic action; the respective bodies being selected
from the class of gaseous substances, in which change of volume
can be easily produced and measured.         In the <U+FB01>rst place, therefore,
a ray of light was passed over the surface of powerful magnetic poles
surrounded by different gases, and the place of its source carefully
examined by telescopes, micrometers, and other means, to ascertain
whether the layer of air in contact with the poles was affected in its
refracting force; but though the experiment was made in oxygen,
nitrogen, and other gases, not the slightest effect was visible.
    llesigning this process, therefore, two air-tight chambers were
made, in which the magnetic poles formed the chief part of the
internal surface of the chamber.      The one was formed by bringing
the <U+FB02>at ends of the two poles to within -5'5th of an inch of each
other, with a frame all round to form the sides; and the other by
                                                              4*

cutting away the central parts of an iron cylinder so as to give it the
form of an hour-glass, and then enclosing that part by an air-tight
copper tube. Cocks were attached to these chambers for the intro
duction and removal of gases, and for the application of gauges, which
were able to indicate a change of volume equal to the           igath
part of the contents of the chamber.         When any given gas was in
troduced into the chamber, and the latter then placed between the
 poles of the electro-magnet, any possible alteration of volume would
be shown by the gauge as soon as the magnet was rendered active;
but whatever gas was employed, or whatever power of magnet used,
 not the slightest change was produced.
     Thinking it possible that there might be expansion in one di
 rection and contraction in another, the gases were then examined as
 to the production of any currents in them, but no traces of such
 appeared.
     From these results, the conclusion was arrived at by the author,
 that the motions of magnetic and diamagnetic bodies in each other
 do not appear to resemble those of attraction or repulsion of the ordi
 nary kind, but to be of a di['l'erential action, dependent perhaps upon
 the manner in which the lines of magnetic force were affected in
 passing from one to the other during their course from pole to pole;
 the differential action being in ordinary cases between the body
 experimented with and the medium surrounding it and the poles.
 A method of showing this action with the gases is described, in
 which delicate soap-bubbles are made to contain a given gas, and
 these, when held in the magnetic <U+FB01>eld, approach, or are driven further
 off, according as they contain substances, magnetic or diamagnetic,
 in relation to air. Oxygen passes inwards or tends towards the mag
 netic axis, con<U+FB01>rming the results formerly described by the author in
 his account of his investigations of <U+FB02>ame and gases.
     Perceiving that if two like bubbles were set on opposite sides
 of a magnetic core or keeper cut into the shape of an hour
 glass, they would compensate each other, both for their own dia
 magnetic matter and for the air which they would displace; and
 that only the contents of the bulbs would be virtually in a di<U+FB02>'er
  ential relation to each other, the author passed from bubbles of
 soapy water to others of glass; and then constructed :1 differential
 torsion balance to which these could be attached, of the following
 nature :—A horizontal lever was suspended by cocoon silk, and at
  right angles, at the end of one arm, was attached a horizontal cross
 bar, on which, at about 1% inch apart, and equidistant from the
 horizontal lever, were suspended the glass bubbles; and then the
 whole being adjusted so that one bubble should be on one side of
  the iron core and the other on the other side, any di<U+FB02>erence in their
  tendency toset inwards or outwards from the axial line caused them to
 take up their places of rest at different distances from the magnetic
  axis; and the power necessary to bring them to an equidistant position
  became a measure of their relative magnetic or diamagnetic force.
     In the <U+FB01>rst place, different gases were tried against each other, and
 when oxygen was one of them it went inwards, driving
                                                              every other

                                     U97
  outwards.    The other gust-e-, “hen compared together, gave ncurly
  equal results, and require a more delicate and <U+FB01>nished balance to
  measure and determine the amount of their respective forces.
     The author now conceived that he had attained to the long-sought
  power of examining gaseous bodies in relation to the effects of heat
  and the effects of expansion in-pantely; and proceeded to an investi
  gation of the latter point. For this purpose he prepared glass bubbles
  containing u full atmosphere, or half an atmosphere, or any other
  proportion of u given gm ; having thus the power of diluting it
  without the addition of any other body.       The ctli-ct was most stri
  king. When nitrogen and oxygvn bl|llld\'s were put into the balance,
  each at one atmoqrlirrc. the oxygen drove the nitrogen out power
  fully. \Vhcn the oxygrn bubble' was replaced by olhrr bubbles
 containing less oxygen. the teinlelacy inwulds of the oxygen was h-ss
 powerful ; and when what may be calh-d an oxygen vacuum (being
 a bulb <U+FB01>lled with oxygi-n, cxliansted, and thcu In-run-lically
                                                                  senlul)
 was put up, it simply balanced the nitrogen bnbbh-.           Oxygen ut
 half an atmosphere was less magnetic than that at one atmosphere,
 but more magnetic than other oxygen at one-third of an at|no.-plu-re;
 and that at one-third surpassed thc vacuum.         In fact. the bubble
 with its contents was more magnetic in proportion to the oxygen it
 contained.    On the other hand, nitrogen showed no di<U+FB02>i-rcncc of this
 kind; whether n bubble contained that gns morc or less condensed, its
 power was the same. ()tht-r guscs (vxccpting olctiunt and cyanogen)
 seemed in this <U+FB01>rst rough apparatus to be in the same condition.
 The air-pump vacuums of all the gases were alike, including that
 of oxygen.
    Hence the author decides upon the place for zero, and concludes
that simple space presents that case.        When matter is added to
space it carries its own properly with it there, adding either magnetic
or dinmngnetic force to the space so occupied in proportion to the
quantity of matter employed; and now thinking that the point of
zero is well determined, he concludes to use the word magnetic as a
general term, and distinguishes the two chimes of magnetic bodies
into paramagnetic and diamagnetic substances.
    There is no other gas like oxygen: its paramagnetic character is
very high.     A solution of protosulphate of iron in distilled water
was prepared, of which a certain bulk in a glass bubble was of the
same paramagnetic force as an equal volume of oxygen ; the solution
was then of such strength as to contain of crystallized protosulphate
of iron seventeen times the weight of the oxygen which could coun
terbalance it. In another case, a glass bubble, containing one-third
of a cubic inch of oxygen, was opposed to a corresponding bubble
having within only an oxygen vacuum.          As soon as the magnetic
power was on, the oxygen passed inwards, and it required a force
equal to one-tenth of a grain to hold it out at the equidistant position.
    The author then refers generally to the air as a paramagnetic
medium, because of the oxygen it contains, and in the next, or
Twenty-sixth Series of Researches, he proposes to enter, after some
preliminary inquiries, into the great subjectof atmospheric magnetism.

    3. “ Experimental Researches in Electricity."         Twenty-sixth Se
ries.   On  Magnetic   Conducting    Power   and Atmospheric   Magnetism.
By Michael Faraday, Esq.,       D.C.L.,   F.R.S.  &c.    Received  October
9, 1850.
    The remarkable results respecting oxygen and nitrogen described
in the last Series, and the absence of any change of volume under
strong magnetic action, led the author to apply for a time the idea
of conducting power to the magnetic phenomena there described,
meaning by that phrase the capability which bodies possess of affect
ing the transmission of the magnetic force without any reference to
the process by which that transmission is effected; and assuming
that two bodies are at the same time in the magnetic <U+FB01>eld, and that
 one displaces the other, he considers the result as a differential effect
 of their difference in conducting power.
   If  a free portion of space be considered with lines of equal mag
 netic force passing across  it,  they will be straight and parallel lines.
 If sphere of paramagnetic matter be placed in such space, they
   a                                                        a
will gather upon and in the sphere, being no longer parallel in their
 course, nor of equal intensity in every part; or     if   a sphere of dia
 magnetic matter replace the former sphere, the lln8s of force will
 open out where the sphere is, being again no longer parallel in direc
 tion nor uniform in force. When the <U+FB01>eld of magnetic force      is formed
 between the opposite <U+FB02>at ends of two large magnetic poles, then
 these are affected,and the globes also, and there are mutual actions;
 a paramagnetic body,   if a   little elongated, points axially and tends
 to go to the iron walls of the <U+FB01>eld, whilst      a    similar diamagnetic
 body points equatorially, and tends to go to the middle of the <U+FB01>eld.
 Paramagnetic bodies repel each other, and so also do diamagnetic
 bodies; but one of each class being taken, they attract one another.
     The convergence of the lines of force upon the opposite sides of
 the paramagnetic sphere, and the corresponding divergence of them
 on the opposite sides of the diamagnetic sphere, the author expresses
 by the term conduction polarity. rThis polarity he carefully di
 stinguishes from that which depends upon the reversion of the di
 rection of the power; the latter he considers as      a    property of the
 particles of magnetic matter; the former as dependent rather upon
 the action of the mass: the latter   is   an absolute inversion of the di
  rection ofthe power, the former only     a  divergence or de<U+FB02>ection of it.
     Applying the idea of conduction to magnecrystallic bodies, he
  concluded that the magnecrystallic axis would coincide with the
  direction of better conduction, and thence concluded, that,         if   a
  symmetric crystal of bismuth were carefully examined in different
  directions,
            it   would be found to be less diamagnetic when its magne
  crystallic  axis was perpendicular to the axis of magnetic force of the
  <U+FB01>eld in which  it  was to be submitted to experiment, than when          it
  was parallel to the magnetic axis.         By means of the differential
  torsion balance described in the former paper, he was able to make
  the trial, and found the results were as anticipated. With calcareous
  spar and his present balance he was not able to establish any dif
  ference, but concludes that  it   will prove most diamagnetic when the

                                     999
optic   nlis of   the crystal   and the magnetic axis   of the <U+FB01>eld are
plrnllel.
   Advancing to the consideration of atmospheric magnetism, the
author tilst refens to the earth as a source of magnetic power from
which cmonnte lines of magnetic forcc passing into space accord
ing to n particular but rccngnilc\l di.~i.rlbUlll)n, and in obedience
to the general laws which govern the dl‘lrll|Uli0|l of power about n
given irregular magnet. In pure space the mngm-tie power is con
sidered as traimniued onwards with n certain degree of facility
which is constant, but may be increased or diminished by the     rescncc
of paramagnetic or dinmagnetic matter within that    space. Tlic atmo
sphere is n portion of such uniller, nnd can ntll-ct the magnetic lirnics
which paw from the earth into space, nnd affects them ditlcreiitly
according lo variations which continually occur in it under natural
circumstances.     Four-iiflhs nearly by volume of the nir is nitrogen,
 which is n gas that neither under any differcncc of temperature or
of expansion shows any alteration in its power of affecting the trails
 ferencc of the magnetic force; nlicthicr ndded to s nice therefore in
one state or another, or when undergoing changes oi a corresponding
 kind by nnturnl cause, it has no inth.ince on the magnetic force.
 The perfect identity in magnetic action of hot and cold nitrogen,
 the author prove.-i by new and delicate experiments. Oxygen forms
 the remaining tifth of the ul|i|o~pliere.    its grcnt magnetic changes
 by expansion have been dl.'.\C|dbl'tl in the Twenty-tifth Series. Those
produced by differcnce of temperature were described in the Philo
sophical Magnziiic for 181-T, but are now resumed with more cnrc,
nnd found to belong to it alone, nnd not to nitrogen or to carbonic
acid: as its temperature is raised its paramagnetic force diminishes,
 being resumed as the temperuturc fulls again.        Thcsc properties it
carries into the atmosphcre, so that the latter is in reulily a mag
netic medium cver varying, from the inlluence of natural circum
staucm, in its magnetic power.        if   n mass of the air he cooled it
becomes more paramagnetic. ifhenti:d it becomes h ss paramagnetic
(or diamagnetic), as compared with the air in n mean or normal
condition.
    The effcct of thc approach and retreat of the sun in his daily
course is to produce such variations of changes in the temperature
and expansion of the atmosphere as to in<U+FB02>uence the lines of force
emanating from the earth, both in their direction and intensity; and
the manner in which this in<U+FB02>uence will be developed is by means of
<U+FB01>gures and descriptions stated by the author in relation to the
annual and daily variation, and the irregular perturbations of the
magnetic force, which he thinks are consequences of it. He then
applies the result of the magnetic observations at Hobarton as n
test of the probable truth of the liypothcsis, and considers that it
n<U+FB02>brds strong con<U+FB01>rmation.       The upper or north end of the needle
there goes west until about twenty-one o'clock, whilst the dip       iii
creases; the dip still increasing until noon, the upper cud returns
rapidly eastward, as the sun passes by, until two o'clock, the dip then
decreasing; after which the needle goes west again, following the

                                       1000
sun. On examining the results at Toronto, corresponding effects
were found to occur, when the upper or south end of the needle was
considered, and therefore in accordance with the hypothesis.              The
examination of the observations made at Greenwich, Washington,
Lake Athabasca, Fort Simpson, and St. Petersburgh, are considered
as further adding con<U+FB01>rmation.          By the aid of these observations the
author restates.    his principles  more     minutely, endeavouring to indi
cate what    difference,  changes    in   the  inclination, declination, place
of the sun,   land,  and sea,   &c.  will   produce.
   Though the sun is the cause of those changes in the atmosphere
which affect the lines of force of the earth, he is not assumed as the
centre of action as regards those lines; that is considered to exist
somewhere in the atmosphere.            It appears to be in the upper re
gions and not on the      surface   of   the earth, because it increases the
dip of places north      and  south   of   the tropics which have a certain
amount of    inclination,  as at Hobarton and Toronto, both in summer
and winter, but it diminishes the dip at places which are within the
tropics, and with little inclination, as St. Helena.        By other kinds of
observations, it appears to be      in  advance of the sun. All the pheno
mena indicate that the sun does not act directly on the needles at
different places, but mediately through its effect on the atmosphere.
   The author then considers the possible cause of numerous irregu
lar variations, such as those that are shown by the photographic pro
cesses of record at Greenwich and Toronto. The varying pressure of
the atmosphere, the occurrence of winds and large currents of air, of
rain and snow, of the passage of those masses of warm and cold air
which the meteorologist recognizes in the atmosphere, of the aurora
borealis, he considers may all produce changes in the lines of mag
netic force, and becmne more or less sensible in the records of
irregular variations. The author thinks it very possible that masses
of air at different temperatures may be moved by the magnetic force
of the earth, according to the principles of di<U+FB02>erential action made
manifest in the experiments on warm and cold oxygen, in which
case material as well as potential magnetic storms may exist.              He
concludes his paper by calling attention to the wonderful constitu
tion of oxygen in its magnetical and electrical, as well as its chemical
relations, to the o<U+FB02>ices it has to perform as part of the atmosphere.

   4-.    Experimental Researches in Electricity." Atmospheric Mag
netism, continued.       Twenty-seventh Series.         By Michael Faraday,
Esq., D.C.L., F.R.S. &c.         Received November 19, 1850.
   In order to obtain an experimental representative of the action of
the atmosphere when heated above or cooled below the average
temperature, the author employed a ring helix of covered copper
wire, through which an electric current was passed.             The helix was
about one inch and a half in diameter, and having the well-known
system of magnetic forces, was placed with its magnetic axis parallel
to a
       free needle: when its position was such that a needle within
the nng would point with the north end downward, then the effect in
de<U+FB02>ecting the surrounding lines of force of the earth was considered

                                     lO()l
as like that of a relativuly paramagnetic mass of air; and when its
position was rcverscd, its action was representative of that of s heated
or relatively dismagnc.-tic mass of air. Bringing this helix into the
vicinity of small magnetic necdlcs, suspended either freely, or so as
to show declination or inclination, the planes of action or indif.
fercnce as regards the power of de<U+FB02>ccting the lincs of force and the
needle were observed.         When thc ncedlc can move only in one
plane, there are four quadrants, formed (in the case of the de
clination ncedlc) by the intersection of the planes of the magnetic
equator and meridian.        \\'hcn in thcsc planes there is no de<U+FB02>ection
at the needle, but when in the quadrants there                 is,
                                                           and in opposite
directions in the Iiciglilmiiriiig quadrants.
    As the lines of force are llela| in and by the earth, so thcse experi
ments were repeated with         nncrdlc in near vicinity to magnet, and
                                                                     a
the differcnrc of c<U+FB02>i-ct   is pointed out: then the cxtent to which these
results arc applicable to those of the curth         considered, and their
                                                     is
utility in guiding the inquircr.
    The cffl'ct of heated air having been considered in the last paper,
 that of cold iiir
                 is   now taken up; and after considering its action in
 causing a  contraction or drawing together of the terrestrial lines of
 magnetic force. according to the principles of conduction before
 enunciated, the author considers generally where the regions of cold
 which travel round the earth every twenty-four hours will be in
 the northern and southern hemispheres, and how they will grow up
 and diminish in extent and importance as the sun moves north and
 south during the            After which he applies these considerations,
 and the results 0 ‘year.
                      the experiments with the ring helix, to the expli
 cation of the changes of the needle as they are given               by
                                                               observations
 at St. Petersburgh, Greenwich, llobarton, Toronto, Cape of Good
 Hope, St. Helena and Singapore.           In doing this, he endeavours to
 explain  the   night   action,  the  early  morning effect, the contrary
 course of the needle for the same hours in different months, the dif
 ference of local time dependent on the distribution of land and
 water, the cumulative effect of preceding months, and the con
 tinual effect, especially in the tropical regions, of the higher tempe
 rature of the northern hemisphere above that of the south.           ln all
 these points the author sees such an agreement between the natural
 results and those which are suggested         the assumed physical cause
                                              by
 of the magnetic variations, as to give im growing con<U+FB01>dence in

     Gt.zxrLzut-:.\,
Ir    now becomes my duty, according to custom, to give n slight
sketeh of the uventu of the yeur which nppear to be of nnltsl. interest
to us as a scientitic body; but <U+FB01>rst pl'rmit me to expreas my deep
sense of obligation to your ('ouncil. 'l'lu-y have npplied thcmselvel
i0 unremittingly to the disrlnn-go of the large amount of business
which has devolved upon them, and have exzunincd can-h question
so thoroughly,       that there bus been little room for ditii-rcuce of
opinion, and tlicrefore my duties have been light, and free from
anxiety.
     Permit me also to return thanks to the ilistingtiislictl men, Fellows
 of this Society, who, culled in by the Council to uid them in wield
 ing the new powers which they derive under the Govtrmncnt Grant,
 have rendered such important servit'cs.
      You are no doubt uwnrc that the <U+FB01>rst step taken by your Council
 in rerer\'Iio|! to the (iovt~rn|u\'nt (irnut, was to nppoint a ('om|nittec,
 connp|uwd of the Council and nu equal numlu-r of other Fellows, to
 make suitable regulations, and decide on tho applications for aid
  in carrying out :.~ti.enllilo ohjccts.     l am lltro you will concur with
  me in thinking that your Council, in undertaking new and heavy
  responsibilities, whcrc a great i-xprri|ncnt was about to be tried, and
  where a false step at the beginning might have led to so much mis
  chief, did wisely in seeking. in the vnrird talents and ncquiremcnts
  of a large Colmnittec, a guarantee against any serious crror.
      I believe there were some not without their doubts as to the
  eventual success of the experiment, seeing that it had not always
  been an easy matter to apply the small fund previou.-ly available for
  similar objects: there were even some, I believe, who apprehended
  that abuses might spring up injurious to the Society.               To me,I
  may perhaps      be  permitted   to say,  tln-so  doubts  and  apprehensions
   did not appear to bo well-founded: it is but a short time since you
   conferred a .\ledal on .\l. llcgnault for very able and elaborate re
   searches, carried on at the expense of the French Government; if
   the French Government had not supplied the means, the experi
   ments could not have been made.               You are about to confer the
   Copley Medal       on the   distinguished    astronomer,  Professor Hansen,
   for his discoveries in Physical Astronomy; and it is a remarkable
   fact, that hc has been for some time engaged in the construction of
   new lunar tables, the moon's place being so far in error as to pro
   duce serious practical inconveniences: this work was commenced in
   time of peace with funds provided by his own Government, but is
   now about to be completed \I ith funds supplied to him by our Go
   vernment.      Here were two examples strikingly brought before us
   by our own recent proceedings, illustrating the position, that while
   the man of science supplies the mind, others often must supply the
   hands.     There were many other similar examples; but, moreover,
   the dpriori reasoning appeared to me to be conclusive; for if we
   except pure geometry, there seemed to be no other science where

                                      1004
  there were not often constants to be determined at an expense of
  time and labour, which it would be a lavish waste to require from
  men of genius actually engaged in prosecuting original discovery.
  There was, I may add, in addition, the experience of the British
  Association and of foreign Governments.         That there were men
  amongst   us able and   willing to  enter the many  tempting <U+FB01>elds of
  scienti<U+FB01>c inquiry no one could doubt,—men ready to labour for us
  assiduously, provided that in doing so they were not called upon
  to make too great a sacri<U+FB01>ce. As to abuses, it was evident that the
  Committee would frame regulations so as not only to make abuse
  impossible, but to remove all reasonable grounds even for the sus
  picion of abuse.
     Soon after their appointment the Committee laid down certain
  rules and certain general principles for their guidance, which, al
  though not irrevocably binding, nevertheless stand as precedents
  not lightly to be disregarded.    The rule, that in every case there
 should be a Committee of three Fellows, charged with the responsi
 bility of seeing that the intentions of the Council in making the
 grant were strictly carried out, is in my opinion of great import
 ance. Without such a rule it is probable that many of our ablest
 men, from a feeling of delicacy, coupled with an apprehension of a
 vague, inde<U+FB01>nite responsibility, would hesitate to accept assistance.
 I will not detain you by entering into any further particulars, as all
 the proceedings are recorded on the Minutes of Council, to which
 you have access; but I am happy to be able to say, that although
 the season was far advanced before the intentions of the Council seem
 to have been generally understood, still there were many applica
 tions from men of eminence engaged in carrying out important ob
jects, and even on this the <U+FB01>rst occasion there was no dif<U+FB01>culty in
 making an effective appropriation of the grant.
    Looking to the future, I think we may venture to anticipate that
 Parliament will annually place a similar sum at our disposal, so long
 as we can usefully employ it; and that while we shall thus be enabled
to advance science in certain directions where otherwise we could
have effected but little, we shall remain as free to exercise our own
unbiassed judgements, and as perfectly independent as at any pre
vious period of our history.
    In this age of progress, when each month has its new facts, it
would be vain to take a general survey of the discoveries of the year
with a view of pointing out a certain number as the most important:
experience has shown that time often affords the only real test of
comparative value, as some discoveries apparently the most pro
mising have in the end proved utterly barren; while others, at <U+FB01>rst
sight of little moment, have led to the most brilliant results.      It
would be impossible, however, to look through the scienti<U+FB01>c publi
cations of the year, however cursorily, without perceiving that much
had been done. Our continental neighbours have been as energetic
and as successful as usual; and     I am sure you have been happy to
observe, that in the United States, in the midst of the business and
““'°"8!'°$BiI1g pursuits of a new country, science is engaging in

                                      1005
creased attention; many very able men are springing up, snd an
association for the advsncement of science has been formed and is
well supported.        Several observatories, furnished with the best in
struments, principally from the manufactories ofcontinentul Europe,
have been established.         An astronomical expedition has been sent
to the southern hemisphere, by authority of the federal government,
under the command of Lieut. Gillies, principally for the lpurposc of
making observations, which, used in conjunction with others in the
northern hemisphere, may determine more accurately the parallax
of the sun and the dimensions of the solar system. No observations
have yet been received from the expedition, but it is known that an
observsto       has been established for its use at Santiago.
   Much 30 has been done by the labour of private persons: an
astronomicaljournal of great merit has been established; and seve
ral of the investigations published in it. as, for instance, on the V910.
city of the galvanic current, on the elements of Neptune, and on
the wonderful comet of I81-3, will probably be considered as
standards.
   One of these deserves especial mention.           It is known that Besscl's
examination of the places of Sirius and Procyon for many years
psst led him to the conclusion that these stars are subject to the
action of some unknown force, and he suggested the attraction of
invisible companions;         now lately M. Qchubert has examined, in
the same wsy, the movements of Spica, and has come to the conclu
sion that it moves in an apparently small orbit, with a periodic time
of forty years. Such conclusions, it is unnecessary to observe, are
extremely doubtful, but the inquiries which have led to them are
                                                                r
deserving of our best attention.                                              '
    In the methods of observing, a step has also been taken by the
astronomers of the United States which deserves particular notice.
In a country in which the use of the electric telegraph is so exten
sively developcd, it was natural that the application of this mode of
instantaneous communication, to the determination of terrestrial
longitudes, should soon suggest itself; indeed the principle had been
suggested by Mr. Wheatstone as far back as 1840'; and it was
then an easy step to make the galvanic wire an instrument for trans
mitting, not the comparison of the clock, but the actual observation
of the transits over every individual wire of the transit telescope.
For this purpose it was necessary in aseries of stations to place only
one moderately good clock, to be used in the following manner. An
endless <U+FB01>llet of paper being carried by independent mechanism, under
a style, which is pressed upon it by the action of a galvanic magnet,
that derives its force from a wire passing through all the stations,
and animated by a battery in any part; if the clock be so connected
with the circuit that at every vibration of the pendulum the circuit
is interrupted, the trace made by the style upon the paper <U+FB01>llet will
be interrupted at every second.         Now if at each of the observing
stations    the wire   be curried through such an apparatus that the cir

 cuit can at any instant be broken by a touch of the observer, it
 will be in his power, by a mere movement of his <U+FB01>nger when the
 object passes each wire of the transit telescope, to exhibit in the
impressed trace on the <U+FB01>llet a series of interruptions, peculiar to the
 observation, mingled in their proper places with the series of in
terruptions produced by the clock.            As this can be done at each
 station without impeding the similar operations at the other stations,
 it is evident that several series of strictly comparable observations
 may be recorded on the same <U+FB01>llet of paper; one wire only being
 necessary, and indeed only one being applicable.           It then became a
 question whether an analogous method of recording transits might
 not be available for the observations of a single observatory, without
 reference to the problem of determining terrestrial longitudes.           For
 this purpose it appeared best to reverse the relations of the clock
 and galvanic current, so that the vibration of the pendulum should
 make an impress upon a <U+FB01>llet or revolving disc.             Practically, it is
 found necessary to have another battery, another wire, another gal
vanic magnet, and another style for making the impression corre
sponding to each observed transit over a wire of the instrument 1 if
it happens that there are in the same observatory several instru
 ments where observations are to be comparable, by a proper arrange
 ment of wires all these observations may be recorded by means of
the same style.        Numerical evidence is adduced to show that the
 irregularity   of  transits  thus observed is far less than that of transits
 observed by       the  eye and ear; and there is no doubt that the
 number     of  observations     made in a given time may be very much
 greater   than  that  of  observations   made on the old system.      On the
 ot-hcr hand,   the  after-labour   of reading  off  these graphical transits,
 and converting them into numbers, will be considerable.            I  am not
aware   that   this  method    of observation  has  been used on our side of
the Atlantic, although I am able to assert that it has engaged the
attention of some of the English observers. Preparations are making
at the present time for trying it at the Royal Observatory at Green
wich.     It is proposed to record the transits taken with the new
transit circle, and those taken with the altitude and azimuth instru
ment, on the same recording surface.           Numerous experiments have
been made in America by Mitehell, Walker and others, for deter
mining with the aid of this system of record, the velocity of the
galvanic pulse through the ordinary telegraph wires.             The inquiry
however is one of peculiar di<U+FB02>iculty, and I am happy to <U+FB01>nd it is
engaging the attention of scienti<U+FB01>c men;
    Since our last meeting, the <U+FB01>rst volumes of Liebig and Kopp’s
very interesting annual report on the progress of Chemistry and the
allied sciences have issued from the press.          Full and complete as to
Chemistry, it is a very excellent index to the recent papers on phy
sical science in the periodicals, and supplies that kind of informa
tion so useful to a man, who, fully occupied with one engrossing
pursuit, is anxious to know something of what is passing around
him. Of the progress, however, of abstract mathematics it gives no
account: there, however, there has been progress also. Indeed,

                                  I007
just  as the increase of manufactures has always led to further cfforts
to pcrfcct the beautiful inncliincs. culled tools, so the progress of
physical scicncc has at all tinu-s promoted the study of abstract
mntlicmntics.     it was thus that lhc llltnnpls to solve problems rc
lating  to attraction, hest, an-l electricity, led to the discovery of thc
most remarkable properties of detiniic iiitegrals.          To the fruits
gathered from this branch of nnt\lllennatlcs by liulcr, Legendre, and
other most illustrious niialysts of past gciicrutious, our own contem
poraries, both on the continciit and in this country, have added
results of the utmost value.       Abroad, Jacobi, Cauchy, Dirichlet,
Liouville and Catalan. have not only assigned the values of de<U+FB01>nite
 integrals previously unknown, but. what is of more consequence,
 they have estabhshed in relution to them scveral thcorems of the
greatest generality and elegance.         Amongst ourselves, Mr. Ellis,
Mr. Boole. Mr. Cnyley, i\lr. Thoinson and Mr. llurgreiive, have
pursued the same track with distinguished success. \\'ithin the last
 two years the mstliematicians of (iermuny have diligently cultivated
 the study of de<U+FB01>nite integrals, determining their values, investigating
 their properties, and employing them in the summation of in<U+FB01>nite
senics.
    The theory of elliptic integrals having lately formed the subject of
an elaborate report laid beforc the British Association for the Ad
vancement of Science, I necd say little more in reference to the
cultivation of  it,than that the illustrious author of the Fundamenla
1\'ova still labours at the building up of his theory; nor docs he
want the aid of fellow-labourers who have pro<U+FB01>ted        by his teaching.
The volumes of l.iouvillc's and Crclle's journals, for the last two
years, contain nrticlcs on this subject by Guderinsn, Liouville,
Mayer and Cayley.        Matliciiinticiaiis have made some curious ap
plications of the theory of elliptic functions to the solution of pro
blems in geometry: of these, the following    is one of the most remark
nble:—lf   ii  rectilinear polygon admits of being inscribed in one
circle, and circumscribed about another, there exists an equation of
condition between the radii of the two circles, and the mutual
distance of their centres. Jacobi <U+FB01>rst pointed out the connexion
between the problem of determining this condition, and that of
dividing an elliptic function into as many equal parts as the polygon
has sides.    In n recent number of Crelle's Journal, liichelot has
published an interesting paper,      in    which he shows how to derive
the equation of condition in its rational and simplest form, from the
 formulae which relate to the division of elliptic functions.
    Geometry, both pure and analytic, has of late engaged much of
the attention of foreign innthematicians.       The general properties of
surfaces relating to their tungcnt planes and normals, to their radii
and lines of curvature, and to the shortest lines traced upon them,
 have been investigated ufrcsh by various iiiclliods; old theorems
 have been brought into forms better suited for particular applica
 tion, and many new ones have been arrived at. In the discussion of
surfaces of the second order in particular, very interesting results
 have been obtained. The di<U+FB02>iculties which attended the integration

                                         .        1008
 of the differential equation of their geodetic lines having been at
 length overcome, the properties of these curves, and also of the
 lines of curvature, have been carefully investigated by the geometers
 of ditferent countries.              Abroad, the <U+FB01>rst important steps were made
 by Jacobi, Joachim, Stahl and Liouville. Pro<U+FB01>ting by their labours,
 Mr. Michael Roberts made the remarkable discovery that the lines
 of curvature of an ellipsoid are related to its umbilics, as a central
 conic section to its foci.                  Since then, Chasles, Liouville, Qraves,
 Hart and others, have arnved at vanous theorems concermng the
 geodetic lines, and lines of curvature of surfaces of the second order.
     In the theory both of surfaces and curves considerable advances
 have been recently made by means of generhl methods of transfor
 mation.      Thus, from theorems already established, new ones are
 derived without the need of an independent demonstration.                       Mr.
 William Roberts Mr. Thomson rand Mr. Cayley have lately fur

 interesting properties of curves have been established.                     The pro

Calculus of Operations and the Theory of lmuginaries.          Two im

seems to be those which have been arrived at by Sir \\'illinm Rowan

astronomy, evidently prove the power of this Calculus as an instru

eminent men; the obituary memoirs, however, seem to me to call
for no particular remark, with one exception, that of the dl.-lln

prepared by .\l. Biot, and l am sure you will concur with me in
thinking, that in performing that duty he has conferred a great
obligation on the Royal Society and on all men of science; the
memoir will be read, uninjured by translation, just as we have re
ceived it.
       COL. SABINE,
    I have the honour of presenting to you the Copley Medal in
charge for Professor Ilansen.      lt has been awarded to him for his
discoveries in Physical Astronomy.
    To have contributed even a little to the advancement of that
science, as it exists at the present day, would have been no mean
achievement.      Hansen has done much more; his contributions arc
of a very high order. Previously to the appearance of Hansen's
memoirs, two methods had been employed in the determination of
 the planetary perturbations.    One of these, known by the name of
 the method of variation of elements, besides being exceedingly
 beautiful in theory, is peculiarly well adapted to the determination
 of the secular variations and the inequalities of long period.
 It has the disadvantage, however, that the number of elements
 whose perturbations we are thus required to calculate, is twice as
 great as that of the coordinates, the perturbations of which are the
 <U+FB01>nal objects of investigation; and also that the former perturbations
 are frequently much greater than the latter.      In order to take into
 account the square of the disturbing force, which is quite necessary
 in the present state of astronomy, we must <U+FB01>nd the change intro
 duced into the perturbation of each element of the disturbed planet,
 by the perturbations of each several element both of the disturbed
 and disturbing planets.     Consequently, unless we content ourselves
 with the selection of a few of the most important terms, the calcu
 lations become extremely long and laborious.
    In the second of the methods above alluded to, the perturbations
                                                     r
                                                             5

                                    1010
of the planet’s coordinates are found at once by the integration of
the proper differential equations.     But this method, though perhaps
preferable to the former for calculating the inequalities depending
on the <U+FB01>rst power of the disturbing force, is inapplicable, or at any
rate seems as yet not to have been applied to the calculation of those
which depend on the square and higher powers of that force, so
that it cannot be regarded as affording a complete solution of the
problem.
     In Hansen’s method, the perturbations are applied to the mean
longitude and to the logarithm of the radius vector.        The disturbed
 mean longitude, combined with invariable elements, gives the true
 longitude in the orbit, and the logarithm of the true radius vector
 is found by adding its perturbations to that value which corre
 sponds with the disturbed mean longitude and the same invariable
elements as before.      The perturbations of latitude are determined
 in a manner more analogous to the ordinary method of variation of
 elements. Thus, with respect to the longitude and radius vector,
 Hansen avoids the inconvenience of having to calculate the pertur
 bations of twice as many quantities as are <U+FB01>nally wanted, while at
  the same time his formulae take into account all powers of the
 disturbing force.
      Hansen <U+FB01>nds also that the series which expresses the perturba
  tions of the mean longitude is more convergent than that in ordinary
  use which gives the perturbations of the true longitude; and Mr.
  Adams found this to be the case in his investigation of the disturb
  ances of Uranus, the use of the perturbations of the mean longitude,
  instead of those of the true, having been attended with considerable
  advantage.
      Astronomers have long seen the convenience of applying the in
  equalities of long period to the mean longitude of the planet, and
  similar advantages, though not of so marked a character, follow from
  applying all the inequalities in the same manner.
      Only a part of Hansen's investigations respecting the perturba
   tions of bodies moving in orbits of great excentrieity and inclination
   has yet appeared.    In this part he treats of the case where the di
   stance of the disturbed body from the sun is always less than that
   of the disturbing.   This is perhaps the most important case, as it
   includes the disturbances of the minor planets and of Encke’s comet
   produced by Jupiter, and the planets exterior to it.
      An example is given of the application of the formulae to the
   disturbances of Encke's comet caused by Saturn.         In this case the
   method succeeds perfectly,    and there is no doubt of its applicability
   when the distance of the disturbed and disturbing bodies from the
   sun never become very nearly equal to each other. If these distances
   ever approach very closely to equality, or if one of them is sometimes
   greater and sometimes less than the other, the calculations become
   much more complicated.         Hansen's lunar theory, “ Fundamenta
   nova investigationis orbitae lunae," contains the most complete view
    of the principles of the method <U+FB01>rst adverted to above; but the
    numerical results of his formulae have not yet been published.

    I have now the grati<U+FB01>cation of presenting to you the ltumford
 Medal to transmit to M. Arago, whose long and brilliant career,
 as one of the greatest discovercrs of the age in Physical Optics, has
 excited the admiration of all men of science :—the discoverer of
 coloured polarization, of rotatory polarization, of the polarization of
 the sky, and of many other important facts embodied in modern
 works on Light. The Medal has been awarded to him for his ' Ex
 perimental investigations on Polarized Light,' the concluding me
 rnoirs on which were communicated to the Academy of Sciences of
 Paris during the last two years.
    The President then called upon Mr. Christie to read the biogra
 phical notices of some of the deceased Members, which he handed
 to him.
     HENRI-MARIE DUcnormr as BLAINVILLB                      was born at Arques
 in Normandy,          September 12, l777, of an ancient and respectable
                                                                     5*

 family, and received his early education at the Military School of
 Beaumont-en--Auge.      On the dissolution of this establishment at
 the Revolution, he was sent to Paris to complete his education at
 the “ Ecole du Génie, Mathématiques et Dessin," and was exempted
 from the conscription of I798 by reason of an accident in the right
 arm followed by partial anchylosis.      He accordingly remained in
 Paris, occasionally attending lectures on the Natural Sciences, and
 studying painting in the Drawing Academy of Vincent.          He had
 attained the age of twenty-seven, still undecided as to a profession,
 when, having listened to an eloquent lecture by Cuvier, at the Col
 lege of France, M. de Blainville lel't the theatre with a determina
 tion to pursue the science of Comparative Anatomy.      For this pur
 pose, he, by the advice of M. Duméril, entered himselfas a student
 in the School of Medicine; and after devoting three years to the
 usual studies, took his degree as Doctor of Medicine in 1808; the
 subject of his inaugural dissertation being founded on some experi
 ments on the in<U+FB02>uence of the eighth pair of Nerves in Respiration.
    The ardour of M. de Blainville in the pursuit of what had now
become his absorbing science, and his skill as a draughtsman, pro
 cured for him the especial attention of Baron Cuvier, who, after
employing him as a practical anatomist and artist at a salary of
2000 francs per annum, con<U+FB01>ded to him the delivery of a part of
his Course of Lectures on Zoology, at the College of France; and
he soon afterwards obtained, by a successful concours, the Chair of
Zoology and Physiology at the Faculty of Sciences, on which occa
sion he defended his well-known Thesis ' On the Natural Af<U+FB01>nities              I
of the Omit/zorh1/nc/zus parado.z'us.'                                        l

of obtaining o<U+FB02>ice in the administration of the newly-established
legitimate government, to the principles of which M. de Blainville        . A
was sincerely attached.      But he resisted the temptation, and re
mained faithful to his scienti<U+FB01>c pursuits. He took advantage of the
peace to visit the Museums of England in 1816, and made many              QL-4:).
drawings of rare Mollusca in the British Museum, and of anatomical
                                                                         _.!
specimens in that of the Royal College of Surgeons.            Several
Memoirs inserted in the Bulletin of the Philomathic Society testify
to the ardour with which he availed himself of his short sojourn in      _44._
this country; and he soon after collected and methodized his re
searches into the organization of the invertebrate animals in the
form of two extensive Articles in the ' Dictionaire d'Histoire Natu
relle,’ afterwards published as distinct works, one entitled ' Manuel
de Malacologie,’ the other Manuel d'Actinologie.' A vast number,

branches of Zoology.       He published in 1822 one volume of a
Course of Lectures ' On the Organization of Animals, or Principles       le
of Comparative Anatomy,’ a work which was never completed.
    M. de Blainville was elected a member of the Academy of Sci

and soon alter, in 1880, was appointed to the Chair of the Natural
History of the .UolIusea and Rarliata in the Jardin des Plantes, on
the retirement of Lamarck. Two years afterwards, on the lamented
demise of Baron Cuvier, M. de Blainville was nominated his suc
cessor in the Professorship of Comparative Anatomy at the Jardin
des Plantes.    This Professorship placed him at the head of the
famous Museum of Comparative Anatomy, the formation of which
had been one of the llereuleau labours of Cuvler's great career;
and M. de Blainville avniled himself of it to commence his great
work 'On thc Osteugruphy of the Vertebrate Classes,' which con
tains the most beautiful and accurate figures of the skeletons of a
large proportion of the .\luuun-ulinn Claw. 'l'weutv-tliree fasciculi
of this uork had been publi.-hed, uml .\l- de Bluiuville had corrected
the proof-sheets of the twenty-fourtli fuseieulus, 'On thc ()~t¢-ogra|-liy

his place in a railway carriage for llouen on the ls-t of May, H550;
and was found, on the arrival of the train there, in a state of upo
pleetic insensihility.  He was removed to the waiting-room; an
attempt was made to bleed him, but in vain, and he soon after ex
pired, at the age of seventy-three.
   He was elected a Foreign Member of the ltoyal Society in 1832.

éclairé, soutenu, par les entretiens journaliers de son ami Laplace, dont,
un peu plus tard, la résidence touchait la sienne.         Ce fut sous l’in
<U+FB02>uence de ces deux hommes que Gay-Lussac prit son essor.
     Ils dirigèrent d’abord son jeune talent vers ce champ de recherches
commun à la physique et a la chimie, que le génie inventif de
Dalton avait commencé à. explorer avec une activité si féconde, dans
le mémoire intitulé Experimental Essays, &c., qu’il publia en 1801 *.
C’était en effet, à cette époque, le sujet de travail qui pouvait être le
plus fructueux et le plus utile, pour <U+FB01>xer une foule de données dont
l’emploi revient sans cesse, dans les recherches expérimentales, et qui
étaient alors ignorées, ou imparfaitement établies.        Obéissant à cette
inspiration, Gay-Lussac <U+FB01>t, dans la même année, 1801, son premier
mémoire sur la dilatation des gaz et .des vapeursT; puis, sans
 s’arrêter, une foule de recherches sur le perfectionnement des ther
 momètres et des baromètres, sur la tension des vapeurs, leur mélange
 avec les gaz, l'appréciation de leur densité, l’évaporation, l’hygrome
 trie, et la mesure des effets capillaires.     Cela le conduisit jusqu’en
 1803. Une Occasion rare s’offrit alors, d’utiliser cet ensemble de con
 naissances physiques qu’il avait acquises.     Il avait été chargé de faire,
 avec un de ses amis, une ascension aérostatique, pour savoir, s’il était
 vrai que la force magnétique cesse d’agir hors du contact de la masse
 terrestre, comme on l’ avait annoncé. Ils constatèrent, qu’ au contraire,
 elle se conservait sans affaiblissement notable, dans Fespace libre,
jusqu’à 4000 mètres d’élévation. Mais leur ballon s’était trouvé trop
 faible pour les porter plus haut, tous deux ensemble.           Alors Gay
 Lussac <U+FB01>t seul une deuxième ascension, dans laquelle il s’éleva jusqu’â.
 la hauteur de 7000 mètres, la plus grande qu’aucun homme eut
 jamais atteint.     Il con<U+FB01>rma l’observation déjà faite sur la persistance
  de la force magnétique; il rapporta de ces hautes régions, de l’air,
  qui, analysé, se trouva avoir la même composition qu’à la surface de la
 terre ; et il recueillit en outre une série de déterminations importantes,
  sur le decroissement régulier des pressions, des températures, de l’hu
  midité atmosphérique, dans tout l’intervalle de hauteur qu’il avait
  parcouruI.      Ce dernier succès, venant, pour ainsi dire, couronner
  toutes ses précédentes recherches, acheva de lui donner, à très juste
  titre, la réputation d’un physicien consommé.        Effectivement, si l’on
  se reporte à l’époque de ces travaux, on ne saurait y méconnaître un
  progrès notable sur tout ce qui avait précédé.          Les opérations, les
  appareils, ont un caractère de simplicité ingénieuse, qui distingua
  toujours Gay-Lussac.        On y. remarque une intention genérale d’ex
  actitude plus grande, et des résultats relativement plus précis. Toute
  fois, du point de vue où nous pouvons envisager aujourxl'hui ces
  investigations, il est évident que le sujet en était trop complexe, pour
   être pénétré à fond par des procédés d’expérience aussi restreints.      Il
  faut y appliquer des appareils d’une conception plus générale, et
   d’un mécanisme plus sur, comme plus varié, pour embrasser l'ensem

    Il ne serait pas possible de mentionner ici tous ses mémoires.                 Ils
 se  suivent, presque sans interruption, dans les volumes des Annales ole
 C/zimie et de Physique, pendant plus de trente années.                      Partout,
jusque    dans   les plus simples      notes, on  apperçoit     ses  qualités distinc
 tives, un esprit droit, lucide, des conceptions nettes, et la fermeté de
jugement qui le retient toujours dans l’expression stricte des faits.
 On les reconnaîtrait à ces caractères, sans qu’elles fussent signées.
 Pour montrer le rang élevé où il s’est placé, comme chimiste, nous
 rappellerons seulement ceux de ses travaux qui, par leur nouveauté,
leur importance, ou les progrès ultérieurs dont ils ont été l’origine,
 nous semblent mériter le plus d’être signalés.
    Celui que nous mentionnerons d’abord, lui fut suggéré par une
 observation qui remonte presque aux débuts de sa carrière chimique.
 En 1804, M. Alexandra de Humboldt, déjà célèbre par son voyage
 aux régions équinoxiales, avait fait au jeune Gay-Lussac l’honneur
de se l’associer pour des recherches Œeudiométrie.                  Ils reconnurent
 que,  dans   la  formation   de  l’ eau, 100 parties   en volume    de gaz oxygène,
se combinent, par la combustion, avec un volume de gaz hydrogène
si proche d’être égal à 200 parties, que l’on ne pouvait pas répondre
 expérimentalement de la différence*.              La tendance de ces nombres
 vers une   limite   simple, frappa Gay-Lussac.           Il soupçonna immédiate
 ment que le rapport exact de 1 à 2 était le véritable, et que cette
simplicité pouvait bien être un fait général, analogue, pour les
volumes, à celui que Dalton avait découvert, pour les proportions de
poids suivant lesquelles les corps forment leurs combinaisons de dif
 férens ordres.       Ayant suivi silencieusement cette idée, avec persé
 vérance, dans tous les cas d’applieation qu’il put trouver, illa présenta
 comme certaine quatre ans plus tard, à la <U+FB01>n de 1808, non sans quelque
crainte de la part de ses amisj'.           Le résultat, tel qu’on peut l’énoncer
 aujourdfhui, consiste en ce que : Lorsque deux gaz se combinent, leurs
volumes ont entre euæ des rapports numériques simples ; et le volume
 du composé qu’ils forment, étant considéré à l’état de gaz, présente
 aussi un rapport simple, avec la somme des volumes des gaz qui sont
 entrés dans la combinaison.            Cette loi des volumes est devenue une
des plus utiles que l’on ait trouvées en chimie, bien qu’i1 ait fallu
quelque tems pour qu’0n en sentit la valeur.                   L’énoncé que nous
venons d’en donner, ne di<U+FB02>ère de celui de Gay-Lussac, que par une
étendue et une précision d’application, dues aux progrès du tems.
La simplicité des rapports qu’elle suppose n’existe, et ne peut évi
demment exister, qu’autant que l’on néglige les inégalités de dilatation
des gaz, qui, étant presque toujours insensibles dans les expériences
de chimie habituelles, restreignent, plutôt théoriquement que pratique
ment, son usage.         Il ne faut pas mettre à la charge de Gay-Lussac
les systèmes que l’on a voulu y rattacher, en ne tenant pas compte
de cette circonstance ; car il ne les a jamais acceptés.            Les spéculations

dans      une série de recherches chimiques, dont il s'était activement
occupé avec hi. Thénanl,                        tout le cours de cette même année
 1808.       La <U+FB01>n de la précét pendant
                                     ente, H407, venait d'être illustrée par une
grande découverte ; continuation heureuse des études patientes faites
par Ilisiuger ct Berzelius, sur le pouvoir du courant voltaique pour
désunir les élémens des corps composés.                En soumettant les effets de
cc
     pouvoir à des expériences nombmuscs et précises, les deux chimistes
Suedtiis avaient constaté la faculté générale qu'il a, non seulement de
séparer les principes des combinaisons. mais aussi de les transporter à
des pôles contraires. par exemple l'nxvzène des oxides, et des acides,
au pôle vitré ; lc prineipe complé|netitairc, au pôle résineux.                 Durant
l'année lrltlti, Davy s'était profou‘l(ïinicut trceupé de ces phénomènes
de transport.         Concevant toute leur importance, il les avait multi
          variés, et il avait fait mille efforts pour <U+FB01>xer les conditions de
pliés,
  eur accom ilissement.           ll les reprit encore l'année suivante, avec
des                  voltaiques plus                   ct il parvint ù décomposer
ainsi appareils
          a potasse et la soude.         l pmissauts,
                                             en avait extrait des substances d'ap
parence métallique, malléables, étuiuemmeut conductrices de l'élec
tricité.      D' une vue hardie et sure, il les signala d'après ces caractères,
comme deux métaux simples, qu'il nomma le potassium et le sodium.
Les deux alcalis en étaient des oxides. Pendant que le grand chimiste
Anglais ioursuivait avec ardeur les innombrables effets de ces nou
velles substances, comme ageus de décomposition des autres corps,
Gay-Lussac ct M. T hénard se jettl-rent ensemble dans cette voie, à
sa suite.        Ils découvrirent, et anuoncèreut bientôt (7 Mars, I808)
un procédé chimique, qui fournissait les nouvelles substances beaucoup
plus abondamment que les appareils v-oltaiquics.0                    Ils pûrent ainsi
étudier leurs caractères propres, et leurs actions sur les autres corps,
avec plus de facilité, de généralité, de précision.               Dans la multitude
de ses premières tentatives, Davy avait apperçu des indices évidens,
mais presque insaisissables, de la décomposition de l'acide borique,
   u'il avait seulement signalés, sans pouvoir les suivre, pressé par tant
d'autres objets. Mettant à pro<U+FB01>t les agens actifs qu'ils s'étaient pro
curés, les deux expérimentateurs Français attaquèrent cet acide, en le
chauffant avec le potassium.                Ils lui enlevèrent ainsi son oxvgèue,
isolèrent son radical, qu'ils appelèrent le bore, et le re roduiserent
aussi, par synthèsexl'          Davy obtint bientôt après des résultats pareils,
    ' lls  <U+FB01>rent arriver la potasse et la soude fondues, au contact du fer incandescent,
maintenu à une très haute température.           Voyez Recherchea Pliysico-chimiques,

    1' La première annonce de ce proiédé, et de sea résultats, fut communiquée          a
l'Institut par une note, lue, au nom de Gay-Lussae et de 'I'hénnrd,Ie 20 Juin 1808.
Elle fut imprimée immédiatement, dans le bulletin de la Société Philomatique, pour
le mois de Juillet de cette même année, page l73.         Gay- Lussac était alor' grave
ment malade d'une explosion qui avait failli l'nvengIer.      Davy annonça des tenta.
lives du même genre, mais moins avancées, dans un mémoire daté du 30 Juin, qui
est in'éré aux transactions philosophiques de l80S, voyez page 343, note.            Les
résul\ats dé<U+FB01>nitifs des deux chimistes Français ont été consignés au Moniteur, dans
les Nos. des H et l5 Novembre           I808. Ceux de Davy le furent dans sa leçon
Bakérienne, datée du I5 Décembre, qui est insérée aux transactions philosophiques
de l809 ; voyez page 75.         Voye; aussi pages 41 et 42, le passage où il reconnaît
avec une entière sincérité qu'il s'est servi du procédé (happy metliod) de Gay-Lussac
et Tbénard, pour la préparation du potassium, préférablement à l'action voltaique.

s’étant pourvu désormais de potassium parla méthode chimique, dont
il  reconnut noblement les avantages.               Pendant cette année 1808 et
les   suivantes,   les  travaux     incessans    du  savant Anglais furent, pour
Gay-Lussac       et  Thénard,    le  sujet   fécond  d’une  vive et continuelle con
currence.       Il  ne fallait pas     moins    qu’une  rivalité  aussi active, pour
mettre si vite au jour tous           les  trésors que renfermait sa découverte.
La    lutte  s’établissait,   au  pro<U+FB01>t de la science, dans les idées, comme
dans les faits.        Ainsi,   une     dissidence d’un moment s’éleva, sur la
nature des substances que Davy avait signalées.                  Les effets u’on en
obtenait                  se représenter      à peu près aussi bien, en admettant
            Îpouvaient
 qu’ elles ussent, comme 11 le croyait, des métaux simples, qui formaient
1a potasse et la soude par leur combinaisonavec                                 ou en
 supposant qu’elles fussent des hydrures de ces basesl’oxygène;     alca ines, totale
 ment dépouillées d’eau.             Cette dernière interprétation semblait se
 rattacher mieux que l’autre aux idées antérieurement admises en
 France. Sous cette in<U+FB02>uence, Gay-Lussac et Thénard l’embrassèrent
 d’abord; mais une exploration plus étendue des faits la leur <U+FB01>t en
 suite abandonner, pour revenir au sentiment de Davy, qui est aujour
 d’hui adopté universellement dans toute l’extension qu’i1 lui avait
 donnée des l’origine ; les expériences ultérieures l’ayant pleinement
 con<U+FB01>rmé*.
      Une alternative d’interprétation analogue s’offrit encore à leur
 esprit, quand eux, et Davy également, se servirent du potassium, pour
 essayer de décomposer les deux corps que l’on appelait, à cette époque,
 l’acide muriatique, et l’acide muriatique oxygéné. Mais, quoique la
              fut particulière, elle avait une importance capitale pour la
 qilicstion
 t éorie de Lavoisier, jusqu’alors universellement admise. Dans cette
 théorie, l’acide muriatique devait être le premier
                                                                   dégré
                                                                          d’oxidation
 d’un radical inconnu ; et l’acide muriatique oxygéné en était le
 deuxième.        En combinant ce second corps, à l’é-tat de gaz sec, avec
 l’hyclrogène gazeux, on reformait le premier, qui, alors, devait contenir
 de l’eau.      Or, aucun procédé, aucun agent chimique, ne réussissait
 à y faire constater la présence des deux élémens de cette eau, qu’on
 y supposait ; et l’on n’en pouvait jamais dégager qu’un seul, l’hydro
 gène. D’une autre part, on ne parvenait pas à extraire, du gaz mu
  riatique oxygéné sec, la moindre trace d’oxygène. Après une active
  concurrence de recherches expérimentales, variées des deux côtés,
  avec une égale persévérance, Gay-Lussac et Thénard apperçûrent que
 l’on pouvait éluder la di<U+FB02>iculté, en intervertisant les relations théo
  riques des deux corps ; c'est à dire, en considérant celui qu’un appelait
  oxygéné comme une substance simple, qui, par sa combinaison avec
  l’hydrogène, formait l’ autre acide-l'. Cette nouvelle vue faisait brêche
  à la théorie de Lavoisier, où l’on suppose que l'oxygène est le seul
              acidi<U+FB01>ant.     Ils se bornèrent, trop prudemment peut-être, à
  principe
   a présenter comme également compatible avec les faits ; et, retenus
  par la considération des grands changemens qu'elle nécessitait, dans
 l’ensemble de leurs rapports, jusqu’ alors admis, ils continuèrent d’ em

 nuèrent à s’occuper de ce sujet, pendant 1’année suivante, avec une
 égale activité d’esprit, mais dans des conditions de travail bien dif
 férentes.     Davy, devenu riche par un mariage récent, se rendait avec
 sa femme en Italie.        Quelques instrumens de précision, et de mani
 pulation, quelques réactifs chimiques bien purs, les plus indispen
 sables, lui composaient un laboratoire portatif', qui le suivait partout,
 et lui su<U+FB02>isait.     Il n’avait à sa disposition qu’une petite quantité
 d’iode, et ne pouvait donner aux expériences que les momens de
 loisir d’un voyage d’agrément: mais sa pensée y était toujours. Des
 trois mémoires qu’il adressa à la Société Royale, au sujet de l’iode,
 le premier est daté de Paris, le second de Florence, le troisième de
 Rome*. Ce dernier est du mois de Février, 1815. Il contient la
 découverte de l’acide iodique, à l’état solide et cristallisé, tandis que
 Gay-Lussac ne l’avait obtenu qu’en dissolution dans l’eau, ou en
 combinaison avec des bases, de manière à en donner toutefois l'analyse
 exacte.     Du reste, par une conséquence naturelle, ces mémoires de
 Davy    0<U+FB01>"rent une riche collection de faits détachés, habilement vus,
 plutôt qu’un travail d’ensemb1e.              Gay-Lussac, mieux pourvu de
 matière, d’instrumens, et de tems, effectua ce travail dans les sept
 premiers mois de 18141'.           Guidé par l’analogie qu’il avait reconnue
 entre le chlore et l’iode, il développa savamment et patiemment ce
 parallèle ; la suivit dans toutes ses combinaisons, acides, salines, mé
 talloides, éthérées, dont il assigna la composition ; et il <U+FB01>xa toutes ses
 propriétés spéciales, si exactement,         que 1’on a pu seulement, depuis,
 étendre les résultats qu’il avait obtenus, ou perfectionner les procédés
 qu’il avait employés, sans rien trouver à reprendre à ses détermi
 nations.     E'tant parvenu à extraire l’acide iodique, des iodates, le
 même sentiment de correspondance le conduisit a extraire pareille
 ment 1’acide chlorique, des chlorates, d’où on ne l’avait pas encore
 retiré ; et il en donna l’analyse exacte en proportions de poids, ainsi
 que de volumes.         Son mémoire, inséré au tome 91 des Annales de
 Chimie, présente un remarquable ensemble de toutes les connaissances
physiques et chimiques, appliquées à 1’ étude d’1m nouveau corps, avec
une sureté de jugement, et une <U+FB01>nesse de tact, qui ne laissent rien
d’incertain ou d’inexploré.            Il est aussi complet et parfait qu’un
travail chimique peut l’être, à son temps donne.              C’est là que Gay
Lussac présenta le premier exemple de l’emploi qu’ on peut faire de la
loi des volumes, pour conclure, par induction, la densité des vapeurs
des corps, que 1’on ne sait pas vaporiser matériellement.             Il se servit
de cette methode pour calculer la densité de 1a vapeur de l'iode                ui
n’était pas encore connue, et l’expérience a con<U+FB01>rmé depuis cette dé
termination, si hardie alors.
    Un an plus tard, en 1815, Gay-Lussac mit 1e sceau à sa réputation
de chimiste, par la découverte de l’azoture de carbone, ou cyanogène.

'essentielles.    Cette extension donnée par Gay-Lussac à la théorie des
proportions     dé<U+FB01>nies,    a été une des innovations les plus hardies et les
plus    fécondes   que  l’on   ait apportées, de nos jours, dans la science
chimique.
     Poursuivant toujours la même vue, il montra peu après, dans une
courte note, comment des corps composés, physiquement très divers,
étant considérés à 1’ état de gaz, peuvent être idéalement constitués par
des grouppes de vapeurs, représentant d’ autres corps, toujours les mêmes,
mais assemblés en nombres divers et simples, de volumes gazeux.*
Cette conception est reconnue aujourd’hui comme la seule rationnelle
et générale, par laquelle on puisse exprimer, et mettre en évidence, les
rapports de composition des substances organiques entr'el1es.              Il ne
faut pas imputer a ce principe l’abus qu’on en a              faire, en prenant,
contre l’intention de son auteur, ces possibilit âude représentation,
pour des réalités absolues, comme cela est arrivé trop souvent.
     L’espace nous manque, pour analyser, même pour mentionner, une
foule d’autrcs travaux importans de Gay-Lussac.                Nous avons pu
citer seulement, parmi leur grand nombre, ceux qui nous ont paru le
mieux le caractériser.         Pendant les années qu’il y consacra, son talent
reconnu l’éleva, sans effort, à tous les honneurs des sciences.             Pro
fesseur de physique, ou de chimie, dans plusieurs établissemens publics,
il porta dans son enseignement, comme partout ailleurs, la dignité
 simple, et un peu froide de ses manières, avec la netteté, la droiture,
la justesse Œappréciation, qui étaient habituelles à son esprit.           Mais
 ensuite, une autre carrière, sinon plus belle, ou plus attrayante, du
 moins plus pro<U+FB01>table à ses intérêts, de fortune, s’ouvrit pour lui, et
 l’absorba bientôt presque entièrement.           Depuis 1805, il était membre
 du comité consultatif des arts et manufactures, établi près le ministère
 du commerce.         En 1818, on l’attacha aussi à l’administration des
poudres     et salpêtres.     Il s’était marié en 1808, à une personne dont
 l’affection répondait      à la sienne, et il était devenu père de famille.
 Dans ces circonstances, il parut regarder désormais comme un devoir
 de tourner son talent vers les applications.          Ce fut ainsi qu’il publia
 successivement     des   instructions  pratiques  d’une grande utilité, sur la
 fabrication de l’aeide sulfurique hydraté, sur les essais des chlorures
 décolorans, des alcools, des alcalis employés aux usages du commerce,
 &c.      On y retrouve son même caractère, d’adresse ingénieuse, (Texac
 titude, d’habileté prudente, adapté avec une rare intelligence à la
 simplicité des manipulations industrielles.         En cherchant à se rendre
 l’industrie pro<U+FB01>table, il voulait aussi l’avancer; et son intégrité n’ aurait
 consenti, pour aucun prix, comme le ‘font tant d’antres, à propager,
 on à étayer par l’autorité de son nom, des procédés, ou des entreprises,
 dont le succes ne lui aurait pas paru assuré scienti<U+FB01>quement. C’était
 toujours le même homme, dans une autre sphère. En 1829 il fut
 nommé essayeur du bureau de garantie de la monnaie, em loi très
 lucratif; et, au lieu des procédés de la coupellation employés exclu
 sivement jusqu’alors, il imagina, et introduisit dans les opérations
 qu’on lui con<U+FB01>ait, l'essai de l’argent par la voie humide, ce ui leur
 donna un dégré nouveau et remarquable, de facilité, de rapidité, de

   The Rlv. W|u.|A.\| Kmar, M./\., Rector of Barham, Suffolk,
was born at Witnesham Hall in that county, the residence of his
father, who was       profession     solicitor, Sept. l8, 1759. His
                                    by                a
mother was Lucy, daughter of Mr. Daniel Meadows of the same
parish. llis grandfather, John Kirby (born I690), as we learn from
a notice by     near relative in the 'Literary Gazette’, wrote
                          a                                        The                        '

and his uncle, Joshua Kirby, was the author of Dr. llrook Taylor's        '
Perspective made easy.’      This Joshua Kirby was the intimate
friend of Gainsborough, who directed                            by
                                             his will that he might be
buried          by
           his sidc—a desire which was carried into effect,—and was
appointed to the o<U+FB02>ice of Comptroller of the works at Kew, by His
 Majesty George lll., with whom he was          great favourite.  Mrs.
                                                                     a
 Trimmer was his daughter, and consequently <U+FB01>rst cousin to Mr.
 Kirb       .
       Mi. Kirby      educated at the Grammar School at Ipswich,
                              was
 whence he removed in his seventeenth year to Caius College, Cam
 bridge.    Here he pursued his studies with diligence, and laid so
 good     foundation,  that he subsequently earned the reputation of
           a a
          sound and accurate scholar.    ln the year 1781 he took the
 being
 degree of  B.A.;  in the year 1782  he was  admitted into holy orders,
 having been nominated         the Rev.   Nicholas   Bacon to the joint
                                               b(y
 curacies of Barham and       oddenham.     By   his exemplary conduct
 in the discharge of his parochial duties, he so gained the esteem of
 Mr. Bacon, that he left him by his will the next presentation to the
 rectory of Barham; to this he was inducted in the year 1796, so
 that for sixty-eight years he exercised his ministry in the same
 charge, residing also in the same parsonage-house.
     Mr. Kirby's <U+FB01>rst love for natural history was awakened by his
 mother occasionally lending him, when          boy, some of the morea
 showy foreign shells from her cabinet to play with, as      reward for             a
 good conduct.     He was accustomed to ask for his favourite Shells
  by their names, which he learned from his mother, and to this
  early pleasurable association of the nomenclature of objects of na
  tural history, with the objects themselves,          probable that he  it   is
                                                                         mt.            2 -7&3.   iii

                                   1024
 derived no small portion of the pleasure which he felt in his ma
 turer years, from the dry and tedious investigations (as some would
 have deemed them) in which he delighted to engage, to ascertain
 the names and the relative priority of those given by former na
 turalists, to any plant or insect before him.
    Mr. Kirby’s taste for natural history lay dormant during his uni
 versity studies, as so often happens in similar cases, but was re
 excited as soon as he entered on his curacy, proving how important
 it is that an early bias in this direction should be given in youth,
 and how vast a fund of enjoyment is lost to our clergy from the
 unfortunate neglect of this science in our schools.     The land-shells
 about Barham, which it is probable from his boyish predilections he
 would <U+FB01>rst collect, being soon exhausted, he naturally turned his
 attention to botany, and in the course of time became thoroughly
 acquainted with the <U+FB02>owering-plants around him, which he inves
                                 '                 ’
 tigated by the aid of Smith's English -Botany and other botanical
 works.     When these were becoming scarce, that he began to ob
 serve the Cryptogamic tribes, may be inferred from his having one
 day in the spring of 1809 conducted Sir W. Hooker and Mr. Spence
 to the habitat of a rare species of Marchantia? on a particular
 bank, several miles from Barham,—the excursion ending in a ludi
 crous adventure, which in after years he often related when speak
 ing of his natural history rambles.
    How far his Cryptogamic investigations would have been pur
 sued, itris impossible to say; but it is not unlikely that but for an
 incident which turned his thoughts into another channel, that of
 Entomology, he might have been led to carry them out with the
 characteristic ardour with which he followed up every pursuit in
 which he engaged, and that Mosses, Lichens and Confervae would
 have absorbed that attention which he afterwards gave exclusively
 to insects.
    The incident referred to, which he has himself very graphically
                                                 ’
 related in the 'Introduction to Entomology (vol. ii. p. 227), was
 his accidentally observing and being led to admire and preserve a
 yellow Cow-lady (Coccinella 22-pzmctata), which was crawling on
 his window-sill.    So little up to this time had he attended to in
sects, that this species, which is not uncommon, struck him with
surprise and admiration, and led him forthwith to search for others;
and every new acquisition increasing his wonder and delight with
the vast and beauteous region of Nature thus opened to his view, he
threw aside botany and devoted himself wholly to entomology—
thus affording another proof, how great events spring from small
causes.
    While collecting and studying the insects round Barham for
some years,    during which he communicated several valuable papers
to the Linnean Society, of which he had become a Fellow, he par
ticularly directed his attention to the tribe of wild-bees, and <U+FB01>nding
how few of them were described and how little they had been syste
matically studied, he made notes on the various species and fami
lics, till at
              length his materials were so considerable as to become

                                  I025
the foundation of his great work, the ' Monographia Apum Anglia,'
which appeared in l80'2, in two volumes 8vo. This work would
have been thought remarkable as the unaided production of a coun
try clergyman and entomologist of no long stsndin , had it been a
mere                   of a greatly extended number 0F the previously
               l ritish species of the Linnean genus Apia; but when we
         descrigtion
recognised
consider that he had not only brought together and described up
wards of two hundred species of the tribe, but with an admirable
largeness and correctness of view had divided them into numerous
families and subfamilies, so natural, that most of them have since
been adopted as genera, and that he took lessons in the art of eteh
ing for the express pur ose of being enabled to give a correct idea
of the parts of the mouth on which his divisions were mainly founded,
we shall not be surprised that it excited the warmest admiration of
British and foreign entomologists on its appearance, and at once
elevated him to the rank of one of the <U+FB01>rst entomologists of the
age.
     During the next <U+FB01>ve or six years, Mr. Kirby collected materials
for, and contributed to the Linnean Society, two very valuable
papers on the genus Apton, in which he described a great number
of new species.
     In the year I808, Mr. Spence, who had carried on an active en
tomological correspondence with Mr. Kirby for the preceding two
or three years. proposed to him, with the view of remedying the
want of a good English introduction to the science, that they should
jointly write one—a proposal to which Mr. Kirby at once assented,
as he did to Mr. Spence's subsequent extension of      it, that the work
should not be merely technical as was his <U+FB01>rst idea, but be thrown
 into
    a     popular form, comprising nnder various heads all the known
 facts relative to the habits and economy of insects, and their noxious
 or useful properties, &c., and in the shape of letters so as to admit
 of a more discursive mode of treating the subject. The general
 plan having been thus agreed on, Mr. Spence spent several weeks
 with Mr. Kirby at Barham, in the spring of 1809, to <U+FB01>ll up its de
 tails, and to commence the letters on external anatomy and orismo
 logy, which were the portions <U+FB01>rst written, and on this occasion and
 on similar visits in subsequent years, every term and its de<U+FB01>nition
 were discussed by the authors, and the other letters written by
 each,joiutly criticised.
  It    would not be easy to overrate the in<U+FB02>uence which this work
 (of which vol. was published in I815, vol. ii.
                i.                                   in   I817, and vols.
 iii. and iv. in 1826) had on Mr. Kirby's subsequent entomological
 career.    Not only did it     supply, under its various heads, suitable
 places for introducing from his note-book, his numerous detached
 observations during many years, on the manners, economy, &c. of
 insects, which but for this opportunity would probably have been
  lost to the world, but the necessity of extending his former studies
  as to the anatomy and nomenclature of the parts of bees, to those of
  all the other orders, and of investigating many new points of their
  history, led to a great accession to his previous knowledge, which
                                                              6

                                 1026
bore ample fruit both in the work in question and in his         future
ones.
  Of these, following    his admirable paper on his new order “ SlTf1)8
iptera" and his “Century of Insects" in the 'Linnean Transac
                                      '
tions,’ the most important was his Bridgewater Treatise,’
                                                              “ On the
History, Habits and Instincts of Animals," published in the 76th
year of his age, in which he brought together a vast number of
curious and important facts in the natural history of animals, and
urged their application in proof of the wisdom and goodness of the
 Creator with that persuasive and pious ardour with which he always
 endeavoured to lead his readers, like himself, “to see God in all
 thin s."
    T%lis is not the place to enumerate the titles of his numerous less
 important papers in the Zoological Journal,’ and other periodical
                             '

 work, the entomological portion of the ' Fauna Boreali-Americana
 of Sir John Richardson, published in a quarto volume in 1837, in
 which he described the insects of the northernmost region of Ame
 rica with a largeness of grasp as to their generic and family rela
 tions, and a clearness and accuracy as to their speci<U+FB01>c characters,
 fully proving that at the very advanced age of nearly eighty, his
 entomological zeal and acumen had not diminished.
     Some time before the publication of this work, Mr. Kirby, feeling
 that his entomological career was appropriately closed by      it,gave
 his whole collection of British and Foreign Insects to the Entomo
 logical Society of London, of which he had been elected the H0
 norary President on its establishment in l833—a noble gift, for
  which future entomologists, who will thus have access to the very
 species he described in his various works, will feel a deep debt of
 gratitude.
     Constant and unwearied as were Mr. Kirby's entomological la
  bours, they never encroached on his professional and social duties.
  His parishioners of every class looked up to him as      a  father, on
 whose advice, sympathy and assistance they might con<U+FB01>dently rely,
  and the whole tenor of his long life proved him to be at once one
  of the kindest of friends and most simple-minded, warm-hearted
  and pious of men.
     Mr. Kirby was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1818, and
                           a
  became one of the Linnean Society soon after its institution in 1788.
  Besides being Honorary President of the Entomological Society and
  President of the Ipswich Museum, he was a Fellow of the Geologi
  cal and Zoological Societies, and an Honorary Member of several
  foreign societies.   He died July 4-, 1850, aged ninety years and ten
  months, and was buried in the chancel of his church at Barham.
   SIR Ronnar PEEL was born on the 5th of February, 1788, at
Bury, in Lancashire.  His father was one of our greatest manufac
turers, a very wealthy and a very able man, remarkable for the
vigour of his mind and the extent of his practical knowledge.
   Sir Robert was educated at home with great care till of proper
                                                               a

                                    1027
age for n public school, and then was sent to Harrow, where, ap
plying himself with unusual diligence, he made rapid progress in
his studies, and in his seventeenth year entered Christehurch,
Oxford.
   The new examination statutes had      been recently passed, subjecting
all persons who proposed to take a degree to a public examination,
with a graduated scale of honours proportioned to their pro<U+FB01>ciency,
either in a mixed course of ('la.-sics and Aristotelian Philosophy, or
a course of Mathematics and Physics, the <U+FB01>rst class being the
highest honour.      Sir Robert Piel nt once undertook to read for the
highest honours in both courses, and was the <U+FB01>rst person who suc
reeded.     In I808 he grntlamted, nml after that he does not appear
to have pursued his scientitic studies further, but entering the House
of Connnons as representative of the Borough of ('=.i‘ln-l. he devoted
lai|nself exclalsively to politics.  llc was soon appointed Cnd\r Se
cretary   for the  Home   Department, and <U+FB01>lling in sttccessimt the va
rious o<U+FB02>icrs, the liigln-st prizes of a successful political career, be
eventually became Pri|nc .\lini.-lter.
    With science politicians in this country have not usually much to
do: Sir Robert Peel, however, was a Member of the Committee in
which the scienti<U+FB01>c pensiol‘s originated, and on several occasions as
a Minister of the Crown he awarded scienti<U+FB01>c pensions.              Fully
alive to the importance of science as the basis of the engineering
and manufacturing pre-eminence of this country, he was in the con
stant habit of consulting scienti<U+FB01>c men whenever he had any new
commercial measures to bring forward, or whenever a di<U+FB02>iculty
arose which called for scienti<U+FB01>c assistance; but he docs not seem
to have devoted any portion of his leisure moments to scienti<U+FB01>c
reading, or to have kept up the mathematical knowledge he had
early acquired at Oxford; and he appears to have regarded science
with interest rather for the sake of its applications to practical pur
poses than as a high and ennohling pursuit.
    Looking to Sir R. Peel's great abilities, his commanding in<U+FB01>uence,
his unrivalled powers as a mun of business, his success at Oxford,
which was evidence that he had then the power of using the keys of
exact knowledge, it is natural that scienti<U+FB01>c men should have been
anxious for his assistance in the management of the Associations for
the Advancement of Science. He was a Trustee of the British Mu
seum, and was most ef<U+FB01>cient; but u hen it was intimated to him that
there was a general wish that he should permit himself to be put
forward more prominently either as a President of the British Asso
ciation, or in some other way, he declined, stating that he was not
quali<U+FB01>ed, as science was not one of his pursuits.        On the 29th of
June, having been in the House of Commons till four o'clock in the
morning, he attended an early meeting of the Royal Commissioners
for the Exhibition of 1851, assisting in the transaction of business
with his usual vigour and judgement, and soon after the meeting he
was thrown from his horse and received the fatal injuries of which
he died on the 2nd of July.
