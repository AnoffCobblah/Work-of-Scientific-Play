Additional Observations    on the optical Properties and       Structureof   heated
  Glass and unannealed glass Drops.  By David Brewster, LL.D.
  F.R.S. Edin. and F.S.A. Edin. In a Letter addressed to the Right
  Hon. Sir Joseph Banks, Bart. K.B. P.R.S.    Read November 10,
  1814.   [Phil. Trans. 1815, p. 1.]
IN   this continuation of the author's remarks on Rupert's drops, he
observes, that when they are made of colourless glass, and are held
before a sheet of white paper, even the unbroken drops exhibit some
appearances which he considers as marks of a crystalline texture;
and when they are broken in such a manner that the parts are re
tained in their relative situation, the structure shows a cleavage in
the direction of lines diverging from the apex, or rather in the form
of conical layers, having a common axis, with their apex towards the
blunt end of the drop.
   Since the surface of these drops is cooled suddenly by plunging
into water, and fixed before the central parts are contracted, the
author conceived that their specific gravity might be less than that
of annealed drops; and indeed a difference was found upon trial,
amounting to ºrth part in the aggregate bulk of           its
                                                      external dimen
sions; but     appeared, on examination, that the contraction
               it                                                   the      of
glass had taken place from within outwards,         so   as                       in
                                                              of to
                                                      leave cavities
the interior sufficient   to
                           account for the difference       weight, without
supposing any intrinsic difference      of density  in the glass itself.
   Dr. Brewster further observed, that        by heating    drop
                                                              a       redness,
                                                                      to
and allowing    it    cool gradually, these cavities disappeared entirely,
                     to
so   as   prove that they did not arise from included air, but merely
          to
from the internal contraction     of  the glass.
   Since considerable   difficulty occurs    inpreserving unannealed drops
of flint glass, the author has   paid  attention   to
                                                    the circumstances most
favourable     to their preservation, and recommends removing them

from the water in which they have been plunged, as soon as the red
ness in the centre of the drop ceases to be visible.
   Since the smallest portion of any polarizing crystal polarizes or
depolarizes light according to                      its

   The instrument contrived by Dr. Roget, is constructed to answer
this last purpose, with the same facility as common multiplication
and division are performed by the common sliding-rule.
   For in the same manner as numbers are considered as powers of
 10, so their indices, whether integral or decimal, being, in fact, num
bers, may again be regarded as powers of 10; and their secondary
indices, or logarithmic logarithms, may be laid down as logometric
intervals, to which other logometric intervals may be added or sub
tracted mechanically, so as to present to view any multiples or ali
quot part of a logarithm, and consequently any powers whatever of
the number to which that logarithm is index; for when the unit of
Gunter's line, on the slider, is applied to any number on the scale,
divided into logometric logarithms, then 2 on the slider corresponds
to the square, 3 to the cube, &c. of the same number.
   The author enumerates various uses to which such an instrument
is applicable. To       cases  all

 Experiments on the Depolarization of Light as erhibited by various
   mineral, animal, and vegetable Bodies, with a Reference of the Phe
   nomena to the general Principles of Polarization. By David Brewster,
   LL.D. F.R.S. Edin. and F.S.A. Edin. In a Letter addressed to
       the Right Hon. Sir Joseph Banks, Bart. K.B. P.R.S.                                     Read       De

    When a ray of light has been so modified by reflection or refraction
 that in certain planes it is not divided into two parts by a prism of
 Iceland spar, that ray is said to be polarized; but it may again, by
 several means, be rendered divisible, and is then said to be depola
 rized. The object of the author, in this letter, is to comprise expe
 riments on the depolarizing properties of a great variety of substances
 at the same time, and thence to deduce the general principles on
 which the various degrees or modes in which they exhibit this pro
 perty depend.
    Dr. Brewster has already, in a former communication, described
 the general phenomena of depolarization by mica, calcareous spar,
 topaz, and other regularly crystallized bodies, which have two neutral
 axes at right angles to each other, and two depolarizing axes also at
 right angles to each other, but making angles of 45° with each of
 the neutral axes.
    Of the bodies now enumerated by the author, some have no pola
 rizing or depolarizing properties, as rock salt, fluor spar, and spinelle
 ruby. Out of seven specimens of diamond, four did not depolarize;
 one depolarized about one fifth of the light, one about one half, and
 one nearly         all
                the light    every position.

On an ebbing and flowing Stream discovered by boring in the Harbour
  of Bridlington. By John Storer, M.D. Communicated by the Right
  Hon. Sir Joseph Banks, Bart. K.B. P.R.S. Read January 19,
  1815.     [Phil. Trans. 1815, p. 54.]
  In the year 1811, with a view to making certain improvements in
the port of Bridlington, an examination was made of the depth of a
stratum of clay, and another of gravel, at some distance below high
water mark.     At low water the harbour is dry, and at high water it
has from fifteen to seventeen feet of water in the deepest part. The
spot fixed upon for boring, has about six feet of water in ordinary
tides.
   After boring through 28 feet of clay, and subsequently through a
mixed stratum of chalk and gravel, the augur was found to strike
against a solid rock, on which that instrument could make no im
pression, and the work was discontinued, without any appearance of
water at that time rising in the bore. But in the course of an hour
or two it was observed to be filled to the top with very limpid fresh
water, which, after a short time, was projected some inches above
the summit, in a stream equal to its calibre. As the water was found
to be  fitfor washing, and                  all
                                culinary purposes, the bore was first
secured  by     elm stock ten feet long, and perforated with
                an                                              three                                    a

diameter, well tinned    the depth    32 feet, and which thus reached

through the fissures of this rock that the water is supposed to issue,
till overpowered by the increasing column of tide, which, by its
greater specific gravity, will occasion it to find vent at a level which
will be more above the point at which the two fluids meet in pro
portion to the difference df their densities.
    In confirmation of this hypothesis it is further observed, that after
very stormy weather, when there is an unusual swell upon that coast,
the water is discharged with an evident undulation.
    Dr. Storer, however, observes, that the relative altitude to which
the spring is elevated after much rain, rather militates against its
correctness; and he would expect the additional force of the column
of spring water at such times to produce an opposite effect, by
enabling it to overcome the same column of sea-water during a longer
period  in each tide.
    As it seemed probable that the subject may be elucidated by an
acquaintance with the peculiarities of the springs in the neighbour
hood, the author remarks, that upon the Wolds behind Bridlington
there is very little water during summer and autumn; but in the
course of two or three weeks after the commencement of frost, the
springs begin to run copiously, and in some instances even with con
siderable impetuosity.

   The author having, in former experiments on the depolarization of
light by a mixture of resin and bees' wax, had reason to suppose that
the effects were modified by pressure, now examines the effects of
pressure on a class of substances which, from their elasticity, will
restore themselves after removal of the force applied, and thence ad
mit of greater variety in the repetition of the experiments.     By em
ploying animal jellies, he had an opportunity of giving them any de
gree of tenacity that might be wished.
   A small cylinder of jelly being placed upright between two plates
of glass, had at first no power of depolarization.    By gradual drying
at its circumference,  it soon began to depolarize  at that part; and as
it became thereby more dense than at         its
                                            centre,    had the power

   The next experiments related to the effects upon the heart of cer
tain stimuli applied to the brain or spinal marrow.     Spirit of wine,
applied to the brain or to the upper portions of the spinal marrow,
excited considerable increase of the heart's action, but not when ap
plied to the lumbar portion.    A watery solution of opium or infusion
of tobacco  also, occasioned a slight increase; but this was soon suc
ceeded  by  more languid action of the heart, which, however, reco

of the brain, yet may be influenced through the brain, the office of
which is considered as purely sensorial. The separate existence of
these powers is illustrated by a review of the various classes of ani
mals, in the lowest of which we find only the muscular system; in
the next above the muscular and nervous without sensorium; and in
the most perfect animals we find the three vital powers combined,
each having existence not immediately depending on the others, but
so connected that no one can subsist long without the others, since
all are supported by the same circulation, that is dependent for its
continuance upon muscular action, which cannot exist without re
spiration, while this again depends on the nervous system for                                 its
continuance.

heart's action in carp, after being fully exposed by opening into the
pericardium without any injury being done to the brain or spinal mar
row, Mr. Clift next passed a hot wire from the tail to the occiput of
a carp of the same size, so as to destroy its spinal marrow ; and he
found that the action of the heart was quickened for two or three
beats, but then resumed the same rate of pulsation as before, although
the voluntary muscles had lost their power and did not contract when
a stimulus was applied to them.

                                                 vase,  discovered about two
years since, there were found, among other colours, three different
kinds      red, one approaching
           of                          orange, another dull red, and third
                                                 to                                                         a
purplish red. The first was minium, the second and third proved                                                   to
be both ochres of different tints. Another red found            various fresco              in
paintings differed from those found     the vase, and proved   inver                                   to    be
milion. This   substance, called    the Greeks       by
                                                kwyá<U+017F>lapi, was known

                                      12
by the name of minium to the Romans, who called our modern mi
nium by the name of cerussa usta, in consequence of the mode of
making it; which, on the authority of Pliny, is said to have been
suggested by the accidental effects of a fire at the Piraeeus at Athens,
 by which ceruse was found converted into minium.
   From the description which Pliny gives of an inferior sort of ver
milion, formed by calcining certain stones found in veins of lead,
the author is of opinion, that the mineral thus treated must have
been a natural carbonate of lead, which becomes red when burned.
   Among the yellows examined by Sir Humphry Davy, were ochres
of various tints, from being mixed with different quantities of chalk,
and the yellow oxide of lead or massicot.
   But though we have the evidence of Vitruvius that orpiment was
known to the ancients, and of Pliny that a substance nearly allied
to orpiment, termed Sandarach, was used by the Romans, the author
has not been able to detect either of these sulphurets of arsenic in
any   of the ancient fresco paintings.
    Among some rubbish collected in one of the chambers of the baths
of Titus were several large lumps of a deep blue frit, which, upon
 being analysed, were found to consist of soda, silica, and oxide of
 copper.    Upon examination of the different tints of blue observable
 in the paintings  of the baths, as well as several blues in fragments
of fresco  painting  from the ruins near the monument of Caius Ces
tius, and from excavations made at Pompeii, it appeared that they
all consisted of the same blue frit, more or less diluted by admixture
with carbonate of lime. There appears to the author every reason
to believe this to be the colour described by Theophrastus, as disco
vered by an Egyptian king, and anciently manufactured at Alexan
dria. Vitruvius also speaks of the same colour under the name of
caeruleum, made in his time at Puzzuoli, by heating together sand,
flores nitri or natron, and filings of copper.
   Though Pliny and Vitruvius speak of Indian blue, which appears
to have been indigo, the author has not been able to discover any
remains of it at this time; nor indeed of any other blue, excepting
the frit before mentioned among the opake blues used by painters. But
it is by no means uncommon to find among the ruins fragments of
transparent blue glass, which are tinged with cobalt ; and it would
appear, from a passage in Theophrastus, that the Greeks considered
cobalt as a species of XaAkös, in consequence of  itsproperty      giving
                                                                  of
this blue colour.
   Among the several shades      of  green observable     in
                                                           the baths   of
Livia, the baths     Titus, and elsewhere, the greater part are coloured
                       of
by carbonate      copper; but one
                  of              of  them, which approached the olive,
proved  to   bethe common    green earth   of
                                           Verona.   Itseems not impro
bable that some        the greens which are now found

carbonate    ofcopper may have been originally laid     on  acetates; for

it appears from Theophrastus that the ancients were well acquainted

    On the Laws which regulate the Polarization of Light by Reflection

       Though Huygens, who first explained the laws that regulate the
    extraordinary refraction of light at a surface of Iceland spar, disco
    vered that light thus separated has properties different from common
    light; and though Newton observed that light thus modified has per
    manent properties, with reference to the plane in which it has been re
    fracted, and expressed this peculiarity by saying that these rays have
    sides according to which       subsequent refractions are regulated;—it
                                              its

    term   by  which        he
                         could  conveniently    express   the various affections

    phenomena relating         his important discovery, that light may also

      Dr. Brewster further observes, that                             it       is   according           to   the same

                                      15
law that the maximum of polarization takes place in reflection from
the joint surface of two media. The angle of incidence is comple
ment to the angle of refraction, or the tangent of incidence (as the
author expresses it,) is equal to the quotient of the indices of refrac
tion of the media.
    After describing in a series of propositions the various degrees in
which light becomes polarized by reflection or refraction at different
angles, and the number of reflections or refractions necessary to
effect complete polarization at various angles remote from that which
produces the maximum, the author investigates the origin of a cer
tain quantity of unpolarized light which exists even at the maximum
polarizing angle in reflection from substances of high refractive
power; and he shows it to depend on the different refrangibility of
differently coloured light.       For when the incidence is such that the
mean     refrangible  rays are completely  polarized, it is evident that the
incidence will not be such as to     polarize  completely either the red or
the violet    rays,  and   consequently  a beam composed of these will       s
appear as white light not polarized; and when the polarization is
                                                                             **
 effected at the surface of substances of high refractive and dispersive
power, this portion will form a large proportion of the whole re
flected light. On the contrary, any pencil of homogeneous coloured
light, though only once reflected, may be completely polarized, even
 at the surfaces of the densest substances, if incident at an angle cor
 rectly adapted to its refrangibility.
    The author purposes, on some future occasion, to point out the
 laws which regulate the polarization of light under various other cir
 cumstances not noticed in the present communication.
 On some Phenomena of Colours, exhibited by thin Plates.            By John
    Knox, Esq. Communicated by the Right Hon. Sir Joseph Banks,
    Bart. G.C.B. P.R.S.        Read April 6, 1815.      [Phil. Trans. 1815,
    p.  161.]
    It is not surprising,  says the author, that neither Sir Isaac Newton,
 nor Dr.   Herschel,   nor any other writer who has followed on the same
 subject, have given any explanation which appears to him to be sa
 tisfactory, since they have not been in possession of the phenomena
 connected with this inquiry.       After stating various objections which
 he considers as conclusive against the alternate disposition to be re
 flected or transmitted inherent in the rays of light, and recurring at
 certain equal intervals which are expressed under the name of fits by
  Sir Isaac Newton, Mr. Knox proceeds to describe those new phe
 nomena which form the principal subject of his paper, and which he
 has been enabled to make by the assistance of the method of ob
  serving such appearances employed by Dr. Herschel.            This method
  consists in using the shadows of some opake substance held over

account the author calls them binary, a term which applies to the
numerous class of phenomena which he has observed by a great va
riety of combinations.    He reckons as many as six kinds of rectili
near bands   produced  in his experiments which have not been no
ticed  by any  other writer.
   In order to ascertain what effect the presence of air might have
on these phenomena, the author repeated some of his experiments
in vacuo, and found that the removal of the air had no perceptible
effect.
   Even the interposition of water between the surfaces appears to
him to diminish but little the brilliancy of the colours. Nitric acid
has more effect; and in fluids of greater density, as olive oil, the
whole class of phenomena disappear.
    It appears somewhat strange, says Mr. Knox, that Newton
should have attributed the coloured rings to a plate of air and to
supposititious fits of easy reflection and refraction, when a cause more
obvious was at hand; namely, the interference of the reflecting and
refracting strata diffused over the contiguous surfaces: for it may be
supposed, that when a ray passing out of glass into air is interrupted
and receives a new impulse by the influence of a second refracting
medium, these contrary impulses may be repeated many times, and
by repeated vibration may affect the rays according to their different
refrangibility, so as to separate them into differently coloured spec
tra. He therefore thinks it highly probable, that by this compound
action and reaction between the strata and light, and between the
rays of light themselves,                all
                                 the various phenomena are produced,
although from their extreme minuteness           accurate knowledge    an                               of

founded even by Scheele, for apples contain a portion of sorbic as
well as of malic acid; but that these acids are different, Mr. Donovan
proves by decomposing malate of lead by sorbic acid.        For if water
be boiled on malate of lead, no crystals are to be obtained on cooling
the liquor; but when the malate is boiled in sorbic acid, the malate
is decomposed; and the liquor, when cooled, deposits the peculiarly   -
brilliant crystals of sorbate of lead.
     In order to be well assured of the difference between these acids,
 Mr. Donovan compared his acid with as many as seven different spe
cimens of malic acid obtained from different sources, and was con
firmed in the opinion that they are essentially different, by comparison
of various neutral salts obtained from each; those containing sorbic
 acid being in general to be procured in permanent crystals, while
 those from malic acid yield merely deliquescent residua when reduced
 to dryness.
    The author remarks, that the purest malic acid is that prepared
 from the Sempervivum tectorum, which, according to the observation
 of Vauquelin, appears to be free from every other acid; while the
juice of apples, unless they be taken very young, appears constantly
 to contain a portion of sorbic acid.
    This paper concludes with conjectures respecting the progressive
changes of vegetable products, and possible conversion of bitter prin
ciple into malic acid, sorbic acid, and oxalic acid; but the author is
 fully sensible that little reliance can be placed on such speculations.
 On the Structure of the Organs of Respiration in Animals which ap
    pear to hold an intermediate Place between those of the Class Pisces
     and the Class Vermes, and in two Genera of the last-mentioned Class.
    By Sir Everard Home, Bart. V.P.R.S. Read June 1, 1815. [Phil.
     Trans. 1815, p. 256.]
    The genera of animals here enumerated by the author, are the
 Lamprey, Myxine, an animal between the Lamprey and the Myxine,
 the Aphrodita aculeata, and the Leech.
     In the Lamprey, the organs of respiration consist of separate oval
bags, that have seven openings on each side of the neck, for receiv
 ing and emitting the water which they breathe by means of a carti
 laginous thorax surrounding the bags.       In the Lampern, which is of
 the same genus, the structure is very similar, but the cartilages of
 its thorax are weaker.
     In an animal brought from the South Sea by Sir Joseph Banks,
 there are also the same number of external openings, and the same
 number of bags; but there is no cartilaginous thorax, and hence the
 author is induced to consider the animal intermediate between the
 Lamprey and Myxine, which it resembles in having teeth, and in hav
 ing a mesentery to its intestines.
     In the Myxine, there are only two orifices on the under surface of
  the neck; but these branch internally to six separate bags on each
 side.

                                                 24
     In the Aphrodita aculeata, the organs of respiration differso much
from other animals of that tribe, that the author enters more minutely
into the peculiarities of their structure.  There are thirty-two open
ings between its tufts of bristles on each side, which lead to one large
cavity on the back, into which project two rows of globular cells that
communicate with the viscera, the use of which may admit of some
doubt.
   In the Leech, there are sixteen external orifices on each side under
the surface of the belly, communicating with an equal number of di
stinct globular cells.
   With respect to the respiration of the Lamprey, the author observes,
that it naturally differs from that of fishes in general; for whilst they
are attached by means of their mouths, the respiration could not then
be carried on by means of that organ.          A portion of the respired
water  may,  however,    be occasionally received into the oesophagus by
a tube,  with which         all
                          the bags  communicate,    and thence may pass
into the stomach.                                      -
     In
      the animal from the South Seas, which has     cartilaginous  no
thorax, the respiration must   performed by the elasticity
                                             be                the            of
bags themselves.
      the Myxine, the author conceives that the water received by
     In
the two external openings      carried wholly into the oesophagus, and
                                       is
is then thrown out          by    an
                            orifice that opens externally below those
before described.
      the Aphrodita and Leech, the same openings which receive, also
     In
emit the respired water; and since        the latter the pressure
                                                       in          the        of

vary according     the degree
                     to            bodily exertion.

that they  are hermaphrodite.

          in                        reality testicles, and that the sup

On the Multiplication of Images, and the Colours which accompany
  them in some Specimens of calcareous Spar.  By David Brewster,
   LL.D. F.R.S.                Lond. and Edin.            In a Letter              addressed to the     Right
   Hon.        Sir Joseph Banks, Bart. G.C.B. P.R.S.                                 Read   June 8, 1815.
    [Phil. Trans. 1815, p. 270.]
    The phenomena which the author here endeavours to explain, he
says, were first noticed by Prof. Robinson of Edinburgh, and pub
lished by Mr. Benjamin Martin in his Treatise on Iceland Crystal.
It would not be easy to describe the appearances without reference
to the figures that accompany the paper. The peculiar specimens
of calcareous spar in which they occur, have been supposed to have
fissures, with a disposition to split in the direction of the longer dia
gonal of the rhomboid. But the author considers it as an interrupting
stratum, since it appears to him not to bear the most remote resem
blance to a fissure, but resembles a vein or film uniting the two pris
matic portions of a rhomboid. Neither are the phenomena produced,
 when two surfaces artificially polished in the direction of the sup
posed plane are applied to each other; but they are produced when
 a thin film of sulphate of lime is interposed as a vein between two
 such portions of Iceland spar, and the surfaces are closely united by
a cement of strong refractive power.
    The supposition of such a crystallized vein, serves also to explain
 the varieties observable in the characters of the phenomena in dif
 ferent instances, which must vary according to the thickness of the
 vein, and according to the position of      polarizing axis.  its
   The author also describes certain new instruments for exhibiting
complementary colours produced                        by
                                    polarized light; but the descrip

these occasions have been from 300 to 800 times; sometimes one,
and sometimes another being used, according to the states of the air
or moon, or other circumstances.
    The observations here recorded, were made principally from the
year 1787 to 1798 inclusive, and they are given in the order in which
they occurred with all the phenomena noticed each time, and notes
of correction added from subsequent observations respecting stars
mistaken for satellites, or satellites wrongly numbered. For Dr. Her
 schel always added a configuration to his descriptions, in order to avoid
mistakes, and in general made, by previous estimate, a sketch of the
places where known satellites might be expected; some misconcep
 tions were unavoidable, in consequence of the interruptions to his
 observations from cloudy or moon-light nights, as well as from small
 stars that unexpectedly interfered.
    From all the observations thus made, and from accurate measures
 taken by different micrometers, the author infers the nodes of the
 two first satellites to have nearly the same longitude of 165%"; that
 their inclination is also the same, 78° 58'; and the motion of both,
 from their ascending node to the greatest elongation, retrograde.
 The periodic time of the first is found to be 8" 16° 56' 5"; and that
 of the second 13° 11" 8" 19°; their distances at greatest elongation
 36" and 48" respectively.
     To these determinations respecting the orbits of the satellites,
 Dr. Herschel adds his estimate of the distances to which they must
 move from the body of the planet before they become visible by his
  20-feet telescope.      The first requires to be at more than half its
  greatest elongation.     The second also becomes invisible when it is
  within half       its
                   greatest  elongation.       there   If    interior satellite,

different metals to be ignited by the power of this battery, by joining
equal lengths of any two wires in the same line, and making the
circuit through both thus connected.        In the comparison of platina
and   iron,  which of all metals are most easily ignited, the difference
was so   little, that their comparative ignition altered during the ex
periment in consequence of apparent difference in their capacities, as
well as conducting powers. Of other metals, gold and copper were
nearly equal, and far less easily ignited than the former. After them
stood zinc.; and last of all silver.    Mr. Children observes, that the
order of these   metals,  as conductors of electricity, nearly follows that
of their  powers   to conduct heat.

Determination    of the North Polar Distances and proper Motion of
    Thirty fired Stars. By John Pond, Esq. Astronomer Royal, F.R.S.
   Read June 15, 1815. [Phil. Trans. 1815, p. 384.]
    In the former catalogue which the Astronomer Royal gave in 1813,
he estimated the probable extent of error at not more than one fourth
of a second; and his present catalogue, which may be presumed to
be improved by a greater number of observations, confirms the just
ness of that estimate; since the greatest difference observable is not
more than two tenths of a second.
    A  comparative catalogue is also given of the places of the same
stars in 1756, as deduced from the observations of Dr. Bradley; and
thence is added a column of annual proper motions for each of the
stars in the collection.
An Essay towards the Calculus of Functions. By C. Babbage, Esq.

    In the same manner as an exponent expresses one operation on
quantity, namely, the multiplication of it by itself a certain number
of times, or raising it to the power expressed by that exponent, so
the term Function, which has been introduced into modern analysis,
is intended to express generally the results of all the various opera
tions that can be performed upon quantity. Many of these operations
consist of two parts, the direct and the inverse. To extract a root is
the inverse, with reference to that of raising any number to a higher
power. So the integral is the inverse of the differential calculus; and
the same observation applies to finite differences.     In all these cases
the inverse method is    by far the more difficult of the two.
    The author's object in the present essay is to consider the inverse
method with respect to functions, and, if possible, to determine the
value of an unknown function by means of any functional equation
given, instead of discovering, as in the direct method, the value of a
quantity from an equation in which the function is known. But the
mode in which the author pursues his inquiry, of course could not
admit of being publicly read.

    When this gas is mixed with atmospheric air, it inflames by a
lighted taper; but unless the quantities are duly proportioned, the in
flammation is too slow to be accompanied with sound.              The com
bustion appeared to be most sudden when there were about 7 or 8
parts of air to 1 of the gas.     When 1 of the gas is mixed with 15 or
 16 of  air,  the candle burns with an enlarged flame, which does not
extend to the whole quantity, and the same phenomenon occurs
when the gas constitutes no more than ºrth part of the mixture.
    The author next made trial of the degree of heat necessary for the
combustion of this gas, which in fact is difficult to ignite, for even
the electric spark will not explode a mixture containing 5 parts of
 air to 1 of the gas; but when the air is increased as far as 6 to 1, or
nearer to the most explosive proportion, then it does take fire by the
electric spark.      Even the most explosive mixture will not take fire
from well burned charcoal, nor by iron heated to any degree short
of actual combustion.       But on the contrary, hydrogen whether sim
ple or sulphuretted, olefiant gas, or carbonic oxide, may each be set
 on fire very readily by all these means; and hence the gas procured
 by distillation from coal is liable to be fired by ignited iron or char
 coal, in consequence of the olefiant gas which it contains along with
 the carburetted hydrogen in the first stage of the process of distil
 lation, and on account of the carbonic oxide and hydrogen which it
 contains in the latter stages of      production.     its

aperture but those of the gauze, if the little lantern so constructed

 On the Developement of Exponential Functions; together with several
   new Theorems relating to finite Differences.   By John Frederick W.
   Herschel, Esq. F.R.S.     Read December     14, 1815.  [Phil. Trans.
   1816, p. 25.]
    The subject here considered by Mr. Herschel relates to the cele
brated theorems of Lagrange, expressing the connection between sim
ple exponential indices and those of differentiation and of integration.
    Since the theorems have been demonstrated by various subsequent
analysts, as by Laplace, by Arbogast, and by Dr. Brinkley, the author
takes them for granted; but observes that in their original form they
are but abridged expressions of their meaning; and that in order to
become practically useful, their exponential functions require further
development.
   And though this part of the subject has been treated with great
ability by Dr. Brinkley, who has deduced formulae respecting the
first of the two theorems far more simple than could have been ex
pected from the complex nature of the subject; yet since his method,
when applied to the second more general theorem, would lead to de
tails of extreme complexity, Mr. Herschel has taken a different view
of the subject; and beginning with the more general theorem has
arrived at a general formula, which he believes to have been hitherto
wholly unnoticed, and which, when applied to certain particular
cases treated of by Dr. Brinkley, affords precisely the same results.
   But the mode in which this subject is treated, or even the results,
were not of a nature to admit of being read in public.

of light is reflected, in proportion to the increase of distance from the
central line of no reflection.           The light, however, which has thus
been polarized, may be wholly, or in part, depolarized by the inter
position of many crystallized bodies, the degree of depolarization
being dependent on the more or less exact position of a certain neu
tral axis or plane of their crystalline texture with the plane of pri
mitive polarization. When these planes are perfectly coincident, the
light remains polarized in that plane, and a black line appears in
 that direction; but adjacent to                         it,      on

by a method which forms the subject of the second section of this
paper.
   When a plate of glass is brought to a full red heat, and is then
cooled by placing its edge on a bar of cold iron, the same fringes of
colour are developed during cooling as by placing cold glass upon
hot iron; and in this case the glass retains the property given to it
even after it is completely cold.
   The author delineates various configurations of colours produced
by plates of different forms thus cooled. Among many others, a
parallelogram of glass exhibits an inscribed parallelogram, with lines
from each angle to the angles of the plate; and when the plate has
been divided longitudinally by a diamond, each of the portions again
exhibits an inscribed parallelogram, just as if the parts had been se
parately heated; and in this respect they present a property analo
gous to that of a divided magnet, each part of which has opposite
poles as the entire bar.

                  The electric discharge was mostly accompanied by an evident mus

                                                                      to                               of

                                              40
nesses: but the reverse will happen in each case if one glass be
compressed and the other dilated.
   If a compressing force be applied to the centre of a plate of glass,
it will exhibit the black cross and other phenomena to be seen by
means of doubly-refracting crystals.
   If a plate so compressed be inclined to the polarized ray, the tints
of colour will ascend or descend, according to the direction in which
it is inclined.
  If a plateto which the power of depolarization has been given by
heat be compressed, the tints of the interior fringes rise in the scale,
and those of the exterior descend, when the axis of pressure is per
pendicular to their direction.
   The same effects which are thus produced upon glass by com
pression, are produced in a similar manner upon such crystallized
bodies as do not possess these properties in their natural state. But
those bodies which already possess the doubly-refracting structure
in a high degree, as calcareous spar, rock crystal, beryl, &c., suffer
no change by any degree of mechanical compression to which the
author has subjected them.
   Since the tints of colour communicated to polarized light depends
on the degree of force applied to glass, through which it is trans
mitted, Dr. Brewster conceives that a convenient instrument might
be constructed for measuring the intensity of forces, which he would
call a Chromatic Dynamometer; and in the same manner might
variations of temperature, or humidity of bodies be measured, with
the assistance of a little ingenuity, by chromatic thermometers and
hygrometers.
   In the prosecution of these experiments, the author examined the
properties communicated to jelly by variations of its density from
drying, and contrived means of giving it permanent power of depo
larization, by the constrained position in which it was allowed to
harden. And he found that the polarizing force of distended isinglass
far exceeds any which can be given to glass, either by heat or pres
sure, and is even greater than that of beryl, which owes          power             its
to  crystalline texture.
     Inconclusion, the author expresses his hope that the principles

mitted.   In seven hours the dog had a natural motion. Its pulse
had returned to the natural standard of 140 in a minute, and he ap
peared perfectly recovered from the effects of the experiment.
   After three days, sixty drops of the same infusion were given to
the same dog to swallow.      In two hours he became languid; his
pulse wiry and weak, but still 140 in a minute.     In four hours the
languor was less, the pulse natural. In eight hours he had a natural
motion, and in eleven hours appeared perfectly recovered from this
dose.
   The effects of this medicine upon the dog and upon Sir Everard
Home, as far as they were sensible, were very similar, but differed
in degree. Sir Everard, in consequence of an attack of the gout,
took sixty drops of the Eau medicinale. In two hours he became hot
and thirsty. In three hours the pain became tolerable while the limb
was at rest.    In seven hours he had a confined motion from the
bowels.    There was a degree of nausea. The pulse, which is natu
rally 80, was lowered to 60 in a minute, with occasional intermis
sions.   In ten hours little remained except some degree of languor,
with the pulse at 70, which on the following morning was restored
to its natural standard, with removal of all symptoms of gout.
   If these observations shall be confirmed, says the author, we must
conclude that the different kinds of substances which produce specific
diseases are first carried into the circulation, in the same manner as
mineral and animal poisons; and that the medicines by which they
are acted upon go through the same course before they produce their
beneficial effects.
An Appendir to     Paper on the Effects of the Colchicum autumnale
                   a
  on Gout.    By Sir Everard Home, Bart. V.P.R.S. Read April 25,
  1816.    [Phil. Trans. 1816, p. 262.]
   In the paper on this subject, lately read to the Society, the author
hoped to establish two facts which seemed to him of primary im
portance; first, that this medicine can be received into the circula
tion without permanent mischief; and secondly, that its beneficial
effects upon gout are produced through that medium; and hence
the sudden relief it gives can, he thinks, be readily explained.
  The criterion by which he judges of the influence of the medicine
is the pulse, which he has found to be invariably diminished ten or
twenty beats in about twelve hours after it is taken; and since this
effect is also produced when the same medicine is injected into a
vein, he was satisfied that in the former instance the lowering of
the pulse depends upon       its
                            arrival into the circulation, and not upon
the state of the stomach.
  The author has since been induced     to try whether the effects ofa
larger quantity injected into the veins would also correspond with
those produced     by   an
                        overdose taken into the stomach.

    There are here many warm springs, of which several are as much
as 8° above the surrounding atmosphere; and one of them was at
90°, while the temperature of the air was only 73°.
    Among the vegetable productions of this country observed by
Mr. Mornay, is one very remarkable for the light which it yields
when cut. It is described as a climbing plant, destitute of leaves,
and without thorns. It contains a milky juice, which exudes as soon
as the plant is wounded, and appears luminous for several seconds.
This juice is extremely acrid, so as to blister the skin, even of
quadrupeds, to which it is applied. It becomes viscid by drying, and
turns of a greenish-yellow colour, appearing to be a gum-resin.
    It is conjectured that this plant may be an Euphorbium ; but as
the author had not the good fortune to find it in flower, he had not
the means of learning with certainty to which tribe of plants it may
belong.
 Observations and Experiments     on the Mass of native Iron found in
    Brasil.    By William Hyde Wollaston, M.D. Sec. R.S. Read
    May 16, 1816. [Phil. Trans. 1816, p. 281.]
    The observations here added as an Appendix to "Mr. Mornay's
 paper, relate to the crystalline texture of the mass, and its magnetic
 qualities.   The experiments were undertaken for the purpose of
 ascertaining the presence of nickel more certainly than Mr. Mornay
 had been enabled to do, and also to discover the quantity of this       in
 gredient.
     The crystalline forms in which this iron breaks, are such as are
 common to many metallic substances; the regular octohedron, tetra
 hedron, or rhomboid, consisting of these two combined.
     With respect to magnetism, it is observed, that the fragments are
 precisely like any pieces of the best soft iron, easily obeying the
 magnet, and instantly assuming polarity, according to the direction
 in which they are placed with reference to the magnetic meridian,
 and as instantly changing it when reversed. And hence it is inferred
 that the magnetic polarity of the mass is solely from similar induc
 tion.
     For detecting the presence of nickel, the author dissolves a very
 small portion in nitric acid, evaporates to dryness; and after dis
 solving the oxide of nickel in pure ammonia, he precipitates by triple
 prussiate of potash.
     But for determining its quantity, he adds sulphuric acid to the
 ammoniacal solution; and after evaporating to dryness, he expels
 the ammoniacal salts by heat, and then dissolves the residuum, which
  is mere sulphate of nickel, and, by crystallization, obtains it in a state
  from which the quantity of metallic nickel can be inferred.       By this
  process he found four per cent. of nickel in this specimen of native

                                   46
iron, and a corresponding     quantity in the scales of oxide detached
from its cavities.
 On Ice found in the bottoms of Rivers. By Thomas Andrew Knight,
   Esq. F.R.S.     In a Letter addressed to the Right Hon. Sir Joseph
   Banks, Bart. G.C.B. P.R.S. Read May 23, 1816. [Phil. Trans.

   The author having witnessed this phenomenon in the course of
last winter in the river Teme, which runs past his residence in Here
fordshire, describes the appearances that he observed, and relates the
circumstances under which they occurred, for the purpose of account
ing for a fact which, though frequently noticed, has not yet been
satisfactorily explained.
   After a night that had been intensely cold, the stones in the rocky
bed of the river glistened with a kind of silvery whiteness, which,
upon examination, arose from numerous spicula of ice adhering to
them, and crossing each other in every direction. The river was not
at that time frozen over in any part, but the temperature of the water
was at the freezing point; and in a mill-pond just above, the water
was replete with millions of spicula of ice, which naturally would
have a tendency to rise and form a crust at the surface; but in fall
ing over a low weir into a narrow channel, numerous eddies, occa
sioned by large projecting stones, constantly carried fresh spicula to
the bottom, where they collected against the surfaces and in the
cavities opposed to the current, especially in those parts where it
became less rapid.
   Had the coldness of the weather continued,      it is conceived that
the ice might have continued to accumulate to much larger quanti
ties, as it had been known to do in the same situation some years
preceding, when the frost was of long duration.
    It was remarked by Mr. Knight, that near the shore the ice that
adhered to stones partly out of the water had a firmer consistence,
although apparently originating from the same source. This ice ex
tended as far as half a yard from the shore, and was three or four
inches below the surface of the water.     This did not melt so rapidly
as that which was deposited at greater distances from the sides, and
at greater depths.
   Although the existence of porous ice in any large quantities may
thus be explained in larger rivers, where there are eddies sufficient
to carry floating spicula in contact with the bottom, yet the author
expresses his doubts respecting large masses of solid ice said to have
been found at the bottoms of deep and sluggish rivers, in which there
are no eddies to cause the descent even of small particles, and no
obvious cause of subsequent consolidation.

On the Formation of Fat in the Intestine of the Tadpole, and on the
  Use of the Yolk in the Formation of the Embryo in the Egg.     By
  Sir Everard  Home,  Bart. V.P.R.S. Read    May  23, 1816. [Phil.
  Trans. 1816, p. 301.]
   From the smallness of tadpoles in this country, they have not at
tracted the notice of naturalists so much as their peculiarities deserve.
But those of the Rana paradora of Surinam being of a much larger
size, are fitter subjects for observation. The tadpole of this frog bears
so strong a resemblance to a fish, that it is commonly sold as such
for the use of the table. But as these are not to be had here in suf
ficient quantity for examination, the author had recourse to the com
mon tadpole of this country.
    This animal, as soon as it leaves the ovum, has ten filaments pro
jecting from the neck on each side, which answer the purpose of gills.
In the young shark, while yet in the egg, there are twenty-four                                         si
milar filaments to answer the same purpose.              In the common newt
also is a similar apparatus, but the number is only three on each
side. In each instance this structure is but temporary, and drops off
when the permanent structure of lungs in the frog, and of gills in
the shark, is completely formed.
    During the growth of the tadpole                       its
                                               abdomen becomes distended,
the intestine being then very capacious, and filled throughout its
whole extent with          soft substance, that burns with
                            a                                          vegetable      a

is  accumulated     quantity
                       a          fat of    yellow colour, inclosed

   In the Blue-bottle Fly the suckers are two on each foot, imme
diately under the root of each claw. Their form is funnel-shaped,
with a narrow neck; when not in use they are contracted, and ap

laterally from each other.

any other animal known to the author.         There is one point to which

  The author observes generally, respecting the Vermes of Linnaeus,
that the blood is conveyed by veins to the respiratory organs, and
from thence by arteries to the heart, in which they differ from fishes;
while they differ, on the other hand, from Mollusca in general, by
having red blood.
   The Sepia has been thought to have a circulation peculiar to itself;
but the author remarks, that it bears a close resemblance to that of
the Teredo, in having two auricles which transmit the blood received
from the bronchiae to the heart, but differs in this, that there are also
two auricles that receive the venous blood, and transmit it to the re
spiratory organs.
Observations on the Hirudo vulgaris.  By James Rawlins Johnson,
  M.D. F.L.S. &c. Communicated by the Right Hon. Sir Joseph
  Banks, Bart. G.C.B. P.R.S.    ead November 14, 1816.    [Phil.
  Trans.  1817, p. 13.]
   The animal here described under the name of Hirudo vulgaris, is
the same that has been denominated by Linnaeus and others, Hirudo
octoculata, on account of the number of its eyes; but since the               Hi
rudo tessulata has also eight eyes, it has been thought proper to
change that name for one not liable to mislead.
   This little animal is found very commonly in rivulets, attached to
the under surface of stones.       Its length varies from one inch to an
inch and an half. The back is of a dark brown, marked with nu
merous transverse lines, and a central line longitudinally of a black
colour. On the belly also is a longitudinal black line, but the rest
is of a yellowish-green colour.
   In structure this animal very much resembles the Hirudo medici
nalis, having the anus at the extremity of the tail, and four longitu
dinal vessels destined to convey the circulating blood, one dorsal, one
abdominal, and two lateral. In these, eight pulsations are observable
in the course of a minute, but not derived from any central organ
corresponding to the heart of other animals.
   Its food consists of very small worms, which it swallows whole.
   The object of the present communication is to record such pecu
liarities as the author has observed in        its
                                                 mode          of

which     hehas paid attention during the last two summers.

                             the 18th, both    ofwhich were subsequently

uterus. When the animal is about to produce a capsule, it fixes itself
by the tail, and in the course of ten minutes is seen to become much
distended in the region of the uterus, but contracted both above and
below that part. The swelling at first has the ordinary dark colour
of the animal, but in a few minutes a film is seen to separate, and
become of a milky white colour, from the contents of the uterus,

                          have come under his own observation, the
employment      galvanism has been almost uniformly attended with

without complaint, the relief    often perceived    five minutes, and                        in

                                             56
generally in less than a quarter of an hour. The battery employed
consisted of 4-inch plates, charged with a mixture of muriatic acid
and water, in the proportion of one acid to twenty of water.
   With regard to the number of plates, there are few persons who
cannot bear so many as eight pair, and few who require more than
twice that number.       Dr. Philip generally begins with a very weak
power, and gradually increases it till the patient begins to feel some
degree of uneasiness, when it is easy to move the wire of communi
cation backward a few divisions, and again return after a temporary
remission of the excitement.      The application was made through the
medium of two thin plates of metal dipped in water and applied wet,
one to the nape of the neck, and the other to the pit of the stomach,
in order that the galvanic fluid might pass through the chest as nearly
as possible in the direction of the nerves; and with respect to the
position of the two ends of the battery, it was found expedient to
place the positive wire to the nape of the neck, and the negative wire
to the pit of the stomach.     The operation was discontinued as soon
as the  patient felt his  breathing   become free; for it was not found
that continuance for a     greater  length of time had any tendency to
prevent a recurrence of the symptoms.
   In those cases of spasmodic asthma in which galvanism has been
applied by the author, it has failed to give relief; but where the spas
modic paroxysm has been succeeded by habitual difficulty of breath
ing, there galvanism did give immediate, but temporary relief.        It
appears, however, that most is to be expected from this remedy in
those cases of habitual asthma which are the least complicated with
any other disease.
   In order to be assured that the effects above described, as appa
rently arising from galvanism, might not, in fact, be owing to an im
pression on the mind during          employment, Dr. Philip endeavoured
                                       its
in various instances      deceive his patients,

the skin without    really completing    the  circuit;  but they  invariably
received   no relief from such    experiments,  and  very soon felt the cus

established     the usual way.

      one instance the galvanic current was directed solely along the

Account of some Experiments on the Torpedo electricus, at LaRochelle.
  By John T. Todd, Esq. Communicated by Sir Everard Home, Bart.
   V.P.R.S. Read December 5, 1816. [Phil. Trans. 1817, p. 32.]
     Having upon a former occasion submitted to the Royal Society
some experiments and observations on the Torpedo electricus, the
author is now induced to offer a continuation of his researches; and
in the present communication describes a series of experiments un
dertaken with a view of ascertaining whether that animal possesses
any power either of exciting the electrical organs, or of interrupting
their action independent of the large system of nerves, by which they
are directly supplied.     The commencement only of this investigation
is now submitted to the Society, the author having been deterred
from      its
          completion                by
                           untoward circumstances.
    His experiments were performed immediately after the fish was
taken, and while      was vivacious and active.
                           it                      When the lateral car
tilages and all their appertaining muscles were divided, the shocks
seemed        as
            potent     before such operation.

of  the electrical organ  sensibly diminished       removing          by

one half      each electrical organ was removed, the power
                of                                                 giving                of
shocks was retained by the remainder.
   These experiments were performed on two torpedos; the one
eight, and the other eighteen inches       length.    The results were
                                                         in                                            in
all main points similar; but the smaller fish became,        might have         as
been  expected,   most   speedily exhausted.
     In   third torpedo, between nine and ten inches long, an
          a                                                                                        in
cision was made round the circumference            both organs,       of                     so   as   to
leave      attachment between them and the animal, except by the
           no
nerves; but the power           giving shocks was not impaired
                                         of                           this                    by
operation.     The author remarks that the nerves supplying the elec
trical organs      the torpedo arise exclusively from the medulla ob
                      of
longata, notwithstanding the long course which some            them take          of
before  they  reach the   organs.

in a damp state, in consequence of the unpropitious weather, during

other analogous vegetable substances in the absence of extractive

of pure tan and gallic acid; that the same circumstance renders

produced by heat, upon combustion and explosion.     A volume of air
at 212° is expanded to 2:25 volumes. At a dull red heat       proba                                  its

under the idea that the heat acquired by the mixed gas               passing                     in

sudden extrication of nitrogen, ammonia, and aqueous vapour.
On     the   Parallar of the fired Stars. By John Pond, Esq., Astrono
     mer Royal,    F.R.S. Read February 20, 1817. [Phil. Trans. 1817,

     Dr. Brinkley, of the Observatory of Dublin, having noticed for
 several years past a periodical deviation of several fixed stars from
 their mean places, strongly indicating the existence in them of an
nual parallax, the author was induced to institute a series of obser
vations upon the subject, the results of which are submitted to the
Royal Society in the present communication.           Being unable to de
vote the mural      circle, erected at the   Royal  Observatory   in 1812,
entirely to this investigation, the Astronomer Royal employed two
ten-feet telescopes, fixed to stone piers, and directed to the parti
cular stars whose parallax was suspected, and furnished with micro
meters for the purpose of comparing them with other stars passing
through the same field. The question of parallax              theoretically     is,
speaking, rather curious than important; but with regard                the                    to

Brinkley      have the greatest parallax, the discordance between the
                 to
summer and winter observations          not less than 0".5, and scarcely
                                               is

than those found by Dr. Brinkley, they appear to be equally inde
pendent of accidental error. The author, however, is not inclined
to refer the cause of the differences to parallax, for they are sensibly
increased by direct comparison with an opposite star, as with Capella,
 in which the maximum of parallax is nearly as great as in
 a. Aquilae; and it is very unlikely that the parallax of one star should
exceed '5", and that of the other be an insensible quantity.        More
 over, all these stars pass the meridian about the time of the winter
 solstice at their maximum of parallax; and in proportion as stars
 do not possess this property, both the Astronomer Royal and Dr.
 Brinkley either find a much smaller discordance, or none at all; the
 author accordingly is inclined to look for some explanation of the
 difficulties in this peculiar circumstance.
    Tables are annexed to this paper, showing the method of com
 puting the equation, or index error, applicable to the north polar
distances.                            -

    Being induced last autumn to suspect that the discordance in
 favour of parallax, before met with, might arise from variation of
 temperature, the author endeavoured last winter to keep the interior
 and exterior of the Observatory of the same temperature, which the
 mildness of the season easily enabled him to do.         From the 1st of
 July 1816 to March 1817, the index error of the instrument suffered
 no variation; and therefore the objections urged by Dr. Brinkley
 were done away. Under these circumstances the observations of
 a. Lyrae, y Draconis, a Cygni, and a Aquilae, showed no indication of
 periodical variation.     Whether the fixed instruments lately erected
for this   investigation  will confirm the above result remains to be
 determined.
 An Account of some Fossil Remains of        the Rhinoceros, discovered by
     Mr. Whitby,      in a Cavern inclosed in the Lime-stone Rock, from
     which he is forming the Break-water at Plymouth. By Sir Everard
     Home, Bart. V.P.R.S. Read February 27, 1817. [Phil. Trans.
     1817, p. 176.]
     Having been requested by Sir Joseph Banks carefully to preserve
 such organic remains as might be found in the quarries whence the
 supplies of limestone for the break-water at Plymouth are drawn,
 Mr. Whitby, who has the superintendance of the undertaking,
 transmitted, in November 1816, a box of fossil bones, which form
 the subject of the present communication.
     According to Mr. Whitby's report, they were found in a cavern
 of the solid limestone rock, fifteen feet wide, forty-five long, and
 twelve deep. It was filled with clay, and the bones lay about three
 feet above the bottom.       This cavern is about seventy feet below the

                                  67
surface of the rock, and four feet above high-water mark; and al
though considerable pains were taken to discover its outlet, no com
 munication of the kind was found.
   Mr. Whitby mentions that caverns have been frequently dis
covered in this limestone, the walls of which have been encrusted
with stalactitic concretions; but in the present case no such appear
ance was observed in any part of the cavity,        a proof, says the
author, that no opening in the rock from above had ever been closed
up by the process of infiltration. In further confirmation of this
circumstance, Mr. Whitby has stated that in the contract for quar
rying there are two prices; one for rock, and another for clay, earth,
and rubbish; and that two officers constantly attend, one for the
Crown and the other on the part of the contractors, who measure the
contents of all caverns containing clay or other soft materials; and
that these officers distinctly state that the rock surrounding the-
cavern was equally hard with the other parts.
   All the bones discovered in this place belong to the rhinoceros,
and are evidently parts of the skeletons of three different animals.
They are in a most perfect state of preservation, and every part of
the surface entire, to a degree very seldom observed in fossil bones;
and as the teeth of the rhinoceros differ both in form and structure
from those of every other known animal, there was no kind of diffi
culty in recognising them. Every portion of the bones also possessed
some characteristic feature proving it to have belonged to the same
animal.    The animals to which these bones belonged seem to have
been   nearly of the same size, and very large, for on comparing the
fossil metacarpal bone, with that of the largest rhinoceros ever seen
in this country, the skeleton of which is in Mr. Brookes's collection,
that of the former was 8% inches long and 2% inches broad, while in
the latter the length was only  7%  inches and the breadth 2; inches.
This skeleton stands 5 feet 8 inches high. It deserves remark
that all the bones found in this cavern belong to the same species
of animal; for although great pains were taken to ascertain
whether there were any others than those sent to London, none
were discovered.)
   Some comparative chemical analyses of different fossil bones are
annexed to this paper, from which it appears that those above de
scribed are remarkably free from extraneous earthy substances, and
consist almost entirely of phosphate and carbonate of lime, with only
slight traces of animal matter: whereas most of the fossil bones dis
covered in the blue clay at Brentford, and in the argillaceous lime
stone at Lyme in Dorsetshire, yielded considerable portions of alu
minous and siliceous earth.

Description      of     a thermometrical Barometer                      for      measuring Altitudes.
  By the Rev. Francis John Hyde Wollaston, B.D. F.R.S.                                           Read
  March 6, 1817. [Phil. Trans. 1817, p. 183.]
   The author's attention having been drawn to the variations in the
heat of boiling water, as corresponding with changes in atmospherical
pressure and in the height of the barometer, he was led to construct
the instrument described in the present paper, for the purpose of
measuring heights with greater accuracy and convenience than by the
common barometer, or by the methods formerly devised by Fahren
heit and Cavallo.
   The author constructed his thermometer with different scales, from
an uncertainty how far their sensibility might be carried; and in one
instance the bore of the tube was so minute, and the ball so large,
that every degree on Fahrenheit's scale was equal to ten inches. The
instrument, however, with which the greatest number of observations
were made, had a scale of 3.98 inches to every degree, and each de
gree is divided into 100 parts upon the scale, and into 1000 by a
vernier.   On comparing this thermometer with a good barometer,
it was found that the two instruments agreed equally well in all parts
between 30-68 inches and 28:23 inches.                                 The result was, that                   a   dif
ference of 1° of Fahrenheit's scale is occasioned by 0-589 inch on the
barometer; 30.603 inches (corrected) on the barometer, = 213°367
on the thermometer, and 28 191 inches barometer, =209°263 ther
mometer.
   Having thus ascertained the delicacy and capability of the instru
ment, the author proceeds to describe the best mode of constructing
it,which    further illustrated by
            is                        annexed drawing. To the ver

thermometer for the measurement of the greatest heights, the author
details some experiments upon altitudes made with an instrument,
552 parts upon the scale of which were equal to 530 feet in altitude.
With this instrument boiled on the counter of a bookseller's shop in
Paternoster-row, estimated between four and five feet above the foot
pavement on the north side of St. Paul's Churchyard, and boiled
again in the gilt gallery of the cathedral, there was a difference of
254 parts; the corrected height thus indicated therefore = 272.64
feet.  General Roy makes the gallery above the north pavement to
be 281 feet, which, allowing five feet for the difference of station,
brings the author's estimate to 267 feet, differing only four feet; or
by another calculation, founded on General Roy's statement, the dif
ference is less than two feet.
Observations on the Analogy which subsists between the Calculus of
  Functions and other branches of Analysis.   By Charles Babbage,
  Esq. M.A. F.R.S.     Read April 17, 1817.    [Phil. Trans. 1817,
 p. 197.]
  At    the commencement of this paper the author states the advan
tages which may be derived from the employment of analogical rea
soning in mathematics, and recommends it as a very useful guide to
new discoveries: he then proceeds to point out the striking resem
blance which subsists between several parts of common algebra and
the integral calculus, and similar parts of the calculus of functions.
   Mr. Babbage then notices certain fractions which, by peculiar re
lations among the functions of which they consist, become evanescent.
The true values of these fractions are ascertained, and they are ap
plied to the solution of a class of functional equations which the
author had solved in a former paper, from which the following result
is obtained:—“Whenever the mode of solution there adopted seems
to fail, the failure is apparent only, and the general solution may al
ways be deduced from it.”
   Several points of resemblance between the integral calculus and
that of functions, are then noticed; and a remarkable analogy be
tween a method of integrating differential equations, and a mode of
solving functional equations, is pointed out; in both cases the ope
rations are performed by multiplying by a factor, whose form is to
be determined by another equation.         Some equations are given in
which this method is     successful, and the obstacles to itsgeneral ap
plication are pointed out   as demanding further inquiry.              -

Note respecting the Demonstration of the Binomial Theorem inserted
  in the last Volume of the Philosophical Transactions. By Thomas

  Read April 17, 1817. [Phil. Trans. 1817, p. 245.]
  In this note the author expresses his regret at finding that the de
monstration of the binomial theorem, and the first proposition of his
paper on the construction of logarithms, formerly presented to the
Royal Society, had been previously given by Mr. Spence in his
Essay on Logarithmic Transcendents.      This author, however, says
Mr. Knight, is not particularly happy in the manner of developing
the kind of functions treated of in his preface, and therefore in the
present note gives a solution of a class of equations of which Mr.
Spence has considered a particular case, without however resolving.

  No physiological             subject has attracted more attention                          than the
first formation of the embryo in the class Mammalia; and although
it has been ascertained that an ovum is formed in the ovarium of the
quadruped, the circumstances respecting                            its

failed in  this  inquiry;    Haighton   and Cruikshank were equally unsuc

the stomach and     bowels,   must   depend   upon   some distinct substance
contained    in the sediment.
   To ascertain this point several experiments were instituted upon
dogs, tending not merely         confirm Sir Everard's opinion upon this
                                      to

Eau medicinale with the infusion of Colchicum autumnale.             The ex
periments were made by Mr. Gatecombe, with the following results.
Thirty drops      ofEau medicinale, with the deposit injected into the
jugular vein, produced       purging                                One hun

dred and    sixty drops  administered       the same way, killed the dog                            in
six hours, and there were appearances                     of
                                                 violent inflammation     the                  in
bowels.     The same quantity taken by the mouth, produced nearly
similar effects. One hundred and sixty drops                            of
                                                          the vinous infusion
of  colchicum, without sediment, produced purging and vomiting, from
which the animal recovered. Two hundred drops produced the same
                                                                                                    it of
effect, but 300 drops produced effects corresponding with those
the 160    of  Eau medicinale. The dog died            nine hours. inHence
appears that the Eau medicinale produces double the effect                the                  of
vinous infusion        of
                       colchicum.      Six grains                  of

vinous infusion, produced vomiting and purging, with blood, which
lasted twenty-four hours.

Upon the Ertent of the Expansion and Contraction of Timber in dif
  ferent directions relative to the Position of the Medulla of the Tree.
   By Thomas Andrew Knight, Esq. F.R.S. In a Letter addressed
   to the Right Hon. Sir Joseph Banks, Bart. G.C.B. P.R.S. Read
   May 8, 1817. [Phil. Trans. 1817, p. 269.]
   Most of the attempts which have been made by writers on vege
table physiology, to account for the force with which the sap of trees
ascends during the spring, having proved unsatisfactory and inade
quate, Mr. Knight was induced some years ago to suggest the ex
pansion and contraction of the cellular processes proceeding from
the bark to the medulla, and which he called the true or silver grain
of the wood, as concerned in this process.
   The present paper contains further experiments, showing this power
to be active in living trees, and were made on many kinds of timber
with nearly similar results.     Some boards of ash and beech wood
were cut in opposite directions relative to their medulla, so that the
convergent cellular processes crossed the surfaces of some of them at
right angles, and were parallel with the surfaces of others. These
were placed, under similar circumstances, in a warm room, and the
former warped about ten times more than the latter, contracting
nearly 14 per cent. in breadth, while the others only contracted 3%
per cent. During his experiment Mr. Knight was led to infer that
the medullary canal must be liable to considerable changes of dia
meter, as the moisture of wood increases or diminishes. To ascertain
this, parts of the stems of young trees were carefully dried, the me
dulla was removed, and metal cylinders driven with force into the
empty space. The pieces of wood were then suffered to absorb
moisture,    and the medullary canal became so much enlarged- as to
suffer the cylinders to fall out.
   Mr. Knight conceives that this kind of expansion often produces
those rifts in trees referred to wind or frost.   That winds cannot be
the   cause,  seems obvious from the circumstance of pollard-oak-trees
being almost always rifted, upon which they can have little power;
and the frost of this climate is seldom sufficiently intense to congeal
the winter sap in trees.
   The force with which this cellular substance of timber expands, is
more than adequate to such effects, and often overcomes a pressure
of many tons; and as it is in action in the living tree, Mr. Knight is
of opinion that it is the agent by which the powerful propulsion of
the sap observed by Hales is effected.
 Observations on the Temperature of the Ocean and Atmosphere, and on
    the Density of Sea-water, made during a Voyage to Ceylon.       In a
   Letter to Sir Humphry Davy, LL.D. F.R.S. By John Davy, M.D.
    F.R.S. Read May 22, 1817. [Phil. Trans. 1817, p. 275.]
    The experiments on the specific gravity of sea-water, detailed in
 this paper, were partly conducted at sea, and partly after the author's

                                                                 74.
   arrival at Ceylon; and the results lead him to adopt the opinion that
   the ocean resembles the atmosphere in being, catteris paribus, nearly
   of the same specific gravity throughout. The water used in the ex
   periment was always taken from the surface of the ocean. The vari
   ation of specific gravity was most observable when the water was
   rough and agitated, and seemed in one instance diminished by heavy
   Taln.
      Dr. Davy doubts whether a modern traveller of high authority is
   correct in supposing that a peculiar specific gravity belongs to the
   water of each zone; for in his own experiments, the water taken in
   latitude 0°12' S., and 22° 36' S., was of similar specific gravity, as
   also that taken at 34° 25' S., and that washing the shores of Co
   lumbo.
                The trials of the temperature of the air and water were, during
  the greater part of the voyage, made every two hours, night and day.
  The variations of atmospheric temperature, says the author, follow
  the course of the sun. They are pretty considerable whilst he is
  above the horizon, and very insignificant during the night.      At a
  great distance from land, and with a steady wind between and bor
  dering upon the tropics, the diurnal variation of atmospheric tempe
  rature appeared perfectly regular;      maximum precisely       noon,its                                    at

Observations on the Genus Ocythoë of Rafinesque, with a Description
  of a new Species. By William Elford Leach, M.D. F.R.S. Read
  June 5, 1817. [Phil. Trans. 1817, p. 293.]
   Several ancient and modern writers have described a species of
Ocythoë often found in the Paper Nautilus, and have considered it as
belonging to that shell. Sir Joseph Banks and other naturalists
have maintained a contrary opinion, and have considered the Ocythoé
as a parasitical inhabitant of the Argonaut's shell. Rafinesque, whose
opportunities for observation were commensurate with his talent in
observing, regarded it as a peculiar genus, allied to the Sepia octo
podia of Linnaeus, and as a parasitical resident of the above-mentioned
shell.
   The observations of the late Mr. John Cranch, zoologist to the
Congo expedition, have, in the opinion of Dr. Leach, removed all
doubt upon this subject.     In the Gulf of Guinea he took several
specimens of a new species of Ocythoë in a small Argonauta, and
placed two of them in a vessel of sea-water, so as to observe their
motions.   When adhering to the basin the shell could be removed;
they had the power both of retiring within it and of entirely quitting
it.  One having left the shell lived several hours, and showed      de                             no
sire   return. Others quitted the shell while taking up the net.

   From the annexed chemical examination of the Javanese swallow's
nest, it appears to possess a close analogy to albumen; differing
from the ordinary properties of that principle in being easily soluble
in liquid ammonia, and in the solution of                                 of its

of foliated membranes.

On the great Strength given to Ships of War by the application of
  Diagonal Braces.   By Robert Seppings, Esq. F.R.S.   Read No
  vember 27, 1817.    [Phil. Trans. 1818, p. 1.]
    The principle of applying diagonal frame-work to ships of war
was first partially and successfully adopted in the Kent, of 74 guns,
in the year 1805, and since that period has been successfully em
ployed in the construction of thirty-eight sail of the line and thirty
frigates. These circumstances might be deemed conclusive as to the
advantages of the new system; but as the Royal Society have
already published this author's account of it at a very early period
of      its
       adoption,              he

as in
             the correctness                   of
   far    his knowledge extends, has never been previously applied,

A Memoir       on the Geography     ofthe North-eastern part of             Asia, and on
  the Question whether Asia         and America are contiguous,             or are sepa
  rated by the Sea.  By Captain James Burney,                    F.R.S.       Read         De
  cember 11, 1817.    [Phil. Trans. 1818, p. 9..]
   The opinion that the continents of Asia and America are sepa
rated by the sea, seems first to have been inferred in 1736 by Pro
fessor Müller, and to have been founded upon some papers found at
that time in Siberia, relating to the celebrated voyage of Deschneer,
who in 1648 first discovered the sea east of Kamtschatka.        The
question, however, seems to have been undecided at the period of
Behring's voyage, as we learn from his instructions given by Peter
the Great; and the Asiatic side only of Behring's Strait was disco
vered by that navigator: for the coast of Asia being there found to
take a western direction, it had the effect of giving an impression of
the total separation of Asia and America. After noticing several
other attempts to determine the north-eastern limits of Asia previous
to the arrival of Captain Cook in the sea of Kamtschatka, Captain
Burney proceeds to the observations of that navigator.
   The first extraordinary circumstance was a sudden disappearance
of the tides in Behring's Strait. Thence Captain Cook coasted the
land of America to the north and north-east till stopped, in 70° 40'
north latitude, by a floating body of ice.   He then stood westward
from the coast of Asia, keeping in as high a latitude as the ice would
permit. The deepest soundings in this sea did not exceed 30 fathoms
in latitude 68°45', mid-way between the coasts of Asia and America.
The soundings decreased to the northward, and did not increase in
running from the coast of America westward, as is usual in running
from land.   These, and other peculiarities, gave so much the cha
racter of a mediterranean sea, that some on board, says the author,
were of opinion that we were inclosed by land to the north, and
that Asia and America were there united.
   Captain Burney next notices the expedition of Commodore                                 Bil
lings; in which, however, no new facts respecting the main question
were discovered.
  In this uncertainty respecting the north-east termination of Asia,
the author gives one observation of importance,—which          that the     is,
Tschuktzki people        do
                      not appear     know the extent

   In Captain Krusenstern's    Memoir on the Lands of the Icy Sea,
it is related that 250 versts of the coast of a northern land was very
lately explored, which has been called New Siberia; and at the
easternmost part of this land the coast took a direction to the north
west, which appeared to render it not probable that it joined the
Tschuktzki land: but nevertheless, the coast, in Captain Burney's
opinion, may turn to the east; and the Russian discoverer Heder
stroom considers that this is the case, and that New Siberia is a
prolongation of America. The Tschuktzki people, says the author,
would not explore further north than afforded a prospect of reward
for their pains, which has led them to some of the islands of the Icy
Sea, though there is no evidence of their having yet reached New
Siberia. On the whole, Captain Burney is of opinion that Asia and
America are part of one and the same continent.
Additional Facts respecting the Fossil Remains of an Animal, on the
  subject of which two Papers have been printed in the Philosophical
  Transactions, showing that the Bones of the Sternum resemble those
  of the Ornithorhynchus paradoxus.     By Sir Everard Home, Bart.
  V.P.R.S.     Read January 22, 1818.    [Phil. Trans. 1818, p. 24.]
  In an engraving annexed to Sir Everard Home's first paper upon
the above subject, a portion of bone is shown lying upon the scapula,
which he considered as a portion of a rib accidentally brought there;
but which he now finds to be nearly in its original situation, and is
found to resemble nearly the clavicular bone in birds, as far as regards
relative position.
   The bones of the sternum were first pointed out to the author by
Mr. Buckland; and their discovery destroys the analogy between this
fossil animal and cartilaginous fishes.     On comparing the general
form of the sternum with that of the      Ornithorhynchus   paradorus, a
general agreement was discovered between them : they differ in the
fossil skeleton having a clavicular bone, which is wanting in the
other, and in the Ornithorhynchus having a long process from the
scapula, which the fossil bone wants.
   The fossil animal is ascertained to have lived in water, by the form
of its vertebrae; and from the shape of the chest, it must have breathed
air; in these respects resembling the Ornithorhynchus: but the mode
of progressive motion differs: that of the one being the same as in
fishes, that of the other the same as in the whale tribe.
   Another bone is described in this paper, probably belonging to the
same animal, and which the author regards as the first bone of the
pectoral fin; which, however, cannot be absolutely determined till
the bones of the pelvis are found.
   To find any analogy, says the author, between the bones of animals
now alive and those of races long extinct, is matter of no small cu
riosity; but to have discovered an analogy between the peculiarities

An Account of Erperiments for determining the Length of the Pendu
  lum vibrating Seconds in the Latitude of London.   By Capt. Henry
  Kater, F.R.S.    Read   January   29, 1818.   [Phil. Trans. 1818,
  p. 33.]
     Ithas long been a desideratum in science, to determine the pre
cise length of a pendulum vibrating seconds in a given latitude.
Most of those who have undertaken this inquiry have endeavoured
to find the centre of oscillation; but as this depends upon the regu
lar figure and uniform density of the body employed, it involves
difficulties which may be considered as insurmountable.                Despairing,
therefore, of success in        any  attempt founded upon such principle,
Captain Kater endeavoured to discover some other property of the
pendulum less liable to objections; and was so fortunate as to per
ceive one which promised an unexceptionable result.
   It is known that the centres of suspension and oscillation are re
ciprocal; or, in other words, if a body be suspended by its centre of
                     its
                  former point
                                                                                                           in of
oscillation,                          suspension then becomes the centre
                                         of
oscillation, and the vibrations          both positions will
                                              in                    performed         be
equal times.      Now        as
                             the distance               of
                                                the centre       oscillation fromof
the point       suspension depends upon the figure
                 of                                                the body em    of
ployed,    ifthe  arrangement             of     its

the centre       oscillation will also suffer
                    of                              change.     Suppose,

ing about twenty-two inches beyond the knife-edges. Three weights
are employed for the adjustments.            The great weight immoveably               is
fixed beyond the knife-edges; the second weight slides                     the bar,             on

 near the knife-edge, at the opposite end, and may be fixed at plea
  sure; the third weight is a small slider, intended to move near the
 centre of the bar, upon which are engraved divisions of one twentieth
 of an inch, seen through an opening in the slider. The support of
 the pendulum consisted of agate planes bedded in bell-metal.
    In proceeding to the details of the experiments, the author acknow
 ledges his obligations to Henry Browne, Esq. F.R.S., who permitted
 him to use his house in Portland-place, and his excellent clocks, for
 the purposes of the investigation. The greatest daily variation of the
 clock used as a standard of comparison did not exceed three tenths
 of a second between the months of February and July.
    By the method of coincidences which Captain Kater employed, the
number of vibrations made by the pendulum in twenty-four hours
might be obtained in the space of eight minutes to within half a
second of the truth; and the usual correction was applied for the
extent of the arc of vibration.
   The pendulum being suspended with the great weight above, the
number of vibrations in twenty-four hours was determined ; and if
it differed when the pendulum was inverted, it was equalized by
moving the second weight, and finally adjusted by the slider, every
allowance being made for the temperature, and the height of the
barometer being noted.     Thus the number of vibrations in twenty
four  hours, of a pendulum   equal in length to the distance between
the knife-edges at a given temperature and barometrical height, was
ascertained.
   The next sections of Captain Kater's communication refer to the
apparatus and methods employed for the measurement of the distance
between the knife-edges; for the comparison of the British standard
measures of the highest authority; and to the expansion of the pen
dulum, which was found to be "00000996 of    length for each degree      its
of Fahrenheit's thermometer.
   After describing the methods        deducing the length
                                                       of      the pen                          of

Account    of Experiments made on the Strength of Materials. By
    George Rennie, jun. Esq.      In a Letter to Thomas Young, M.D.
    For. Sec. R.S. Read       February 12, 1818.    [Phil. Trans. 1818,
    p. 118.]
    After taking a cursory view of the labours of others in this depart
ment of mechanical inquiry, Mr. Rennie proceeds to give an account
of the apparatus which he employed, and of the result of his own
experiments. Of the resistances opposed to the simple strains which
may disturb the quiescent state of a body, the principal are: the re
pulsive force, whereby it resists compression; and the force of cohe
sion, whereby it resists extension.    On the former, with few excep
tions, there is scarcely anything on record. Lagrange, in his Memoir
on the Force of Springs, published in 1760, represents the moment
of elasticity by a constant quantity, without indicating the relation
of this value to the size of the spring: but in the Memoir of 1770, on
the Forms of Columns, when he considers a body whose dimensions
and thickness are variable, he makes the moment of elasticity propor
tional to the fourth power of the radius:–but all these calculations,
says Mr. Rennie, are inapplicable to columns under common circum
stances.     The results of experiments are also extremely discordant;
for it is deduced from those of Reynolds, that the power required to
crush a cubic quarter of an inch of cast iron is 200 tons, whereas in
the author's experiments upon cubes of the same size, the amount
never exceeded five tons; and although Mr. Reynolds probably em
ployed metal cast at the furnace of Maidley Wood, which is very
strong, yet this circumstance can have been but of little importance
compared with the great disproportion of results.
    Mr. Rennie employed four kinds of iron: the first taken from the
centre of a large block, similar in appearance to what is usually
called gun metal; the second from a small casting, close-grained, and
of a dull gray colour; the third, horizontally cast iron, in bars three
eighths of an inch square and eight inches long; the fourth, similar
bars cast vertically.    It appears from the annexed tables that the
vertical castings are stronger than those taken from the block.
    Some miscellaneous experiments relating to the different kinds of
wood and stone are also added to those on the metals. They show that
little dependence can be placed on the specific gravity of the stone;
neither is hardness to be regarded as a characteristic of strength. In
the rupture of amorphous stones, Mr. Rennie remarks, that pyra
mids are formed, having for their base the upper side of the cube
next the lever, the action of which displaces the sides of the cubes
precisely as   if a wedge had operated between them.

  The subject of recurring series, says the author, has been almost
exhausted; but there is a class of series nearly allied to them, which
contain a species of functions, which he calls circulating functions,

The Croonian Lecture.    On the Changes the Blood undergoes in the
  act of Coagulation.   By  Sir Everard Home, Bart. V.P.R.S. Read
  November   20,  1817.    [Phil. Trans. 1818, p. 172.]
   After paying a tribute of applause to the talents of Mr. Bauer, as
a  microscopical observer, the author proceeds to estimate the size of
the globules in human blood, 16 of which, when enveloped in their
colouring matter, occupy the space of the 160,000th part of a
square inch, so that 2,560,000 would be required to cover the super
ficial inch; but when the colouring matter is removed, 25 occupy
the 160,000th part of an inch, which gives 4,000,000 to the square
inch. The readiness with which the colouring matter is removed
                                                   is 3 its

                        important influence upon its subsequent tex
ture, and therefore observed what happened during the coagulation

coagulum formed upon the surface, air was then disengaged, which
passed     every direction through the serum, without interfering
          in
with the globules, and formed    beautiful net-work a   anastomosing                 of

nexed drawings.      It explains, says the author, the important change
which the blood undergoes after extravasation in living animals, and
leaves no difficulty in accounting for          becoming vascular by re       its
ceiving the red blood into the tubes thus prepared.

 On the Laws of Polarization and Double Refraction in regularly Crystal
   lized Bodies.    By David Brewster, LL.D. F.R.S. Lond. and Edin.

   Read January 15, 1818. [Phil. Trans. 1818, p. 199.]
      In the different inquiries which the author has already laid before
this Society, his attention was often directed to the phenomena of
regular crystals; but he only lately succeeded in reducing under a
general principle               all
                        those complex appearances which result from
the combined action of more than one axis of double refraction.   In
this paper Dr. Brewster gives     general view     the present state         of
                                                                                                                 of of

the other a plate which gave rings of the same size as the plate of
calcareous spar.    But when we combine a system of rings produced
by a crystal of zircon, with the system produced by calcareous spar,
a different effect is produced; and the system, instead of being                                           di
minished, is increased, and is equal to that which would have been
produced by a thin plate of calcareous spar, whose thickness is equal
to the difference of the thicknesses of the plate of calcareous spar
employed, and the plate of calcareous spar that would give rings of
the same size as those given by the zircon alone.         In the section
“on crystals with two or more axes of polarization,” Dr. Brewster
observes that, although M. Biot considered mica as the only mineral
possessing the compound structure indicating two axes, he had found
the same structure in topaz, nitre, tartrate of potash and soda, sul
phate of potash, acetate of lead, and mother-of-pearl, as early as 1813;
and he points out the means of deducing the number of axes in crystals
from their primitive forms.    Dr. Brewster expresses the general law
of the tints for crystals with one or more axes in the following man
ner.    The tint produced at any point of the sphere by the joint action
of two awes is equal to the diagonal of a parallelogram whose sides
represent the tints, and whose angle is double the angle formed by the
                                                                                            -

   The fourth and fifth sections of this paper relate to the resolution
and combination of polarizing forces, and the reduction of      crystals                        all
to  those with two     more oraxes; and     the polarizing to

crystals that have the cube, the regular octohedron, and the rhom
boidal dodecahedron for their primitive form.             The sixth and con
cluding section describes the artificial imitation               the classes    of   all                   of

which he could only explain by referring them to parallax. Among
these stars, a Aquilae exhibited the greatest change of place.
   In consequence of the Astronomer Royal having doubted the cor
rectness of the author's conclusions upon this point, he has anxiously
engaged in observations relating to it during the last sixteen months;
and although the results in respect to 2. Lyrae and to Arcturus have
not been very uniform, the recent observations on a Cygni are consis
tent with the former ones, and exhibit the same discordance between
the summer and winter observations as before. In regard to 2 Aquilae
also, the observations detailed in the present paper are remarkably
coincident with those formerly detailed; and the author thinks that
it is to this star we must look for the final decision of the question
concerning parallax.
   Referring to Mr. Pond's observations, Dr. Brinkley is led to enter
tain doubts of the fitness of an instrument similar to the Greenwich
mural circle for so delicate an inquiry, founded upon remarks detailed
in the paper respecting the elements used in computing the index
error, and which are independent of the uncertainties to which the ob
servation itself is also subject.   It however, from the uncertainty
                                                             is,

  The author next relates his experiments and observations upon
the urine and urinary organs of lizards. He examined four species,
—the gecko, iguana, the kobbera-guion, (described by Knox,) and the
alligator. The kidneys vary in size; each ureter has a papilla situ
ated in the receptacle; in other respects the structure resembles that
of snakes. The secretion is also nearly similar; that of the alligator
contains, besides uric acid, carbonate and phosphate of lime; in one
case it smelt strongly like musk.
   In two species of the testudo, Dr. Davy found the kidneys lobu
lated like those of the preceding animals.      In the bladder both of
the turtle and tortoise he found flakes of uric acid in a transparent
liquid, containing mucus and common salt, but no urea.

   Since the author's former communication upon the above subject
to the Royal Society, various researches have been brought forward,
differing   in
             their results from his own     well   from each other. as          as
Sir Humphry concluded that the phosphoric acid contained about
three fifths     its
                 weight      oxygen,   of
                                        twice that contained or the                               in
phosphorous acid.  Berzelius considers the phosphoric acid com                                   as
posed  of 100 phosphorus     128:17 oxygen; and Dulong,
                                            +               100                                   of
phosphorus    1245 oxygen; and both these chemists consider the
                 +

                                       96
 oxygen in the phosphorous       acid to be to that in the phosphoric as
 3 to 5.
     After showing that the only possible source of error in his former ex
 periments was the smallness of the quantity of the phosphorus burned,
 Sir Humphry describes various modes of effectually carrying on the
 combustion upon a larger scale, and gives the preference to that in
 which the vapour of phosphorus, passing from the orifice of a small
 tube, is made to burn in a retort filled with pure oxygen.            The
 mean result of several experiments carefully conducted upon this
 plan, gave the composition of phosphoric acid at 100 phosphorus +
  134°5 oxygen.
    The author having shown the insufficiency of Dulong's method for
 ascertaining the composition of phosphoric acid and of the chlorides
 of phosphorus, proceeds to detail his researches upon the latter com
 pounds, and upon the constitution of phosphorous acid.          The result
 of several experiments indicated the composition of perchloride of
 phosphorus to be 1:00 of phosphorus + 6 of chlorine; and showed
 that phosphorous acid contained half the quantity of oxygen existing
 in the phosphoric acid, and the liquid chloride half the quantity of
 chlorine contained in the solid perchloride.      These experiments suf
 ficiently agree with each other to afford the means of determining
 the equivalent number of phosphorus.         Thus, if phosphoric acid be
 supposed to consist of two proportions of oxygen and one of phos
phorus, the number representing the proportion in which phospho
 rus combines will be 22-3.       If the absorption of chlorine in forming
phosphorane be made the datum, the number will be 22-2.              If the
 quantity of horn silver formed from the liquid chloride be assumed
as the datum, the number will then be 23-5.           The mean of all is
 22-6, or the double  45-2,   from which, if we take away the decimal,
we obtain 45. The author's experiments upon phosphate of potash
also agree with this number.
    The next subject discussed in this paper is the hypophosphorous
acid of M. Dulong.      Although Sir Humphry has satisfied himself of
the existence of this   acid,  he is not disposed to regard the methods
of   analysis adopted  by  its discoverer as satisfactory.    When hypo
phosphite of baryta is decomposed by heat, it is converted into phos
phate of baryta and hydrophosphoric gas; and knowing the quan
tity of acid in the former, and of phosphorus in the latter, it is easy
in this way to learn the composition of the hydrophosphorous acid.
The results of Sir Humphry's experiments, however, lead to the con
clusions adopted by Dulong; namely, that the quantity of oxygen in
the hydrophosphorous acid is half that which is contained in the
phosphorous acid. M. Dulong has suggested that the acid described
by the author as a mixture of phosphorous and phosphoric acids, is
a peculiar chemical compound, and proposes to call it phosphatic
acid; but as it has no crystalline form, nor any marked characters;
as it is not of uniform composition; and as phosphorous and phos
phoric acids mixed, produce a substance of the same kind,-Sir Hum

                                                         97
 phry does not admit of this conclusion.   The author has adopted
 throughout the calculations in this paper the supposition that the
 hydrogen in water is as 2 to 15 to the oxygen; and consequently,
 he says, has taken the number 15 to represent the latter element.
 If the hypophosphorous acid be regarded as a simple compound of
 oxygen and phosphorus, it will consist of 45 phosphorus + 15 oxy
 gen; phosphorous acid of 45 phosphorus + 30 oxygen; phosphoric
 acid of 45 phosphorus + 60 oxygen.
    Sir Humphry concludes this paper with some incidental observa
 tions relating to the compounds of phosphorus.

    This paper is divided into three sections. In the first the author,
 after taking an historical view of the different experiments under
 taken by Robinson, Watt, Dalton, Biot, and some others, relating
 to the elastic force of vapours arising from different bodies at dif
 ferent temperatures, and after pointing out the sources of error and
 imperfection to which they are liable, proceeds to describe the ap
 paratus which he employed, which is further illustrated by an an
 nexed drawing. The space which contains the vapour for experiment
 is about half an inch of a barometer tube, against which the oblong
 bulb of a delicate thermometer rests so as to indicate the true tem
 perature.     The contrivance is such, that though the liquid and                                         in

globular receiver being surrounded by a certain quantity of water of

 On the Different Methods of Constructing a Catalogue of Fired Stars.
   By      J.
          Pond, Esq. F.R.S. Astronomer Royal. Read May 21, 1818.
   [Phil. Trans. 1818, p. 405.]
   The method hitherto adopted in the Royal Observatory for con
structing a catalogue of stars, either in declination or right ascension,
has been to take some one star as a point of departure, and thus to
determine the position of the rest by direct comparison.       The decli
nations were determined by direct comparison with y Draconis, and
a Aquilae was chosen as the common term of comparison in right
ascension.    In observations with the transit instrument, this mode of
proceeding is highly objectionable; for every result is subject to a
double error,    that committed in the observation of a Aquilae, and that
in the observation of the star itself. Besides which, if the observation
of a Aquilae be omitted, then the other observations become useless.
Hence, although extreme accuracy was ultimately thus obtained by
the late Astronomer Royal, the method was tedious and objection
able.
   The method which Mr. Pond proposes to substitute, and which he
describes in this paper, has the advantage of affording, in a single
year, a catalogue equally accurate with one formerly obtained in three,
and equally applicable to the mural circle and transit instrument. No
particular star is in either case assumed as a point of departure in
preference to the rest.     On the contrary, every star is in        turn as                  its
sumed         point
               as a     reference  of  the others.   to   thus endeavoured,It   is
in  the first instance,      establish their relative distances from each
                                         to

           from the equator       meridian, leaving the choice and deter

                    of                     departure       subject for future
                                                           of               as  a
consideration.     The   principles      proceeding  applicable
                                                         of          both                    to            in

     In
      respect            to   the accuracy      of   the results afforded            by   the new transit
instrument,              Mr. Pond thinks that 120 observations enable him                                  to
define the place               of  a    fixed star    to   one tenth

    The telescope erected for this investigation resembles         con                         in     its
struction   that which was formerly used for the observations                                                   of

tention was again called to it by Dr. Brinkley's late communication.
By reference to an annexed table, it appears that the greatest error
in a series of ten observations, made with the transit, could not have
been more than 0"03, and consequently it is not probable that the
error in fifty observations should have exceeded half that quantity.
Taking, however, every circumstance into consideration, it is possible
that the whole parallax of a Aquilae may have amounted to half a
second, which is about a tenth part of that assigned to this star by
Dr. Brinkley. The author, however, proposes to continue the inves
tigation; and when his observations shall have been sufficiently mul
tiplied, promises to communicate the result to the Society.
 On the Parallaw    of the Fired Stars in Right Ascension. By John
   Pond, F.R.S. Astronomer Royal.          Read May 28, 1818.       [Phil,
   Trans. 1818, p. 481.]
   This paper is intended   as an appendix to a former one on the same
subject.    The author extends his investigation to a few more of the
principal fixed stars. He divides the results of any one star into two
parts; first, alternately or accidentally, and also according to the law
of parallax; and as no greater difference is observable in the latter
than in the former case, it is demonstrable that parallax has had no
sensible effect on the observation.      He next inquires what may be
the magnitude of the parallax that might be concealed by the acci
dental error of observation.    Without entering into a rigorous com
putation on the laws of probability, he conceives that it may be in
ferred by inspection, that it is almost impossible that the longer axis
of the ellipse, described by the brightest fixed star, can exceed 0"-6,
 and it is very improbable that it should amount to half as much; and
as this quantity can never derange the mean place of a star 0" 1 in
declination, it is evident that all attempts to determine the parallax
by a meridian instrument of any description must be utterly hope
less.
An Abstract of the Results deduced from the Measurement of an Arc
   on the Meridian, ertending from Latitude 8° 9' 38":4, to Latitude
   18° 3'23"-6 N., being an Amplitude of 9°53'45"2.             By Lieut.
   Colonel William    Lambton,  F.R.S. 33rd   Regiment    of Foot. Read
   May 21, 1818. [Phil. Trans. 1818, p. 486.]
   The author, at the commencement of this paper, refers to the 12th
volume of the Asiatic Researches, in which there are detailed ac
counts of two complete sections of an arc on the meridian, measured
by him in prosecuting the Trigonometrical Survey of the Peninsula
of India. The first is comprehended between the parallels of Punnae,
a station near Cape Comorin, in latitude 8°9'38":39, and Patchi
polliam in Coimbetoor, in latitude 10° 59' 48".93. The second is
comprehended between the parallels of Patchipolliam and Namtha
bad, a station near Gooty in the ceded districts, in latitude 15°6'0"-21.

                                    103
Since those measurements, the author has obtained another section,
extending from Namthabad to Daumergidda, in the Nizam's do
minions, which being in latitude 18° 3'23"-6, gives a total arc of
9°53'45" 14 in amplitude.
   From the first of these sections, Colonel Lambton finds the length
of the degree due to latitude 9° 34'44" (the middle point of that
arc), equal to 60472-83 fathoms. The second section, whose middle
point is in latitude 13° 2' 55", gives the mean degree equal to
60487.56 fathoms; and the last section gives the degree equal to
6051278 fathoms due to the latitude of 16° 34'42", the middle
point of that section.
   The author proceeds to compare each of these degrees, first with
the French measure, then with the English, and lastly, with the
Swedish measure, and thence obtains a general mean for the com
pression at the poles. The first mean of these three degrees, used
with the French degree, gives the compression roºrs; the second
mean of the same three degrees, used with the English degree, gives
+++++;     and the third mean of these three degrees, used with the
Swedish    degree, gives stºry; so that the mean of these three means
will give the compression sºur, or s-Ho nearly of the polar axis.
   The number of base lines in this extensive arc are five, all mea
sured with the chain extended in coffers, with elevating screws, &c.
   The author, after giving a variety of data, proceeds to investigate
the formulae which he has employed in his calculations, and concludes
with a table of the lengths of different degrees . for every third degree
from the equator to the pole.
The Croonian Lecture.      On the Conversion of Pus into Granulations
   or New Flesh.     By Sir Everard Home, Bart. V.P.R.S. Read No
   vember 5, 1818.      [Phil. Trans. 1819, p. 1.]
   The changes which pus undergoes in the formation of new flesh
are so analogous to those which take place in the blood, and which
were discussed in the author's Croonian lecture of last year, that he
is induced to consider the two fluids as possessed of the same pro
perties, the colour of the globules being the principal characteristic
distinction  between them.
   That pus is a transparent fluid, in which globules are subsequently
formed, was proved by the author in 1788; and in July 1817 Mr.
Bauer observed the same property in the serum of the blood: he saw
globules forming in that fluid while he was examining it in the field
of the microscope.      Human blood, sheep's blood, and calves' blood,
presented to Sir Everard similar results; the serum of which, when
warm and fresh, was observed, in a space covering Trºoroth part of
an inch, to produce from six to twelve globules in a few minutes,
two only being observed in the first instance.
    The author, after detailing further experiments on the formation of
globules in the serum of the blood, proceeds to examine the changes
which happen in pus upon the surface of a sore, having previously

                                                    104.
described the appearance of the surface immediately under the newly
secreted pus.     It was made up of eminences and hollows; the former
consisting of clusters of tortuous blood-vessels, the latter filled with
pus.    After a few minutes' exposure, the following changes were ob
served: a transparent pellicle covered the surface, under which glo
bules of air made their appearance in different places; then horizontal
anastomozing canals, filled with red blood, were seen to form; and
red spots, which were the termination of perpendicular canals, were
observed under the pellicle.     Drawings illustrating these appearances
accompany the paper.
   After detailing further proofs and illustrations of the above phe
nomena, presented by the surfaces of sores covered with pus, Sir
Everard observes, that the carbonic acid originally contained in the
tubes is very readily displaced by the blood, in consequence of                                          its
disposition      absorb that particular gas which forms
                      to                                     large  pro              so             a
portion      its  component
                 of           parts.   He thinks that the extrication                                    of
carbonic acid      the original cause
                       is                the tubularity  ofpus; and that            of
the tubes are then filled with red blood, and thus connected with the
circulation.    The succeeding changes are illustrated by Mr. Bauer's
drawing, which the author laid before the Society last year.

modifications which they undergo when the number              axes                       of         is   in
creased.
  It  appears from these investigations that the colouring particles                                      of
crystals, instead    being indiscriminately dispersed throughout their
                                of
mass, have            an
                arrangement related       the ordinary and extraordinary
                                                           to
forces which they exert upon light.                        In
                                            some cases, the extraordinary

                                                           105
medium appeared to be tinged with the same kind and number of
colouring particles as the ordinary medium; but in other cases, in
the same mineral, the extraordinary medium was either tinged with
a different number of particles of the same colour, or with a colour
ing matter entirely different from that of the ordinary medium.        In
some specimens of topaz the colouring matter of the one medium
was more easily discharged by heat than that of the other, one of
the pencils being yellow and the other pink: hence it is a mistake
to suppose that in converting yellow topazes into pink by heat, the
former colour is changed into the latter; the fact being, that the
yellow is discharged by heat, thus leaving the pink unimpaired.
 Hence it may be ascertained beforehand whether atopaz will receive
 a pink colour by heat; for if that colour exist in one of        images,                                         its
 seen     by
          exposing           polarized ray, we may predict the success

  nexed to this paper; in one of which the author remarks, that the
  fixation of the elements of water, in the treatment of animal and
  vegetable substances by the common principles of the laboratory,
  occurs more frequently than is generally believed; and shows, by a
  comparative analysis of hog's lard in its recent state and after sapo

  On Corpora Lutea.       By  Sir  Everard Home,    Bart. V.P.R.S.     Read
              January 14, 1819.      [Phil. Trans. 1819, p. 59.]
      In this paper the author describes the origin, growth, use, and de
  cay of the Corpora lutea.       The ovarium, before puberty, is a loose,
  open texture, in which are a number of globular cells.          After pu
  berty, the Corpus luteum forms in the substance of the ovarium. In
 the cow it appears, when magnified, as a mass of convolutions, some
 what like the brain. Sir Everard then proceeds to describe the draw
 ings which accompany this paper, and of which the object is to show
 that the Corpora lutea are the structures in which the ova are formed;
 that they exist previous to, and perfectly independent of, sexual       in
 tercourse; and that, when they have fulfilled their office of forming
 ova, they are destroyed by absorption, whether the ova are impreg
 nated or not.              -
      On examining the appearance of the Corpora lutea before and after
 impregnation, it appears probable that impregnation is necessary for
 the expulsion of the ovum; but when impregnation does not take
 place, the ovum appears to remain in the cavity of the Corpus luteum.
 Hence it may be concluded, that impregnation takes place in the
 ovarium itself.
 Remarks on the Probabilities of Error in Physical Observations, and
     on the Density of the Earth, considered,     especially with regard to
     the Reduction of    Eaperiments    on the Pendulum.     In a Letter to
     Capt. Henry Kater, F.R.S.        By Thomas Young, M.D. For. Sec.
     R.S. Read January 21, 1819. [Phil. Trans. 1819, p. 70.]
     In the first section of this letter, Dr. Young proceeds to examine
in what manner the apparent constancy of many general results, sub
ject to numerous causes of diversity, may be best explained; and
shows that the combination of many independent causes of error,
each liable to incessant fluctuation, has a matural tendency, depen
dent on their multiplicity and independence, to diminish the aggregate
variation of their joint effect; a position illustrated by the simple case
of supposing an equal large number of black and white balls to be
thrown into a box, and 100 of them to be drawn out at once or in
succession; when it is demonstrated that there is 1 chance in 12# ;

                                                     107
that exactly 50 of each kind will be drawn, and an even chance that
there will not be more than 53 of either; and that it is barely pos
sible that 100 black, or 100 white, should be drawn in succession.
    From calculations contained in this paper, Dr. Young infers that
the original conditions of the probability of different errors do not
considerably modify the conclusions respecting the accuracy of the
mean result, because their effect is comprehended in the magnitude
of the mean error from which these conclusions are deduced. The
author also shows that the error of the mean, on account of this limi
tation is never likely to be greater than six sevenths of the mean of
 all the errors divided by the square root of the number of obser
vations.
    The author then proceeds to the application of the doctrine of
chances to matters of literature and history. He shows that with
respect to the relation of two languages, nothing can be inferred
from the coincidence of the sense of any single word; that the odds
would be 3 to 1 against the agreement of two words; but if three
were identical, it would then be more than 10 to 1 that they were
derived from the same parent language.          Six words give 1700
chances to 1, and eight near 100,000; so that, in these last cases,
the evidence would approach certainty.
    In regard to history, Dr. Young remarks, that the mention of a
 single number found indisputably correct may afford strong evidence
 of the veracity of a historian.
    There is a manuscript of Diodorus Siculus, in which, describing
 the Egyptian funerals, he gives forty-two for the number of persons
 who sat in judgement on the merits of the deceased; and in a mul
 titude of ancient rolls of papyrus, lately found in Egypt, forty-two
 assistants of Osiris are delineated on a similar occasion.  Hence it
 is 100 to 1 that this manuscript  is more accurate than others which
 have been collated; that Diodorus Siculus was a faithful historian;
that the inscriptions related to some kind of judgement; and that
the hieroglyphics have been truly interpreted.
   The second section of Dr. Young's letter relates to the mean den
sity of the earth.
   Before we admit that the excess of density of the central parts of
the earth, compared with                      its
                              superficies, renders  probable that the
                                                                 it
whole was once fluid, we should inquire into the exclusive effect               of
pressure     augmenting the mean density.
             in                                 From this inquiry, Dr.
Young makes evident, that the general law,           compression pro

  The author's letter concludes with some remarks on Euler's for
mula for the rolling pendulum, from which the perfect accuracy of
Laplace's theorems for the length of the convertible pendulum roll
ing on equal cylinders may be inferred, without any limitation of
their magnitude, or of the form of the pendulum.   It also affords the
proper correction for the arc of vibration.
On the Anomaly in the Variation of the Magnetic Needle as observed
  on Ship-board.  By William Scoresby, jun. Esq. Communicated
     by theRight Hon. Sir Joseph Banks, Bart. G.C.B. P.R.S.            Read
     February 4, 1819. [Phil. Trans. 1819, p. 96.]
   The anomalies in magnetic observations on ship-board were usually
attributed to imperfections of the azimuth compass, till Capt. Flinders
suggested the influence of the iron used in the construction of the
ship as their probable source,—a suggestion since confirmed and illus
trated by    Mr. Bain.
     In this paper, Mr. Scoresby has given a table of the selected re
sults of his observations relating to this subject, conducted on the
coast of Spitzbergen, in the years 1815 and 1817. To these he has
added some general inferences, deduced at the time of observation,
and observes, that the anomaly of attraction is probably the greatest
in men-of-war, and ships containing large quantities of iron, though
it also exists to a considerable extent in merchantmen where iron
forms no part of the cargo, especially in high latitudes where the
dip of the needle is great.
On the Genus Ocythoë ; being an Ertract of a Letter from Thomas
  Say, Esq. of Philadelphia, to Wilham Elford Leach, M.D. F.R.S.
  Read February 4, 1819. [Phil. Trans. 1819, p. 107.]
  After describing a genus of Ocythoë, which the author regards as
new, he observes that the Ocythoë offers a deviation from the ordi
nary laws which apply to the testaceous Mollusca, inasmuch as it
resides only in the last volution of the shell; and as the shell does
not   fit
        the body,  it appears probable that   it was not made for           it,
more especially   as
                   there     is attachment between the shell and any
                                  no
part    the body. The shells that approach nearest

of that order: this supposition, however,    isnot corroborated        by
                                                                     the
habits   ofthe animal; for all hitherto discovered of that order swim

observations made in previous voyages; and how far the errors found
to take place on different courses, and under different dips of the
magnetic needle, corresponded with those rules for calculating cor
rections recommended by Captain Flinders, who found that in every
ship a compass would differ very materially from itself on being re
moved from one place to another, and this was found to be the case
in the Isabella and Alexander.
   As the ships ascended Davis's Straits, the binnacle compasses, in
consequence of their construction, became nearly useless; accord
ingly, a standard compass was placed in the Isabella exactly amid
ship between the main and mizen mast, on a stout cross-beam, about
nine feet above the deck; and in the Alexander amidship, on a box
of sand five or six feet above deck. Captain Sabine next describes
the methods by which the points of no error in these compasses were
determined, and which were not in either ship coincident with the
magnetic meridian.
    Captain Flinders has shown that the maximum of error in the
same compass, and confined to the same spot, is different in different
parts of the world; and by multiplying the observations, and com
paring the series, he was led to trace a connection between the
amount of the errors and the dip of the needle, observing that the
influence of local attraction on the compass needle increased with
the dip.    This increase, however, says the author, was a relative
one, being in comparison to the directive power of magnetism, the
diminution of which is sufficient to account for the effects observed;
as will be evident upon reflecting, that though the magnetic force is
greatest at the pole,     its
                            directive power must there have ceased:
hence the    inadequacy    of the rule proposed by Captain Flinders,
whereby the amount        oferror under any known dip being ascer
tained, the amount   of  error for any other dip may     calculated, by
                                                             be

the error in  the one ascertained instance may have borne       the dip.

Flinders's rule, the common   multiplier  for this compass would have
been about one twelfth, making the extreme difference 15°, whereas
it was really more than 10°.     By similar reference

   The author shows, in this paper, that after sunset the fall of tem
perature that ensues upon the earth's surface is considerably greater
on land than in water, and refers to the well-known peculiarity in
the expansibility of water, at temperatures below 40°, for the cause
of its superior temperature and that of the air above           When,                                  it.

   It   has been remarked by Malus, that the action which the first
surface of Iceland spar exercises upon light, is independent of the
position of            its

salt than    the Northern,
                  in             the proportion                                of

equator, is 1027-77, and therefore a little exceeds that prevalent in
the Northern hemisphere, while it is decidedly less than that of the
Southern Ocean.     There is no material difference between different
east and west longitudes at the equator, nor in the same hemisphere.
In general, the salt seems most abundant in the deepest water, and
in that furthest from land; the vicinity of ice also diminishes the
saltness: if therefore this quality should increase in approaching the
pole, it may be considered as militating against the probability of the
ocean being extensively frozen in those regions.       In general, small
inland seas, communicating with the ocean, are less salt than the
ocean itself.   The waters of the Mediterranean, however, are more
saline, and in attempting to account for this circumstance, the au
thor's attention is directed to the relative densities of water from dif
ferent depths of the ocean; and though in some cases it appeared
lightest at the surface, such a result was generally referable to the
vicinity of thawing ice, for, in ordinary circumstances, the density at
great depths in no instance exceeded the mean density of the waters
of the ocean. In regard, however, to different seas or arms of the
ocean, the case is often different, in consequence of local circum
stances.    At the entrance of the Dardanelles, for instance, the dif
ference between the upper and lower strata is as 1020 to 1028.
    Dr. Marcet next details some researches upon the congelation of
sea-water which takes place at 28°, and when slowly effected, is
always attended by the total separation of the salt, which forms a
strong brine that is washed away by the neighbouring water. The
different specimens of water obtained from the ice in the late Northern
Expedition, varied very little in specific gravity; the water was sweet,
and in many instances            its
                                specific gravity did not exceed that         dis        of
tilled water.

 An Account of the Fossil Skeleton of the Proteo-Saurus. By Sir
   Everard Home, Bart. V.P.R.S.     Read March 4, 1819.   [Phil.
      Trans. 1819, p. 209.]
    After reverting to the contents of his former papers on this sub
 ject, Sir Everard describes in the present communication a specimen
 of the animal nearly in an entire state, and of which most of the
 parts are in such good preservation, as to enable him to correct and
 complete his former accounts, the only parts wanting being the bones
 of the pelvis and the lower part of the sternum. A drawing of the
 natural size accompanies this paper, in which, says the author, the
 parts are so clear and distinct, as to render any verbal description
 superfluous.

peculiarities of the rise and fall of the tides at adjacent places, is re
ferred by the author principally to the accumulation that takes place
in these basins. That the tides do not meet at Dungeness in a line
across the Channel, is further proved by the absence of that violent
concussion of water which in such a case would ensue; the fact being,
that the formation of the coast by gradually altering the course of
the tide between the South Foreland and buoy of the Nore, from
E.N.E. to W.N.W. within the stream of the Goodwin Sands, oc
casions a gentle blending of the waters, so that there is only a strong
eddy about the Kentish Knock, and a foamy rippling where they
meet and proceed onwards together.
On the Ova  of the different Tribes of Opossum and Ornithorhynchus.
  By Sir Everard Home, Bart. V.P.R.S. Read March 25, 1819.
  [Phil. Trans. 1819, p. 234.]
  With his previously acquired knowledge    respecting the formation
of the ova of quadrupeds  in Corpora lutea, Sir Everard proceeds to
inquire into that of the Opossum tribe, the ova of which are not
formed in the same manner, but make two distinct gradations be
tween the quadruped and Ornithorhynchus paradorus, which last
approaches so near to the bird, as to complete the link of grada
tion between the quadruped and bird in their mode of generation.
Sir Everard first describes the formation of the ova in the Kan
garoo, which, when expelled from the Corpus luteum, receive a yolk
in the Fallopian tube, and afterwards the albumen in the uterus.
The  foetus, when expelled from the uterus into the marsupium, at
taches itself to the nipple, as described in the 85th and 100th volume
of the Philosophical Transactions. In the Kola and Wombat, and
great and small Opossum, instead of Corpora lutea there are yolk
bags imbedded in the substance of the ovarium; and there are two
uteri, with a Fallopian tube to each, the ovum in each uterus being
separately impregnated in         its
                                 own cavity.
  The mode      of
                formation        of
                              the ova    the Ornithorhynchi, forms the

intermediate link between the     Opossum   and bird. The yolk bags
are imbedded      in
                  the ovaria;   and instead       regular uterus, each
                                                           of   a

liquity, gives the diminution for an interval of nearly sixty years,
with almost sufficient accuracy to state with some confidence the
mass of Venus; but to obtain this point with certainty, the present
obliquity, deduced from a mean of the observations of different as
tronomers, should be used.      Upon this subject the author alludes to
the  opinion of  astronomers,   that observations of the winter solstice
have given a less obliquity than those of the summer solstice,—an
opinion sustained by the observations of Maskelyne, Arago, and Pond,
but questioned by Bessel and Bradley. Dr. Brinkley refers this dif
ference to some unknown modification of refraction; he has observed
that at the winter solstice the irregularity of refraction for the sun is
greater than for the stars at the same zenith-distance.        He points
out the  necessity of paying attention to the observations at the winter
solstice, and gives a table, exhibiting the mean obliquity reduced to
January 1813.
   Dr. Brinkley next alludes to the maximum of the aberration of
light, which appears from his observations of last year to be 20".80.
On some New Methods of investigating the Sums of several Classes of
  Infinite Series. By Charles Babbage, Esq. A.M. F.R.S.       Read
  April 1, 1819. [Phil. Trans. 1819, p. 249.]
   The object of this paper is to explain two methods of finding the
sums of a variety of infinite series.    One of these the author disco
vered several years ago; but finding that some of the results to which
it led were erroneous, he then declined publishing               inquiring  it.    In
into the causes     these errors, he was led
                      of                            the second method,
                                                                 to
which employs the process      integration relative
                                    of                                 to
                                                       finite differences.
The cause of the fallacies    the former method was afterwards dis

methods; and the author concludes by observing, that              has since        he
been informed         by
                     M.  Poisson,  that that   gentleman    had arrived                              at

parency,   transmitting a yellowish, and reflecting a bluish light; an
other is translucent, and a third opake : the two first varieties be
come transparent, and evolve air when immersed in water: the third
evolves air also, but remains opake.      If the first varieties be only
slightly wetted they become quite opake. The property of acqui
ring transparency by the evolution of air from, and the absorption of
water by its pores, belongs also to the hydrophanous opal; but the
faculty of becoming opake by a small quantity, and transparent by
a larger, of water, shows a singularity of structure in tabasheer.
As the tabasheer disengages more air than hydrophane, its pores
must be more numerous; and therefore the transmission of light, so
as to form a perfect image, indicates either a very feeble refractive
power or some peculiarity in the construction of         pores.   To de                            its

                 of
   Captain Kater concludes this paper with some observations re

                                      1  18
specting the figure of the earth.         It having been shown by Clairaut
that the sum of the two       fractions,   expressing the ellipticity and the
diminution of     gravity,  from the     pole  to the equator, is always a
constant quantity, and equal to # of the fraction, expressing the ratio
of centrifugal force, and that of gravity at the equator, it follows
that if the decrease of gravity from the pole to the equator be sub
tracted from this constant quantity, the remaining fraction will ex
press the ellipticity of the spheroid. The diminution of gravity may
be known by finding the difference of the length of two pendulums,
vibrating in equal times at the equator and pole, which are to each
other directly as gravitation; but as such experiments cannot be
made at the pole, Captain Kater proceeds to describe the means of
obtaining the desired result by observations at intermediate stations;
whence it appears that the length of the seconds pendulum at the
equator, deduced from the observations at Unst and Dunnose, is
39-00527 inches, and gravitation at the equator 16:040 feet; hence
the centrifugal force at the equator is ++s of gravitation, or +4+ of
 gravity, which last being multiplied by # gives '0086505 for the
 sum of the fractions, expressing the ellipticity of the earth and dimi
 mution of gravity from the pole to the equator.
     It appears from this result that, excepting the allowance for
 height above the sea's level, the error in the number of vibrations of
 the seconds pendulum at any particular station does not amount to
 rath of a vibration, which is about equal to 400,000th part of the
 length, consequently gravitation may be determined to this degree of
 accuracy by the apparatus employed; and in passing through a
 country composed of materials of various degrees of density, the
 pendulum may be expected to indicate such variations with much
 precision.    Irregularities that are observed in the decrease between
 given latitudes, from the pole to the equator, are referable to this
 irregular attraction; thus the sudden increase of gravitation at
 Arbury Hill is referred by Captain Kater to the granite of Mount
  Sorrel in Leicestershire.
     Though the details of M. Biot's experiments are not yet published,
  the author observes that it affords him no small gratification to learn
  that the acceleration of the pendulum between London and Unst,
  computed by that mathematician from his observations between Unst
  and Formentara, differs only 0".6 from the result of his own expe
  riments,<-a difference referable perhaps to the superior density of
  Unst compared with that of the substrata of London.
   The Croonian Lecture.        A further Investigation of the Component
      Parts of the Blood. By Sir Everard Home, Bart. V.P.R.S. Read
      November 4, 1819. [Phil. Trans. 1820, p. 1.]
      In this communication       Sir Everard announces the existence in
   certain animal    structures of globules         smaller than and inde
   pendent of those ordinarily belonging to the blood; they were first
   remarked by Mr. Bauer, during the microscopic examination of the

                                                119
 coats of an aneurismal tumour; their number was in the proportion
 of one to four of the larger globules, and their diameter was reºrg
 of an inch in the larger in contact with the circulating blood; in
 the other layers they became more numerous, and in that longest
 coagulated were in the proportion of four to one.
    In the section of an aneurismal tumour, the author notices the un
 common appearance of crystals of sulphate of lime with muriate and
 phosphate of soda, which, as well as the globules, he supposes to
 have been originally dissolved in the serum, since they are only
 brought to view by the act of coagulation.
    In coagulable lymph deposited during violent inflammation, the
 same small globules were observed, mixed with a few colourless
 blood globules.    The globules, stated by the author in a former lec
 ture to have been produced in the serum, are also of a similar nature;
 and to distinguish them from the larger blood globules, he proposes
 to call them globules of lymph. In the buff of blood they were very
 numerous in the upper and firmest part, but the lower and softer
layer consisted principally of blood globules.
    A tumour in the prostate gland was found Mr. Bauer to contain
both kinds of globules, and a considerable proportion of transparent
jelly. The hard compact part of a tumour in the breast consisted
 chiefly of lymph globules and elastic jelly. In                        its
                                                                 softer part the
blood globules predominated,               that the structure
                                               so                      these tuof

                                             acriform matter, evolved under
the exhausted receiver         theofair-pump,    was less than that       healthy   of
blood, and appeared                                                                       of

            found the size        the globules various; those which were

rally called light hydrocarbonate, is in reality a mere mixture of hy
drogen and olefiant gases. In proof of this opinion he details a series
of analytical experiments upon the gases from coal, oil, acetate of
potash, moist charcoal, &c., conducted chiefly by detonation with
oxygen, by heat alone, and by the action of sulphur at high tempe
ratures, and obtains results analogous to those afforded by mixtures
of hydrogen and olefiant gas, of the same specific gravities.           Of
the gases above-mentioned, however, the specific gravity, combusti
bility, and intensity of light during combustion, are often much in
terfered with by the presence of carbonic oxide and carbonic acid.
   Of the products obtained by the destructive distillation of coal and
oil, Mr. Brande thinks that some are of what may be termed secon
dary formation; that                  is,
                            that they result from the mutual action                                               of

 On the Action of Crystallized Bodies on Homogeneous Light, and on.
   the Causes of the Deviation from Newton's Scale in the Tints which
   many of them develope on Erposure to a Polarized Ray.     By    F. J.
   W.  Herschel,   Esq. F.R.S.  Lond, and Edin.  Read December 23,
   1819.    [Phil. Trans. 1820, p. 45.]
     When Malus published his discovery of the polarization of light,
 the list of doubly-refracting crystals was small; and as the most re
 markable of them possessed only one axis of double refraction, it was
 presumed that the law discovered by Huyghens, applicable to that
 one, might hold good in all; but the discovery of crystals with two
 axes of double refraction has proved the fallacy of such generali
 zation, and rendered new and extensive investigations necessary.
    There are two modes of conducting observations on double re
 fraction and polarization; the one turns upon immediate observation
 of the angular deviation of the extraordinary pencil, the other de
 pends upon the separation of a polarized ray into complementary
 portions by the action of a crystallized lamina.    After noticing the
 advantages of the latter, Mr. H. observes, that to render observations
 on the tints developed by polarized light available, they must be
 comparable to each other; hence the importance of discovering the
 existence and tracing the laws of those causes which operate to dis
 turb their regularity. In the author's first inquiries on the polari
 zation of light, he was struck by the great deviation from the suc
 cession of colours in their laminae, as observed by Newton, which
 many crystals exhibit when cut into plates perpendicular to one of
their axes; and finding this phenomenon unconnected with irregu
larities in their thickness or polish, and uniformly repeated in diffe
rent and perfect specimens, he was led to inquire into their causes,
especially as they appeared to form an unanswerable objection to
M. Biot's theory, which perfectly explains the tints in crystals with
one axis.
    In the several sections of this communication, Mr. H. first enters
into a detailed description of the phenomena themselves, which are
reducible to one general fact; namely, that the axes of double re
fraction differ in their position in the same crystal for the different
coloured rays of the spectrum, being dispersed in one plane over an
angle more or less considerable according to the nature of the sub
stance.    In many bodies, the magnitude of this dispersion of the
axes is comparatively trifling; while in some, not otherwise remark
able for a high ordinary or extraordinary dispersive power, it is enor
mous, and renders all computation of the tints in which it is not
taken into consideration completely erroneous.       A new element is
thus developed, which for the future must enter into       all rigorous
formulae of   double refraction; and another striking instance   ispre
sented  of   the inherent distinction between the different coloured
molecules    oflight. At the same time, says the author,  by  the com
plete explanation this principle affords of   all the more perplexing

                                                  123
anomalies in the tints, the theory of oscillations stands relieved of
every difficulty, and may be received as adequate to the representa
tion of all the phenomena of the polarized rings, and entitled to rank
with the fits of easy transmission and reflection as a general and sim
ple physical law.

On some Combinations of Platinum.              By Edmund Davy, Esq. Pro
   fessor of Chemistry, and Secretary to the Cork Institution.           Com
    municated    by  F.  Babington,    M.D. F.R.S.         Read  February  17,
     1820.    [Phil. Trans.    1820,  p.  108.]
    The principal object of this paper is to describe a peculiar com
pound of platinum, obtained from the sulphate by the agency of al
cohol.      On boiling sulphate of platinum with alcohol, a substance is
precipitated, which, when dried, is black, insoluble in water, and un
alterable by exposure to air.         It is reduced with a slight explosion
when heated. It          acquires  fulminating    properties when steeped in
ammonia.        It is insoluble in  nitric, sulphuric,  and phosphoric acids,
and    slowly  soluble in muriatic acid.        By  alcohol it is immediately
decomposed, as shown          by  slightly  moistening it with that liquid;
and such heat is produced as to ignite the separated platina.          During
these changes acetic acid is formed.
    Mr. Davy gives a detailed analysis of this powder, whence it ap
pears to consist almost solely of platinum, with a little oxygen, and
the elements of nitrous acid; a small portion of carbon was also ob
tained, which, however, the author regards as accidental; the presence
of nitrous acid is referred to the manner in which the sulphate of pla
tinum is formed, namely, by the agency of nitrous acid on sulphuret
of platinum.
    In the fifth and sixth sections of this paper, Mr. Davy describes
the action of sulphate of platinum upon solutions of jelly, in which
it forms a precipitate composed, when dried at 212°, of
                           56:11 oxide of platinum,
                           20:02 sulphuric acid,
                           23.87 gelatine and water.
    The author considers the sulphate of platinum as the most delicate
known test for jelly.
     In the seventh section of his paper, Mr. Davy describes a grey ox
ide of platinum, obtained by the action of nitrous acid on fulminating
platinum, and affording on analysis,
                        100 platinum + 11.9 oxygen.
    Assuming, with Vauquelin and Berzelius, that the black oxide of
platinum contains 15 per cent. of oxygen, the author observes that
the grey oxide which he has described may be considered as the pro
toxide, and will consist of one proportion of platinum and one of
oxygen, or 126 platinum + 15 oxygen, and the black oxide will
consist of 126 platinum and 22°5 oxygen, or of one proportion of
metal and 1% of oxygen.

                                               of                                           of   English merchant
 ships, only half the timbers are united,                                       so   as    to   constitute any part

                                                   126
of an arch, every alternate couple only being connected together; the
intermediate two timbers being unconnected, and resting upon, in
stead of supporting, the outer planking. The mode of joining the
different pieces of the same rib is also highly objectionable.       It is
effected by the introduction of a wedge-piece, by which the grain of
the rib pieces is much cut, and the general fabric weakened, with a
great consumption of materials.      The object of the introduction of
these wedge pieces or chocks, is to procure the curvature requisite in
forming a ship, when crooked timber is scarce; but the curve may
be equally obtained by a different arrangement of materials, and with
less consumption of useful timber.
    After pointing out several other defects and disadvantages arising
out of the present mode of building mercantile ships, Sir Robert
proceeds to consider the best means of obviating them.       He employs
shorter lengths of timber and of less curvature, consequently less
grain-cut, and their ends are connected by coaks or dowels, instead
of wedge pieces. In the event of a ship grounding, such a con
struction is much better adapted to give support and strength to the
fabric than the former.
    The advantages of this new principle in practice appear from a
report of the officers of Woolwich Yard to the Navy Board, relating
to a comparison of the Talavera, built upon the improved construc
tion, with the Black Prince, constructed in the usual way. Another
important circumstance relating to the Talavera          that her frame    is,
consists     small timber, hitherto considered
               of                                     only applicable as                            to
frigates, but which, when properly combined, may,           Sir Robert's         to in
opinion,       be
             rendered equal     strength and economy

bark.
     In
      the spring    1817, the author selected two oak trees, not quite
                              of
a century old, and growing near each other: the one was barked
and suffered      remain standing; the other felled, and being im
                         to
mediately stripped     bark, was placed
                                   of          situation protected from
                                                                      in   a
sun and rain.    The  following  December,   the other tree, still alive,
was cut down, placed       the same situation, and pieces
                                        in                    each, from                             of
similar parts, were subjected     the following experiments,
                                                      to          differ                                  at

   The specific gravity of the spring-felled alburnum was 0.666; that
of the winter-felled, 0-565. Equal blocks of each alburnum were
cleaved into thin pieces; and, when perfectly dry, suspended in a
damp room for ten days.      One thousand grains of the alburnum of
the spring-felled tree gained 162 grains, and of the winter-felled 145;
so that there is an obvious difference in the properties of the two;
and Mr. Knight doubts not, by taking the bark off in the spring, and
not felling the tree till winter, that the timber would be materially
improved.     He also thinks that these observations are applicable to
the heart wood as well as to the alburnum, though he has not at
present any very conclusive evidence to offer on that subject.

so close a resemblance to the vertebrae of the shark, as often to have

portion added as before.       In two days the mass of fungi was raised
in little  pyramids,   which gradually  increased in height, so as nearly
to fill the  phial, and  occupied  the cells of the mass of ice.  A thaw
now continued for some time, and the fungi fell to the bottom of the
water in the phial, where they occupied about double their original
bulk, having sustained an increase to that amount during their vege
tation in the ice and snow.
   In water these fungi appear also perceptible of vegetation, but
they produce new fungi of a green instead of a red colour.        By ex
posure to excessive cold the primitive fungi are killed, but their seed
still retains vitality, and if immersed in snow regenerates new fungi,
generally of a red colour.      The author thinks that snow is undoubt
edly the native soil of these fungi.
   This paper is illustrated by a drawing, showing the original ap
pearance of the fungi in the snow water from Baffin's Bay, and their
gradual increase in the phials, as described in this abstract.
Some Account of the Dugong.  By Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles,
  Governor of Sumatra.  Communicated in a Letter to Sir Everard
  Home, Bart. V.P.R.S. Read May 18, 1820. [Phil. Trans. 1820,
  p. 174.]
  The form of the Dugong resembles that of the common Cetacea.
The skin is smooth and thick, with a few scattered hairs, and the
 head small in proportion, with two short tusks projecting from the
 extremity of the upper jaw. The place of the incisors is substituted
 by the rough bristly surfaces of the palate and jaws, which enable
 the animal to browse upon marine vegetables. There are twelve
 cylindrical molares, with flat crowns.          The aperture of the ears is
 remarkably small.        There are no dorsal or ventral fins; but the place
 of the anterior extremities is supplied by fins, which, however, are
 not capable of supporting the animal when out of water.
    Upon dissection, the skin was found three quarters of an inch
 thick. The stomach has two appendages opening into                it,  near the
junction    of  the duodenum; the intestinal canal         is  long; the liver
 has two large and two smaller lobes, one             of
                                                       whichis  tongue-shaped
and covers the gall-bladder; the kidneys are large, and the urinary
 bladder probably capable       of    considerable distention; the testicles
are   placed    alittle below the    kidneys;   the urethra opens   in   a small
 tubercle between the two lobes      of    the glans   penis.
     In the thorax the thymus gland        is  large, black, and friable; the
lungs not lobulated; and the ventricles          of the heart, being separated
at  their points, give   it
                          a    double appearance.
     In regard       the skeleton, the head
                    to                          is remarkable for the manner
in  which the anterior      partof    the   upper  jaw  bends downwards, the
lower    jaw  being    proportionally   truncated.     There are fifty-two ver
tebrae,   eighteen   ribson  each  side,  and the sternum  is  bifurcate  at the
apex, and articulated     to    the cartilages   of  the upper ribs. There     is
no   pelvis nor posterior extremities, but opposite the eighth           or
                                                                          tenth

lumbar   vertebrae are two narrow flat bones, lodged in the flesh, one
on each side. The scapula is thick, and the humerus, radius, and
ulna, short and strong.                                        -
   The flesh of this animal is delicate and juicy, resembling young
beef.   It is only found in shallows and inlets of the sea, and the
greatest number is said to be taken during the northerly monsoon,
near the mouth of the Johore river, in the inlet of the sea between
Singapore island and the main; they seldom exceed eight or nine
feet in length, though they probably grow much larger, but are then
too strong to be caught.

    The sudden alterations                in   the rates       of chronometers, when taken
 on     board ships, are generally ascribed                   to   the motion        of   the vessel; but

from circumstances    connected with the chronometers of the Doro
thea and   Trent, during  the late voyage to the North Pole, the author
is induced to refer these alterations to other causes: he found that in
 all cases the gaining rates were increased and their losing ones di
minished on ship-board.      That this acceleration does not arise from
the ship's motion, was shown by                             its

A  Sketch of an Analysis and Notation applicable to the Estimation of
   the Value of Life Contingencies.     By Benjamin Gompertz, Esq.
   F.R.S. Read June      29,  1820.   [Phil. Trans. 1820, p. 214.]
   Mr. Gompertz begins by establishing    a system of notation intended
to avoid unnecessary repetitions and circumlocution, and proceeds to      .
apply his abbreviated expressions to a more accurate determination
of the value of a number of joint lives, according to any given tables
of mortality, than can be obtained by the common approximations.
He afterwards investigates the probabilities of the survivorship of
two persons of different ages, who were known only to be living at
one time and dead at another, which, within certain limits, are sup
posed to be equal : and he inquires into the conditions of mortality
that would be requisite in order that this proposition should be accu
rately true. He then applies his method to the problems which have
been solved by Mr. Morgan in the Philosophical Transactions, and
copied by Mr. Baily in his work on Assurances, relating to some
complicated contingencies and survivorships on different suppositions
respecting the decrement of life, employing various integrations,
summations, and approximations in this elaborate inquiry, but with
out obtaining any results which it is possible to specify in an abstract,
as giving a general idea of the nature of his improvements, without
entering into forms of expression directed almost as much to the eye
as to the understanding.
On the Measurement of Snowdon, by the Thermometrical Barometer.
   By the Rev. F.    J. H. Wollaston, B.D. F.R.S. Read June 29,
   1820.    [Phil. Trans. 1820, p. 295.]
   After adverting to the statements contained in his former paper
upon the use of the above-mentioned instrument, and giving certain
tables requisite for determining the necessary corrections arising out
of the want of uniformity in the variations of the boiling tempera
ture of water at certain elevations, the author details the means
which he resorted to for estimating the height of Snowdon by this
instrument, and compares his results with the trigonometrical and      -
barometrical measurement of General Roy.
   The height, as obtained by the thermometric barometer, properly
corrected from the north end of Carnarvon Quay to the summit, is
3546-25 feet.     General Roy's trigonometrical measurement gives
3555.4   feet, and barometrically 3548.9 feet.     During this visit to
Carnarvon, the author also took the opportunity of ascertaining, by
the same means, the height of Moel Elio, also measured by General
Roy. He makes it 2350-55 feet, while General Roy's trigonometri
cal measurement gives 2371 feet, and the barometer 2391.8 feet.
This discordance, the author thinks, may be referred to the indetermi
nate form of Moel Elio rendering the point of observation less definite.
   Archdeacon Wollaston concludes this paper with a description of
some improvements in the construction of this instrument.

 On Sounds Inaudible by certain Ears.    By William Hyde Wollaston,
  M.D. P.R.S. Read June 29, 1820.         [Phil. Trans. 1820, p. 306.]
   In this communication the author describes a peculiar insensibility
to certain sounds in the ears of persons not otherwise deaf, which
he was led to observe by trying different modes of lessening the
sense of hearing in himself; when he found, that by closing the
nose and mouth, and expanding the chest, the membrana tympani,
thrown into a state of tension by external pressure, made the ear
insensible to grave tones, without affecting the perception of sharper
 sounds.   In this case the ear was insensible to all sounds below F
marked by the bass cliff.
   In the natural healthy state of the ear, there seems to be no limit
to the power of discerning low sounds; but if we attend to the
opposite extremity of the scale of audible sounds, and with a series
of pipes, exceeding each other in sharpness, examine their effects
successively upon the ears of different persons, we shall find con
siderable difference in their powers of hearing them, and see reason
to infer that human hearing is more confined than has been supposed.
Dr. Wollaston's attention was called to this circumstance by finding
a person insensible to the sound of a small organ pipe, which, with
respect to acuteness, was far within the limits of his own hearing.
By subsequent examination, this person's hearing was found to ter
minate at a note four octaves above the middle E of the pianoforte.
Other cases of the insensibility of the ear of certain persons to high
sounds are next adverted to ; such as to the chirping of the grass
hopper, the cricket, the sparrow, and the bat; the latter being
about five octaves above the middle E of the piano.       The limit of
the author's own sense of hearing is at about six octaves above the
middle E ; and, from numerous trials, he is induced to think that,
at the limit of hearing, the interval of a single note between two
sounds may be sufficient to render the higher note inaudible, although
the lower one is heard distinctly.
   The range of human hearing includes more than nine octaves, the
whole of which are distinct to most ears, though the vibrations of a
note at the higher extreme are 600 or 700 times more frequent than
those which constitute the gravest audible sound; and as vibrations
incomparably more frequent may exist, we may imagine, says the
author, that animals like the Grylli, whose powers appear to com
mence nearly where ours terminate, may hear still sharper sounds,
which we do not know to exist; and that there may be insects hear
ing nothing in common with us, but endued with a power of exciting,
and a sense that perceives the same vibrations which constitute our
ordinary sounds, but so remote that the animal who perceives them
may be said to possess another sense, agreeing with our own, solely
in the medium by which it is excited, and possibly wholly unaffected.
by those slower vibrations of which we are sensible.

Astronomical    Observations.   By Stephen Groombridge, Esq.                               F.R.S.
           Read June  29, 1820.   [Phil. Trans. 1820, p. 330.]
   In the present improved state of astronomical observations, it is
material to possess the readiest and most accurate means of finding
the apparent time. The right ascension of certain fixed stars having
been precisely obtained relatively with each other, and with the equi
noctial points during the course of many years, affords the direct
method of ascertaining the right ascension of the mid-heaven: hence
the convenience of having the corrections of these stars in the form
of tables, that the same may be taken out at one view with the ar
guments of the sun's longitude, and of the moon's node.           For this
purpose the mean diurnal motion is adapted to the longitude of the
sun, as found in the Nautical Almanac, at the time the star passes the
meridian.    The mean epoch is reduced to the vernal equinox less
four seconds,  in order to render the corrections additive; which, being
an universal  period,  the same applies to all parts of the world. To
these tables Mr.    Groombridge    has subjoined some observations of
the planets  at and near the   oppositions;   also of the solstices of the
last two years, and of the comet of 1819.                                 *

  The use of the black rete mucosum of the negro is a subject which
has fruitlessly engaged the attention of the physiologist. The author's
mind was directed to this inquiry by the circumstance of a silver fish

 scorches and elevates the cuticle in blisters; this effect is prevented
by covering the hand or face with thin black kerseymere, and the
 same purpose is attained by the black rete mucosum of the negro.
 In these cases perspiration comes on, which it does not in the former,
and the surface, though actually hotter, is uninjured.
   Nature has provided a similar defence from the injury of light, by
placing a black pigment at the bottom of the eye of those animals
who are exposed to the intensity of the sun's rays; whereas in the
inhabitants of shady and dark situations the pigment is either pale,
or altogether wanting.
   The author concludes this paper by ascribing the beneficial effects
which he has shown to result from the black matter in the negro's
skin, and at the bottom of the eyes in certain animals, to the power
which black surfaces possess of converting the radiant matter of the
sun into sensible heat.
 On the Magnetic Phenomena produced by Electricity.                             In   a   Letter from

    In  repeating the experiments of Oersted, Sir Humphry found that
 with a voltaic battery of 100 pair of 4-inch plates, the south pole of
 a magnetic needle placed under the communicating wire of platinum
 (the positive end of the apparatus being on the right) was strongly
 attracted by the wire, which was shown to be itself magnetic, by                                      its
 power   of attracting steel filings, and         communicating permanent

    Being desirous of domesticating the Quagga in this country, his
 Lordship endeavoured to procure some individuals of that species,
 but being disappointed in obtaining a female, an attempt was made
 to breed from the male and an Arabian chestnut mare; the result
 was a female hybrid, now five years old, and showing her mixed
 origin both in form and colour.
    The Arabian mare has since been bred from, by a black Arabian
 horse, and the produce, namely, a two year old filly and a year old
 colt, though in most respects fine specimens of the Arabian breed, are
 marked with certain stripes and lines belonging exclusively to the
 Quagga: the manes are especially unlike those of the Arabian breed.
 It is a striking fact, observes his Lordship, that so many features not
 belonging to the dam, should in two successive instances be trans
 ferred by her to the progeny of a sire who has them not.
 Particulars of   a Fact, nearly similar to that related by Lord Morton,

chestnut colour was to a certain extent evident.

    By Sir Everard Home, Bart. V.P.R.S. Read December 7, 1820.
    [Phil. Trans. 1821, p. 25.]
    By a microscopic examination of the retina and optic nerve, Mr.
Bauer found them to consist of globules of rºws to roºrg of an inch
diameter, united by a transparent viscid and coagulable gelatinous
fluid : the brain also, according to the same observer, consists of the
same globules, united by the viscid jelly, and forming a fibrous ar
rangement.
    After describing the peculiarities in texture of the different parts
of the brain, Sir Everard adverts to the circumstance of lymphatics

                                   138
never having been found in that organ, and shows that the veins are
 supplied with valves, and perform the office of absorbents, carrying
their contents into the superior longitudinal sinus, which appears
rather to be a reservoir than a vein, for the fluid that passes through
it is not simply circulating blood, but contains the colouring matter
in a decomposed state, and is black as ink.
   There can be little doubt, says Sir Everard, that the communica
tion of sensation and volition is more or less dependent upon the
viscid mucus which links the globules of the brain and nerves toge
ther; he then proceeds to show its existence in the blood, and that
it is  the medium by which the colouring matter is attached to the
surface of the red globules. It would appear therefore, continues the
author, that the principal materials of which the body is composed
are found in the blood, with the exception of fat; fat, however, is
found in the blood of the skate and salmon, and perhaps is united
with the alkali in human blood.
   Sir Everard next details the result of his examination of the veins
of the coats of the stomach, and of the vasa brevia, which are also
supplied with valves, and which act the part of absorbents. In tracing
these veins towards the cavity of the stomach, they became indistinct
just as they entered the villi.
   This paper concludes with some observations respecting the struc
ture and uses of the spleen, from which Sir Everard concludes that it
is a reservoir to receive the superabundant serum carried into the
circulation from the stomach into the splenic vein; and not only of
the serum, but of the coagulable lymph, globules, soluble mucus,
and colouring matter, which are carried to the thoracic duct when
wanted.
 On Two New     Compounds of Chlorine and Carbon, and on a New Com
   pound   of Iodine, Carbon, and Hydrogen. By Mr. Faraday, Chemical
   Assistant in the Royal Institution.  Communicated by W. T. Brande,
   Esq. Sec. R.S. and Prof. Chem. R.I.       Read December 21, 1820.
    [Phil. Trans. 1821, p. 47.]
   After some general observations respecting the action of chlorine
upon compounds containing carbon, and more especially upon car
buretted hydrogen gas, Mr. Faraday details the processes by which
he succeeded in obtaining two binary compounds of carbon and chlo
rine; the first, which he calls perchloride of carbon, was formed by
exposing the triple compound of carbon, hydrogen, and chlorine,
with excess of chlorine, to the agency of the direct solar rays; mu
riatic acid was formed, and a white crystalline compound at the same
time generated.      The author next describes the method of purifying
this compound, and details its properties, which are briefly these:—it
forms crystals, which appear to result from a primitive octahedron; it
does not conduct electricity; it is slowly volatile, like camphor, at
common temperatures, fusing at 320°, and boiling at 360°. It is not
easily combustible; but when retained in the flame of the lamp,

                                                     139
produces a red flame, with the formation of muriatic acid; it is                                               in
soluble in water, and readily soluble in alcohol, ether, and oils; and
nearly insoluble in acids. When heated with several metallic perox
ides it is decomposed with the production of carbonic acid, and a
metallic perchloride.
   The author describes several experiments made with a view to
ascertain the proportions in which the carbon and chlorine exist in
this compound, from which it appears, that as one volume of olefiant
gas requires five volumes of chlorine for     conversion into muriatic  its
acid and this new chloride, and                      as
                                                                                   to of

formed,    sothree volumes                 of

form the solid chloride.

An Account        of a Micrometer      made   of Rock Crystal. By G. Dollond,
  F.R.S.      Read January 25, 1821.             [Phil. Trans. 1821, p. 101.]
   The author's object in this communication is to describe a more
simple application of rock crystal to the purposes of micrometrical
measurements in telescopes than any hitherto adopted.        His im
provement consists in the substitution of a sphere of rock crystal, in
place of the usual eye-glass, by which the trouble of angular cutting
is done away, it being only necessary to form the lens of a proper
diameter for the focal length required.
   Another advantage obtained by Mr. Dollond’s micrometer is that
of being able to take the angle on each side zero without reversing
the eye tube; and also of taking intermediate angles, by moving the
axis in which the sphere is placed; and, thirdly, it possesses the pro
perty of an eye tube not intended for micrometrical measurement,
for when the axis of the crystal is parallel to that of the object
glass, only one image is formed, and that perfectly distinct. After
adverting to some other advantages resulting from this improvement,
Mr. Dollond proceeds more particularly to describe the contrivance
by reference to an annexed drawing.
The Bakerian Lecture.    On the best kind of Steel and Form for a
  Compass Needle.    By Captain Henry Kater, F.R.S.   Read Feb. 1,
  1821.    [Phil. Trans. 1821, p. 104.]
   On the return of the first expedition from the discovery of a
North-west Passage, the compasses were reported to have become
nearly useless, from the diminution of the directive force consequent
upon the near approach to the magnetic pole.               The azimuth
compasses on that occasion being of the author's invention, he was
anxious that the second expedition should be furnished with instru
ments combining the utmost power and sensibility; and was con
sequently led to the researches, the mode of conducting which, with
their results, form the subject of this lecture.
   In respect to the best material for the construction of compass
needles, Captain Kater found that clock springs made of sheer steel
were capable of receiving the greatest magnetic force, and that in
forming the needle it should be exposed as little as possible to heat,
by which     its
               capability   receiving magnetism
                                  of                  diminished.

   The form best   adapted for the needle      the pierced rhombus,

   These bones were found not far from those previously described

  In this   paper, after adverting to the sources, properties, and com
position of carburetted hydrogen obtained from stagnant water, and
of olefiant gas procured from the decomposition of alcohol; and after
examining the agency of chlorine upon these compounds; the author
proceeds to examine the gas procured by the decomposition of oil
and of coal at high temperatures.        The former, or          gas,     shown         oil           is
to  vary considerably        composition and properties, according

                                          artificial illumination.
     Inanalysing these gases, Dr. Henry always found them mixtures
of  olefiant, carburetted hydrogen, hydrogen, and carbonic oxide
gases.     Dr. Henry separated the first         the action       by

Some Observations and Experiments on the Papyri found in the Ruins
  of Herculaneum. By Sir Humphry Davy, Bart. P.R.S. Read
  March 15, 1821. [Phil. Trans. 1821, p. 191.]
    Having in some preliminary experiments upon fragments of a roll
of papyrus found at Herculaneum, the leaves of which adhered
very strongly together, ascertained that it afforded, by exposure to
heat, a considerable quantity of inflammable gaseous matter; that
when digested in nitric and muriatic ether it coloured those fluids;
and that, when immersed in an atmosphere of chlorine, it was evi
dently acted upon;–Sir Humphry Davy concluded that there yet re
mained in these papyri no inconsiderable portion of undecomposed
vegetable matter. With this information he proceeded to examine the
collection preserved at Naples; and after detailing the state of the
manuscripts, he describes the methods resorted to for detaching the
layers and ascertaining their contents.            These methods were con
siderably varied, according to the state of the manuscripts.              Those
which were pale chestnut-coloured, and covered with white ashes,
were so far destroyed as to render                 all
                                                attempts       arriving
                                                                    at       any
                                                                               at
knowledge        oftheir contents quite hopeless. Two manuscripts                       of
firmer texture, and having the appearance                 peat, were unrolled
                                                              of
when acted      upon  by chlorine and    heat,  but they   had been rendered
illegible by the previous operation            of
                                            water.     All the best specimens
of  the black and more perfect manuscripts had been operated upon
before Sir Humphry's arrival          Naples;

only some remaining fragments, from many                       of
                                                           which         he

succeeded        obtaining parts
                in                of columns, by which their contents may
be   judged      of.On the black manuscripts containing white earthy
matter     in their folds several experiments were tried, but they were
rarely successful, from the firm agglutination                 of
                                                          the fibres     the pa

pyrus.
    After having adverted        tothe various impediments that were op
posed     tothese proceedings, by the persons under whose care and su
perintendence the Herculaneum manuscripts                Naples were placed,

                                              to      continuing    the inquiry,
Sir   Humphry     concludes this   paper   with some    general   observations.
The Roman manuscripts are generally
                                                         on

larger characters, though less perfect than the Greek ones. None
of  them contain those vestiges             of
                                           oxide         of

been detected had ink       ofgalls and iron been employed: indeed                 it   is
probable, says Sir Humphry Davy, that the use                this ink and that
                                                                    of

Observations on Naphthaline, a peculiar Substance resembling a Con
  crete Essential Oil, which is apparently produced during the Decom
 position of Coal Tar, by Erposure to a Red Heat. By       J.
                                                           Kidd, M.D.
   Professor of Chemistry, Oxford. Communicated by W. H. Wol
  laston, M.D. F.R.S.      Read March 8, 1821.     [Phil. Trans. 1821,
  p. 209.]
   By passing coal tar through a red-hot iron tube, a portion of an
aqueous fluid, and of a substance like tar, was obtained; the latter
is black, soluble in ether, and partially in alcohol, of an aromatic
odour, and sweetish taste.    It was submitted to slow distillation,
and among other products afforded naphthaline, a white concrete sub
stance of an aromatic odour and taste, fusible at 180°, and scarcely
soluble in water, but readily so in ether, alcohol, and oils.
   Of the various characters of this substance, detailed by the author,
its tendency to crystallize appears the most remarkable; its vapour
condenses in rhombic plates, which are sometimes modified into hex
agonal plates, by the incomplete development of the smaller angles
of the usual rhomb.
   The other substances obtained along with the naphthaline were
ammoniacal water, and an oil of a bituminous and aromatic odour,
boiling at 210°, and not congealing at 32°, highly inflammable, and
readily soluble in alcohol and ether: there was also produced, during
the latter part of the distillation, a yellow farina precipitable from
its alcoholic solution by water, and fusible. Of these four substances,
resulting from the distillation of the black liquid obtained by distil
ling coal tar, Dr. Kidd thinks that the water and the farina are pro
ducts, and the other mere educts of the operation.
On the Aberrations of Compound Lenses and Object- Glasses.  By
  J.F. W. Herschel, Esq. F.R.S. &c. Read March 22, 1821. [Phil.
  Trans. 1821, p. 222.]
   To those mathematicians who have investigated the theory of the
refracting telescope, it has often, says Mr. Herschel, been objected,
that little practical benefit has resulted from their speculations. Al
though the simplest considerations suffice for correcting that part of
the aberration which arises from the different refrangibility of the
different coloured rays, yet in the more difficult part of the theory of
optical instruments which relates to the correction of the spherical
aberration, the necessity of algebraic investigation has always been
acknowledged; although, however, the subject is confessedly within
itsreach,a   varietyof causes have interfered with   itssuccessful pro
secution, and the best artists are content    to  work their glasses by
empirical rules.   In the investigations detailed   in  this paper, the

 the usual methods hitherto described, the author proposes the follow
 ing process. The solution containing the iron is to be peroxidized
 by nitric acid, then neutralized while boiling by carbonate of ammo
'nium; the iron falls, while the other metals, which Mr. Herschel sup
 poses to be manganese, cerium, nickel, and cobalt, remain in solution.
 A few precautions are necessary to insure success in this operation;
 such as, that the solution must contain no oxide of manganese or ce
 rium, except in their states of protoxide; and that during the pre
 cipitation the solution should be duly diluted and agitated; and the
 latter portions of the alkaline solution, carefully added so as to avoid
 its excess, though slightly surpassing the point of saturation, give
 rise to no error or inconvenience.
  Mr. Herschel concludes this paper with some observations re
specting those peculiarities of the peroxide upon which  separation                               of
                   depends,      gives                  application                               its its

patient's general health being disordered, nothing further was done
till the summer  1820, when  second operation was performed

                                 the canal were thus completed; and
 by   third operation, upon
        a                      smaller scale, the cure was ultimately

An Account of Observations        made with the Eight-Feet Astronomical
   Circle, at the Observatory of Trinity College, Dublin, since the Be
   ginning of the Year 1818, for Investigating the Effects of Parallar
   and Aberration on the Places of certain fived Stars; also the Com
   parison of these with former Observations for determining the Effects
   of Lunar Nutation. By the Reverend John Brinkley, D.D. F.R.S.
   and M.R.I.A.      Andrews Professor of Astronomy in the University
   of Dublin. Read June 21, 1821. [Phil. Trans. 1821, p. 327.]
   The observations, of which the details are given in this communi
cation, were instituted with a view to discover the source of the dif
ferences that have existed between the observations made at Green
wich and those at Dublin. Dr. Brinkley's former observations of cer
tain stars pointed out a deviation of about one second from the mean
place, after having made all usual corrections.       Mr. Pond's observa
tions pointed out no such deviations.       Dr. Brinkley referred the de
viations which he had observed to parallax; and his principal object
in the present paper is to ascertain how far that opinion is correct,
and to show that no change of figure in the instrument, nor any un
certainties of the changes of refraction, can be admitted as the causes
of the effects observed.
   As, in deducing the quantity of parallax, the results must be affected
by any uncertainty in the constant of aberration; and, in like manner,
as in investigating the constant of aberration, from observations of a
given star, the parallax, if any, will be involved,—the author adopted
the following process in reducing the observations.
   The observed zenith distances of a given star were reduced to         Ja
nuary 1st, 1819, by the common equations, taking the constant of aber
ration = 20"-25. The mean of these was taken. The correct mean
zenith distance was supposed equal to this mean         –  e ; the constant
of aberration = 20"25+       w;  and the  semi-parallax  = p. The equa
tions of condition thus resulting from the respective observations,
thus contained three unknown quantities.          These equations were
reduced to three by the method of making the sum of the squares of
the errors a minimum.       The solutions of these three equations give
the values of e and p, and thence the values of the mean -
                                                             polar distance,
constant of  aberration,   and  semi-parallax.
   After a very detailed account of the method of conducting his ob
servations, instituted with a view of obtaining an explanation of the
source of the difference of the results of his former observations, and
of those of Mr. Pond relative to parallax, Dr. Brinkley states his       in
ability to detect any such explanation, or to obtain any result op
posed to his former conclusions: he remarks, however, that the dis
cordances between his observations and those made at Greenwich,
may by some be considered as showing the great precision of modern
observations, since the whole extent of the absolute difference is only
about one second.        Independent, however, of the interest of the
question of parallax, it is important, he observes, to ascertain the
origin of this small difference.

On the Effects produced in the Rates of Chronometers by the Proximity
  of Masses of Iron. By Peter Barlow, Esq. of the Royal Military
  Academy.     Communicated by John Barrow, Esq. F.R.S.         Read
  June  28,  1821.   [Phil. Trans. 1821, p. 361.]
     It        been ascertained that during Captain Buchan's voy
          having
age to the arctic regions, in 1818, the rates of chronometers dif
fered on board and on shore, and this change having been attributed
by Mr. Fisher to the iron of the vessel, the author felt desirous of
examining into the effects of the proximity of masses of iron upon
chronometers’ rates, and of determining their causes. In this com
munication he details the results of a variety of experiments and ob
servations relative to the effects of iron on chronometers placed under
different circumstances in                      its
                                   vicinity; whence          concludes, that       he                                 it
undoubtedly does alter their rates, but that              does not necessarilyit
accelerate them,        suggested

On a New Compound of Chlorine and Carbon. By Richard Phillips,

   The above substance was discovered by M. Julien, of Abo, in
Finland, amongst the products arising out of the distillation of cal
cined sulphate of iron, with crude nitre in iron retorts.            It forms
white acicular  crystals  by   sublimation,   and when    passed  through    a
green glass tube containing red-hot rock crystal, it is decomposed
with the deposition of charcoal and evolution of chlorine.           It is not
altered by repeated sublimations in chlorine.          It was analysed by
passing        its
            vapour over red-hot oxide           copper, by which chloride
                                                           of
of copper and carbonic acid gas were produced: the former was de
composed by nitrate         silver, and the proportion

periments,   which, with their results, are given at length in this
paper; and after showing the practical applications of which the
investigations contained in it are susceptible, he concludes by ob
serving, that a just estimate of their importance can scarcely be
formed, till an analogous account of the nerves of the throat, neck,
and chest shall be laid before the Society, which will show that in
them also there are the same distinctions of structure and functions,
and that the nerves of respiration may be distinguished and separated
amidst the apparent intricacy of the general system, and that by
dividing them, the motions of the several parts, which unite in the
act of respiration, may be successively stopped; while their other
functions, dependent upon their other nerves, are continued.
   By pursuing this investigation, the remaining parts of the nervous
system are also much simplified, and the apparent confusion arising
out of the crossing and re-union of nerves is thus shown to be for
the purpose of associating the muscles into different classes, for
combining them in subserviency to different organs, and placing
them under the guidance of a sensibility more certain in       operation                  its

netic needles, while imperfectly conducting fluids did not, under                                        si
milar circumstances, give any polarity          steel.   Electricity passed
                                                                     to
through air, however, produces this effect; and Sir Humphry has
succeeded       affecting the arc
                 in                     fire by the approximation
                                                          of                                         of   a
magnet.
     In
     investigating   the relative conducting powers       substances for            of
electricity, Sir Humphry found that wire kept cool           better con
                                                               a                     is  a
ductor than when heated; and the knowledge           this fact led   the       of                   to
explanation        very singular result, namely, that      applying heat            by
                     of of   a a
to one part        wire      the circuit, in                        its
                                             other parts become colder,
and that       by
              applying  cold  they become  hotter; thus, when one part

                                   155
of a wire, heated to dull redness in the circuit, is cooled by ice, the
remaining portion becomes white hot, whilst the application of the
flame of a spirit-lamp renders the other part colder.
   In discussing the relations of heat, magnetism, and chemical ac
tion, to electricity, Sir Humphry particularly adverts to the relative
elevations of temperature which the different metals undergo during
the transmission of electricity: thus, when a chain, composed of al
ternate lengths of silver and platinum is made the connecting me
dium between the poles of a powerful battery, the silver wire being
four or five times the diameter of the platinum, the former metal is
not sensibly heated, whilst the latter becomes intensely ignited.
Now if heat be regarded as material, we cannot suppose that it is
expelled from the platinum because it may be thus generated           in
definitely; again, if dependent upon, or identical with, electricity,
its quantity should be similar throughout the metallic chain. In re
gard to the magnetism of this chain, the case is different, for every
part of it exhibits equal magnetic powers; so that the power appears
directly as the quantity of electricity.
    Sir Humphry Davy concludes this communication with some ge
neral remarks respecting the different phenomena produced by the
agency of electricity; whether they depend upon one or more spe
cies of ethereal matter, or whether they are merely exhibitions of the
attractive powers and subtile motions of the corpuscles of common
matter, are questions which remain for the determination of future
researches and experiments.
 The Bakerian Lecture.     An Account of Erperiments to determine the
    Amount of the    Dip  of the Magnetic Needle in London, in August
    1821; with Remarks on the Instruments which are usually employed
    in such Determinations.    By Captain Edward Sabine, of the Royal
    Regiment of Artillery, F.R.S.     Read November 22, 1821. [Phil.
    Trans. 1822, p. 1.]
    After describing the imperfections of the instruments in general
 use for ascertaining the dip of the magnetic needle, and adverting to
 the consequent inaccuracy and insufficiency of the observations made
 with them, Captain Sabine gives an account of the form of dipping
 needle which he preferred for his experiments, and which was con
 structed for him by Mr. Dollond, upon principles laid down by Pro
 fessor Meyer, of Gottingen.     He then enters into minute details of
 the mode of    pursuing  and  verifying his observations, the results of
 which, gained by three different methods, are as follows: viz. by 10
 experiments with Meyer's needle, 70° 2'-9; by the times of oscil
 lation in the magnetic meridian, and in the plane perpendicular to it
 (mean by three needles), 70° 04'; by the times of vertical and hori
 zontal oscillation, 7°02'-6.    So that 70° 03' may be considered as
 the mean dip of the needle towards the north, in August and Sep
 tember 1821, within four hours of noon, being the limit within which
 all the experiments were made.

overlooked, and the smoothness of the skin would give it a greater

   The comet described in Captain Hall's letter was visible for 33
days in the months of April and May, 1821.           During the first week
its nucleus was    bright  and  distinct; but being then in the interior of
the country, he did not commence observing it till the 8th of April,
when its nucleus had become so indistinct as to render its measure
ment by the micrometer uncertain.           On its first appearance, the
comet appeared of a dull white, and its tail presented a dark streak
            itssides, giving      the appearance     being split.

   Dr. Brinkley remarks that the comet observed by Captain Hall                              is
interesting   to astronomers           on
                                   account     its small perihelion distance,

                       the sun.    On the 8th      April was distant from

                            the 3rd    May, of2-64,  the sun's distance from
the earth being unity.
   Dr. Brinkley also remarks that            probably the same comet that
                                             it      is
was observed       in1593;       agrees with that

distance, and great inclination.       Of that comet, the inclination was
88°, and the perihelion distance ’089;          this, the inclination
                                                          of             106°           is
44', and its perihelion distance ’093.

                                             having escaped European ob
servers.   It  was never more than        few degrees from the sun, and
                                                 a

  Artificial Pupil, consisting of an anterior membranous and a poste
 rior muscular coat; the latter, in the act of contraction, presses
 back the lens upon the vitreous humour, the elasticity of which
 causes it again to advance when the sphincter muscle of the iris re
 laxes.     In proof of the correctness of this opinion, Sir Everard ad
 duces some experiments illustrative of the influence of belladonna
 upon myopic eyes.
    Having ascertained that the marsupium is not muscular, I could

On the anomalous Magnetic Action of Hot Iron between the White
  and Blood-red Heat.     By Peter Barlow, Esq. of the Royal                            Mili

  Engineers, F.R.S.   Read

  p. 117.]
   Finding the attractive power of soft malleable iron and steel for a
magnet greater than that of cast-iron and hard steel, the author was
desirous of ascertaining the effect of heating these bodies in a fur
nace, so as to render them perfectly soft, upon their magnetic power.
With this view the bars were rendered white-hot, and being placed
in the direction of the dip, their powers were found nearly equal. It
was however found that there was a point between the white heat,
at which all magnetic action was lost, and the blood-red heat, at
which it was strongest, at which the iron attracted the needle the
contrary way to which it did when cold; viz. if the bar and com
pass were so placed that the north end of the needle was drawn to it
when cold, the south end was attracted during the interval above
mentioned.
    The author then proceeds to detail some further experiments in
illustration of this anomalous magnetic action, from which it appears
that the quantity of magnetic attraction at a red heat is influenced
by the height or depth of the centre of the bar from the compass;
and as the natural effect of the cold iron was changed by placing the
compass below the centre of the bar, it became a question how far
the negative attraction was also changed.          To decide, the compass
was lowered to within six inches of the bottom of the bar, when the
cold iron produced a deviation of 21°, by attracting the south end of
the needle. At a white heat             its
                                     power ceased; but          this subsidedas
   bright red the negative attraction amounted

                                           another series        experiments of

   Being doubtful how far the heat itself, independent               the iron,    of

duced       no

Observations for ascertaining the Length of the Pendulum at Madras
  in the East Indies, Latitude 13° 4' 9"1 N.; with the Conclusions
  drawn from the same.     By John Goldingham, Esq. F.R.S.    Read
  January 31, 1822. [Phil. Trans. 1822, p. 127.]
   The observations detailed in this paper are comprised in two se
ries.  By the result of the first, the pendulum of experiment, which
was constructed upon the same principles as that used by Captain
Kater, and described in the Philosophical Transactions for 1819, was
found to make 86166,108 vibrations in twenty-four hours, and by the
result of the second series, 86166,048, the mean being 86166,078;
so that the result of each series differs from the mean only rà-$oth of
a beat in twenty-four hours.
   The length of the seconds pendulum at Madras, deduced as the
mean of these two series of observations, is 39°026302 inches of Sir
George Shuckburgh's scale, at the temperature of 70° in vacuo, and
at the level of the sea.
   By comparing this with the length of the pendulum vibrating se
conds in London, we obtain gr;     ºr   as the ellipticity of the earth,
which is  very nearly the mean deduced from the observations of Cap
tain Kater in  England,  and those of the French mathematicians.

   The rock in which the cavern, mentioned in the title of this paper,
is formed, is that species of limestone called Oolite. Its greatest
length is from 250 to 300 feet, and its breadth and height vary from
two to seven feet, there being few places in which it is possible to
stand upright.   Its bottom was covered by a sediment of mud, and
the roof and sides, as well as the surface of the mud, were incrusted
by stalactitic matter. The animal remains were found, not upon the
surface, but in the lower part only of this muddy deposit, and in the
stalagmitic accumulations beneath    it,and were thus remarkably pre
served from decay.     The teeth and bones hitherto discovered are
those of the hyaena, fox, bear, of   an

themselves after the deluge, seems proved             the total absence              by                                      of

On the Difference in the Appearance of the Teeth and the Shape of the
  Skull in different Species of Seals. By Sir Everard Home, Bart.
  V.P.R.S. Read February 28, 1822. [Phil. Trans. 1822, p. 239.]
   In this paper, which is illustrated by three drawings, Sir Everard
brings before the Society an account of some peculiarities in the
skull and teeth of different species of Seals, in order to prevent mis
takes being made when fossil remains of that animal are met with.
The first drawing is of the skull of the large seal, from the South
Seas; the second, from a seal shot near the Orkneys; and the third,
from a seal's skull in the Museum of the College of Surgeons, from
New Georgia, near the ice towards the South Pole. In all these the
teeth differ in form, which the author suggests may arise from the
shell fish on which they live being of different kinds.

   The result of the experiments detailed in this paper are, that
merely hammering a bar of soft steel upon pewter and upon stone,
gives it a feeble magnetic power; but that the same bar hammered
vertically upon a poker, became much more powerfully magnetic.
On inverting the bar a single blow nearly destroyed               magnetism,           its

On the Alloys of Steel.       By  J. Stodart, Esq. F.R.S. and Mr. M.
    Faraday, Chemical Assistant in the Royal Institution.      Communi
    cated by J. Stodart, Esq. F.R.S.     Read March 21, 1822.      [Phil.

   The metals which form the most valuable alloys with steel, for the
purpose of manufacture into cutting instruments, are silver, platinum,
rhodium, iridium, osmium, and palladium.         Eight pounds of Indian
steel, alloyed with rºwth of pure silver, formed a very hard and
tenacious compound, well adapted to the manufacture of cutlery and
several edge tools.     Ten pounds of the same steel with r+gth of
pure platinum, produced an alloy less hard but more tough than the
 former.
    With rhodium, iridium, and osmium the alloys were also excellent;
but the scarcity of those metals prevents their general introduction
into the manufactory.
    The authors then state the processes of analysis which they
adopted to assure themselves of the composition and perfection of
the respective alloys.
    The alloy with platinum is rapidly acted upon by sulphuric acid;
 and to ascertain the presence of the platinum, the residuary black
powder of this solution, after having been heated red hot, is to be
treated with nitro-muriatic acid, and the platinum reduced by heat.
    The residuary matter of the alloy of silver, when similarly acted
 on by dilute sulphuric acid, was dissolved in nitric acid, and tested
by muriatic. The residue of the alloy of palladium having been
heated, was dissolved in nitro-muriatic acid, and precipitated by
prussiate of mercury.      From the rhodium residuum the iron was re
moved    by  muriatic  acid, and long digestion in nitro-muriatic acid
gave an easily distinguishable muriate of rhodium.       The residue of
iridium and osmium was decomposed in the usual way by the action
 of caustic soda.
    The rapid action of dilute sulphuric acid upon these alloys, as
 compared with pure steel, is next adverted to, and is referred to
electrical action, a voltaic combination being produced by the libe
 ration of the difficultly oxidable metal.
    The black insoluble residue of these alloys, obtained by the action
 of dilute sulphuric, appear to be peculiar compounds. When boiled
 in dilute muriatic acid, protoxide of iron is dissolved, and a black in
 soluble compound remains, which, when dried and heated to 400°,
 burns like pyrophorus, leaving protoxide of iron and the alloying
 metal : hence, say the authors, during the action of the acids on the
 steel, a portion of hydrogen enters into combination with part of the
 metal and charcoal, and forms an inflammable compound not acted
 on by the acids.     The action of nitric acid on some of these residua
 produces a deflagrating compound, especially that from the alloy of
 platinum.

the human spine, and to some pathological consequences connected
with such structure.

 Of   the Nerves which associate the Muscles of the Chest, in the ac
    tions of Breathing, Speaking, and Expression. Being a Continuation
    of the Paper on the Structure and Functions of the Nerves. By
    Charles Bell, Esq. Communicated by Sir Humphry Davy, Bart.
    LL.D. P.R.S. Read May 2, 1822. [Phil. Trans. 1822, p.284.]
    This paper forms the continuation of that printed in the last vo
lume of the Society's Transactions, by the same author.          In the
present communication the author proceeds to show that the office of
the respiratory apparatus is not confined to the changes produced
upon the blood, but that the same actions are employed in subservi
ence to other organs, and that they perform a variety of functions,
as in the natural voice in articulate language, and in the expression
of passion, as well as in the more familiar acts of smelling, coughing,
sneezing, &c.
    Having established the proofs of the necessity of a number of re
mote parts being joined in the performance of these functions, he
proceeds to show that there is a distinct class of nerves for this pur
pose. That these nerves depart from the same column of the spinal
marrow, and diverge to all the parts of the frame, which are drawn
into consent in the action of respiration.
    Proceeding to show the difference betwixt the calm and uniform
breathing for the purposes of circulation, and the excited and more
irregular actions, as in speaking, singing, coughing, and sneezing, he
proves the necessity of certain powerful muscles being brought in as
accessories and aids to the common muscles of respiration. He nexts
shows that the respiratory nerves are entirely distributed to these
accessory muscles.
    After tracing these nerves, and disengaging them from their       in
tricate relation with the other nerves, he proceeds, by comparative
 anatomy, and by experiments, to show that they are respiratory
nerves, and that their division cuts off the parts to which they are
respectively distributed from participating in the act of respiration.
    He takes occasion to show that authors have attended too ex
 clusively to the par vagum, or eighth pair of nerves, which is only the
principal or central nerve of an extensive class of nerves, which

                                                     172
have the same root, and receive their power from the same source;
and that when injured in their common origin, there is a simulta
neous cessation of motion in all the apparatus of respiration, that
breathing instantly ceases, and with it life.
   Touching on Pathology, he assigns reasons for believing that
sudden death, when there is no apparent injury of vital organs, is
by disorder of this division of the nervous system.
   Having distinguished these nerves from the common voluntary and
sensible nerves on the one hand, and from the sympathetic system
on the other, he proceeds to show that expression is seated in these
nerves. That they are not merely the nerves which order the motions
of breathing, the nerves of natural and articulate language, but that
through them the breast, chest, and face become the organs of ex
pression, whenever the heart is agitated by sentiment or passion;
and that without their instrumentality, the utmost agitation of the
spirits in passion would be attended with no outward sign.

 On the State of Water and Aëriform Matter in Cavities found in cer
    tain Crystals.   By Sir Humphry Davy, Bart. P.R.S. Read      -   June
     13, 1822.    [Phil. Trans. 1822, p. 367.]
    After adverting to the interesting phenomena connected with cer
 tain crystalline products of the globe, and showing that the Huttonian
theory more plausibly accounts for their formation than the Wer
 merian, Sir Humphry proceeds to offer additional arguments in its
 favour, deduced from his examination of the aëriform and liquid
 matter contained in certain siliceous stones.      The fluid was in all
 cases found to be nearly pure water; and the elastic fluid was pure
 azote, existing always, however, in a state of considerable rarefac
 tion; namely, from 12 to 18 times more rare than atmospheric air.
 In the only two cases in which the relation of the bulk of the water
to that of the void space could be ascertained, it was nearly as 2
to 1.
    In the chalcedonies of basaltic rocks the gas was also azote, but it
was 61 or 70 times more rare than atmospheric air, the quantity of
water to that of void space being the same as in the rock crystal.
    It occurred to the author that atmospheric air might have been
originally included, and that the oxygen might have been absorbed
by the water; and an experiment is detailed, the result of which
proved favourable to such an opinion. None of the crystals of se
condary rocks examined by Sir Humphry Davy were impervious to
air; in these, therefore, atmospheric air was found of its usual den
sity; this was even the case with the cavities in dense calcareous
spar.
    The President observes, in conclusion,    that it appears difficult to
explain the results obtained, unless by supposing the water and silica
separated from each other at a very high temperature; at such tem
peratures a liquid hydrate of silica might exist under pressure, and
like other liquid bodies in the atmosphere, it would probably contain
small quantities of atmospheric air; and upon such a supposition, the
phenomena presented by the water in rock crystal and chalcedony
might be accounted for.

Some Experiments on the Changes which take place in the fired Prin
  ciples of the Egg during Incubation.   By William Prout, M.D.
  F.R.S. Read June 20, 1822. [Phil. Trans. 1822, p. 377.]
   In the researches detailed in this paper, the author's attention was
chiefly directed to the nature, proportions, and changes of the earthy
and saline substances contained in the egg, and to the source of the
matter constituting the skeleton of the chick. He therefore analysed
the egg first in its recent state, and then at the end of the first, se
cond, and third weeks of incubation, his experiments being princi
pally confined to the eggs of the domestic fowl.
   After some preliminary details relating to the variations in weight
which eggs suffer when kept, and which show that for a considerable
period they sustain a daily loss of about nine grains, and that the
relative weights of the shell, albumen, and yolk, are liable to con
siderable variation, Dr. Prout proceeds to describe the manner in
which he conducted his analysis, especially in relation to the saline
principles of the yolk. This substance is remarkably difficult of    in
cineration, in consequence of the phosphorus which it contains burn
ing into phosphoric acid, which forms a coating that protects the
coal from the action of the air. The general results of these experi
ments are thrown into the form of tables. They show that the rela
tive weights of the constituent principles of different eggs vary con
siderably, and that during incubation the loss of weight exceeds by
about eight times that which the egg sustains by ordinary keeping.
That in the earlier stages of incubation an interchange of principle
takes place between the yolk and a portion of the albumen, which
passes into a substance in some respects analogous to curd of milk.
That as incubation proceeds, the phosphorus of the yolk becomes
phosphoric acid, which, united with lime, is found in the bones of the
chicken; which lime, Dr. Prout thinks, makes its appearance in some
unaccountable manner, and from some unknown source, and that it
does not pre-exist in any known state in the recent egg.         Its only
possible source, observes Dr. Prout, is the shell; but we are pre
cluded ascertaining the exact quantity of lime in any particular shell
before and after incubation, and the application of averages cannot
be resorted to, in consequence of the great difference of weight in
the shells of different eggs. The author's reasons for doubting that
origin, or source of the lime, are, that the membrane in contact with
the shell is never vascular, and that both the albumen and the yolk
contain at the end of incubation a considerable quantity of earthy
matter, which one would suppose would have been appropriated to
the bone in preference to that derived from a more remote source.
 Dr. Prout observes, that the circumstance of the shell becoming very
 brittle towards the end of incubation, may by some be ascribed to
 the absorption of a portion of   its  substance; but this he    inclined
                                                                is

                      sufficient     account for all the known changes
 which the shell suffers. He of to   opinion that great doubt hangs over

the source of the lime, though he by no means intends to assert- the
impossibility of          its
                    being derived from the shell.

    The longitude of Masulipatam Flagstaff by the eclipses is 81°12'
 33", and by the chronometer 81°12' 15", which is so close an agree
 ment, that the longitude of this important point of the coast may be
 regarded as correctly determined. Mr. Goldingham then details the
 observations by which he determined the latitude and longitude of
Point de Galle Flagstaff, the mean of the former being 6° 0'50" N.,
 and the latter 80° 17' 2" E.; the longitude of Canton, deduced as
the mean of Capt. Huddart's observations and his own, Mr. Golding
ham gives as 113° 18'23" East of Greenwich.
 Observations on the Genus Planaria. By      J. R. Johnson, M.D.  F.R.S.
           Read June 27, 1822.      [Phil. Trans. 1822, p. 437.]
    In this paper the author confines his observations to four species
of the above genus, which are delineated of their natural size in an
annexed drawing. They are generally clustered under leaves, stones,
or pieces of wood, in slow streams; they are very rapid and change
able in their movements, in consequence of the annular muscles of
which the body consists; their texture, however, is so soft, as not
to admit of accurate dissection, though the author was able to ascer
tain that the body consisted of one common cavity, with lateral cells,
like that of the medicinal leach.      In the Planaria torva, two ventral
apertures are particularly distinct. The upper one gives passage to
a long flexible tube, and the lower conducts to the ovarium; this
tube they frequently project, and employ it in seizing worms and
aquatic insects; they also receive their food by this organ, and not
exclusively by the mouth, as the author proved by presenting an
earth worm to one of the Planaria lactea, from which he had re
moved the head; it soon affixed itself, and became distended by food.
When, however, the animal is injured, or loses this tube, it then takes
sustenance by the mouth. Though he has repeatedly seen the young
of the Planaria torva and Planaria cornuta, the author has not de
termined whether they are oviparous or viviparous.          The Planaria
lactea and Planaria brunnea are     oviparous,  producing   eggs within a

which, on escaping from the egg, are of various sizes, and very

     At   the commencement     this paper Dr. Marcet, after adverting

unable      to
          detect the smallest trace     that metal; nor did he find
                                                               of                                                  it

   Dr. Marcet next examined sea water, with      view     ascertaining         a             of
whether any nitrates are present     it: with this view   inadded sul                         he

                                                    sea water may               in                                 be

                           the same bittern for earthy and metallic
salts, the author found  that neither alkalies nor their carbonates
throw down anything but magnesia, and that                                           no

On the Ultimate Analysis of Vegetable and Animal Substances. By
  Andrew Ure, M.D. F.R.S.     Read June 27, 1822.   [Phil. Trans.
  1822, p. 457.]
  Dr. Ure commences this paper by adverting to the fallacies to
which the modes of analysing organic substances hitherto practised
are subject; and in detailing the peculiar methods adopted in his own
researches, he shows the means of obviating them, and of diminishing
the various sources of inaccuracy to which these complicated pro
cesses of analytical chemistry are necessarily more or less liable.
Where oxide of copper is used,                           its
                                      hygrometric quality has generally

     The Vibrio tritici   small worm which infects wheat, being the

                                of
Purples. Upon examining the grains thus diseased, the author found
them       the unimpregnated germens, containing masses
          to   be                                               white                                     ofa

through the microscope, displayed hundreds of minute worms in
lively motion.      When these worms had become perfectly dry, and
apparently entirely lifeless, they again recovered upon being moist
 ened with a drop of water, and were as lively as before.
   To determine the origin of these animals, Mr. Bauer undertook a
 series of experiments, which convinced him that the spawn or eggs
were conveyed into the cavities of the germens by the circulating
 sap. In these experiments he inserted some of the worms into sound
grains of wheat, suffered them to germinate, and found the worms
in different stages of their growth in the stalk, and ultimately in the
germens.
   The largest of these worms was one fourth of an inch long, and
one eightieth of an inch in diameter; their head is armed with a
moveable proboscis, and the tail ends in a claw-like point; at a small
distance from which, on the inferior side, is an orifice, from which
they discharge their eggs in strings of five or six, adhering to each
other. Each egg is about sºuth of an inch long, and synth, or rºwth
in diameter; and if attentively examined, they are transparent enough
to allow of the young worm being seen within, which, in about an
hour and a half after the egg is laid, extricates itself. These worms
exhibit no external distinctions of sex, and the author considers them
to be hermaphrodites.
   The first specimens of these worms which Mr. Bauer examined,
were from grains twelve months old, and consequently perfectly dry.
He, however, also succeeded in recovering them by immersion in
water, from wheat which had been kept five years and eight months;
but the longer the specimens were kept, the longer were the worms
obliged to be immersed in water, to enable them to recover their
muscular motions.       The longest period of its suspension which he
had   observed,   was six years and one month; after that time they
seemed    perfectly  dead.
   Alternately moistened and dried in a watch-glass, these worms
might be preserved alive for several weeks; and if kept continually
moist, they remained alive for three months; but if dried at the end
of that period, they do not again recover, but become quite straight,
and remain unaltered in the water for more than fourteen months,
when they gradually decay. Their extraordinary preservation, and
these various circumstances, Mr. Bauer refers to the mucous-like water
in which they are enveloped, and which appears to be of an oily na
ture.
   The author concludes this paper with an abstract of the description
of these worms given by other writers, and of their opinions respect
ing their origin.
On Metallic Titanium.      By W.  H. Wollaston, M.D. V.P.R.S.     Read

mistaken for pyrites.  Upon subjecting them, however, to more rigid
examination than they had previously received, Dr. Wollaston ascer
tained them to be titanium in its metallic state. He found them not
only harder than pyrites, but so hard as to scratch glass, and even
agate.   They are neither acted upon by nitric, sulphuric, nor muri
atic acids;  nor are they dissolved by nitro-muriatic acid.     They are
infusible before the blowpipe, but become superficially oxidized, and
borax restores the cleanliness of their surface, by dissolving the oxide.
By nitre they are rapidly oxidized; and by combining          action with                        its
        borax,  they may     entirely          be

    It appears from the investigations detailed in this paper, that with
respect to a measurement on the meridian, the degree depending on
Colonel Lambton's brass scale must be multiplied by the fraction
 :000018, and the product subtracted from the measure given by the
scale to reduce it to the present parliamentary standard; and that
the degree depending on Ramsden's bar must be multiplied by .00007,
and the product added to the measure given by the scale to reduce it
to the standard.
‘On the Changes which have taken place in the Declination of some of
    the principal fired Stars.  By John Pond, Esq. Astronomer Royal,
    F.R.S. Read April 18, 1822. [Phil. Trans. 1823, p. 34.]
    The objects of this communication are chiefly two; the first is to
restore a greater degree of confidence in the results of the late ob
servations made with the mural circle at Greenwich, which now ap
pear to have been subjected to a very small error only, arising from
some temporary causes now very effectually removed; and the second
to point out a want of uniformity in the proper motions of almost all
the stars, which is of such a nature as to indicate a slow change of
place towards the south in almost every instance, with the exception
of y Ursae majoris, 6 Ursae minoris, and 6 Cephei only. The greatest
deviation is found in three very bright stars, Capella, Procyon, and
Sirius. The proper motion of each of these is southward; hence
these proper motions are accelerated, while that of Arcturus, on the
contrary, may be considered as uniform.
    The author observes, that though the number of stars which have
proper motions northwards is nearly equal to those of which the pro
per motion is southward, yet the joint magnitude of the motions
southward exceeds that of the motions directed northwards nearly in
the proportion of 4 to 1.
    It was not till after February, 1821, that the mural circle became
completely out of repair; its present perfection has been verified by
means of observations made with an artificial horizon of mercury
protected by wooden boxes, of different sizes and figures according
to the different altitudes of the stars: at the same time, Mr. Pond
 observes, that for very delicate purposes it would be improper to
place implicit confidence in the observations of declination made in
 the course of the year 1820.

Appendie to the preceding Paper on the Changes which appear to have
  taken place in the Declination of some of the fired Stars. By John
  Pond, Esq. Astronomer Royal, F.R.S. Read November 14, 1822.
  [Phil. Trans. 1823, p. 39.]
     The author states that the observations made at Greenwich during
the last summer have confirmed his former results, showing most de
cidedly that the computed places of the principal fixed stars do not
agree with those determined by actual observation.       He finds the
general tendency of the deviation to be southward, but inconsiderable
in about one third part of the heavens as to right ascension, in which
part, from the zenith to the pole, stars appear a very small quantity
to the northward; in the remaining part, as to right ascension, all
the stars deviate to the south, and with a few exceptions the south
ern more so than the northern ones.
   He then inquires, whether these deviations admit of explanation
by supposing them to arise from errors in the instrument, or in the
mode of observing.      If occasioned by the general uncertainty of astro
nomical   observation,  they would be found to follow no law at all; if by
errors in the  instrument,    they would bear some direct proportion to
zenith distance.     But these anomalies are shown to depend rather
on  right ascension than on zenith distance; and as it cannot be con
ceived in what way error of zenith distance can be influenced by
right ascension, the supposition of error in the instrument will not
account for the deviations.        In further proof of this, numerous ex
amples are given of unequal or opposite deviation in stars adjacent
as to polar distance, but of opposite right ascension; in            which              all
cases, owing        to
                   the shortness     the arcof                   be

                                                        it, to
stancy therefore       the error affecting
                         of                    the deviation     the stars,      of
if owing     to

                                           the same both     direction and  in
degree.
   The author next considers the different hypotheses that may                                  be
entertained by those who, not convinced by the preceding arguments,
may yet        be

astronomical researches.      Although the period          observation em               of

pected between the extreme seasons.          Here, again, from the season
chosen, from the pains taken         equalize the temperature, and from
                                                 to
the concordance of the results obtained with two and six micro
scopes, the author believes that no errors           sensible amount have     of
been introduced by change          temperature.

next adverted      to  namely, that founded

the solar nutation after allowing for parallax, from the observations
made with the Dublin instrument.            This reasoning        considered                       is
strictly logical,     proving the disengagement

the larger equation results from parallax; since those stars           which                                 in
the Dublin instrument discovers parallax, are          some distance from          at

        of                            that part        in
                                                    the meridian.   The            of

                                     186
height of this station he determined by levelling to the Grand Junc
tion Canal, from which, and the known difference of levels of the
canals communicating with this, he obtained the relative height of
this station, compared with the most important objects in North
ampton, Buckingham, and Bedford.             Finding the country to the
north of Arbury station suddenly fall about 400 feet, and continue
thus depressed for nine or ten miles, Mr. Bevan observes that such a
defect of matter would probably produce a deflection of the plumb
line to the southward; and accordingly, on calculating the latitude
of Arbury station from that of Blenheim observatory, independent
of any astronomical observations made at Arbury, he found it 5" less
than shown by the zenith sector, giving countenance to the proba
bility of local attraction by the high land to the south of the station.
The author thinks that the observations at Dunnose were affected by
the high land to the north of that station giving a latitude less than
it should be by 7" or 8", and that Greenwich observatory is not
altogether clear of local attraction from the higher land to the south,
and defect upon the northern side.       Clifton station also, he remarks,
may be 2" or 3" in error, from the same cause.
   With such corrections as the face of the country may warrant, not
exceeding in the whole 200 miles above 10", the author thinks it
probable that the section of the meridian measured in Britain may
agree with the different sections measured in other parts of the
world.
   Mr. Bevan lastly adverts to the probable errors in the height of the
stations in the survey; and assuming the highest points of the Grand
Junction Canal to be 408; feet above the level of the sea at low
water spring tides, he considers the heights of Wendover, Kens
worth, Bowbrick Hill, and Arbury Hill stations, to be about 72 feet
in excess, as laid down in the survey.
On some Fossil Bones discovered in Caverns in the Limestone Quarries
   of Oreston. By Joseph Whidbey, Esq. F.R.S. In a Letter ad
   dressed to John Barrow, Esq. F.R.S.          To which is added, a De
   scription of the Bones by Mr. William Clift, Conservator of the
   Museum of the College of Surgeons.            Read February 6, 1823.
    [Phil. Trans.   1823,  p.  78.]
   In one of these caverns there was       a lining of stalactite, and the
bones were    lying  loosely  covered with rubble; in another, the bones
adhered to the walls.
   To this letter is annexed a description of the bones found by Mr.
Whidbey, by Mr. Clift, Conservator of the Museum of the Royal
College of Surgeons.
   They belong to animals of several distinct genera; namely, the
Bos, the Deer, Hyaena, Horse, Wolf, and Fox. Of these bones, a few
are superficially incrusted with stalagmite, but the greater number
were firmly imbedded in stiff clay, and exhibit no appearances of

                                                   187
mutilation, except in one instance, where the radius of a young
wolf is impressed by the incisors and canine teeth of an animal the
size of the weasel.
   Such of the bones as were examined appeared to have lost the
greater part of their animal matter, and had consequently become
brittle; some of them when immersed in water became black, but
recovered their former appearance on drying; this was especially the
case with those of the carnivorous tribes.
   Mr. Clift observes that appearances of disease in fossil bones are
of rare occurrence; among these, however, he found two examples
in the metacarpal and metatarsal bones of the bovine animals, show
ing upon their surface the effect of ossific inflammation; there were
also marks of disease in the lower jaw of a young wolf.
   It appears from Mr. Clift's detailed enumeration of the bones from
these caverns, that they are clearly referable to animals of known
and still existing genera; but he observes that it is a curious cir
cumstance, that with the exception of the very few belonging to the
deer, they        all
                 appertain      animals differing from those formerly
                                         to
found  in the immediate    vicinity   the present caverns.

   Mr. Clift concludes this communication with particular descrip          a
tion and enumeration        the bones, which are further illustrated by
                                of

Experiments    for  ascertaining the Velocity of Sound, at Madras in the
   East Indies. By John Goldingham, Esq. F.R.S. Read February
    20, 1823.    [Phil. Trans. 1823, p. 96.]
   The author commences this paper with an abstract of the opinions,
experiments, and calculations of several eminent philosophers who
have studied the above subject; and after remarking upon their dis
cordant results, observes that his own experiments may perhaps fur
nish a clue for discovering the cause of such differences.   These were
made at Fort St. George, where a morning and evening gun are
fired from the ramparts, the former at daylight, and the latter at 8
o'clock in the evening.      Morning and evening guns are also fired at
St. Thomas's Mount; and between these the Madras Observatory is
situated, in latitude 13° 4'8" N., at which the observations were made
with chronometers of 100 beats in 40 seconds. Each observer began
to count the beats in the interval of the flash and report.       Their
number was registered, as well as the height of the thermometer,
barometer, and hygrometer, and the state of the wind and weather
at the time. The distances of the guns from the observatory were
ascertained with much precision; that of the Mount gun being
29547 feet, and of the Fort gun 139323 feet. The results of these
experiments are given in eleven annexed tables. From Tables 1 and
6, it appears that the velocity of sound is much affected by different
states of the atmosphere and weather; and from Tables 2 and 7, we
find as the thermometer rose, the atmosphere at the same time de
creasing in density, sound moved with increased rapidity. The mean
velocity of sound deduced from these experiments appears to be
1142 feet in a second, which closely corresponds with the estimate
of Newton and Halley. The comparison of the experiments with the
Mount and Fort guns seems to show that sound travels equally in its
progress; and by comparing the observations upon the influence of
wind, a difference is found of 1275 feet in a minute between the
wind being in the direction of the motion of the sound, and opposed
to it.
On the Double Organs       of Generation of the Lamprey, the Conger Eel,
    the common    Eel, the Barnacle,  and Earth Worm, which impregnate
    themselves; though the last from copulating, appear mutually to im
   pregnate one another.       By Sir Everard Home, Bart. V.P.R.S.
    Read February 27, 1823.       [Phil. Trans. 1823, p. 140.]
    Having previously ascertained the teredo and the lamprey to be
hermaphrodites, and that in these tribes the same individual both
forms and impregnates the ova, the author shows upon the present
occasion, that eels and barnacles are similar in their mode of gene
ration. In respect to the former, the author adopts the opinion of
Sir Humphry Davy, that the common and the conger eel belong to
the same species, their difference in size and colour depending upon
the one living in fresh and the other in salt water.     Their organs of

                                   189
generation are precisely similar. Sir Everard points out some errors
into which anatomists had fallen in describing these, more especially
with respect to the eel tribe, in which the kidneys being immediately
behind the peritoneum, and closely connected, the whole mass has
been mistaken for kidney.
   In that species of barnacle called Lepas anatifera, the ovaria are
situated round the oesophagus, and the ova are impregnated before
they leave the ovaria.
   The author concludes this paper with an account of the structure
of the organs of generation in the earth worm, and of their mode of
copulation. These, as well as the other anatomical facts detailed in
this communication, are illustrated by reference to a variety of draw
ings.
 On a New Phenomenon    of Electro-magnetism.   By Sir Humphry Davy,
   Bart. Pres. R.S.      Read March 6, 1823.        [Phil. Trans. 1823,
   p. 153.]
   About fifteen months ago it occurred to Sir Humphry Davy to try
the action of a magnet upon mercury, connected in the electric cir
cuit; and having very lately had occasion to repeat the experiment
in a more perfect manner, by the aid of a battery, consisting of a
single pair of plates of about 100 square feet, constructed for the
London Institution, under the direction of Mr. Pepys, he is induced
to lay the result of the experiment before the Royal Society, as pre
senting a phenomenon which may prove important hereafter in its
relations to the theory of electro-magnetism.
   When two wires were placed in a basin of mercury, perpendieu
lar to the surface, and in the voltaic circuit of the above-mentioned
battery, the mercury revolved according to the common law of elec
tro-magnetic rotation, upon presenting a magnet either above or
below the wires; and the velocity was increased by using the oppo
site poles of two magnets, one above and the other below the mer
cury. When the pole of the magnet was held above the mercury,
and between the two wires, the circular motion ceased, and currents
took place in the mercury in opposite directions.     These and other
circumstances induced Sir Humphry Davy to believe that the pas
sage of the electricity through the mercury, produced motions inde
pendent of the magnet, and that the rotations described were owing
to a composition of forces; and, moreover, that such motions would,
from the position of the wires, occur chiefly at the lower surface of
 the mercury; he therefore inverted the form of the experiment,
bringing the copper wires through two holes in the bottom of a glass
basin, with so much mercury in it as to stand one tenth of an inch
above the polished ends of the wires.      Upon making the communi
cation with the battery, the surface of the mercury was elevated into
a small cone above each of the wires, from which waves flowed off in
all directions, the only apparent point of rest being central, between
the wires. These cones were diminished by the approximation of

                                                     190
the pole of a magnet, which produced rotation, and on bringing it
near enough, a depression of the mercury above the pole. The above
phenomenon appeared, independent of any elevation in the tempera
ture of the mercury, nor can it be attributed to electric repulsion.
It must be referred to forces producing motions in right lines, or un
dulations from the surfaces of the wires as a centre; and it seems,
says the author, strongly opposed to the idea of the electro-magnetic
results, being produced by the motion of a single imponderable fluid.

     In the course of this examination he shows that the six muscles,
which are attached to the eye-ball, do not, as has been supposed,
form one class of voluntary muscles; but that while the four straight
muscles, or recti, are provided for the voluntary motions of the eye
when directed to objects, the other two, called oblique, perform
certain involuntary motions.    These involuntary actions are shown
to be a provision for the better protection of the eye; for when the
eye-lids wink and close to wash the cornea, the effect would be                                          in
complete, and the object but imperfectly attained, unless the cornea
were at the same time raised by the revolving of the eye-ball.
   After having proved that the eye-ball revolves so as to carry the
cornea upwards during the motion of the eye-lids; and having
shown also that the oblique muscles are the agents in this involun
tary and instinctive motion,--he proceeds to demonstrate that the
same muscles elevate the cornea during sleep.
   The author says, that while we are awake, the eye is under the
active influence of the four straight muscles; but when the eye-lids
are closed in sleep these muscles resign their office, and the involun
tary oblique muscles prevail, so as to draw the cornea under the
upper eye-lid. This is also shown to be the condition of the eye in
faintness and on the approach of death, and on          other occasions     all
when languor       debility prevail over the voluntary muscles
                          or                                        the                          of

  The author notices, incidentally, that the enjoyment the sense                       of
of vision attended with the excited condition of the recti or vo
                is

  An Account of an Apparatus   on a peculiar Construction  for performing

    This instrument consists of two plates, each fifty feet long and
 two wide, one of copper and the other of zinc. They are rolled round
 a cylinder of wood, and their contact is prevented by the interposi
 tion of hair rope and notched sticks.     This coil is counterpoised and
 suspended by a rope and pulleys over a tub of acid, into which it is
 immersed when required for use. When thus immersed, with its
poles connected by a sufficient conductor, it affected magnetic needles
 at a distance of five feet, and was extremely powerful in conferring
magnetism upon steel bars, which acquire a north polarity at the
copper, and a south at the zinc plate.      The electric intensity of the
 apparatus is exceedingly feeble.
 On the Condensation of several Gases into Liquids.       By Mr. Faraday,

    The gases which the author has succeeded in condensing into the
liquid form, are, the sulphurous acid, sulphuretted hydrogen, carbo
nic acid, euchlorine, nitrous oxide, cyanogen, ammonia, muriatic acid,
and chlorine. The process by which they were condensed, consisted
in liberating them from certain of their compounds in small glass
tubes, hermetically sealed and bent, so that when required, the end
might answer the purpose of a receiver, and be occasionally immersed
in ice or freezing mixtures.    They generally appear as exceedingly
limpid, colourless, and mobile fluids, and assume the gaseous form
with various degrees of rapidity and violence upon the removal of
that pressure by which they had been previously restrained.
    In this paper Mr. Faraday details the particular method to which
he resorted for obtaining each of these liquid bodies, and describes
such of their characters as his experiments have hitherto enabled him
to determine.                                                      t
    Liquid sulphurous acid appears to exert a pressure of about 2
atmospheres, at 45°.      The pressure of the vapour of sulphuretted
hydrogen was equal to about 13 atmospheres, at 32°; that of car
bonic acid to 40 atmospheres, at 45°; of nitrous oxide 48 atmo
spheres, at 50°; of cyanogen between 3 and 4 atmospheres, at 45°;
of muriatic acid 28 atmospheres, at 32°.
    The author's attempts to obtain hydrogen, oxygen, fluoric, fluo
silicic, and phosphuretted hydrogen gases in the form of liquids, have
hitherto been without success.

On the Application of Liquids formed by the Condensation of Gases as
  Mechanical Agents.     By Sir Humphry Davy, Bart. P.R.S. Read
  April 17, 1823. [Phil. Trans. 1823, p. 199.]
   The elasticity of vapours, in contact with the liquids from which
they are produced under high pressures in high temperatures, is
known to increase in a higher ratio than the arithmetical one of the
temperature; but the exact law is not determined, and the loss of
latent heat in compression, and the re-absorption in expansion,
renders the advantage of steam under great pressure and at very
high temperatures doubtful in an economical view. No such doubt,
however, exists in regard to those fluids which require very great
compression for their existence, and where common temperatures are
sufficient to produce an immense elastic force.   Thus sulphuretted
hydrogen, which condenses into a liquid under a pressure of 14 at
mospheres at 3°, had its elastic force increased so as to equal a
pressure of 17 atmospheres by raising    temperature            its

It was only, therefore, at casual intervals that he could make use of
the means placed in his hands, and many interesting opportunities
were thus lost merely for want of adequate leisure to profit by
them.
   The only stations, accordingly, at which the pendulum was swung
in a satisfactory manner, were, 1st, the Galapagos Islands in the
Pacific, lying  32% miles N. of the Equator; 2ndly, St. Blas, on the
N.W.    shore of Mexico, in lat. 21% N., and not far from California;
and, lastly, Rio de Janeiro, the capital of Brazil, in lat. 22°55' S.
   The ellipticity of the earth, resulting from the experiments made at
the Gallipagos, is reºrg; but it must be observed that, as the nature
of the ground on which the pendulum was here swung, was totally
different from that of the stations at which it was swung in England,
this result is not to be depended upon as giving a true expression
for the ellipticity; since whenever a comparison is to be made be
tween different stations on which the same pendulum has been
swung, the circumstances ought always to be as nearly alike as pos
sible in all that relates to the density of the ground. At the Gala
pagos, however, every thing was volcanic, and the islands were sur
rounded by a deep sea, whereas at the English stations the rocks
were mostly primitive, and were surrounded by land. At the second
station, San Blas, there were two series of experiments made, the first
by Capt. Hall, which gave an ellipticity of strº-r, and the second by
Mr. Henry Foster, one of his officers, re-ºrr. These two series, how
ever, were performed under circumstances so different, as to account
sufficiently for the want of exact agreement in the results.      During
the first the  temperature  was  steady,  the  sky  always clear, and the
rate of the clock uniform; but before the second series was well
commenced the rainy season set in with great violence, the sky be
came overcast, few stars could be seen, the temperature fluctuated,
and the rate of the clock became unsteady.         The relative degree of
credit, therefore, which attaches to the two series, is as 397 at 47,
the amount of the respective factors, or nearly as 8 to 1, and we
may assume the correct ellipticity at rºgr. At Rio de Janeiro, by
Captain Hall's series, the ellipticity comes out r}-ºry, and by Mr.
Foster's grºs r. The sum of the factors in this case being 148 and
304, or nearly as 261 in favour of Mr. Foster's experiments, the
correct ellipticity may be taken at rººrs.
   Captain Hall is of opinion that it would contribute materially to
the determination of this question if the same pendulum were to be
swung at places resembling the Galapagos, in geological character,
such as the Canaries and Azores, Madeira, St. Helena, the Isle of
France, and various islands in the Eastern Ocean; besides swinging
it at stations resembling those of Captain Kater in this country,
especially at the Cape of Good Hope, and at a port in the Falkland
                           as lie

    This is a paper in continuation.—In this part the author states
 that there are six nerves of the brain which go to the eye, while
 there are in             all
                      only nine nerves coming from the brain.              He pro
 ceeds     to
            show that each nerve has           distinct     appropriate

    The branch        the fifth nerve, called Ophthalmicus, bestows upon
                           of
 the parts within the orbit and the coats and surfaces               the eye, sen              of
 sibility   topain, and that modification           sensibility which causes the

double root, and is a nerve both of sensation and of motion.
   In the end of the paper certain conclusions are drawn, which have
reference to the subjects of the preceding papers of the same author.
And here the author advocates the importance of anatomical inves
tigation as superior to experiments on living animals, affirming that
erroneous opinions in physiology have been sometimes strengthened
instead of corrected by such experiments.
An Account of Experiments made with an Invariable Pendulum at New
  South Wales, by Major-General Sir Thomas Brisbane, K.C.B.

    [Phil. Trans. 1823, p. 308.]
   In this communication, laid before the Royal Society at the re
quest of Sir Thomas Brisbane, Captain Kater gives the results of
experiments made by Sir Thomas Brisbane and Mr. Dunlop, at Pa
ramatta, in New South Wales; and by Sir Thomas Brisbane, Cap
tain Kater, and Mr. Rumker, in Portland Place, London, with an
invariable pendulum belonging to the Board of Longitude.
 . The number of vibrations made by this pendulum in a mean solar
day at London, in latitude 51° 31' 8" 4, at the temperature of 60°,
and reduced to a vacuum, was found to be 86090-17: at Paramatta,
in latitude 33°48'43" S., by Sir Thomas Brisbane's experiments
86021-59; and by those of Mr. Dunlop 86022:21.
*  Captain Kater, after detailing these observations, proceeds to de
 duce the compression, and finds       it,   by
                                           comparing the vibrations           at
 London with those resulting from Sir Thomas Brisbane's experi
 ments  at Paramatta,  to   beru-k+r; by Mr. Dunlop's        rr.

.  By the comparison    of  the vibrations        at
                                             Unst with those     Para at
 matta, Sir Thomas Brisbane's experiments give rºw-r, and those               of
 Mr. Dunlop   sºur    for the compression.
   But the author remarks that these numbers are not to be deemed
 eonclusive,                        in              vibrations made by
                                                       of

       By disposing magnets
                          so as partly to counteract the influence of
the earth's polarity on a magnetic needle, the author suspected that
  its
   daily variation might possibly exhibit itself       very increased                         in   a
degree;                          experimentally prosecuting the idea,                                    he                   to

 differed from that of Mr. Barlow, for instead of applying a magnet
in the horizontal plane of the needle he placed two in the line of the
dip, having their poles in the reverse position to those of the needle.
In describing the results of his experiment, Mr. Christie calls the
south pole of a magnet that which points to the north pole of the
earth, so that the north end is the south pole, and the south end the
north pole of his magnetic needles. In stating the deviations from
any point considered as zero, those which he places in the direction
of the sun's apparent daily motion are considered minus, and those
in a contrary direction plus, whatever may be the position of the
needle. The results of Mr. Christie's observations are given in the
form of tables, the first of which extend from March 26 to March 31,
and exhibit manifest deviation towards the east before eight in the
morning, and the greatest westerly deviation about one P.M. In a
second series of observations, with another needle, the directive
force of which was to the power as 1-63 to 1, the times of the
greatest easterly and westerly deviation agreed with the former, but
the easterly was greater compared with the westerly.             In a third
series the suspension of the needle was improved, and the magnets
were so adjusted as to render        directive force   its
                                                         0-68          With           as          to   1.

An Account of     the Effect of Mercurial Vapours on the Crew of His

    municated by Matthew Baillie, M.D. F.R.S. Read June 19, 1823.
    [Phil. Trans. 1823, p. 402.]
   The Triumph arrived at Cadiz in 1810, and in the following March
a  Spanish  vessel, laden with quicksilver, was wrecked under the bat
teries, then in possession of the French. The Triumph's boats were
sent to her assistance, and about 130 tons of the quicksilver carried
on board. The metal was secured in bladders packed in barrels, but
the bladders having been wetted grew rotten, and the metal escaped
in large quantities, got mixed with the provisions, and very soon af
fected the crew with ptyalism, ulcerated throats, &c. The different
animals on board were also affected.       From the extent of the mis
chief it was evident that the air of the confined part of the vessel
contained mercurial vapour, and accordingly those who slept and
messed in the orlop and lower decks were more severely affected
than those chiefly confined to the upper deck; while the men who
lived and slept chiefly under the forecastle, escaped with a slight af
fection of the gums.                                          -

                of                       temperature; his methods have

Laplace consider       it   as
                         infinite.  The former limits would make the
horizontal refraction less than the truth; the latter supposition much
greater.   Mr. Ivory       inclined
                            is          suppose some considerably ex

tended, though finite height, which shall give the true refraction                                  at
the horizon, and which will probably                     be
                                             also correct for all other
cases; and       he
                thinks     not superfluous
                            it                inquire, whether such an
                                                          to

atmosphere would afford results sensibly different from those                               of
atmosphere      infinite extent. The phenomena
                 of                                      twilight and       of

                                     201
meteors indicate, he observes, a height of forty or fifty miles, at
which the atmosphere is dense enough to reflect a sensible quantity
of light. At the height of about 25,000 miles the centrifugal force
would become equal to the gravitation of the air, and the equilibrium
would be no longer possible.
   . But the great reason that prevents our supposing an atmosphere
infinitely extended, is the coldness of the upper regions.     Mr. Ivory
considers the elastic force as disappearing from the effect of cold
upon the temperature, is 266 centigrade degrees below the freezing
point; and he observes, that if the decrease uniformly amounted to
a degree in 95 (English) fathoms, as it appeared to do in Gay Lus
sac's aerostatic observation, the whole height ought not to exceed
 29 miles; consequently he thinks that the thermometer must fall at
 a slower rate in the higher than in the lower parts of the atmosphere.
     Mr. Ivory proceeds to investigate the motion of light according to
 the laws of central forces, and to the experiments of Hauksbee and
 others on the refractive density of the air. He first shows that the
 formula employed by the French astronomers, as far as 74° from the
 zenith, is deducible from any imaginable law respecting the consti
 tution of the atmosphere; and he gives, for example, the mode of
 obtaining it from that of Cassini.
     He next considers the case of an equable variation of temperature
 in ascending, which he thinks is rendered probable, as the law of
  nature, by observations of Gay Lussac and others; and he inquires
  into the general methods of integrating the expressions of the re
  fraction  in such  cases,  according to the methods already employed
  by Kramp and Laplace.         He examines, on various suppositions re
  specting the height of the atmosphere as connected with various
  laws expressing the progressive temperatures, beginning always from
 that which is observable at the earth's surface the amount of the
  horizontal refraction, which he finds not so materially affected by
  these suppositions as to enable us to decide with certainty, from ob
   servation, which of them ought to be preferred.
      Upon these foundations the author investigates the actual mag
   nitude of the refraction under different circumstances, by means of
   several infinite series, of which he computes the values; and he com
   pares his results with those which have been observed by astrono
   mers. The ingenious hypothesis of Laplace, he remarks, gives us a
   height of                        depression of a centigrade degree, or
               5% fathoms for a
   197 feet for 1° of Fahrenheit, which, he says, is little more than two
   thirds of the height actually corresponding to this depression; and
   the French table, he says, was computed for the foregoing point, and
   then altered proportionally throughout its extent for a difference of
    10 centigrade degrees.      As far as 86° from the zenith, Mr. Ivory's
   computations agree very accurately with those of Bessel; and further,
   this celebrated astronomer does not recommend the adoption of his
   table. The comparison of the new table with the observations of the
   French Astronomers, and of Dr. Brinkley, appears to be highly fa
   vourable to the accuracy of Mr. Ivory's results.

 Observations on Air found in the Pleura, in a Case of Pneumato
   thorar; with Eaperiments on the Absorption of different kinds of
   Air introduced into the Pleura. By John Davy, M.D. F.R.S. Read
   June 6, 1823. [Phil. Trans. 1823, p. 496.]
    In this paper Dr. Davy gives a detailed account of the symptoms
produced by the above disease, and of the appearance after death, in
a man of thirty years of age. He also adverts to the composition of
the air found in the lungs, which was collected by immersing the body
in water, and puncturing the pleura, when it issued in the enormous
quantity of 225 cubic inches. It was without smell, and extinguished
flame, and was not inflammable.             It consisted of 8 carbonic acid,                                  .
and 92 azotic gas per cent.; and the author considers it as derived
from the atmosphere by a morbid communication, which was dis
covered on dissection, between the pleura and atmosphere through
the medium of the lung. To determine the mode in which                    change              its
    composition had been effected, Dr. Davy inflated the right pleura
 of of
     a dog with atmospheric air, and killed the animal after 48 hours.
On examining the air, the oxygen was found absorbed                  larger pro         in
portion than the azote, which accounts for the accumulation                   the                   of
latter gas       the preceding instance.

                 of                                                     Twenty
four hours after, the dog was killed, and the result was, that during
   sojourn      three days
                      of         the pleura the oxygen had been absorbed
                                       in
in a greater proportion than the carbonic acid, and the latter                                          in
                                                                                                        a

pleura      absorbing one kind          gas more than another, without re

   The object              of
                    this communication         prove that the free acid
                                                                   is   to

                                                            of               is
 that the salts present are alkaline muriates.

                                    205
     The contents of a rabbit's stomach were digested in distilled water,
and the clear portion of liquid thus obtained divided into four parts.
The first was evaporated to dryness, and the quantity of muriatic
acid present in the residuary fixed salts determined by nitrate of sil
ver; the second was supersaturated with potash, evaporated and de
composed by nitrate of silver as before, by which the total quantity
of muriatic acid in the fluid was ascertained; the third was neutral
ized by a solution of potash of known strength, and the required
quantity accurately noticed.       This gave the proportion of free acid
present; and by adding this to that in union with a fixed alkali, as
above determined, and subtracting the sum from the total quantity
of muriatic acid present, the proportion of acid in union with ammo
 nia was estimated. But as a check to this result, the third neutral
 ized portion was evaporated to dryness, and the muriate of ammonia
 expelled by heat; the quantity of muriatic acid left in union with the
 fixed alkali was then determined as before; and by subtracting this
 from the total quantity, the quantity in union with ammonia was
  determined.
      From such experiments the author concludes, that no inconsider
  able quantity of unsaturated muriatic acid exists in the stomachs of
  animals during digestion; and from the examination of the fluid
  ejected from the human stomach in a case of dyspepsia, he infers
  that there also the muriatic acid performs the same office.
  On the North Polar Distances of the principal fired Stars. By John
      Brinkley, D.D. F.R.S. &c. Andrews Professor of Astronomy in the
      University of Dublin.     Read December 18, 1823.     [Phil. Trans.
      1824, p. 50.]
      The author observes, that of the recent catalogues that have
   been formed of the principal fixed stars, two, those of Dublin and
   Greenwich, agree very exactly.        That of M. Bessel differs con
   siderably; but the differences are such that they would agree by a
   modification of the co-efficients of refraction employed for correcting
   the observations.    Mr. Pond, he says, has applied the refractions of
   Bradley to the instrument of Dublin; he himself thinks it more safe
   to determine the refraction for each place from its own instruments;
   and he objects to the reasoning by which Mr. Pond has endeavoured
   to prove the existence of a flexure in the tube of the instrument of
   Dublin.
       Dr. Brinkley makes the mean difference of the stars of Greenwich
   and Dublin for 1813 only a few tenths of a second; for 1823, still
   less. Neither the Dublin Catalogue, nor any other more extensive
    comparison, affords, in his opinion, a confirmation of the hypothesis
    of a general southern motion, which he is therefore inclined to attri
    bute principally to a slight inaccuracy of the Greenwich Catalogue
    for 1813.                                                      -
       The comparisons unfavourable to the southern motion are those
    of Bradley's observations at Wanstead, in 1728; and some French ob

                                      206
 servations, in 1740; of Maskelyne's at Schehalien, in 1774; General
 Mudge's, in 1802; and General Lambton’s, in 1805; as well as of
 Piazzi's Catalogue.    Mr. Pond's observations at Westbury agree too
 little with the Catalogue  of Greenwich, he thinks, to be of any use
 in the inquiry; and Mechain's are opposed to others made by better
 instruments.
    Dr. Brinkley does not think it an argument in favour of Bessel's
 refractions, that they give the obliquity of the ecliptic the same for
 both solstices; he rather supposes some particular equation is re
 quired for the solar refraction, Bessel's refraction at low altitudes
 being manifestly too large for the stars.
    The question of parallax Dr. Brinkley still reserves for future dis-"
 cussion.
 On the Figure requisite to maintain the Equilibrium of a Homogeneous
   Fluid Mass that revolves upon an Aris. By James Ivory, A.M.
   F.R.S. Read December 18, 1823. [Phil. Trans. 1824, p. 85.]
   The author enumerates the various steps by which Sir Isaac New
ton, M*Laurin, and Laplace have carried the theory of the equili
brium of a revolving fluid very near to perfection, but he observes
that they have generally supposed the spheroid to differ but little
from a sphere; and he proceeds in the present paper to investigate
the figure “by a direct analysis, in which no arbitrary supposition is
admitted.”
    Mr. Ivory thinks it necessary to distinguish carefully two separate
cases; the first is when the particles of the fluid do not attract one
another, and the second when the particles are endued with attrac
tive powers. These, he says, are plainly two cases that are essentially
different from one another; for in the first, a stratum added induces
no other change than an increase of pressure caused by the action
of the accelerating forces at the surface; but in the second, besides
the pressure, a new force is introduced, arising from the mutual at
traction between the matter of the stratum and the fluid mass to
which it is added.                                             -
   Mr. Ivory gives two different methods of investigating the funda
 mental laws of this equilibrium, the one which is the newest and
most simple being contained in two propositions.
   First, If a homogeneous fluid body revolving about an axis be in
equilibrio by the attraction of     its particles, any other mass          of
                                                                           the
same fluid   having     similar
                        a       figure, and revolving      in the same time
about      axis similarly placed, will likewise
          an                                         be   inequilibrio     by
                                                                           the
attraction        of
                  particles.
   The proof   is its
                  easily deduced from the well known properties             of   an
attraction inversely proportioned     to the square   of  the distance.

On the Corrosion of Copper-sheeting by Sea-water, and on Methods of
 preventing this Effect; and on their Application to Ships of War

  January 22, 1824. [Phil. Trans. 1824, p. 151.]
   When copper sheeting, however pure the metal may be, is exposed
to sea-water, a green rust is formed upon it; which, when washed
off, is replaced by a similar substance, till the whole of the metal is
thus destroyed by corrosion.         To prevent this effect, the President
avails himself of the modification of chemical affinities, derived from
electrical power; and in pursuing his researches in relation to this
subject, he found the above-mentioned action upon copper counter
acted by any weak negative electricity easily excited in it by the
contact of a surface of tin not exceeding + with that of the copper,
and made part of an electric circuit in sea-water.        Other metals may
be substituted, but the     facility with which a perfect contact is made
by solder with tin, and the facility with which             submuriate de      its
taches from the metal, induce Sir Humphry Davy                  regard               to            it    as
best adapted        the purpose.

to compute a new table by this formula, since the method employed

The Bakerian Lecture.    On certain Motions produced in Fluid Con
  ductors when transmitting the Electric Current. By          J.
                                                       F. W. Her
  schel, Esq. F.R.S.      Read February 12, 1824.    [Phil. Trans.
  1824, p. 162.]
    In the first paragraphs of this lecture, Mr. Herschel describes the
 phenomena that result on placing a portion of mercury covered with
 sulphuric acid between the voltaic poles immersed on opposite sides
 of the globule of metal, but in contact with the acid only. They
 consist in active motion of those particles of the acid in contact with
 the mercury, while the superficial molecules of the metal continually
 radiate from the point nearest the negative pole, and darting to the
 positive pole return along the axis.      The author particularly notices
 several  singular  appearances   resulting  from this current, and shows
 them to be     independent   of any  electro-magnetic   vortices, to which,
 at first sight, they present considerable analogy.       They are incom
 parably more forcible, in proportion to the electric powers used, than
 the motions produced by the action of magnets; hence, they furnish
 an extremely sensible test of the development of feeble Voltaic pow
 ers not easily rendered sensible by other means.
    The author next describes the appearances observed in cases where
 other liquids and metals are used, and adverts to the influence of
 several causes upon the uniformity of the results. Among these, im
purity in the mercury is especially noticed, which should not only be
carefully distilled, but also well washed with dilute nitric acid. Mer
cury thus prepared, and placed in the current as before, exhibits phe
nomena varying with the nature of the liquid;—generally speaking,
currents are produced radiating from the point nearest the negative
pole, which are most violent in acids, and less in saline solutions, in
proportion as the electro-positive energy of the base is greater.           In
many liquids a counter-current from the positive pole is observed;
but if either pole be brought in contact with the mercury, no cur
rents are observed from the point of contact, but strong ones are
perceived to radiate from the other.       If the negative pole touch    it,
                                                                           it
amalgamates with the mercury, which remains bright;         if  the positive,
the  mercury     rapidly oxidizes;   and   inboth cases currents are pro
duced.
   Mr. Herschel proceeds     to  observe, that when mercury    is  electrized

passage of electricity through conductors, and the high attractive and
repulsive powers of the two electricities inter se.          A body so highly

lower rod, receiving some influence from the percussion, performed
a similar office. The author calls this mode         proceeding, the com                 of

                                   2H 1
pound process, to distinguish it from the mere hammering of the wire
upon the rod, as practised by him formerly, and which he terms the
simple process.     He then enters into extended details of his several
 experiments, of which the following are the principal results: first,
that the compound process is more effectual in the production of mag
netism than the simple one, though the ratio of augmentation does
not appear determinate.      In one experiment, the maximum effect of
the simple process was an attractive force capable of lifting between
 186 and 246 grains, while the compound process augmented the lift
ing power to 326 grains.      In another, the simple process gave a lift
ing power of 246 grains, the compound of 345 grains. Moreover,
the efficacy of the compound process is much less manifest upon long
than short wires, and is greatly impaired by diminishing the size of
the rods.
   In respect to the influence of the temper of the wire upon the de
gree of magnetism developed, Mr. Scoresby found that the softer the
wire the more susceptible it became of this magnetic condition.
   The author concludes this paper with some theoretical remarks re
specting the influence of percussion in disposing the particles of iron
to acquire and retain magnetism, which he thinks may tend to ex
plain some otherwise obscure phenomena; and which seem to render
it probable that the process of percussion may be applied, in con
nexion with other modes of magnetizing, for giving increased power
to magnets.
 On Semi-decussation of the Optic Nerves.      By William Hyde Wol
   laston, M.D. V.P.R.S.       Read February  19, 1824.    [Phil. Trans.
   1824, p. 222.]
   In the human brain, the optic nerves, after passing forward to a
short distance from their origin in the thalami, become incorporated;
and from the point of union two nerves are sent off, one to each eye.
To this united portion the term Decussation has been applied, under
the supposition that though the fibres do intermix, they still continue
onward in their original direction; and that those from the right side
cross over wholly to supply the left eye, while the right eye is simi
larly supplied by fibres from the left thalamus.       Anatomists have
considered this opinion as confirmed, by the circumstance of the
nerves actually crossing each other as two perfectly distinct cords in
some fish; the author, however, from a species of blindness under
which he has more than once suffered, concludes that a different dis
tribution of the nerves takes place in the human subject.       This pe
culiar state of vision consisted in seeing only half of every object,
the loss of sight being in both eyes towards the left, and of short
duration only. In reflecting upon this subject, a certain arrange
ment of the optic nerves, not consistent with the generally received
hypothesis of their decussation, occurred to him.       Since the corre
sponding points of the two eyes, he observes, sympathize in disease,
                                   p 2

                                                      212
their sympathy is evidently from structure, and not from mere habit
of feeling together.       Any two corresponding points must be supplied
with a pair of filaments from the same nerve; and the seat of a dis
ease in which similar parts of both eyes are affected, must be con
sidered as situated at a distance from the eyes, at some place in the
course of the nerves where these filaments are still united, and pro
bably in one or other thalamus.           It is plain, he continues, that the
cord which comes         finally  to either eye, under the name of optic
nerve, must be regarded as consisting of two portions, one half from
the right thalamus, and the other from the left.              Upon this suppo
sition, decussation will take place only between the adjacent halves
of the two nerves. That portion of nerve which proceeds from the
thalamus to the right side of the right eye, passes to               destination            its
without interference; and              similar manner the left thalamus will
                                            in   a
supply the left side        the left eye with one part
                                 of                                fibres, while     of   its
the remaining halves             both nerves,
                                      of           passing over  in  the eyes               to                   of
the opposite sides, must intersect each other with               without inter        or
mixture         their fibres. The crossing
                of                                                    of

Some curious Facts respecting the Walrus and Seal, discovered by the
    Eramination of Specimens brought to England by the different Ships
   lately returned from the Polar Circle.      By Sir Everard Home,
   Bart. V.P.R.S.       In a Letter addressed to Sir Humphry Davy,
   Bart. P.R.S.     Read March 4, 1824.     [Phil. Trans. 1824, p. 233.]
   The first fact stated by Sir Everard Home in this paper is the
analogy   in structure between the hind foot of the Walrus and the
foot of the Fly. In both these is a very similar apparatus for produ
cing a vacuum, so as to enable the animal to proceed upon smooth
surfaces against gravity, by the adhesion of the feet thus effected;
there being two cups in the foot of the fly and one in that of the
walrus for this purpose.    Secondly, he notices the peculiar mode in
which the bile in the walrus is collected in a reservoir, and thence
forcibly impelled into the duodenum.
   The third new fact which the author adduces, is the peculiar struc
ture of the funis and placenta of the Seal. In this animal the vessels
forming the funis are not twisted; their whole length is nine inches;
after passing three inches from the navel of the foetus they give off
anastomosing branches, connected with it by three membranous folds,
between which the blood-vessels are conveyed to the placenta. This
structure gives uncommon facility to the placental circulation, and
makes it worth inquiry whether the same peculiarities exist in other
marine animals.
   Several illustrative drawings accompany this paper.
Additional Experiments and Observations on the Application of Elec
   trical Combinations to the Preservation of the Copper Sheathing of
   Ships, and to other purposes. By Sir Humphry Davy, Bart. P.R.S.
   Read June 17, 1824.      [Phil. Trans. 1824, p. 242.]
   Since his former communication the President has had an opportu
nity of prosecuting his researches upon the above subjects, upon an
extended scale, and with results perfectly conclusive and satisfactory.
He found that sheets of copper defended by from one 100th to one
150th part of zinc or iron, exposed for many weeks to the full flow
of the tide in Portsmouth harbour, suffered no corrosion, and that
even one 1000th part of cast iron exerted great protecting influence.
Boats and the sides of ships protected in this way were also similarly
preserved. Of the different protecting metals cast iron is most conve
nient, and the plumbaginous substance formed upon it does not impede
the electrical action. The President formerly anticipated the deposition
of earthy substances upon the negative copper, and this he now found
to take place upon sheets of copper exposed about four months to sea
water, and defended by from one 50th to one 80th their surface of
zinc and iron. They became coated with carbonate of lime and mag
nesia; but this effect is easily prevented by duly diminishing the pro
portion of the protecting metal, so as to prevent the excess of negative
power in the copper, which then remains bright and clean.

                                                 214
   The author observes, that many singular facts have occurred in the
course of his researches, some of which bear upon general science.
Weak solutions of salt act strongly upon copper, but strong ones do
not affect       it,
             apparently because they contain little air, the oxygen                                                   of
which seems necessary       give the electro-positive power
                                  to                              these                                     to
menstrua; upon the same principle, alkaline solutions and lime
water prevent the action               of
                               sea-water      copper, having on  them                                    in
selves the positive electrical  energy   which renders the  copper  ne
gative.

annexed. From these and other details given in the paper, the author
concludes that the apparent direction of the eyes to or from the
spectator, depends upon the balance of two circumstances combined
in the same representation; namely, 1st, the general position of the
face presented to the spectator; 2nd, the turn of the eyes from that
position; and thence proceeds to examine why, if the eyes of a por
trait look at the spectator placed in front of the picture, they appear
to follow him in every other direction.    When two objects are seen
on the ground at different distances from us in the same direction,
one appears and must be represented exactly above the other, so that
a vertical plane from the eye would pass through them; and since
such a line will be seen upright, however far we remove to one side,
it follows that the same objects still seem to be in a line with us ex
actly as in the front view, seeming as we move to turn from their
first direction.

  This paper contains the details of experiments made on board se
veral vessels, with a view of determining the influence of the iron in
the ships upon the compass under different circumstances and situ
ations.   The instrument used for determining the intensity con
sisted of a magnetized cylindrical bar, 2.5 inches long and three
eightieths of an inch diameter, delicately suspended by a single fibre
of the silkworm, to the extremity of an adjusting screw, which
worked in the cap of the glass vessel inclosing the bar. A brass wire
also passed through the cap for the purpose of placing the bar at
right angles to the magnetic meridian previous to      being put into                      its

These experiments were repeated with bars of other dimensions,
which were loaded till they broke; and from them the author also
infers that the elastic force of steel is not altered by temper, and
that the force which produces permanent alteration is to that which
causes fracture in hard steel, as 1 : l'66; and in the same steel of a
straw yellow temper, as 1 : 2°56. From comparisons of the strain
required to cause permanent alteration in different kinds of steel, the
author concludes, that in the process of hardening, the particles are
put into a state of tension among themselves, which lessens their
power to resist extraneous force; and the phenomena of hardening
may be referred to the more rapid abstraction of heat from the sur
face of the metal than can be supplied from the internal parts,
whence a contraction of the superficial parts round the expanded
central ones, and a subsequent shrinking of the latter, by which the
state of tension is produced.
A   short Account of some Observations made with Chronometers, in two
    Eapeditions sent out by the Admiralty, at the recommendation of the
   Board of Longitude, for ascertaining the Longitude of Madeira and
    of Falmouth.   In a Letter to Thomas Young, M.D. For. Sec. R.S.
    and Secretary to the Board of Longitude.        By Dr. John Lewis
   Tiarks.    Read April 29, 1824.     [Phil. Trans. 1824, p. 360.]
    Dr. Tiarks was sent to Madeira in the year 1822 with 15 chro
nometers, of which the rates had principally been ascertained in the
Royal Observatory of Greenwich; he touched at Falmouth both in
going out and returning; and having again ascertained the rates of
his time-keepers, he was thus enabled to obtain two distinct deter
minations of the longitude of Falmouth, which differed about four
seconds of time from that which had been inferred from the Trigono
metrical Survey of Great Britain. It became therefore desirable that
some further operations should be undertaken for the removal or
elucidation of this discordance; and the following year a similar
method was adopted with 25 chronometers, for determining the dif
ference of longitude between Falmouth and Dover; this latter station
having been chosen as easy of access, and as being perfectly deter
mined; and the computations were made by interpolation, without
employing any other rates for the chronometers than those which
were observed in the different trips while they were actually on
board the ship; and latterly, when Dover Roads became unsafe, the
operations were limited to the distance from Portsmouth to Fal
mouth : thus, between the months of July and September, the ob
servations were made three times at Dover, four times at Falmouth,
and three times at Portsmouth; and the comparison of their results
affords a correction of five seconds of time for the difference of lon
gitude of Dover and Falmouth, and of three for the difference of
Falmouth and Portsmouth, agreeing completely with the error of four
seconds, attributed from the observations of the preceding year to the
difference of longitude of Falmouth and Greenwich.

                                   220
  Hence Dr. Tiarks thinks       it fair   to conclude that the diameter   of
the parallel circle, in which the longitude is measured, has in the
survey been taken somewhat too great, and consequently the earth's
ellipticity greater than the truth. He remarks that the measurement
of the spheroidal triangle concerned, determines only the actual flat
ness of the part of the earth's surface on which it is situated, and
not the actual magnitude of the whole parallel, unless its curvature
be supposed perfectly uniform, which we cannot assume with confi
dence; while on the other hand, if we compute the ellipticity from
the result of the chronometrical determination, it becomes one 314th
instead of one 150th, and agrees with the most accurate measure
ments obtained from different principles.  The longitude of Falmouth
is finally determined to be 20" 11*1 of time, and that of the British
Consul's garden at Funchal, 1" 7" 39° W. of Greenwich.
Of  the Effects of the Density of Air on the Rates of Chronometers.
  By George Harvey, F.R.S.E. &c. Communicated by Davies Gil
  bert, Esq. V.P.R.S.    Read May 13, 1824.     [Phil. Trans. 1824,
  p. 372.]
   Among the sources of error to which chronometers are liable, the
effect of the variable density of the medium in which the balance         vi
brates has been overlooked; the author therefore proposes to inves
tigate the effects of diminished and increased pressure of transference
from one to the other, and of the ordinary variations of atmospheric
density upon the rates of chronometers.        In respect to diminished
pressure, he found that chronometers gained by being placed in air
of less density than that of the ordinary state of the atmosphere,
and that, on the other hand, they lost when subjected to air of greater
than ordinary density. These experiments were made with a variety
of chronometers, placed in the receiver of an air-pump, or in that of
a condensing apparatus.
   In respect to the influence of ordinary changes in the density of
the air, the author remarks that pocket chronometers are more
readily affected than box chronometers, but that they          all
                                                               exhibit    an
increased rate under diminished density, and vice versd. The author
shows that these changes   in   the rates,     as
                                              observed     the air-pump

  Davy, Bart. P.R.S.                         Read March 25, 1824.                [Phil. Trans. 1824,

   This letter is supplementary to the former one, and contains
further observations on the relative periods at which the different fa
milies of testaceous animals appear to have been created, and on
the gradual approximation, which may be observed in British strata,
from the fossil remains of the oldest formations to the living inhabi
tants of our present land and waters.
   The author observes, that the dimyairia of the strata between the
transition lime and lias have the ligament external, and that internal
ligaments were therefore confined to the monomyairia till after the
deposition of the lias.    In the beds above the lias all the shells are
referrible to existing orders of animals, and it is only in the tertiary
beds that  any  of the cirrhipeda or families of naked mollusca have
been found.
   What is generally considered as the beak of a sepia, Mr. Dillwyn
refers to the cephalopode animal of an ammonite.     Every shell of the
tertiary strata, the author observes, may be referred to some existing
genus; but though this approximation has thus far proceeded in the
                                 of its
London clay, yet       numerous species are now extinct, and       only                       it  is
in the  upper  beds    crag that any fossil can   completely identified     be
with living species.

   On the other hand, when five double observations, in January and
February 1814, were added to these 61, they reduced the result for
the coefficient to 0", 18; so that the discordancies seem to be too great
to enable us to place any reliance on the conclusions respecting the
actual magnitude of the annual parallax.
   A similar fluctuation is observable in the results obtained for the
following years; and though it might, on the whole, be inferred that
the parallax is about three fourths as great as that which the author
has assigned from his own observations, yet he contents himself with
concluding that the mural circle of Greenwich has not sufficiently
proved the identity of the distance of the two stars in summer and
winter, within one tenth of a second; but, on the contrary, that it
shows the parallax of a Lyrae to be half a second greater than that
of y Draconis.
   In 1815 the first 15 summer observations, compared with the first
13 in November, give a parallax of + 0"-72; the next 16 in summer,
compared with the next 16 in winter, give a negative parallax of
— 0".58; a comparison which sufficiently proves the imperfection of
the observations, depending probably on an unsteadiness in the in
strument.                                                                                         -

    The determination of the apparent distances and positions of such
 double stars as could be measured with micrometrical instruments
 and high magnifying powers, was suggested by Sir William Herschel
 more than forty years ago, and in his hands it led to a new depart
 ment of physical astronomy, by the discovery of sidereal phenomena
 referrible to the agency of attractive forces; but the determination of
 the existence of annual parallax, the immediate object for which the
inquiry was instituted, was soon lost sight of in the more extensive
views of the construction of the universe, which gradually unfolded
 themselves.     Nor has the investigation been resumed, although from
 the precision with which such observations can be made, it seems, in
 the opinion of the authors of this paper, likely to be the mode by
which the existence or non-existence of sensible parallax will ulti
mately be determined.
    The results of Sir William Herschel's observations, from 1779 to
 1784, were published in the Philosophical Transactions from 1782 to
 1785; and a re-examination, after a lapse of twenty years, was under
taken by him in 1801, -2, -3, and -4; and in the Transactions for 1802
and 1804, unexpected phenomena were communicated.              Instances
in which two stars were performing to each other the offices of sun
and planet were proved to exist; and to more than one pair the
period of rotation was, according to the observations of the authors
of this paper, ascertained with considerable exactness.      Immersions
and emersions of stars behind each other had been witnessed ; and
real motions among some of them had been observed rapid enough
to be detected in very short intervals of time.
    But as from the novelty of the subject, and from the imperfections
of the micrometers employed in 1779 and 1780, it was likely that
some instances of error had occasionally crept in, it became desirable
that a second re-examination should be instituted:—accordingly, in
the year 1816, some progress was made by Mr. Herschel towards its
accomplishment, and the results are communicated in the present
paper. A similar idea having likewise occurred to Mr. South, it was
at length determined that the observations should be carried on in
concert, and with his instruments.
   Meanwhile (unknown to the authors of this paper) a similar un
dertaking had been entered upon by a distinguished continental astro
nomer, Mr. Struve, Director of the Imperial Observatory at Dorpat;
and the general coincidence between the measures of this observer
and those of their own, is deemed at once interesting and corrobo
rative of the accuracy of both.

  Observations on the Changes the Ovum of the Frog undergoes during
    the Formation of the Tadpole. By Sir Everard Home, Bart. V.P.R.S.
    Read November 25, 1824. [Phil. Trans. 1825, p. 81.]
     The ova of the Frog, when examined in the ovaria, consist of dark
  coloured vesicles, which acquire a gelatinous covering on entering the
 oviduct, and are completely formed by the time they reach the cavi
 ties in which the oviducts terminate, and during their expulsion from
  which they receive the male influence; after this, the contents of the
 ovum, previously fluid, coagulate and expand, the central part being
 converted into brain and spinal marrow, while in the darker sub
 stance of the egg the heart and other viscera are formed.      The mem
 brane forming the vesicles being destined to contain the embryo when
 it has become a tadpole, enlarges as the embryo increases, and may
 be said to perform the office both of the shell and         lining mem              its
 brane      the pullet's egg, serving
           in                             defence and allowing acration.

 Explanation          of an Optical Deception in
                                          the Appearance of the Spokes

     F.R.S. Read December 9, 1824. [Phil. Trans. 1825, p. 131.]
   The optical deception which Dr. Roget describes, takes place when
a carriage-wheel,   rolling along the ground, is viewed through the                                                      in
tervals of a series of vertical bars, such as those of a palisade, or of a
Venetian window-blind.         In these circumstances,        the spokes ap                 all
pear curved, those which are situated vertically excepted, the degree
 of curvature increasing        their position recedes from the vertical,
                                             as
and being      maximum for the horizontal spokes. The convexity

   To determine the influence of variations of circumstances on these
phenomena, appeared           Dr. Roget the proper mode

The Description             of       a Floating Collimator.  By Captain Henry Kater,
  F.R.S.         Read January                13, 1825. [Phil. Trans. 1825, p. 147.]
   The apparatus described in this paper (of which a drawing is now
laid on the table) is intended to determine the situation of the line
of collimation of a telescope attached to an astronomical circle, with
respect to the zenith or horizon in some one position of the instru
ment; in other words, to determine the zero point of the divisions on
the limb. This is at present usually performed by the use of the level
or the plumb line, or by the reflection of an object from the surface
of a fluid. The author describes the defects and inconveniencies of
each of these methods.        Those of the plumb line, when applied to
small instruments (to the improvement of which he describes his at
tention to have been particularly directed,) are referrible chiefly to
want of sufficient delicacy. Those of the level are referrible to a va
riety of causes not under the command of the observer; while ob
 servations, by reflection, the most perfect perhaps of any now prac
tised, require an union of favourable circumstances rarely occurring.
 Add to these when levels or plumb lines are used, the necessity of
reversing the instrument, and observing out of the meridian.              And
 when observations are made by reflection, that of deferring the cor
 responding observation to the following night, which has proved                                                         so.

spondence in the serrated form of the edges of the teeth, in the ridges'
on their vertical surfaces, and particularly in the manner in which
the new teeth are formed in lateral cavities at the base of the fangs
of the old ones.
   From the nature of the fossils with which these teeth are asso
ciated, the author concludes the Iguanodon to have been, if amphi
bious yet not marine, but an inhabitant of rivers and fresh-water
lakes.   Judging from the proportions of the recent iguana, he con
cludes that some of the fossil teeth figured in his paper must have
belonged to an individual upwards of 60 feet long.
   The author then considers the vertebrae, which differ materially
from those of the recent iguana, crocodile, &c., and resemble rather
those of the fossil crocodiles of Havre and Honfleur, being depressed
at both extremities; but, as among recent lacertae there are exam
ples of the same structure in a higher degree, and the fossils in ques
tion are clearly of the saurian type, he does not regard the discre
pancy as sufficiently important to invalidate the conclusions attempted
to be established in this paper.
An experimental enquiry into the Nature of the radiant heating effects
 from terrestrial sources. By Baden Powell, M.A. F.R.S. of Oriel
  College, Oxford.   Read February 17, 1825. [Phil. Trans. 1825,
  p. 187.]
   In this paper the author first states the opinion of various prece
ding experimenters on the subject of the heat evolved from non-lumi
nous sources, and from bodies in various degrees of luminosity, and
observes that        all
                    the facts may     accounted for, by supposing two
                                                   be
distinct heating influences, one associated   some very close way with
                                                                   in
the rays   oflight, and carried         were     them through
                                                  as   it        by
                                                                  glass                    a

       order   examine the truth       this explanation, he observes fur

ther the portions differ        any other respect than merely      trans                  in
missibility.
   To this end the author institutes      set    experiments, whose ge

neral principle          he
                    states    be, “taking different luminous hot bodies,

against, he proceeds to describe his apparatus, which consisted of two
thermometers, A and B, of large and nearly equal bulbs graduated to
quarters of centigrade degrees, one whitened with a wash of chalk
and water, the other blackened with Indian ink.             In other experi
ments a differential thermometer was         used,  one ball being only ex
posed to the heating influence under various coatings, and the other
carefully screened, so as to reduce the effect as much as possible to
that on a mere air thermometer.
   A variety of experiments on the heating effects of various flames,
incandescent metals, &c., on these thermometers so prepared, and
both screened and unscreened with glass plates, are then detailed;
and the author then draws his general conclusions, which may be thus
stated.
   1. That the heat radiated from all luminous hot bodies is divided
or analysed by a glass screen into two portions, one of which is
stopped by the screen, and employed in increasing                temperature,                 its
and the other passes through         without raising

                                                         in                                                        of
the total radiation, they differ       their capabilities
                                                    in        being absorbed             of
by   the surfaces     bodies. That portion which passes freely through
                           of
glass being absorbed much more readily                                 by
                                                  blackened surfaces, while

Further Observations on Planariae. By J. R. Johnson, M.D. F.R.S.
       Read March 10, 1825. [Phil. Trans. 1825, p. 247.]
   In an account of some species of Planariae, published by Mr. Dal
zell of Edinburgh, that gentleman observed, that in one of these
insects which he had intentionally wounded a little below the head,
an unnatural prominence soon appeared at the wounded part, which
in about four weeks assumed the characters of a new head, and was
soon after very distinctly recognised as such.
   Anxious to verify so singular a result, Dr. Johnson took 100 active
Planariae cornutae, and made in each an incision on the side of the
body.    In one instance only he obtained the desired result, in most
of them the wounds healed.      In some, praeternatural excrescences
took  place, and others separated  at the place of incision to become
two animals. One     only acquired  a double head. It appears, there
fore, to be so unusual an occurrence    as to deserve the attention of
the Royal Society.
   Dr. Johnson proceeds to some additional observations respecting
the propagation of certain species of this curious tribe of insects. In
regard to the Planaria cornuta, he found that they were more rapidly
reproductive by the detachment of fragments when kept singly than
when several are preserved in the same vessel, owing, he says, to the
necessity then existing of continuing the species; hence he also                     in
fers, that the regenerative process is voluntary.   The Planariae kept
together, ultimately threw off as many reproductive portions as the
others, and these he thinks may probably amount to about 20 in
eight months for each insect. The smallest visible portion detached
from the tail becomes a perfect Planaria, but in this case the animal
is so small as to suggest the probability of the parent animal being
viviparous.—Dr. Johnson concludes this paper with some observa
tions on the Planaria nigra, the details of which are illustrated by an
annexed drawing. Like the species formerly described, it is furnished
with an abdominal proboscis, by which it takes     food;  its oviparous,
                                                                      it  is

power  of repairing mutilated parts.
On the Influence   of   Nerves and Ganglions   producing Animal Heat.

  By   Sir Everard Home, Bart. V.P.R.S.     presented                by
                                                        the Society for
  the Improvement   of    Animal Chemistry.   Read March 17, 1825.
  [Phil. Trans. 1825,       p.   257.]
  Sir Everard begins this paper           by
                                       adducing several instances    the        of
existence   of brain and nerves       animals, which however have no
                                         in
power  of generating heat; this     the case with the Oyster, the Snail,
                                     is
and the Water-muscle.       In
                            the  Leech,  the Earthworm, and the insect
tribe generally, the nervous filaments are united               at
                                                        intervals   gan        by
glions; and where these exist, the temperature exceeds that          the        of
atmosphere when below 56°, though            very different degrees, the
                                                in

                                    239
excess in the leech being only 1°, while in a hive of bees it is 26°.
These circumstances induced the author to inquire whether any parts
of animals possessed of an unusual temperature were devoid of nerves:
the heat of the deer's horn while inclosed in its velvet, was found in
the month of June, when only one foot long, to be 96°, and in July
the top of the antler was 99°; the power therefore of generating heat
was here so evident, independent of any direct influence of the brain
or heart, that it was only necessary to ascertain whether nerves ac
companied the blood-vessels, and they were found to do so very nu
merously.    To ascertain how far animal heat was under the control
of the ganglionic nerves, the trunks supplying the velvet of one horn
of the deer were divided, while those of the other were left entire;
and the result was, that on the first day the temperature fell 12°
short of that of the latter; on the second day 26°; on the third day
 17°; on the fourth day 8°; and on the fifth 2°. Forty-eight hours
after the division of the nerves, the temperature of the horn fell to
within 3° of that of the atmosphere, but the animal having bruised
the horn, the diary was discontinued on the sixth day, and it was
then hotter than that of which the nerves were entire; and although
the nervous trunk had not reunited, it was evident that some other
connection had been formed between the nerves of the horn and head.
The author next adverts to the abundant connexion of the placental
nerves with ganglia, as described by Mr. Hawkins on a former oc
casion. This led him to suspect that the uterus might under particular
circumstances of excited action, possess peculiar powers of generating
heat; and he was informed upon inquiry of practitioners in midwifery,
that they sometimes found in turning children, the heat almost as
great as the hand could endure. Sir Everard then details the results
of some experiments in relation to this subject, which were furnished
by Dr. Granville, showing that in certain cases of difficult labour,
the temperature of the uterus rises as high during the violence of the
pains as 120°; and to prove that mere muscular action is not the
cause of this production of heat, he observes that the temperature
of the heart of a dog in full action is only 101°, and that in certain
cases of apoplexy the body becomes alternately hot and cold, the
pulse undergoing no variation in       its
                                      frequency.
   Sir Everard concludes this communication with some remarks upon
the relation between the proportion      ganglionic nerves and that
                                                of                          of
temperature above the surrounding medium          certain fishes, and ob

                                                     a                to
                                                                     each
other.    He also notices the enormous supply             of
                                                     nerves sent       to
                                                                      the
electric organs     the Gymnotus and the Torpedo, which, however,
                 of in   no                     temperature, being en
are productive         remarkable increase           of
tirely free from, and unconnected with, any ganglionic arrangement.
He also suggests the probability     the ganglionic nerves being those
which are principally affected    in   all of
                                        diseases attended      by

able elevation   of   heat beyond the natural standard.

 An Essay     on Egyptian Mummies; with Observations on the Art of Em
      balming among the ancient Egyptians.      By A. B. Granville, M.D.
      F.R.S. F.L.S. F.G.S. M.R.I. one of His Royal Highness the Duke
      of Clarence's Physicians in Ordinary, &c. &c. Read April 14, 1825.
      [Phil. Trans. 1825, p. 269.]
    The mummy described in this paper was purchased at Gournou;
 it was in a single case of the usual form, and covered with cere cloth
 bandages, very neatly and dexterously applied, and among which both
 cotton and linen were recognised. These, to the amount of 28 pounds
 avoirdupois in weight, having been removed, the body was discovered
 to be that of a female. The abdominal integuments were remarka
bly wrinkled, and the whole surface of a dark brown colour and dry,
but in many places soft to the touch, and with the exception of a few
parts, entirely deprived of cuticle.    The height of the mummy from
 the vertex of the head to the inferior surface of the calcaneum was
 5 feet ºr inch, and the principal dimensions of the several parts cor
respond with those which are usually considered as giving rise to the
utmost perfection of female form in the European race, neither was
any trait of Ethiopian character discernible in the form of the cra
mium; all which, observes Dr. Granville, supports Cuvier's opinion
respecting the Caucasian origin of the Egyptians.
   The author then proceeds to a brief summary of the present state
of our information respecting Egyptian mummies, attributing                                  its
scantiness and imperfection       the rarity  perfect specimens, nearly
                                             to           of
all the mummies hitherto described, presenting little else than imper
fect skeletons enveloped      bandages, sometimes covered
                                      in                        the dry             by
skin.

       proceeding        examine the present specimen, the integuments
                           to

                     of
 that cavity carefully inspected. They consisted           portion
                                                                of  a  the sto      of

 capsule     the left kidney, and the left kidney itself, with the ureter
            of
 descending into the bladder, which with the uterus and          appendagesits
were observed      situ, the latter exhibiting marksof disease. Fragments
                     in
only   ofthe intestinal tube were discoverable; and there were             few           a
lumps      resin,
           of          compound
                      of  a                  of
                                       clay and bitumen, and few pieces    a                 of
myrrh. The right kidney, the liver, and minor glandswere missing, but
thegall-bladderwas detected among the loose fragments             membranes    of
and other soft parts, together with remains                    of   its
                                                           own ducts. The
soft parts     the pelvis were then particularly examined, and the per

heart,     in
            avery contracted state, was afterwards found suspended by
its vessels, and attached        the lungs, which adhered
                                     of to

   Upon the examination           the cranium,     was evident that the brain

of the inner nasal bones, the eyes appear not to have been disturbed,
the tongue was entire, and the teeth white and perfect.
   Dr. Granville next proceeds to draw some conclusions as to the
age at which this mummied female died, and respecting the disease
which destroyed her. The bones of the ileum exhibit that peculiar
thinness of their osseous plates which show the individual to have
exceeded her fortieth year, and to have borne children; and as there
are no characters of age or decrepitude about the skeleton, the au
thor considers her to have been about fifty. The ovarium and broad
ligament of the right side were enveloped in a mass of diseased struc
ture, while the Fallopian tube of the same side was sound; but the
uterus itself was larger than natural, and the remains of a sac were
found connected with the left ovarium; all which, connected with
the appearance of the abdominal integuments, leave no doubt of
ovarian dropsy having been the disease under which the individual
suffered.
   The author concludes this communication with some observations
respecting the method of embalming generally, and the nature of the
substances employed in the process, from the details of which he
draws the following conclusions:—
   The abdominal viscera were more or less perfectly extracted,
either through an incision on one side of the abdomen, or, as in the
present mummy, through the anus.       The thoracic cavity was not
disturbed.   The contents of the cranium were removed sometimes
through the nostrils,    and   in others through    one of the     orbits.
The body was then probably covered with quick-lime, to facilitate
the removal of the cuticle, the scalp and nails being, however, left
untouched; after which, it was immersed in a melted mixture of wax,
resin, and bitumen, until thoroughly penetrated; and ultimately sub
jected to a tanning liquor, probably made with the saline water of
the neighbouring matron lakes.    The bandages were applied with the
occasional interposition of melted resin, or wax and resin, the lumps
of resin, myrrh, &c., having been previously placed in the abdomen.

   The author's attention having been recalled to the consideration
of the effects of rotation in altering the magnetic influence of iron,
in the course of speculations on the cause of the rotation of the earth's
magnetic poles; and knowing, at the same time, that Mr. Christie
had found a permanent change in the magnetic state of an iron plate,
by mere change of position on     itsaxis,it seemed      him highly pro
                                                        to

creased     rapid rotation.   On trial, however,   itwas found that the

    In examining the results of some of the experiments upon the
effects of single masses of protecting metal on the sheeting, the
author observed, that in some cases the corrosion seemed to increase
with the distance from the protector.        It became, therefore, neces
sary to investigate this circumstance, and to ascertain the extent of
the diminution of electrical action in instances of imperfect or irre
gular conducting surfaces.       Sir Humphry details several experiments
in illustration of this    inquiry, which prove that any diminution of
protecting effect at a distance does not depend upon the nature of
the metallic, but of the imperfect or fluid conductor.           His experi
ments upon perfect and imperfect conductors led him to another                                      in
quiry, important in its practical relations, respecting the nature of
the contact between the copper and the preserving metal.           He found
the protecting action prevented by the thinnest stratum of air, or the
finest leaf of talc or dry paper; but the ordinary coating of rust, or
a thin piece of moistened paper, did not impair                           it.
   After some experimental details respecting the electro-chemical
powers         of
             metals     solutions excluded from air, Sir Humphry con
                           in
cludes his  paper   with practical inferences and theoretical elucidations
arising out          of
                  its general details.    Finding that      certain cases     in                    of
imperfect connexion, the influence           the protector was weakened
                                                            of
by distance, the author proposed that when ships with old sheathing
were      to   be
              protected,     greater proportion
                                    a                iron should    of used,              be

 of a plate of soft iron, having within it two poles developed in given
 positions, and acting (in addition to the usual magnetic action of soft
 iron,) on a needle of infinitely small dimensions in the plane of the
 plate.    He refers the whole ordinary action of the iron to                     centre,                             its

Some Account of the Transit Instrument made by Mr. Dollond, and

   The author in this paper first describes the operations by which
the new transit instrument at the Observatory of Cambridge was
approximatively placed, so as to allow of a meridian mark being
erected on the distant steeple of Granchester church.       He then en
ters into a more full consideration of the different methods proposed
and employed by astronomers for executing the more delicate ad
justments of the transit in general; he shows how the errors of col
limation, level, azimuth, and the clock, may         detected, and their   all   be
values determined, by the resolution      certain equations      of

     The experiments of which the results are detailed in this paper,
  were made principally on the fluid which is found to be deposited in
 considerable quantity when oil-gas is compressed. This fluid, as ob
 tained at the works of the Portable Oil-gas Company, is colourless,
 of a specific gravity less than that of water; insoluble in water ex
 cept in very minute quantities; soluble in alcohol, ether, oils, &c.;
 and combustible, burning with a dense flame. It is strikingly distin
 guished from the        from which  oil   originated,   not being acted

  The experiments        M. Arago having excited much interest, the
                                     of
authors     of
            this communication were induced        erect    apparatus            to                     an
for their verification; and after few trials they succeededa  causing                                        in

                                    250
 a compass to deviate from the magnetic meridian, by setting in rota
tion under it plates of copper, zinc, lead, &c.
   To obtain more visible and regular effects, however, they found it
necessary to reverse the experiment, by setting in rotation a powerful
horse-shoe magnet, and suspending over it the various metals and
other substances to be examined, which were found to follow with
various degrees of readiness the motion of the magnet.         The sub
stances in which they succeeded in developing signs of magnetism
were, copper, zinc, silver, tin, lead, antimony, mercury, gold, bis
muth, and carbon, in that peculiar metalloidal state in which it is
precipitated from carburetted hydrogen in gas-works.         In the case
of mercury the rigorous absence of iron was secured. In other
bodies, such as sulphuric acid, resin, glass, and other non-conductors,
or imperfect conductors of electricity, no positive evidence of mag
 netism was obtained.
   The comparative intensities of action of thin bodies were next
numerically determined by two different methods, viz. by observing
the deviation of the compass over revolving plates of great size cast
to one pattern, and by the times of rotation of a neutralized system
of magnets suspended over them; and it is curious that the two
methods, though they assigned the same order to the remaining
bodies, uniformly gave opposite results in the cases of zinc and cop
per, placing them constantly above or below each other according to
                                                                         -
the mode of observation employed.
   The authors next investigated the effect of solution of continuity
on the various metals, in the course of which M. Arago's results of
the diminution of effect, by division of the metallic plates used, were
verified; and the further fact ascertained, that re-establishing the
metallic contact with other metals, restores the force either wholly
or in great measure, and that even when the metal used for solder
ing has in itself but a very feeble magnetic power, thus affording a
power of magnifying weak degrees of magnetism.
   The law of diminution of the force by increase of distance is next
investigated.   It appears to follow no constant progression according
to a fixed power  of the distance, but to vary between the square and
the cube.
   The remainder of this paper is devoted to reasoning on the facts
detailed.    The authors conceive that they may be            all
                                                              explained
without any new hypothesis    in magnetism, by supposing simply that
time      requisite both for the development and loss

                               of the force  ultimately  developable  in
them; and they apply this explanation not only     to their own results,

   Mr. Christie in this communication gives an account of some ex
periments on the development of magnetism in copper by rotation.
He corroborates by his own experience the results obtained by Mr.
Babbage and Mr. Herschel, in which a disc of copper was set in ro
tation by the rotation of one or more magnets beneath             both     the      it,             in
case when poles         the same name were immediately below the disc

and when           contrary name. The action appeared equally intense
                  of  a
in  both cases, and from this circumstance the author concludes the
magnetism thus communicated             the copper
                                               to                         be

                                             combining the revolving mag
nets differently, and the results are stated.

    This paper, which professes to be a continuation of former re
searches on the same subject printed in the Transactions of the Royal
Society, is divided into two chapters.          In the first the author consi
ders the nature of the law of those numbers in tables of mortality,
which express the amount of persons living at the end of ages in
regular arithmetical progression. He remarks that for short intervals
the law approaches nearly to a decreasing geometrical progression,
and that this must be the case whatever be the strict expression for
the law of mortality, provided the intervals do not exceed certain
limits. But he further remarks, that this property will be found to
belong to very extensive portions of tables of mortality, and instances
Deparcieux's tables, where from the age of 25 to that of 45, the
numbers living at the end of each year decrease very nearly in geo
metrical progression.
    Considering however the whole extent of such a table, it will be
found that the ratio of this geometrical progression is not the same
in   allparts     the table. But before

   In the second chapter, the author, after briefly explaining by        al
gebraical reasoning, the mode of applying these principles to calcu

represent the logarithm of the present values of annuities for every
value of a certain argument,) are actually calculated, and annexed to
the communication, forming the principal part of the second chapter.
Observations      of the apparent distances and positions of 458 Double and
   Triple Stars,      in the years 1823, 1824, and 1825; together with
                       made
   a re-eramination of 36 Stars of the same description, the distances
   and positions of which were communicated in a former Memoir. By
   James South, Esq. F.R.S.        Read November 17, 1825.      [Phil.
   Trans. 1826, Part I. p. 1.]
   The author prefaces these observations with a brief account of the
instruments with which, and the circumstances under which, the ob
servations previously communicated to this Society were made, and
being fully described in the former paper alluded to in the title of
this, require no further particular description; he contents himself
therefore with noticing that by a different adaptation of their parts,
higher magnifying powers than those formerly employed were ob
tained, and a series of powers from 92 to 787 used in a part of the
 observations.
   A large portion of these observations were made at Passy near
Paris, and the author takes occasion to make honourable mention of
the facilities afforded him on the part of the French Government for
the ingress and egress of his instruments into and out of France, and
of the attention and assistance uniformly afforded him while resident
there by many distinguished individuals.
   Of the stars whose measures are here presented, he states that
 about 160 are hitherto undescribed and probably new.       The places
 of these are given merely with sufficient exactness to enable any one
 to find them in future. The remainder are in great measure stars
 comprised in Mr. Struve's catalogue of 796 double and triple stars,
 and among them about 160 belong to those examined for the first
 time by Sir William Herschel.
    The observations themselves are stated in a manner somewhat dif
 ferent from that adhered to in the former communication already
 alluded    to.Instead    giving all the individual micrometrical mea

result, but also the difference between the greatest and least means
taken, or the limits within which all the measures necessarily lie.
   The stars themselves are arranged in order of right ascension for
convenience of reference.      After the statement of the mean results
of the several sets of observations both of angle and distance, a final
mean with a mean date for an epoch is deduced.        In the case of Sir
William Herschel's stars, a comparison of the measures now obtained
with those given in his catalogues, or now for the first time brought
to light by a careful examination of his manuscripts, is subjoined.
By this comparison several fresh instances have been found of double
stars, in which the relative motion of the individuals composing them
is satisfactorily proved.    In one remarkable case (that of the star
3 Equulei,) this change has gone to an enormous extent, and is sa
tisfactorily referred to proper motion in the large star. In another
not less singular, all the three stars of a triple star (; Cancri) are
ascertained to be relatively in motion, describing orbits about each
other, and forming probably a ternary system by the mutual gravita
tion of         its
           members, thus completely justifying the views taken by
Sir William Herschel      this subject,   his papers published
                                            of                    in

final result with those obtained in other experiments and by different
methods.      Now it appears that previous to the experiments detailed
in the author's paper on the subject in the Philosophical Transactions
for 1818, on which this result rests, another series is there men
tioned, made with the same instruments, but under circumstances
which occasioned their rejection, and which, owing to some repairs in
the instruments between the two series, which occasioned a material
alteration in the distance between the knife edges, have          the weight                   all

    2ndly. With the invariable pendulum, the disc subtended a some
what less angle than the tail-piece, so that the inferred number of vi
brations in 24 hours was diminished about mºoths of a second. But
experiments with the invariable pendulum being intended to be in the
strictest sense of the word comparative, this constant difference will
no way affect the ultimate result.    But as the most direct way to
remove any doubts which may be entertained on the subject, the
author has computed from the whole of Captain Sabine's observa
tions, the successive differences in the vibrations at the various sta
tions visited by him, by the two methods, viz. that of employing the
disappearances    and re-appearances,             and the disappearances alone.
  The results only in one instance differ so much as a tenth part of a
 vibration. They are indifferently in excess and defect, and the mean
  of their discrepancies is exactly nothing.       From this he concludes,
 that if the observations be made as nearly as possible under similar
  circumstances, the method of observing by disappearances alone is
 productive of no perceptible error in practice, in experiments with
 the invariable pendulum, while in those with the convertible pendu
 lum the equal apparent size of the disc and tail-piece precludes the
 possibility of any, either in practice or theory, from this cause.
     The standard of Sir George Shuckburgh having been found iden
 tical with that of Bird, in the custody of the clerk of the House of
 Commons, adopted as the imperial standard unit of extension, the
 length of the pendulum already determined is fixed with the same
 degree of precision in parts of the Imperial standard yard.
     A repetition of Sir George Shuckburgh's experiments on the weight
 of given volumes of distilled water, and a re-measurement of the cube,
 sphere, and cylinder used by him, were found to give no material
variation from his results; and these being stated in terms of the
mean of several standard weights kept at the House of Commons,
the troy pound nearest the mean has been adopted and declared by
the legislature to be the original unit of weight under the denomina
tion of the Imperial standard troy pound.                                 -
     The relation between this   pound    and the cubic inch of distilled
water at 62°Fahrenheit, barometer 30 inches, has been ascertained
by the Commissioners of Weights and Measures, who find that the
latter contains 252,458 grains, each grain being the 5760 part of the
standard troy pound.
    The avoirdupois pound is fixed for assigning              its
                                                          proportion   the          to
standard   troy  pound, so   as   to
                                 contain   exactly  7000 such grains.
    The Imperial standard gallon      defined
                                        is            by

the latter purpose being determined by experiments.instituted  for the
purpose.
   The experiments for adjusting them are then given in full detail.
The troy pounds were first adjusted, and the exactness with which
this operation has been performed may be appreciated from this, that
the final errors of none of them exceed rºº’, oths of a grain. When
brought so near, it was of course not thought necessary to attempt
further correction.
   The avoirdupois pounds and the weights of the gallon of water
were then derived from the troy pounds, and finally adjusted like
them by inclosing within the weight, in hollows left for the purpose,
wires equal to the errors ascertained to exist in them; the weights
of these wires in each case is stated; so that should they by any ac
cident be taken out and lost, they may be restored.
   He next describes the method used in adjusting the gallon itself,
the method of filling it exactly and of weighing it when filled, toge
ther with the corrections depending on the circumstances of tempe
rature and pressure under which the experiments were made.         As a
final result, it appears that one only of the gallons was ultimately
found in error to a greater extent than 1%ths of a grain, the others
having their errors less than a fourth of that quantity.
   The quarts and pints being next disposed         the author describes            of,
the balance contrived       him for       by
                                    weighing  the bushels, which proved

                          their apparent errors less than 6-56 grains                                               of
water, while the corrections for temperature and pressure only

    The examination of the incrustation upon ancient coins showed it
 to consist of oxide of tin, and of carbonate and submuriate of tin, and
 of carbonate and submuriate of copper.        It in some cases acquires a
 dingy hue from the prevalence of black oxide of copper, mixed with
 a little of its protoxide.
    The author could discover no connexion between the perfect state
 of preservation of ancient coins, and their composition; but he ob
 serves that the manner in which the crystalline structure of the in
 crustation is acquired is a peculiarly interesting question.         There
 being no reason to suspect deposition from solution, “are we not,”
says the author, “under the necessity of inferring, that the mineral

were Lignieres on the French, and Fairlight Down, near Hastings,
on the English side. The operations at the former were made by
Captain Sabine and Colonel Bonne; those at the latter by Mr. Her
schel and Mr. Largeteau; thus securing two independent lines of
communication, a British and a French, between the extreme sta
tions, and observers at each station exchanging, observations at the
termination of the whole operation, which was continued for twelve
mights, ten signals being made at each station per night; and though
the whole of them could not be employed, it is stated that the final
result, which makes the difference of longitude between the two ob
servatories equal to 9'21"-6, is not very likely to be found one tenth
of a second in error, and extremely unlikely to prove erroneous to
twice that amount.
   The observations are then stated in detail; and the mode of com
bining them in the most impartial manner, so as to deduce from them
the most advantageous result, is next investigated; and a general
formula deduced applicable to all operations of the kind, and in
cluding all the necessary corrections.    This formula is then applied
to the actual observations, and the result above mentioned deduced.
The two results deduced by considering separately the observations
of the British and of the French observers, at the intermediate sta
tions, exhibit a remarkable coincidence,—their difference amounting
to only a single hundredth of a second.

On the magnetizing Power of the more refrangible Solar Rays.    By
  Mrs. M. Somerville. Communicated by W. Somerville, M.D. F.R.S.

   In the year 1813, Professor Morichini, of Rome, announced that
steel exposed in a particular manner to the concentrated violet rays
of the prismatic spectrum becomes magnetic. His experiments, how
ever, having uniformly failed in other hands, had ceased to excite gene
ral attention; especially in this country, whose climate is usually so
unfavourable for such researches. The unusual clearness of weather
last summer, however, induced Mrs. Somerville to make the attempt.
Having, at that time, no information of the manner in which Prof.
Morichini's experiments were conducted, it occurred to her, however,
as unlikely that if the whole of a needle were equally exposed to the
violet rays, the same influence should at the same time produce a
south pole at one end, and a north at the other of       She therefore                  it.

exceptions possibly attributable to some predisposition in the needle
itself to magnetism too slight to be observed. The distance of the
needle from the prism was varied without materially varying the
effect.   It was found unnecessary to darken the room, provided the
spectrum was thrown out of the direct solar rays.
   The next object was to ascertain whether the other prismatic
colours had the same property as the violet.          Needles (previously
ascertained to be     unmagnetic) exposed    to the blue and green rays
sometimes    acquired  magnetism, though   less frequently, and requiring
longer exposure; but the magnetism when communicated seemed
equally strong as in the case of the violet rays. The indigo suc
ceeded nearly as well as the violet.     In                        all
                                                  cases, the exposed end
usually became north pole. But

  On the Nervous Circle which connects the voluntary Muscles with the
    Brain.    By Charles Bell, Esq. Communicated by the President,
    January 25, 1826. Read February 16, 1826. [Phil. Trans. 1826,
    Part II. p. 163.]
    The author's object in this communication      is to show that every
 muscle is  supplied  with two nerves of different properties, and that
 where nerves of different functions have a separate origin, and run a
 different course, two nerves must unite in the muscle in order to
 perfect the relation betwixt the brain and those muscles.
    Referring to his former observations, Mr. Bell remarks, that when
 he had distinguished two classes of nerves going to the face, and had
 deprived the muscles of motion by dividing the nerve, a question na
 turally suggested itself as to the use of the remaining nerves, more
 especially on finding that the 5th pair, or sensitive nerve, was more
 profusely distributed to the muscles than to the skin, although they
 are found in surgical operations by no means to possess that exqui
 site sensibility which such abundance of nerves would appear to       in
 dicate.
    The lower maxillary nerve, which is a branch of the fifth pair, is
 composed of a nerve of sensation and a nerve of motion, arising in
 two sorts, one the sensitive, the other the muscular.     On the former
 division the Gasserian  ganglion  is formed, but the motive nerve may
 be traced clear of the ganglion to the muscles of the jaws.      Now if
 all that is necessary to the action of a muscle be a nerve to excite
 contraction, these branches, says the author, should have been un
 accompanied; but, on the contrary, they are joined before they enter
 the muscles by the sensitive nerves of the ganglion.
    These and similar facts and observations lead Mr. Bell to ask why
 nerves of sensation are thus profusely given in addition to their mo
 tive nerves; and in the progress of this inquiry, he shows that a
 consciousness of the state and degree of action of the muscles is ne
 cessary to the governance of the muscular frame; that motive nerves
 are not those by which such information is conveyed to the brain,
 for they are concerned in carrying the influence of the will to the
 muscle; and it is not likely that the same nerve should be active in
 two directions at the same moment; for, without reference to the
 cause, a simple nerve has the influence propagated along it in one
 direction only, and cannot be shown to act both from and to the
 sensorium, as may be proved by actual experience, and in illustration
 of which, Mr. Bell refers to the effects of sundry nerves, and to cer
tain cases of their morbid affections.
    The author, therefore, concludes that between the brain and mus
-cles there is a circle of nerves, that one nerve conveys the influence
 of the brain to the muscle, and that another gives the sense of the
 condition of the muscle to the brain. If this circle be broken by the
 division of the motive nerve, motion ceases; if it be broken by the
 division of the other nerve, there is no longer a sense of the condition
 of the muscle, and therefore no regulation of it actively.

                                                           267
   Mr. Bell concludes this paper with some remarks upon the use of
the plexus formed on both sets of nerves, and on their association
upon the integuments. In regard to the plexuses, he considers them
as concerned in associating the functions of distinct muscles; and in
reference to the surface of the body, he remarks, that although the
principal office of    nerves      its
                                   convey impressions
                                                    is     the senso

rium, yet, on the other hand, the condition        the mind     often                 of                         is

He trusts that he has proved that coagulation of the blood in an
aneurismal sac, by the means pointed out in this paper, is not only
practicable, but that it may be resorted to without the production of
any important local or constitutional symptoms.
   Sir Everard next details the results of several experiments made
with a view of ascertaining the effects of various temperatures upon
the spontaneous coagulation of the blood. The separation of serum
he finds considerably impeded by a high temperature, but by a
heat of 120° the blood is rendered buffy; and if drawn from the arm
into a cup immersed in boiling water, and kept for some hours at that
temperature, it does not form a complete coagulum.     A low tempe
rature also interferes with its perfect coagulation; for when drawn
into a cup immersed in ice, and left there, in twenty-four hours the
surface had a buffy coat, and the coagulum was extremely loose.
   It has been generally believed that the cupped appearance of blood
depends upon the coagulable lymph being more contractile when se
parated from, than when blended with, the other parts of the blood.
In a patient who suffered under inflammation of the brain, and who
was bled in the course of thirteen days to the amount of sixty-eight
ounces, some of the blood, though very buffy, was not at all cupped.
Its appearance was very peculiar, and the coagulum was divided into
an upper dense portion, having the characters of coagulated albu
 men; while the lower portion had a gelatinous appearance, and ex
hibited the albumen in a very attenuated state, mixed with the
colouring matter.
On the mathematical Theory of Suspension Bridges, with Tables for
 facilitating their Construction. By Davies Gilbert, Esq. V.P.R.S.
  &c.    Communicated March 9, 1826. Read March 9, 1826. [Phil.
  Trans. 1826, Part III. p. 202.]
   In this  paper the author states that his attention was first directed
to a consideration of suspension bridges, when the plan for the Menai
Bridge was submitted to the Commissioners of Roads and Bridges. It
then appeared to him that the proposed depth of curvature was           in
sufficient for insuring a due degree of strength; and this opinion
was confirmed by some investigations, which are printed in the
Quarterly Journal of Science.       In consequence of this, the interval
between the road-way and the points of support has been augmented
to 50 feet, and    its
                     strength now appears sufficient.
   The   object   ofthis paper is  the expansion   of the formulae, from
which the above-mentioned       approximation   was  derived,   into tables
adapted       general use; and the derivation
             to                                   of other formulae and
tables for the catenary   of equal strength; a curve not merely    of  spe
culative curiosity, but  ofpractical use when bridges   ofvery wide span
are to  be constructed.   The author first remarks, that  asall catenaries,

    A needle, six inches long, contained         brass compass-box with    in   a
a glass cover, was suspended by         fine hair, and made       vibrate,                                    to
alternately shaded and exposed          the sun.               to a

duced      bywooden screen, supported four feet above the box.
               a                                                                                                        It
was then found that (setting off from the same point,) the 100th
vibration could        very distinctly noted

                     in                                               per                                 to       be

   In another experiment a heavier needle was suspended by a fine
wire, and when heated by exposure to the sun its decrease of inten
sity was ascertained by torsion of the wire, and was found to cor
respond nearly with the author's previous determinations;     but the
terminal arc, after fifty vibrations made in the sun, was found
always considerably less than after the same number in the shade,
the initial arcs being the same in both cases. Other observations
made in strong sunshine, and of which a detail is given, led to the
same conclusions; the terminal arc in the shade, after forty vibra
tions, being 14°, and in the sun only 8%, the initial arc being 90°.
   That this effect does not arise from change of temperature and
intensity in the needle is evident from the observations themselves.
To show that it does not arise from change of temperature in the
brass box, the author heated the box over a fire till its heat was
barely supportable by the hand; and the needle being vibrated al
ternately in the box so heated, and in the cold box (but in neither
case exposed to the sun), the effect of increased temperature was
found decidedly and considerably the reverse of that of the solar ra
diation, the terminal arc being materially increased by the heat, a
circumstance, he thinks, indicative of a diminished capacity for
magnetism in brass at an elevated temperature.
   The author next tried the effect of an elevation of temperature in
the needle itself, by dipping it in boiling water, but found no sen
sible effect on the terminal arc.
    The small accelerations in the times of vibrations in the experi
ments first described, the author attributes to the diminution of the
arcs. The first observations in which the peculiar effect was noticed
were made June 4, 1824; and he regrets that his absence from home
during the hot and clear weather of the summer of 1825, prevented
his extending the inquiry by further and obvious experiments.
Meanwhile he regards these observations as tending considerably to
remove the doubts raised respecting the influence of the violet ray
in Professor Morichini's experiments, arising from their repeated
failures in the ablest hands.

neutral combination with sulphuric acid, and that the compound in
its purest known form constitutes what has been called oil of wine;
and that when in this state it is acted upon by certain salifiable
bases, a portion of the hydrocarbon is thrown off, and a distinct set of
neutral salts formed, which are resolvable by heat into bi-sulphates;
and which therefore include two proportionals of the elements of
sulphuric acid, one of proto-carburet of hydrogen, and one of base.
On a Method of expressing by Signs the Action of Machinery.    By

   In the construction of an engine for calculating and printing ma
thematical tables, in which the author of this paper has been for
some time occupied, he states himself to have met with considerable
difficulty from the want of any method by which all those motions
which take place in any machine at the same instant, may be easily
perceived and referred to, and by which the movement of any part
might readily be traced back, through all the intervening stages, up
to the first mover of the machine.   The usual modes of mechanical
drawing he found quite insufficient for these purposes, except in ma
chinery of the simplest construction; and, even if they had not                                                         al
together failed in more complicated cases, the time and expense
required for their execution would have effectually prevented their
employment.
   The most important question was to contrive some method by

which parallax most affects the angle of position is when the great
circle passing through both stars, passes also through the pole of
the ecliptic. But to ascertain how far any particular star is or is
not favourable to the application of the method, and the times of the
year when it ought to be observed, it is necessary to make a calcu
lation, the mathematical principles of which the author explains;
and includes, in proper formulae, which he then applies to the for
mation of a list of about 70 stars, as a specimen.
   He concludes by observing, that by a certain mode of using the
double image-position micrometer, first explained to him by Captain
Kater, the application of this method ceases to be limited to close
stars; and that stars of any moderate distance, otherwise favourably
situated, may be equally well subjected to examination with nearer
ones; and that thus the range of objects placed within our power
becomes unlimited.
A    Formula for expressing the Decrement of Human Life. In a Letter
     addressed to Sir Edward Hyde East, Bart. M.P. F.R.S.         By
     Thomas  Young,  M.D. For. Sec. R.S. Communicated    February  2,
     1826.   Read April 19, 1826. [Phil. Trans. 1826, p. 281.]
    The author first observes that an opinion is generally prevalent, of
 a decided increase in the average duration of human life in many
 parts of Europe; but he yet regards it as probable that this improve
 ment has been much exaggerated, partly on account of the limited
 number of persons on whom the observations have been made, and
 partly from erroneous views respecting the profits of assurance com
 panies.
    He then examines the evidence on which this opinion rests, and
 gives a comparative statement of the annual average of mortality,
the mean term of full life, and the mean age of mankind, according
 to a great number of different authorities; and considers that a pro
longation of life to the extent of one year in eight, is a much fairer
 estimate than one in three, which some have maintained, even on
the limited grounds of the experience on which they have reasoned.
    Another mode, he observes, of easily appreciating the regularity
and analogies of tables is the construction of a curve in which, the
abscissa representing the age, the ordinate shall represent the corre
sponding decrements of life. This he accordingly does, and            its   in
   ection      he
               observes     sufficient
                           is          to  render us  suspicious of  the ac
curacy    of the Carlisle tables; while     heconsidersa     combination    of
these and the Northampton tables, and the London parish registers,
as  likely     give the fairest estimate.

On the Means of facilitating the Observation of distant Stations in
  Geodetical Operations.   By Lieutenant Thomas Drummond, of the
  Royal Engineers.    Communicated   April 14, 1826, by Lieut.-Co
  lonel H. Colby, F.R.S. Read    May  4, 1826. [Phil. Trans. 1826,
  p. 324.]
   In consequence of the Report of a Select Committee of the House
of Commons in June 1824, it was resolved that a new survey of Ire
land should be undertaken; and the author was directed by Colonel
Colby to consider the most effective means of rendering distant sta
tions observable in the prevalent hazy state of that country.
   After adverting to some of the usual means resorted to in such
cases, and showing their inefficiency for his present purpose, and
after noticing some unsatisfactory trials of brilliant pyrotechnical
preparations, and of the combustion of phosphorus in oxygen gas,
the author attempted applying to the purpose in view the brilliant
light emanating from intensely heated quicklime.             To obtain the
requisite                  he passed a stream of oxygen through the
                temperature,
flame of alcohol; and this jet being directed upon a small spherical
piece of quicklime placed in the focus of a proper reflector, the light
which it emitted was found to have 83 times the intensity of the
brightest part of the flame of an Argand burner.          Other substances,
such as   zirconia,   magnesia,   and oxide of    zinc, were tried as substi
tutes, but were found very inferior as sources of light, when ignited,
to quicklime from chalk, which moreover admits of being conveni
ently turned in a lathe into focal balls of any requisite dimensions.
Mr. Drummond proceeds to detail the necessary application of this
system to a case of considerable difficulty that occurred at the end of
last season. Slieve Snaght, the highest hill of Innishowen (2100 feet),
and 15 miles North of Londonderry, forms an important point in the
triangulation connecting the North of Ireland with the Western Isles
of Scotland. On the 23rd of August a conspicuous object was placed
upon      its
           summit, that       might
                               it        observed from Divvis Hill, near
                                             be

as   tofrustrate all efforts      observation, the distance between the
stations being 664 miles.       On the 27th         October the author pro

ceeded     tothe hill; and after some   delay   from tempestuous weather,
brought the new instrument into use, which was brilliantly visible                    at
the other station, and thus successfully terminated the observations.
   This paper concludes with notices           some other proposed appli

An Account of                some      Experiments       relative to the Passage                  of radiant
     Heat through glass Screens.    By the Rev. Baden Powell, M.A.
     F.R.S. of Oriel College, Oxford. Communicated March 9, 1826.

   The object of this paper is to examine the correctness and the con
sequences of a conclusion of De la Roche, that if radiant heat be in
tercepted by two transparent screens, the additional diminution of
effect occasioned by the second is proportionally much less than that
produced by the first, and so for any number of screens.            This M.
De la Roche explains by supposing the heat passing through the first
screens to acquire thereby a kind of polarization, which enables it to
pass the rest more easily. The author, however, observes, that when
the temperature of the source of heat is above incandescence, the
fact admits of more simple explanation, by regarding the heat as
consisting of two portions, the one incapable of penetrating glass,
and therefore wholly stopped by the first screen; the other capable
of so doing, and therefore readily transmitted through any number
of screens.
     If,
       however,              he
                        observes, the same effect    produced      tempera

galvanometer of Prof. Cumming; the suspended needle being sur

altogether disproved                          by    an
                                 experiment here described,           which,                                       in
when two    glasses filled with solution      nitrate     potash,      whichof                 of                  in
were plunged respectively zinc and platina, connected             the multi                               by
plier, were connected                     by
                            substances capable      conducting electricity,           of

 but not of propagating chemical action, such as unoxidable metals,
 the circulation of the current was altogether destroyed.
    Since the chemical changes always tend to restore the equilibrium
 destroyed by the contact of the metals in the fluids of a pile, it is
 evident that the relation between the fluids themselves and the sur
 faces with which they are in contact, will be altered by a continuance
 of the action of the pile. Hence it is easy to perceive the possibility
 of a re-action taking place, when the circuit is broken, or the dispo
 sition of the parts of a pile is changed, or one or more parts of a
 compound circuit abstracted.            Many curious phenomena, of which
 hitherto no    explanation      has been offered, may be explained by this
 view of the    subject;      such as the secondary piles of M. Ritter; the
 supposed polarization of electricity concluded by M. De la Rive from
 his experiments of the interposition of metallic plates in the fluids of
 a pile; the continuance of electro-motive action of detached portions
 of a circuit, after the destruction of the circuit itself, in some expe
 riments, &c.      This re-action is illustrated in the paper before us by
 an  experiment,      in which a circuit, primarily inactive, consisting of
 six arcs of  platinum      in vessels filled with solution of nitre, was made
part of a battery, consisting of fifty pairs of plates, of a combination
primarily active. After continuing the circuit some time it was
broken, and the platinum arcs detached and formed into a circuit
were found to possess independent action, contrary to that of the
pile, which had thus rendered them re-active. This singular conse
quence is pursued yet further in another experiment here stated, in
which detached portions of a battery of fifty plates, which had been
some time in action, were examined as separate piles, after breaking
up the combination.            When they had been placed conformably in
the   original  battery,     their independent action was found to be very
much weakened          by  the re-action thus produced, which in this case
opposed their natural effect; whereas, when unconformably placed in
the original battery, their action, when detached, was found exalted
to three or four times its natural intensity.
    The author next proceeds to point out some general observations
and practical applications which suggest themselves on a view of the
foregoing results.        The chemical changes in a conducting liquid, he
first  shows,    take    place   only in the immediate vicinity of the im
mersed    poles,  the rest of the liquid affording only a tranquil passage
to the   electricity.     This leads him to consider the motions produced
in mercury when interposed in the circuit under an electrified fluid,
which he regards as arising from the two electricities acting as
transporters of ponderable matters, which assume their own peculiar
characters when they reach their point of rest.               The lecture con
cludes with some        practical  suggestions   as to the use of the multiplier
to obtain exact numerical measures of the electro-dynamic relations
of chemical elements, and with some applications of the preceding
results to the useful arts, especially in the preservation of the copper
on ships, and the iron boilers of steam-engines.

On the Discordances between the Sun's observed and computed Right
  Ascensions, as determined at the Blackman-street Observatory, in
  the Years 1821 and 1822; with Erperiments to show that they did
  not originate in instrumental Derangement. Also a Description of
  the seven-feet Transit with which the Observations were procured, and

  Trans. 1826,   p. 423.]
   Astronomers have generally admitted that a certain discordance
between the observed transits of the sun and its computed right ascen
sion takes place, and have been accustomed to refer it to instrumental
error, arising from the action of the solar rays on the parts of the
transit instrument used.                                     -
   The validity of this explanation, and the true state of the facts, are
what the author proposes to investigate in this communication.
   He commences his paper with a full description of the transit in
strument used in the observations, (the work of Mr. Troughton,) and
of which, as accurate drawings have already been exhibited to the
Society, no account need now be given, further than to mention the
connexion of the cones which form the axis and the tube by tension
bars, acting in their interior by means of differential screws, and thus
drawing the cones in forcible contact with the spherical shell, which
forms the centre of the instrument.
    This instrument was erected in 1820, and its adjustments being
made,   it was subjected for two months to every species of trial to as
certain their permanence, which proving satisfactory, the regular se
ries of observations were commenced.
   These observations are stated at length in the tables attached to
this paper and forming part of       The right ascensions

 experiments,            an

   The great velocity with which electricity travels in conducting
bodies having been urged as an objection to this explanation, the
author combats this objection, on the ground that small differences
of electricity ought (from analogy with a fluid similarly circum
stanced,) to be equalized more slowly than great ones; and more
over, that by the disposition of the apparatus, extremely weak forces
being made to act constantly and for a long time, ought to produce
an effect much superior to that arising from the transient action of
each part.
   The author next proceeds to examine the action of screens inter
posed; and having first satisfied himself by direct experiments with
unelectrified metallic plates and needles, that currents of air driven
through a screen of muslin produced no sensible effects, he placed
a screen of coarse gauze between an electrified sealing-wax needle
and a revolving pewter plate, and to his surprise found a tendency to
motion in the needle, opposite to that of the plate; and though not
always produced, nor always to the same extent, this effect occurred
in seventeen out of twenty trials.
   The author then looked out for some method of increasing the in
equality of distribution of electricity on the metallic plate; he there
fore placed on the revolving apparatus, just under the metal plate, a
very small lighted lamp.     Several experiments made with this dispo
sition of the apparatus are related, without leading to any conclusion
as to the action exerted on the needle; and the author then proceeds
to consider what extraneous causes could have acted to produce the
small retrograde motions observed.      First, such causes are enume
rated as currents of air in the room,  in the box containing the appa
ratus; currents driven through the screen by rotation; currents of
heated air from the lamp; vibrations from the mechanism producing
the motion; torsion of the wire suspending, or electricity of the bridge
carrying, the needle; and flexure of the wax.
   Before relating the experiments made to elucidate each of these
disturbing causes, however, he proceeds to relate other experiments,
confirmatory of the fact of the retrograde motion, and of the influence
of the heat in producing it; after which, he describes a great variety
of experiments, made for the purpose of trying the effect of the pre
sence or absence of the disturbing causes; and concludes that none
of them, singly or combined, are adequate to produce the phenomena
observed.
   He then proceeds to state what appears to him to be their true
explanation, on the principles adopted respecting the non-instanta
neous communication of electricity; or at least to show that they are
not repugnant to those principles; or that, moreover, those principles
may in certain cases give rise to a retrograde motion, or to no mo
tion at all, or a direct one, according to the disposition of the appa
ratus; and that very trifling apparent differences in the latter respect
may give rise to  all the varieties   the phenomena.

Case of a Lady born blind, who received Sight at an advanced Age by
  the Formation of an artificial Pupil.    By James Wardrop, Esq.
  F.R.S. Edinb. Surgeon Ertraordinary to the King, &c. Communi

   Part    III.   p. 529.]
   The lady, the subject of this communication, shortly after her birth,
was perceived to be blind by a peculiar groping manner, and an ope
ration was therefore, at six months of her age, performed on both her
eyes; in consequence of which, she lost the whole globe of one, and
the pupil of the other became closed.     Her blindness, up to the forty
sixth year of her  age, was so  complete,  that she could barely distin
guish in sunshine, or in brightest moonlight, which way the light
came. This, however, being sufficient to indicate a sound state of
the nerve, three operations were successively performed on her eye
by the author, for removing a portion of the closed iris. They were
attended with but very slight inflammation, and proved successful in
imparting vision. A journal of her progress in the art of seeing, and
of her sensations, as expressed in her own words, from the first to
the forty-second day after the last operation, is given in the paper
before us.    She appears, up to that period, to have acquired but very
imperfectly, if at all, the power of directing her eye to any given
object; catching it only by repeated trials, and as it were searching
for it; nor was she at that time yet capable of rightly appreciating
the distances of objects.   Colours, however, forms, and relative situ
ations, in angular positions, were distinguished much earlier; the
former immediately, the latter after very short practice.      She ap
peared equally delighted and bewildered by her new sense; pleased
with gay colours and sparkling objects, but most profoundly and per
manently affected by the grand features of nature,       the clear blue
sky, the fields and trees.
   The author regards this case as instructive in many points, espe
cially in a physiological one, as showing the possibility of preserving
nervous sensibility unimpaired, during so very long a period of com
plete inaction.

comparison of his own final numbers.
   The second series of experiments were made at Port Bowen, where
the ships of the NorthWestern Expedition wintered from 1824 to 1825.
The observatory was erected near the harbour, 100 feet above the sea,
on secondary limestone, on a hard frozen soil, and the locality is very
minutely described. The apartment in which the observations were
conducted was thickly lined with fearnaught cloth.          At first it was
attempted to warm it by a stove; but the fluctuations of temperature
so produced proved too great, and the stove was therefore removed
outside, and the observatory warmed by the smoke-pipe; while the
whole apparatus was fenced from draughts of air and sudden change
of temperature by a large envelope of fearnaught lined with racoon
skins.    These precautions proved so effectual, that the total change
of temperature during the observation was seldom more than 3°, and
frequently not         1°,
                    from 50°; while                         by

                                                   observations.   They      of
commence with the first    experiments     Greenwich,       at
                                                       which continued
from the 20th      to
                   the 25th     April, 1824. The time here has been

larly made before and after each observation of coincidences, and is
followed by a table of the deduced rates of the former clock.
    Tables are next given of the observed coincidences, noting the
times of the disappearance and reappearance, and their mean for each
of ten coincidences, the arcs of vibration, the mean arc, the intervals
in seconds, and the corrections for the arcs of vibration; and summed
up at the end of each observation, so as to give the mean intervals;
the number of vibrations in 24 hours, as observed and as corrected
for the arc; the state of the barometer and thermometers is also
 given at the beginning and end of each observation, which were con
 tinued twice a day to the 25th. The whole of the observations are
 then summed up in one table, and these are then reduced for the
 rate of the clock, and presented together in a table of results; after
 taking the mean of which, the proper corrections for buoyancy and
 elevation above the level of the sea are applied to the result.
    The same system of registering is followed in the experiments at
 Port Bowen; only that here the observations of the transits by which
 the rate of the clock is determined are prefixed, and the hygrometric
 state of the atmosphere is also quoted in each observation of coinci
 dences.    The observations of coincidences set down in the first series
extend from June 14th to June 23rd, and were repeated four times a
day.   The rates of the clock, as deduced separately from the sun and
stars, are tabulated, and the results separately computed for each.
In each coincidence, the number of transit observations on which the
time depends, multiplied by the interval in days between them, is re
garded as a factor, and the sum of these factors is taken to express
the weight of the mean determination.      The mean of these determi
nations, according to their weight, is then taken, and the corrections
applied as usual for buoyancy, and for geological and local situation.
   The second series at Port Bowen extends from July 6 to July 10;

tain  Parry and the other officers of the North Western Expedition, in
the   years 1824 and 1825; and they embrace a variety of points of
prominent interest in the theory of magnetism.       They are digested
under separate heads, according as they refer to one or other of the
following points:—

In  the course of these observations, the fluctuating state of the di
rective energy was frequently rendered remarkably obvious, and in
one instance not only daily and hourly, but even momentary oscil

examine the intensity of the magnetism during those oscillations, in
which a corresponding fluctuation was detected, and that so rapid,
as to compensate itself during the time of the needle performing 60

copper and silver, in all proportions, have the same conducting powers
with each of those metals separately; while in alloys of tin and lead,
the heat evolved is a mean of that of the heats evolved from each
metal separately, taking into account the relative weights of each
metal present in the alloy.
   He observes, further, that very small quantities of alloy influence
materially the conducting power.       Thus he found that wires, drawn
from foreign gold coins, reputed to be very pure, conducted much
worse than when drawn from the same gold refined.
   The substitution of a flattened for a cylindrical wire, or the sepa
ration of the latter into four smaller wires, were found to have no
influence on the quantities of heat developed.

   The author commences this paper by stating the necessity of dis
tinguishing by separate appellations all such functions as measure
the intensity of physical properties, which he considers rendered ob
vious by a reference to the controversy respecting motion.            The
subject of this controversy, he observes, was the measure of motion
itself, it being contended on one hand that the motion of a body is

The Croonian Lecture for 1826. By              Sir Everard Home, Bart. V.P.R.S.
      Read November 16, 1826.                   [Phil. Trans. 1827, p. 39.]
    The author states the subject of this lecture to be, “an inquiry
into the mode by which the propagation of the species is carried on
in the common oyster, and the large fresh-water muscle.”
    After noticing the agreement of these animals, in the circumstance
of their ova becoming the nuclei on which pearls are formed, he ob
serves that they disagree in the process gone through before the
young is completely formed. The mode of propagation of the oyster
he regards as more simple than that of many plants; and the pro
cesses, as gone through in much shorter time.
    In describing the mode of breeding of the oyster, the author first
observes that we labour under considerable disadvantage in the in
 quiry in this country, from the prohibition of their sale during the
 spawning season; from which, however, he was relieved by a weekly
 supply of oysters from a private bed.                                            -
    He first describes the two ovaria, which he states to                 lie
                                                                    immediately

this theory requires.
    The author began           by
                            inquiring into the circulation        blood through     of
     lungs;        by              Mr. Russel    procured     injections
                                     of of
the           and      the aid                                              their                 of
veins and arteries, capable         being rendered objects           microscopic        of
investigation       by
                   Mr. Bauer.
    The first fact discovered was, that though             injection introduced
                                                                         an
by the pulmonary artery was found               return by the trunks                              of
                                                     in to
                                                                             the
pulmonary veins, yet, when thrown              by the veins,        does not re     it
turn by the arteries.
   The next fact ascertained was, that the distention           the air-cells           of
produces      interruption between the arterial and venal circulation,
               an
the blood being carried no. further than the small arterial branches
surrounding the air-cells.
   The author then proceeds          describe the air-cells and parts sur
                                          to
rounding them, from drawings made                        by
                                               Mr. Bauer. The branches
of the pulmonary artery, accompanied by larger and more numerous
branches      the pulmonary vein, are seen ramifying behind the in
               of
ternal membrane           of
                        each cell.   The latter have valves      regular                 at                in
tervals, and there are also numerous absorbents supplied also with
valves.   The injection was found         have stopped short
                                                to                the termi              of
nation    of
           the  artery,  and the   space beyond         filled with gas.
                                                                    to    be

the author proceeds        deduce his conclusions, which are unfavour
                               to
able to the received doctrine     simple decarbonization, conceiving the

structure thus developed        better adapted

the atmosphere, and transmit them                   to
                                           the heart.    He considers that
the carbonic  acid, detected   by  Professor  Brande,       urine and per      in
spirable matter, must have been formed               the blood circulating
                                                                    in
through the arteries, and have derived                   its
                                              oxygen from the lungs. He
considers, further, that the carbonic acid carried off        respiration,          in                     is
furnished from such venous blood         has acquired

                                          former occasion that soon after
that process has been begun, the oxygen employed                unites with        in   it
carbon.                                                                                            -
   He finally remarks that, for carrying        the functionson     life, and                of
for supplying  oxygen  and   removing   carbon,   respiration     necessary,             is

Remarks on a Correction of the Solar Tables required by Mr. South's
  Observations.  By G. B. Airy, Esq. M.A. Fellow of Trinity Col
  lege, Cambridge, and Lucasian Professor of Mathematics in the
  University of Cambridge.    Communicated by Dr. Young, F.R.S.,
  &c. Read February 15, 1827.      [Phil. Trans. 1827, p. 65.]
   The discordancies observed by Mr. South between the sun's right
ascension, as deduced from observation, and those given in the Nau
tical Almanac, follow a law so simple as not to allow of their being
regarded as errors of observation, or arising from any casual cause,
but justify usin attributing them to imperfections in the solar tables,
with the exception of three days, in which there seems to be some
ground to suspect error of computation.
   A single inspection of these discrepancies, Mr. Airy observes, suf
fices to show that they arise almost entirely from an error in the epoch,
and an error in the place of the perigee.       From the peculiar form of
the tables in Vince's  Astronomy,   which    give  great facility to the                        in
troduction of an error in the   excentricity,   he was induced at first to
suspect that one might exist; but on calculation found the error in
the equation of the centre so small as to be entirely insensible.        He
then proceeds to detail the process by which, from Mr. South's ob
servations, he has deduced the amount of the several errors, which
consist in regarding the epoch, the mean anomaly, and the equation
of the centre, as erroneous by three very small unknown quantities,
and forming as many equations of condition for determining them as
there are observations.   These combined and resolved, so as to give
the most probable result, lead to the conclusions, first, that the cor
rection of the equation of the centre is evanescent; secondly, that
the epochs of the sun must           all

body, which       this case was cylindrical annulus
                   in                                a   copper, about                  of                       1

revolve  during  the whole series    experiments,   with ofuniform velo                  an
city    five turns per second, exactly under the middle
        of                                                   the breadth                       of
of the annulus, being fixed vertically with their south poles upwards.
He assumes, first, that the action       each magnet may       of
                                                              referred                         be               to
a single point near                    its
                            extremity; secondly, that the action may

                                                  307
 also be referred to a single point or pole in the copper ring, some
what in arrear of the point vertically over the magnet, as a conse
quence of the principles proposed by other writers on the same sub
ject; and, lastly, that the mutual action of these poles on each other
is inversely as the 4th power of their distance. Assuming then a
formula with indeterminate co-efficients expressive of these condi
tions, and determining them by comparison of the assumed with the
observed forces, he finds that the effect of a variation of distance
from   # an inch to 2% (which causes a diminution of force from
1982.5 to 11.375, the ratio of nearly 200 to 1,) can be represented
within a 40th of the whole force, in the extreme case where the ob
servations are liable to the greatest errors, and in all other cases to
the 100th part of the force; so that he considers this law as esta
blished by experiment.       The same operations give the values of the
assumed   constants;    and it may be remarked that these agree very
nearly as deduced from different experiments, and that as a mean
result, we may state the distances of                        its
                                              pole from the extremity                                        of

Corrections to the Reductions of Lieutenant Foster's Observations on
  Atmospherical Refractions at Port Bowen ; with Addenda to the
  Table of Magnetic Intensities at the same Place.    By Lieutenant
  Henry Foster, R.N. F.R.S.        Read March 22, 1827.        [Phil.
  Trans. 1827, p. 122.]
   The error of which this paper contains a correction, consists in
the adoption of one exact second in arc, for the value of a division
of the long level of the repeating circle with which the observations
were made by the author for determining the amount of atmosphe
ric refraction at Port Bowen, an account of which is published in
the Transactions of the Royal Society for 1826, Part IV. ; whereas
the true value is 10".9 in arc. The error was discovered by Captain
Kater, who had occasion to use the instrument, and by him com
municated to the author, who immediately took measures to ascer
tain the fact; and having, in Captain Kater's presence, convinced
himself of          its

about two thirds of the length of the lower jaw backwards from the
symphysis, being a longitudinal slit a little within the lower edge
of the basis of the jaw, and through it exudes an unctuous substance
of the consistence of suet and the smell of musk. During warm
weather, when the animal feeds freely, the secretion is copious; but
in winter is much diminished in quantity, and less powerful in scent.
    The gland, on removing the integuments, is seen lying between the
skin and under-surface of the tongue. It consists of a simple follicle
or sac, of a blueish colour, and an elongated and pyriform shape. In
an alligator four feet in length, it is about half an inch long and one
sixth in diameter.     It is lined with a soft secreting membrane.
    The  gland  is enveloped by extremely fine, delicate, muscular
fibres, disposed obliquely, and consisting of two fasciculi, passing re
spectively over and under the gland, and uniting at its base into a
long slender round muscle, which, after making a slight curve for
wards, proceeds directly back to the corner of the os hyoides, to
which it is closely united; and following the course of another
muscle apparently identical with the mylo-hyoideus in mammifera.
The use of the muscle seems to be to bring the gland into a proper
position for discharging              its
                                 contents, and      operate such discharge

the other coated inside with a thin film of pounded charcoal.        The
latter was most affected.
   In a third experiment, a frame of glass threads, or fine wire, placed
vertically, was coated with a film of diluted white of egg, applied
with a broad hair brush, and kept constantly at the same tempera
ture by applying it fresh and fresh. Then, exposing a heated ball
on one side, and an air-thermometer on the other, no effect was sen
sible on the latter, when the temperature of the ball was low, but
when just invisible in the dark the effect was very sensible.
   The author also finds that this effect is greater than in the case of
glass, and that liquid screens are more permeable to heat than solid
ones. He also found that little difference of effect is observed whether
the screens be near to or far from the heated ball, catteris paribus;
and this he considers as demonstrating that the effect was not due
to secondary radiation from the screen.
On the Derangements of certain Transit Instruments by the effects of
  Temperature.   By Robert Woodhouse, A.M. F.R.S. &c. Read
  April 26, 1827. [Phil. Trans. 1827, p. 144.]
     In the Philosophical Transactions for 1825, the author alluded to
the derangement of the Cambridge transit instrument, arising from
unequal expansion of                  its
                        braces, establishing,       conceived, the             as   he

                                                 alter the passage over the
remaining wires nearly                   19

                                                the direction corresponding
to the  expansion              of
                        the braces.     Another observation, under more
favourable   circumstances,    gave    similar result; viz.
                                                 a                 seconds                    18               of
retardation.
     In
      another experiment the warm blankets were applied          the                                     to
upper western and lower eastern braces, when deviations appeared
to have taken place     the extent  to36, 29, and      of
                                                      seconds    the                27                   in
respective passages over the 5th, 6th, and 7th wires.
      another trial the passages over the three first wires were ob
     In

                                                       312
 served, and warm blankets were then applied to both the western
 braces, and a deviation to the west, though not above one third of
 that arising from their application to the alternate braces was the
 consequence, indicating the difference, not the sum, of the actions
in the two cases; and in this experiment it is very unlikely that the
two braces should have been equally heated.
    The next experiment was varied by observing the passage over the
 1st and 2nd wires, then warming the upper western brace, and ob
serving it on the 3rd, 4th, and 5th wires, allowing the instrument
to cool, then again warming the lower western brace to a yet greater
degree, and observing on the 6th and 7th wires.           The result was a
 deviation to the east, caused by the first warming, a return to      mean                                      its
 state, and then    deviation
                        a         the west from the second warming.
                                                 to
    The experiments were varied                        by
                                         holding the braces some time                                                    in
the hand, and with similar results.
    From these details, the author concludes that the partial heating
                                                them, deranges the Cam

 On some      of the Compounds of Chromium. By Thomas Thomson,
        M.D. F.R.S. L. and E. Professor of Chemistry, Glasgow. Read
        March 29, 1827.  [Phil. Trans. 1827, p. 159.]
  The principal object of this paper is to give an account of a sin
gular compound of chromic acid and chlorine, discovered some years
ago by the author; but in the investigations to which it gave rise, the
author was led to a more careful examination of the oxides of chro
 mium than they had before undergone, and to a knowledge of their
 composition.      An account of these researches he therefore proposes
 to  give in this communication.            He begins by describing metallic
 chromium.       That used     by  him was reduced by Mr. Cooper: it was
white, with a shade of yellow, very brittle, not sensibly attracted by
the magnet even in fine powder.                 Its specific gravity was 5'093.
Nitric acid boiled on it has no          effect,   and aqua regia scarcely any,
unless the action be        very  long   continued.       When heated, however,
with a mixture of      potash   and   nitre,  it is converted into chromic acid;
3:14   grains   of the  metal,    thus  treated,    yielded by solution and pre
cipitation 16:23 of chromate of lead, giving for the weight of an
atom of chromium 3.966, or in round numbers 4'000. The author's
stock of metallic chromium was so small as to prevent the repetition
of the experiment.              -
    The author next describes the green oxide of chromium. This is
easily produced by the action of de-oxygenizing agents, such as                                       al
cohol, sulphurous acid, or sulphuretted hydrogen, on chromate of
potash. When thus obtained it is in the state of a hydrate, contain
ing #ths of              its
                    weight        water, and easily soluble
                                      of                             acids.     moin         A
derate heat, however, expels the water, and leaves the oxide inso
luble      any acid. When further heated nearly
          in                                                     redness,  toglows,         it
or  becomes          of
                   itself  suddenly    intensely    red hot.     Its atomic  weight
cannot         be
             determined from            salts,  its   forms none,—at least cry
                                                                asit
stallizable and definite enough for the purpose; but                  we know that    as
of chromic acid        be 6'5, to    we can determine the number
                                           if                                 atoms         of
of  oxygen          to   be
                     abstracted       convert  to  into green oxide, that

latter will be known. To this end the author deoxidized the chro
mate      potash

                       sulphuretted hydrogen.            Hydrosulphuret        chro          of
mium, composed           its ingredients, atom

Rules and Principles for determining the dispersive Ratio of Glass;
  and for computing the Radii of Curvature for achromatic Object

   The author begins this paper by an enumeration of the various
works on the subject extant in our language, and a general mention
of the writings of foreign mathematicians, which he considers as
leaving room for further inquiry and simplification.         He then states
the method employed in his experiments for determining the refrac
tive and relative dispersive powers of his glasses, the former of which
is that generally known and practised;—of measuring the radii and
focal length of a lens, and thence deriving the refractive index; with
some refinements in                    its
                             practical application, consisting chiefly                                                       in

   Mr. Barlow next inquires into the validity of the empirical rule
employed by Mr. Tulley, as stated in Rees's Cyclopaedia, which in
many usual cases he finds to give results nearly agreeing with his
own computations; in others, however, it differs too widely to be
depended on.
   The author next enters on an experimental inquiry of the limits
within which an error in spherical aberration or dispersion may have
taken place without producing a sensible defect in the object-glass,
by procuring, with the assistance of Mr. Gilbert, glasses to be ground
to radii nearly, but not quite agreeing with the results of compu
tation. It results from them, that in some states of the data and
assumed radii, much greater deviations may be borne than in others,
and the author considers that such combinations should be preferred
as admit the greatest latitude in this respect.
   The author concludes this paper by a synoptic statement of a mode
of approximate solution applicable (in consequence of the peculiarity
of the formula for the destruction of the spherical aberration) to all
ordinary states of the data, and comprised in a very short and easily
calculable form; and by a method of practically determining the cur
vatures and indices of refraction of any given convex or concave lens.
On the Change in the Plumage of some Hen-Pheasants.   By William
  Yarrell, Esq. F.L.S.    Communicated by William   Morgan,  Esq.
  F.R.S., March 19, 1827. Read May 10, 1827. [Phil. Trans.
  1827, p. 268.]
   The last shooting season having been unusually productive of hen
pheasants, which have assumed more or less the plumage and ap
pearance of the male, much discussion in consequence has arisen on
the cause of this change; and the author having had many opportu
nities of examining the facts, both as respecting the pheasant and
domestic fowl, was induced to notice the internal peculiarities which
invariably accompany this transformation.     According to an opinion
of Mr.   J. Hunter and of Mr. Butter, this change only takes place
at an advanced age; but the author considers the facts in his posses
sion as at variance with this idea, and that the appearances in ques
tion may occur at any period of life, and may even be produced arti
ficially.
    In all the instances examined by him, the sexual organs were found
diseased, and to a greater or less extent in proportion to the change
of plumage. The ovarium was shrunk, purple, and hard; the ovi
duct diseased, and the canal obliterated at the upper part, imme
diately preceding  its  funnel-shaped enlargement          at
                                                       the bottom      of
                                                                     the
ovarium.      Having  openeda   hen-pheasant    in   its
                                                    natural plumage, for
the sake   of  comparison, he  founda  similar diseased state    the or
                                                                  of
gans  to   exist; thus proving that the disease must exist some time
before the corresponding   change    of   feathers takes place.

   \                                       3.18
   He then observes, that it is no uncommon thing to find, among
numerous broods of pheasants reared by hand, some females, which,
at the age of only four months, produce the brightest plumage of the
male; and in two instances of birds shot in a wild state, the nest
feathers had not been shed, proving them to have been birds of the
year.
  A     partridge, having a white bar across the breast, and the first
three  primary    feathers in each wing white, being opened, exhibited
the same sort of organic disease; and from circumstances adduced,
it appears that this was also a bird of the year.
   All variations in plumage, however, are not traceable to this cause.
In most of the excepted instances, however, the individuals are dwarf
birds, and the author attributes their variety of plumage to defective
secretion,-the effect of weakness.
   When the sexual organs are artificially obliterated in the common
fowl;—in the male bird, so soon as this operation is performed, he
ceases to crow; the comb and gills do not attain their full size; the
spurs remain short and blunt; and the feathers of the neck assume
an appearance intermediate between the hackled appearance of the
cock, and the ordinary web of the hen.       The operation on the female
being performed (by obliterating the oviduct), the ova cease to en
large; she makes an imperfect attempt to crow; the comb increases
in size; and short and blunt spurs make their appearance. The plu
mage also alters both in colour and form, and approaches that of the
cock; and the bones of the lower part of the back never acquire that
enlargement requisite for giving a proper breadth to the pelvis.       In
short, the two sexes by this process approximate so nearly in charac
                                                                     -
ter, that it is frequently difficult to determine the sex.
   In the case of hen-pheasants, they assume the plumage of the male
at best but imperfectly, and it is probable that they do not live many
years after the change.
   The author concludes by regarding it as a general law, that where
the sexes of animals are indicated by external characters, these un
dergo a change, and assume a neutral appearance whenever original
malformation, subsequent disease, or artificial obliteration, has de
prived these organs of their true influence.

          to           proceeded     he
                                    investigate the laws and amount

of   the deviation         so   arising.
  He distinguishes the action into three several cases:—
   1st. When the needle           any part is       on
                                                  the magnetic meridian    of                                              of
the ball.           In
                this case there          deviation caused
                                                     is   no    the primary                        by
of  the shell,  nor  any secondary   deflection  produced      deteriorating                      by
one pole        of
             the needle.
   2nd. When the needle            the magnetic equator
                                               is   in         the ball.                          of                       In
this case he   observed,  that whichever end        the needle    weakened      of                        is
approaches the ball.
               In
           every other position, one branch                                     of
                                                                                                                           if to
   3rd.                                              the needle    nearer                                 is
the centre          of
                 the ball than the other.     Here         observed, that            it   is
the near end     deteriorated, the needle approaches
                      is                                     natural mag                          its
netic situation;  but     the more
                                 if distant, then the reverse takes place;
and this  represents  the  general law     the phenomenon.         of
   From this law, Mr. Barlow         led     the explanation
                                                         is      the facts,
                                                                     to
                                                                                                        in of
on the principle     induced magnetism
                           of                 the shell; for            in
                                                                the second
case above enumerated, the equilibrium          the needle    produced by  of                      is
equal and opposite repulsions on                               its
                                          equal and equally magnetized
ends.    When, therefore, the repulsion on one end           weakened by                          is
deteriorating that end, that                        on
                                   the other obtains the   advantage,  and
the deteriorated end       drawn towards the ball.
                                     is
     In   the general case, the reasoning                          is   equally simple; and Mr. Bar
low shows that its results are precisely                                    those which observation
affords.
  These results             he
                     considers                           as decisive    favour  in that theory     of
which  regards the  magnetism                        of   an iron shell    induced   as    the
                                                                                                          in

                                in                   the observations                      of

                                          at         Greenwich, from

                                                    320
mean to sidereal time, and which was set down and calculated on
by Mr. Herschel in the paper drawn up by him, containing an account
of the operation and the results deduced, on the authority of official
communication with the Astronomer Royal.         This error falls on the
reduction of the single Greenwich observation of the 21st of July;
and though partly compensated by an opposite error of three tenths
of a second committed by Mr. Herschel himself in the reduction of
that day's observations, is still sufficient to account for and correct
the great and perplexing deviation of that day's results from those of
the other three days in which only the signals proved successful.
   The effect of Mr. Henderson's correction        therefore,    redeem     is,                 to

On the Effects produced upon the Air Cells of the Lungs when the
  Pulmonary Circulation is too much increased. By Sir Everard Home,

   In examining    the air cells of the lungs of a hare that had been
coursed, the author found the superficial large cells filled with colour
less coagulable lymph, forming white specks, and the smaller, more
interior ones filled with coagula of red blood.        No such appearance
was seen in the     lungs   of  hares, snared or shot.    A run of fifteen
minutes with greyhounds so exhausts the hare, that it is frequently
known to die from over exertion before the dogs are able to reach
it.  To examine the state          the lungs,

be excited when the surfaces of two metals, instead of touching at
one point, were in symmetrical contact throughout, the author first
employed a compound ring of bismuth and copper, the copper out
wards, and he found that to whatever point heat was applied, mag
netic powers were developed, a needle being affected differently,
according to the different positions in which the ring was placed with
regard to          it.

the three great divisions, viz. the saccharine, the oily, and the albu
minous, in which the alimentary matters employed by the more per
fect animals may be comprehended; and afterwards to inquire into
the changes induced in them by the action of the stomach and other
organs, during the subsequent stages of assimilation.
    The present paper includes some preliminary observations on the
analysis of organized bodies in general, and the composition of the
first of the above classes, viz. the saccharine.
    After an historical sketch of the principles and progress of the
 analysis of organized substances, the author makes some remarks on
the difficulties attending the use of oxide of copper as now employed.
 He observes that it is not only hygrometric, but, like many other
powders, also condenses air. He likewise found, that when the ox
ide was removed from the tube in which the combustion had been
 effected, and retriturated, and reburnt (as in most instances was
 necessary), it almost invariably gained, instead of losing, weight; a
 circumstance which he ascribes to the combination of the oxygen of
the air contained in the tube, with the partially reduced oxide of
 copper.     These sources of error, from their variable and uncertain
 character, he found it impossible to ascertain, and was at length
 obliged to adopt another principle.
     When a substance composed of hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen, is
 burnt in a given quantity of oxygen gas, one of three things must
 happen; either the volume of the gas will not be changed, in which
 case the hydrogen and oxygen must exist in the substance, in the
 proportion in which they form water; or, secondly, the volume may
 be increased, in which case the oxygen must exceed that proportion;
 or, lastly, it may be diminished, when the hydrogen must predomi
 nate. These well-known facts the author has taken advantage of for
 determining the composition of vegetable substances, and proceeds
 to describe the apparatus he employed for that purpose, which con
 sists essentially of accurately graduated syphon gasometers, placed at
 a convenient distance from one another, so that they may be readily
 connected by means of an intermediate tube, in which the substance
 to be analysed is introduced.      Heat is applied to this tube by means
 of a spirit-lamp, and the oxygen gas transferred, by means of mer
 cury, from one gasometer to another, through the ignited tube. After
the operation, the difference of volume, as compared with that of the
 oxygen originally employed, shows the composition of the substances.
The author then details some precautions necessary to be observed in

that when     a  crystallized     substance passes into the organized state,

that the    only  difference that can           traced           be

this law, and renders theory inapplicable; while experiment, as the
author remarks, has not yet supplied the defect.
   The author devotes the first part of his paper to a consideration of
the experiments made by Bossut and other members of the French
Academy in 1776, 1778, and by the London Society for the Improve
ment of Naval Architecture in 1793 and 1798.          Both these sets of
experiments he regards as inconclusive, partly from the small size of
the floating body and the small velocities used, but chiefly from the
inadequacy of the means of measuring the actual resistance, and the
sources of error arising from the rigidity of the cords used, the fric
tion of pulleys, and that of the line itself dragged through the water,
the moving power being a weight suspended and descending uni
formly.
   In the experiments which form the object of this paper, all these
sources of error (which, in some cases, amounted to three times the
resistance to be measured,) were avoided by the simple contrivance
of estimating the strain exerted on the boat, at every instant, by a
spring weighing machine immediately attached to          through which             it,
the tension       of
                 the cord was     course transmitted, and which mea

                                  329
Greenwich, since the erection of the new transit instrument, and as
computed by the solar tables of Delambre, which are used in the
computation of the Nautical Almanac; with a view to the discovery
of the errors in the elements of those tables. The number of obser
vations from which this comparison was made is 1212, and they ex
tend, with an interruption of only three months, from the end of
July 1816 to the end of the year 1826. The result of the compari
son at first indicated the necessity of a correction of the epochs of
the sun's longitude, and of the longitude of the perigee, and per
haps also of the equation of the centre.   But upon pursuing the ex
amination through a series of years, it became manifest that some
other source of irregularity existed, and that this could be no other
than an erroneous estimate of the masses of some of the planets, es
pecially of Venus and of Mars. A more critical examination showed,
that there was also an error in the assigned mass of the moon.
   The author proceeds to state the process by which he arrived at
the determination of the amount of these several corrections. It was
found necessary in these investigations to take into account an error
which occurred in the tables with regard to the secular motion.     It
results from his researches, that the epochs for 1816 and those for
1821 to 25 ought to be increased respectively by 4".734 and 5'-061;
that of the perigee increased by 46"-3, and the greatest equation of
the centre diminished by 0"-84. The mass of Venus should be re
duced in the proportion nearly of 9 to 8, and that of Mars nearly in
the proportion of 22 to 15. On a comparison of these results with
those which have been derived from an examination of some of Dr.
Maskelyne's observations, as given by Burkhardt in the Connaissance
des Tems for 1816, they are found on the whole to agree in the most
satisfactory manner. The principal discordance occurs in the correc
tion of the place of the perigee; a discordance which the author
thinks may arise either from want of correctness in the calculation of
the term in the motion of the perigee, depending on the square of
the time, or, what is more probable, from some undiscovered ine
quality in the formula, which is a function of the sun's mean lon
gitude.
Experiments to determine the Difference in the Length of the Seconds
   Pendulum in London and in Paris.       By Captain Edward Sabine,
   of the Royal Artillery, Secretary of the Royal Society. Communi
   cated by Thomas Young, M.D., Foreign Secretary to the Royal
   Society, and Secretary to the Board of Longitude. Read November
   15, 1827. [Phil. Trans. 1828, p. 35.]
   The author commences this paper by a brief statement of the ex
isting state of the determinations of standards of length in the two
countries; and he observes an attempt made by M. Arago in 1817
and 1818, to bring into immediate comparison the standards of the
two countries, proved inconclusive from the rates of the pendulums
not having been obtained with sufficient exactness.

                                   330
    The author having obtained from His Grace the Master-general of
 the Ordnance a general leave of absence from his military duties so
long as he could be usefully employed in scientific pursuits, conceived
he could no way satisfy the condition better than in carrying into
 effect this purpose.    Accordingly, being provided with two pendu
 lums, one made for M. Schumacher, another the property of the
Board of Longitude, he set out for Paris, whither the pendulums were
forwarded to him.
    The comparison was made in Paris at the Royal Observatory, in
 the Salle de la Méridienne, on the spot in which M. Biot's measure
ment had been made, and every proper facility and assistance afforded
him. The coincidence-clock was compared every 12" by M. Mathieu
with the transit-clock of the Observatory.     On the 27th of April, the
weather having set in mild and steady, the experiments were begun.
The results are stated in the form of appended tables, of which a de
tailed account is given. Table I. contains the daily rate of the clock
used for the coincidences. Table II. contains the particulars of thir
teen distinct determinations of the rate of the pendulum No. 8. ; four
by M. Mathieu ; four by M. Nicollet; three by the author; one by
 Messrs. Nicollet and Savary conjointly; and one by M. Savary and
the author.     They are corrected as usual. Table III. contains the
results of thirteen similar determinations of the rate of the pendulum
No. 7, in which the author was also assisted by Messrs. Freycinet and
Duperrey.
    Each of the pendulums, when not used in observing coincidences,
was employed in determining its rate by a journeyman-clock or coun
ter, a method used by Messrs. Freycinet and Duperrey, but which
the author thinks inferior to that of coincidences, though capable of
giving good results. The particulars of these are given in Tables IV.
and V. From all these experiments in conjunction, it appears that
the numbers of vibrations performed in a mean solar day at Paris (re
duced as usual) by the two pendulums, were respectively 85922:06
and 85933:83.
    The pendulums and apparatus were re-conveyed to London early in
 September by water, and the rates again determined at Mr. Browne's
house in Portland Place, by means of that gentleman's excellent
clocks, and transit observations made by Captain Sabine.       The pre
cautions used are fully detailed, and the observations, which are also
appended in a tabular form in Tables III, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, the
author being assisted by M. Quetelet, of Brussels.       They give as a
final result 85933°29 and 85945'85 for the numbers of vibrations re
spectively, made by each in a mean solar day, similarly reduced for
London.
    As a final result of the whole operation, the author regards 12":00
as the acceleration of the seconds pendulum in passing from Paris to
London. The same acceleration deduced from a comparison of M.
Biot's and Captain Kater's direct measurements of the seconds pen
dulum, in Paris and in London, comes out 11:76, or, conversely, the
length of the seconds pendulum observed by the former in London

                                            331
transferred to Paris by an assumed retardation of 12", gives a length
differing from M. Biot's by 0.00023.     Borda's agrees within 0-00079
with M.   Biot's, and Captain Kater's, so transferred, holds very nearly
a mean between the two, but approaches rather nearer to Biot's than
to Borda's.
On the Measurement of High Temperatures. By James Prinsep, Esq.
  Assay Master of the Mint at Benares.       Communicated by Peter
  Mark  Roget,  M.D. Secretary of the Royal   Society. Read Decem
  ber 13, 1827.  [Phil. Trans. 1828, p. 79.]
   The author, after adverting to the many abortive endeavours of
former experimentalists to obtain instruments for the accurate ad
measurement of high temperatures, and after suggesting doubts as
to the confidence to which Wedgwood’s pyrometer is entitled, de
scribes several attempts of his own to effect this very desirable object.
In the course of his inquiries, a remarkable fact presented itself to his
notice in the change which occurred in an index constructed on the
compensation principle, and formed by two slips of metal, the one of
silver and the other of gold, originally quite pure, and united with
out any alloy. In the course of a few years, although it had never
been subjected to a heat above that of melting lead, the whole sur
face of the gold became converted into an alloy of silver, the impreg
nation extending gradually to a considerable depth in the gold, and
 destroying the sensibility of the instrument to changes of tempera
ture. After trying various plans, he gave the preference to one
founded on the following principles: namely, that the fusing points
 of the pure metals are fixed and determined; that those of the three
 noble metals, namely, silver, gold, and platina, comprehend a very
 extensive range of temperature; and that between these three fixed
 points in the scale, as many intermediate ones as may be required
 may be obtained by alloying the three metals together in different
 proportions.      When such a series of alloys has been once prepared,
 the heat of   any   furnace may be expressed by the alloy of least fusi
 bility which it is capable of melting. The determinations afforded
 by a pyrometer of this kind will, independently of their precision,
 have the advantage of being identifiable at all times and in             coun          all
 tries: the smallness      the apparatus

cessive addition of 10 per cent. of gold to the silver, the fusion of
which, when pure, marks the point of zero; while that of gold is
reckoned at ten degrees.     If minuter subdivisions were required for
particular objects of research, these might easily be made, following
always the decimal series. From the point of fusion of pure gold to
that of pure platina, the author assumes 100 degrees, adding to the
alloy which is to measure each in succession 1 per cent. of platina.
Whether these hypothetical degrees represent equable increments of
temperature is a question foreign to the purpose of this paper, and
must be the subject of future investigation.    The author then enters
into a detailed account of the method he employed for insuring ac
curacy in the formation of the requisite series of alloys, and of various
experiments undertaken to ascertain their fitness as measures of high
temperatures.    The determinations of the heats of the different fur
naces adapted to particular objects, are given in a tabular form. The
remaining portion of the paper contains the recital of the author's
attempts to determine by means of an apparatus connected with an
air thermometer, the relation which the fusing point of pure silver
bears to the ordinary thermometric scale.    An extensive series of ex
periments, of which the results are given in a table, were made with
this apparatus. From the data thus afforded, after making the ne
cessary corrections, the author deduces the following results in degrees
of Fahrenheit; viz. A full red heat 1200°, orange heat 1650°, melt
ing point of silver (which had been estimated by Wedgewood at
4717°, and by Daniell at 2233°) 1830°; of silver alloyed with one
tenth gold 1920°.

ployed.
On Captain Parry's and Lieutenant Foster's Eaperiments on the Velo
  city of Sound.  By Dr. Gerard Moll, Professor of Natural Philo

   Henry Kater, V.P.R.S.       Read January 17, 1828.             [Phil. Trans.

   In this paper the author institutes a comparison between the re
sults of the experiments on the velocity of sound made by Captain
Parry and Lieutenant Foster in the arctic regions, and those deduced
from the theoretical formula of Laplace.         At the temperature of
 —17°72 of Fahrenheit, and with a barometric pressure of 29.936
inches, the mean result of      allthe observations gave       velocity
                                                                  a              of
 1036-19 feet per second. With the same data, this velocity, by
calculation according   tothe formula      Laplace, would
                                              of                1017-72;
                                                                  be
differing from the observed velocity        by
                                             17:47 feet   only.   Similar
comparisons   ofparticular observations, which are selected         being  as
made under favourable      circumstances,   with the deductions from
theory, are made   bythe author with but little variation     in
                                                              the results.
From the whole investigation,     hedraws the conclusion, that        very  in
high latitudes, where the cold  is very intense, the data         on
                                                                which the

                                     333
calculations are founded are more uncertain than at ordinary tempe
ratures; thus confirming the opinion of Laplace, who says, in speaking
of these differences, “ qu’elles paraissent étre dans les limites des
petites erreurs dont cette expérience, et les élémens du calcul, dont
j'ai fait usage, sont encore susceptibles.” The author shows by an
elaborate calculation, that the influence of moisture in the atmosphere
 on the velocity of sound must at these two temperatures be quite
 trifling, not amounting in any case to more than a few inches in a
 second; and that this element may therefore be safely neglected in
the computation.     He next proceeds to compare the experiments of
 the northern navigators with those of Dr. Van Beck and himself, and
 also those of other observers, adverting to their general agreement;
 which, he observes, is sufficiently satisfactory to warrant the conclu
 sion, that whatever difference may still be found to exist between
 computation and observation, is rather to be ascribed to some imper
 fection in the theoretical formula, than to any fault or negligence in
 the observers. He concludes by remarking the strong testimony
 which Captain Parry's observations afford of his exemplary accuracy,
 amidst the great difficulties with which, from the circumstances in
 which he was placed, he had generally to contend.
An Account of a Series of Experiments made with a view to the Con
  struction of an achromatic Telescope with a fluid concave Lens, in
  stead of the usual Lens of Flint Glass. In a Letter addressed to Da
  vies Gilbert, Esq. M.P. President of the Royal Society.      By Peter
  Barlow, Esq. F.R.S. &c. Read January 17, 1828. [Phil. Trans.
   1828, p. 105.]
   The idea of constructing achromatic telescopes with fluid lenses
was first suggested to the author by the attempt of Messrs. Gilbert
to apply to practice the principles and rules for the construction of
aplanatic object-glasses, laid down by Mr. Herschel in the Philoso
phical Transactions for 1821.        In following these suggestions, the
author became sensible of the difficulty of obtaining flint glass of
sufficient size and purity for astronomical telescopes; and was thence
led to consider the possibility of substituting some fluid in place of
flint glass. Dr. Blair had, many years ago, succeeded in making very
perfect telescopes of this description, but he still retained the use of
flint glass. Among the various fluids adapted to this optical purpose,
the author gave a decided preference to the sulphuret of carbon,
which combines properties of perfect transparency and freedom from
colour, with a refractive index nearly equal to that of flint glass, and
with a dispersive power more than double, properties which it appears
to retain under       all
                       the temperatures    to which     it likely
                                                             is       to exbe
posed  in   anastronomical telescope. After several trials, Mr. Barlow
determined the best method       of  confining this fluid, but was     at
                                                                        first

ber of double stars of the class which Sir William Herschel has
pointed out as tests of a good 3%-inch refractor.     Encouraged by his
success, he again attempted a 6-inch object-glass, with a different
manner of adjusting and securing the lenses, and considers the result
of his endeavour as proving at least the practicability of the construc
tion. This instrument, with a power of 143, shows the small star in
Polaris so distinct and brilliant, that     transit might          its

seen through the telescope, resembles one of the brighter portions of
the milky way; of the nebula major, which is brighter, more irre
gular, and composed of a great number of different parts; and of the
dark space on the east side of the cross, or the black cloud, as it is
called, which is occasioned by the almost total absence of stars.       It
is remarked by the author, that neither of the two nebulae, major and
minor, are at present in the place assigned to them by La Caille.
He finds also that scarcely any nebulae exist in a high state of con
densation, and very few even in a state of moderate condensation
towards the centre.       Some have bright points in or near the centre,
many of which may be stars; but the greater number of the nebulae
appear only as condensations of the general nebulous matter into
faint nebulae of various forms and magnitudes, generally not well de
fined; while many of the larger nebulous appearances are resolvable
into stars of small magnitudes.       But whether nebulae are universally
thus   resolvable,  is a question of which our instruments are yet in
competent to afford a direct solution, and in the discussion of which
we have only analogy as our guide.
An Account of Trigonometrical        Operations in the Years 1821, 1822,
    and 1823, for determining the Difference of Longitude between the
    Royal Observatories of Paris and Greenwich.        By Captain Henry
    Kater, V.P.R.S. Read January 31, and February 7, 1828. [Phil.
    Trans. 1828, p. 153.]
    The first section of this paper contains a narrative of the pro
 ceedings of the Commission appointed for executing the object an
nounced in the title.
    The first trigonometrical operations for connecting the meridians of
 Paris and Greenwich were carried on by General Roy, in coopera
tion with Messrs. de Cassini, Mechain, and Legendre, in the year
 1790, an account of which was published in the Philosophical Trans
 actions of that year.     In 1821, the Royal Academy of Sciences, and
 Board of Longitude at Paris, communicated to the Royal Society of
 London their desire that these operations should be repeated, and the
 following Commissioners were nominated by these scientific bodies
for that purpose; namely, Messrs. Arago and Mathieu, on the part
 of the Academy of Sciences; and Lieutenant-Colonel Colby and Cap
 tain Kater, on the part of the Royal Society.
    The instrument employed in these operations was the great theo
 dolite of Ramsden, belonging to the Royal Society, and the same
 which had formerly been used by General Roy.
    It was at first proposed to adopt as a base, some one of the distances
 given by the trigonometrical survey of Great Britain, and to connect
 it with General Roy's stations; but it was found that the guns and
 wooden pipes, which had marked these stations, had been either re
 moved or lost, so that the exact stations could not be immediately
 ascertained.     The signals used for connecting the stations upon the
 coasts of   England     and France were lamps with compound lenses,

                                                    336
constructed under the direction of M. Fresnel.     These lenses were
3 feet in diameter, and were composed   of numerous pieces; the light
they gave far exceeded that of any of our lighthouses, appearing at
the distance of 48 miles, like a star of the first magnitude.  Staffs
were also erected near the lamps, but these were only occasionally
visible.
   These lamps were placed under the care of proper attendants on
stations selected upon Fairlight Down and near Folkstone Turnpike,
and the observers then crossed the Channel on the 24th of Septem
ber 1821, and stationed themselves at Blancnez.    Their observations
were for some time retarded by tempestuous weather, but were com
pleted on the 7th of October.    They then removed to Montlambert,
a fort situated on a height near Boulogne, where a further delay oc
curred in consequence of an accident that had happened to the lamp
at Fairlight. On the 14th they returned through Calais to Fairlight.
Here they at length succeeded in discovering the wooden pipe by
which General Roy had marked his station, and which had been bu
ried 4 feet deep in the earth. In order to preserve this point, a mill
stone, having the words “Roy's Station” cut upon           was placed                  it,
level with the surface     the ground,   of                    its
                                           centre being precisely over
the centre      the pipe.

   The  party  next proceeded    Folkstone; andto    order    carry on      in               to
the series towards London, stations were selected on Stede Hill and
Wrotham Hill, which were connected with Folkstone by                   interme               an
diate point      Tolsford Hill, from which the stations
                     on                                             the French         on

   In July of the next year, 1823, the theodolite belonging to the
 Ordnance was placed at the station at Chingford, and the series of
observations, which had been left imperfect the preceding autumn,
were completed.      Pains were taken by sinking stones of proper size,
with the word “station” marked upon them, and also by observing
the angles formed by steeples and other permanent objects in the     vi
cinity, to preserve the identity of the stations, for the use of future
                                           -
observers.
   In the second section, an account is given of the methods of com
putation that were adopted. The methods which have been employed
for geodetical calculations, may be reduced to three;—the first con
sists in considering the observed triangles as spherical triangles, of
which the sides are to be computed by spherical trigonometry; the
second is to deduce from the spherical angles, the angles formed by
the chords, and thus reduce the spherical triangle to a plane triangle;
the third consists in deducting from each of the observed spherical
angles, one third of the spherical excess, which reduces the triangle
to a plane triangle, in which the computations may be made by plane
trigonometry. This last method, devised by Le Gendre, and which
is recommended by its elegance and simplicity, was the one employed
on the present occasion.
   The third section comprises the details of the observations of the
several triangles, and the computations made from them of the actual
distances of the several stations.    As the standard of linear measure
employed by General Roy for the measurement of the base upon
Hounslow Heath differs by a small fraction from the Imperial stand
ard yard, it was found necessary to add 5'82 feet as a correction
to that distance.    Corresponding corrections to all General Roy's
measurements     may  be obtained by using the constant multiplier of
 •0000691.
   The fourth section is occupied with computations of the distances
from the meridian, and from the perpendicular to the meridian of
Greenwich.
   The fifth section contains the investigations of the latitudes and
longitudes  of the several stations.   In these computations the ellip
ticity of the earth has been assumed at one 300dth, as being nearly
the mean between ºn and riºr, the limits between which the ellip
ticity is generally supposed to be comprised.
   The sixth section contains remarks on the observations of the pole
star for determining the direction of the meridian, showing the small
degree of reliance to which, with reference to that object, such ob
servations are entitled, and also on the determination of the length
of the degree upon a circle perpendicular to the meridian, which is
liable to similar causes of error.
   The seventh section is on the measurement of the heights of the
stations above the level of the sea; and the influence of terrestrial
refraction on the accuracy of these measurements.
   As the results of M. Arago's observations in France have not yet
been published, the longitude of Calais must be taken, as given in the

Abstract of a Meteorological Journal kept at Benares during the Years
  1824, 1825, and 1826.      By James Prinsep, Esq. Assay Master of
  the Mint at Benares.    Communicated by Peter Mark Roget, M.D.
   Secretary of the Royal Society. Read January 25, 1828.       [Phil.
  Trans. 1828, p. 251.]
   The registers, of which the monthly results are presented in a
tabular form, contain an account of the states of the barometer,
thermometer, the air hygrometer, the wet bulb hygrometer, the de
grees of aqueous tension, amount of evaporation, quantity of rain,
wind, and other circumstances relating to the weather at Benares
during three successive years. The author states it as his opinion,
that the diurnal oscillations of the barometer, as well as the monthly
variations, are dependent on the alterations of the specific gravity of
the air from changes in                   its
                             temperature; the operations    which may                                of
be  traced with much greater distinctness     Benares than     the more    at                         in

   The author next gives the results of some experiments with a col
limator made for Captain Foster, having a float of only 5 inches in
diameter, and with a telescope 5 inches long; the errors generally do
not amount to more than 1%,ths of a second.
   He then enters into details as to the manner of using the vertical
floating collimator in astronomical observations, beginning with the
portable azimuth and altitude circle, described by the Rev. F.                                      Wol
laston in his Fasciculus Astronomicus, and applicable to other similar
instruments.     The new collimator affords also the most perfect me.
thod of  adjusting the line of collimation of a mural circle or of placing
it at right angles to the axis.
   The author next proceeds to describe the method of applying the
instrument to the zenith telescope. In comparing the observations
made by the zenith sector, belonging to the Board of Ordnance, with
the zenith telescope used in conjunction with the vertical floating col
limator, the mean of errors in the former case was--0"'54 and—0"-75;
in the latter--0":44 and—0"-66. From observations made on y Dra
conis, the zenith distance of which at Greenwich is 0° 2' 6"-36, and
at York Gate 0° 0' 35".67; the difference of latitude between the two
places was found to be 0°2'42"-03; that of Greenwich being 51°
 28'38".96, and of York Gate 51° 31' 20".99. The decimals of a se
cond, by the azimuth and altitude circle and the horizontal floating
collimator, were 94; by the same instrument and the vertical floating
collimator, '76; and by the zenith telescope, and the vertical floating
collimator, '92: the mean being ‘9.
   From the greater degree of precision attainable by the employment
of the vertical floating collimator, from the facility of     construction,        its
                             its
                       application, and the time saved by using                                     it,

A    Comparison       of   the Changes   of Magnetic Intensity throughout the
     Day in the Dipping and Horizontal Needles, at Treurenburgh Bay
     in Spitsbergen.  By Captain Henry Foster, R.N. F.R.S. Read
     May 8, 1828. [Phil. Trans. 1828, p. 303.]
   The observations made by the author at Port Bowen in 1825, on
the diurnal changes of magnetic intensity taking place in the dip
ping- and horizontal-needles, appeared to indicate a rotatory motion
of the polarizing axis of the earth, depending on the relative posi
tion of the sun, as the cause of these changes.         By Capt. Foster's
remaining at Spitzbergen, during the late Northern Voyage of Dis
covery, a favourable opportunity was afforded him of prosecuting this
inquiry.     Instead of making observations with a single needle, vari
ously suspended, as had been done at Port Bowen, two were em
ployed,—the one adjusted as a dipping-needle, and the other sus
pended horizontally.      The relation between the simultaneous inten
sities of the two needles could thus be ascertained, and inferences
deduced relative to the question whether a diurnal variation in the
dip existed as one of the causes of the observed phenomena, or
whether, the dip remaining constant, they were occasioned by a
change in the intensity.
    The dipping-needle used was one belonging to the Board of Lon
gitude, and made by Dollond. Both this and the horizontal-needle
were made in the form of parallelopipedons, each 6 inches long, 0.4
broad, and 0.05 thick.       The experiments were continued from the
30th of July to the 9th of August; and were so arranged, that in
the course of two days an observation was made every hour in the
four-and-twenty; that           is,
                               part       of
                                       them     one day and another part
                                                     in
in  the other   day.
   The observations on the horizontal-needle were made            the fol
                                                                     in
lowing manner:—after being freely suspended                by

vested      torsion, the needle was turned somewhat more than 40° out
           of
of  the magnetic meridian, and the oscillations counted only when the
arc   ofvibration had decreased      40°.to  The times    performing ten

                                                the instrument were also
registered.     The oscillations         of
                                     the dipping-needle were taken         as
follows: one hundred with the face              of
                                            the instrument east, previous
to those    ofthe horizontal-needle being observed; and another hun
dred after the latter, with the face west,--a process which gives the
mean time        observation nearly the same for both needles.
                 of                                                    Two

the two needles, it appears that at the time when an increase took
place in the intensity of the dipping-needle,       that of the horizontal
needle underwent a corresponding diminution, and vice versa.            On
comparing these results with the hypothesis of a rotation of the ge

on the power of the telescope, and thence computes the correspond
ing change in the refractive index of the fluid. The result is the
amount of adjustment already stated. The correction for angular
measurements was the 60th part of a second in every minute, for
every degree of thermometric change; a quantity, Mr. Barlow ob
serves, which is too small to deserve notice, except in cases of ex
treme delicacy. The dispersions at 31° and at 84° are in the ratio of
3067 to 3084.     The change in the refractive index between 32° and
212°, supposing it to increase uniformly, would be about one tenth
of the whole,_a proportion which is very nearly the same as the
actual expansion of the fluid.     Hence it is considered as probable,
that in this and all other  expansible fluids, the index of refraction
varies directly as the density.   On the other hand it would appear,
that the dispersive ratio remains, at                          all
                                         temperatures, constantly the
Same.

swarm had issued, and proceeded directly to the one which had just
settled, and instantly united with them.    The author is led from
these and other facts to conclude that such unions of swarms are ge
nerally, if not always, the result of previous concert and arrange
ment.
   The author proceeds to mention some circumstances which induce
him to believe that sex is not given to the eggs of birds, or to the
spawn of fishes or insects, at any very early period of their growth.
Female ducks, kept apart from any male bird till the period of laying
eggs approached, when a musk drake was put into company with
them, produced a numerous offspring, six out of seven of which
proved to be males.
   The mule fishes found in many rivers where the common trout
abounds, and where a solitary salmon is present, are uniformly of the
male sex; hence the spawn must have been without sex at the time
it was deposited by the female.
   The author states that he has also met with analogous circum
stances in the vegetable world, respecting the sexes of the blossoms
of monoecious plants.    When the heat is excessive, compared with
the quantity of light which the plant receives, only male flowers ap
pear; but if the light be in excess, female flowers alone are pro
duced.
On the Laws of the Deviation of Magnetized Needles towards Iron.
  By Samuel Hunter Christie, Esq. M.A. F.R.S. &c. Read June 5,
  1828.  [Phil. Trans. 1828, p. 325.]
   The author had pointed out, several years ago, the law of devi
ation of a magnetized needle, (either freely suspended or constrained
to move in any particular plane,) from its natural position, by the in
fluence of masses of iron in             its
                                     vicinity. This law was founded on
the  hypothesis   that the iron attracted both the poles                  of
                                                                 the needle:
the position     ofwhich, resulting from this action, might             deter      be
mined by that       of   imaginary minute magnetic needle, freely sus

bodies those which have the least attraction for that fluid, and being
the best conductors for                        it,
                                are entirely passive during its transit
through them.                In
                     confirmation                         of
                                      these views, the author describes

                                    351
experiments in which the electric spark was found to have penetrated
through the side of a glass globe blown to an extreme degree of thin
ness. An electric jar, from which the air had been partially ex
hausted, could not be made to receive as high a charge as when the
contained air was of the usual density, and when entirely exhausted
could not be charged in any sensible degree; when filled with con
densed air on the other hand, it retained a higher charge than before.
The heated and consequently rarefied air surrounding a red-hot iron
rod is found to conduct electricity with great facility. The same
property is observed in the flame from a blowpipe, which may be re
garded as a hollow cone containing highly rarefied air; as also, in
a larger scale, in that of a volcano. Sir H. Davy had concluded from
his experiments on voltaic electricity, that the conducting powers of
metals are diminished by heat; but Mr. Ritchie infers from several
experiments which bear more directly upon the question, that the
metals afford no exception to the general law, that in all bodies heat
increases the conducting powers; and explains the apparent anomaly
in Sir H. Davy's experiments, by the dissipation of the electricity by
the rarefied air surrounding the heated metals, which were used as
conductors.    He concludes his paper by describing an experiment
which   appears  to establish, in respect to this law, a striking analogy
between the electric and magnetic influences.
 On Magnetic Influence in the Solar Rays. By Samuel Hunter Christie,
    Esq. M.A. F.R.S. &c. Read June 19, 1828. [Phil. Trans. 1828,
   p. 379.]
    From the experiments described by the author in a former paper,
it  appeared that a magnetized needle vibrated under exposure to the
sun's rays, came to rest sooner than when screened from their          in
fluence; that a similar effect was produced on a needle of glass or
 of copper, but that the effect on the magnetized needle greatly ex
 ceeded that upon either of the others.     In the prosecution of this in
 quiry, the author has endeavoured to vary the experiments so as to
 obviate several causes of inaccuracy which might tend to invalidate
the general conclusions he had before drawn. His first object was
 to compare the effects of the solar rays on an unmagnetized steel
 needle with one that was magnetized under the same circumstances;
 and the result was, that the latter was influenced in a more consi
 derable degree than the former; and a similar difference was ob
 served when the vibrations of a magnetized needle were compared
 with those of a needle made of glass or of copper.        He ascertained
 that the diminution of the terminal arc of vibration, on exposure to
 the sun, was not occasioned merely by the heat imparted to the
needles or surrounding medium, although this cause appeared in some
instances to measure the intensity of the action which produced the
 diminution. In order to determine the comparative influence of the
 separate rays, he allowed them to fall on the needles after transmis
 sion through   differently coloured fluids and glasses; but owing to

                                    352
 want of opportunity, he was obliged to abandon the inquiry before
 arriving at any determinate results: though as far as they went, they
 appeared to confirm the conclusion that the effects were dependent
 on the degree of light, and not on that of the heat. The red rays,
 however, appeared to have a greater effect in diminishing the ter
 minal arc than the blue.     In order to determine the single effect of
 temperature, independently of light, the needles were vibrated in
 close vessels surrounded with water of different temperatures; the
 results showed that the terminal arc was increased in air of higher
 temperatures, which is the reverse of what takes place from the di
 rect influence of the solar rays; and that this effect, instead of being
 different in the magnetized and in the other needles, was nearly the
 same in all, of whatever materials they consisted, and whether mag
 netized or not. The author next endeavoured to ascertain the effects
 produced on the axes of vibration by the action of a common fire;
 these, though much less in degree, he found to be similar in kind to
 those of the sun.

 The Bakerian Lecture.     On a Method of rendering Platina malleable.
    By William Hyde Wollaston, M.D. F.R.S. &c. Read November 20,
     1828.   [Phil. Trans. 1829, p. 1.]
     In this paper the author details the processes which, from long
 experience in the treatment of platina, he regards as the most effec
tual for rendering that metal perfectly malleable. When it is purified
by solution in aqua regia, and precipitation with sal-ammoniac, suf
ficient care is seldom taken to avoid dissolving the iridium contained
in the ore by due dilution of the solvent. The author states the exact
degree of dilution requisite for this purpose, and the exact proportions
in which the two acids are to be used. The digestion should be con
tinued for three or four days, with a heat which ought gradually to
be raised; and the fine pulverulent ore of iridium allowed to subside
completely before the sal-ammoniac is added. The yellow precipi
tate thus obtained, after being well washed and pressed, must be
heated with the utmost caution, so as to expel the sal-ammoniac,
but at the same time to produce as little cohesion as possible among
the particles of platina. It is then to be reduced to powder, first by
rubbing between the hands, and next by grinding the coarser parts
in a wooden mortar with a wooden pestle; because the friction of any
harder substance would, by producing burnished surfaces, render
them incapable of being welded together by heat. The whole is then
to be well washed in clean water.
    In this process the mechanical diffusion through water is made to
answer the same purposes as liquefaction by heat in the case of the
other metals; the earthy impurities being carried to the surface by
their superior lightness, and the effect of fluxes being accomplished
by the solvent powers of water.
    The grey precipitate of platina being thus obtained in the form of
an uniform mud or pulp, is now ready for casting, which is effected

                                                              353
by compression in a mould, formed of a brass barrel, six inches and
a half long, and turned rather taper within, so as to facilitate the ex
traction of the ingot when formed.           The platinum is first subjected
to a  partial    compression    by  the hand with a wooden plug, so as to
expel the greater part of the water.           It is then placed horizontally
in an iron press, of which a figure is given, constructed so as to afford
great mechanical advantage to the power applied to produce com
pression.     The cake of platina is then to be heated to redness by a
charcoal   fire,   in order to drive off                        all
                                             the remaining moisture; after
wards    subjected              to
                           the most intense heat          wind furnace; and    of   a

                                                reduced by the processes

screwing, and with a perforation at the extremity of each.  In these
perforations are fixed two suitable plano-convex lenses, which may
thus have their axes easily brought into the same line by means of
their plane surfaces; while their distance from each other may be
adjusted by screwing, so as to produce the best effect of which they
are capable.   The best relative proportion of the foci of the two
lenses, appears, from the trials made by the author, to be that of
three to one. The distance between their plane surfaces should, in
general, be about 1:4 of the shorter focus, but should be varied by
trial, till the utmost possible degree of distinctness has been attained.

   The author also ascertained that the electrical shocks of the tor

On a Method    of comparing the Light of the Sun with that of the
  fired Stars. By William Hyde Wollaston, M.D. F.R.S. Read
  December 11, 1828.     [Phil. Trans. 1829, p. 19.]
  In  the Philosophical Transactions for the year 1767, a suggestion
is thrown out by Mr. Michell, that a comparison between the light
received from the sun and any of the fixed stars, might furnish data
for estimating their relative distances; but no such direct comparison
had been attempted.      Dr. Wollaston was led to infer from some ob
servations that he made in the year 1799, that the direct light of the
sun is about one million times more intense than that of the full moon,
and therefore very many million times greater than that of all the
fixed stars taken collectively. In order to compare the light of the
sun with that of a star, he took, as an intermediate object of com
parison, the light of a candle reflected from a small bulb, about a
quarter of an inch in diameter, filled with quicksilver, and seen, by
one eye, through a lens of two inches focus, at the same time that
the star or the sun's image, placed at a proper distance, was viewed
by the other eye through a telescope. The mean of various trials
seemed to show that the light of Sirius is equal to that of the sun
seen in a glass bulb one tenth of an inch in diameter, at the distance
of 210 feet, or that they are in the proportion of one to ten thousand
millions; but as nearly one half of the light is lost by reflection, the
real proportion between the light from Sirius and the sun is not
greater than that of one to twenty thousand millions. If the annual
       ax of Sirius be half a second, corresponding to a distance of
525,481 times that of the sun from the earth, its diameter would be
3-7 times that of the sun, and its light 13.8 times as great. The di
stance at which the sun would require to be viewed, so that its
brightness might be only equal to that of Sirius, would be 141,421

been unable, for want of a sufficient number of specimens of water
taken at various depths in the Mediterranean,     to draw any certain
inference as to what becomes of the vast amount of salt brought into
that sea by the constant current which sets in from the Atlantic
through the Straits of Gibraltar, and which, on the evaporation of
the water, must either remain in the basin of the Mediterranean, or
escape by some hitherto unexplained means.         In the hope of ob
taining further evidence on this question, he had requested Captain
 Smyth, R.N., who was engaged in a Survey of that sea, to procure
specimens of water from the greatest accessible depths.    The speci
mens collected  by  Captain Smyth   were, in consequence  of Dr. Mar
cet's death, given to other persons, and applied to other objects.
Dr. Wollaston, however, fortunately obtained the three remaining
bottles of the collection.
   The contents of one of these, taken up at about fifty miles within
the Straits, and from a depth of 670 fathoms, was found to have a
density exceeding that of distilled water by more than four times the
usual excess; and accordingly, it left upon evaporation more than
four times the usual quantity of saline residuum.    The result of the
examination of this specimen accords completely with the anticipa
tion, that a counter current of denser water might exist at great
depths in the neighbourhood of the Straits, capable of carrying west
ward into the Atlantic as much salt as enters into the Mediterranean
with the eastward current near the surface. If the two currents were
of equal breadth and depth, the velocity of the lower current need
only be one fourth of that of the upper current, in order to prevent
any increase of saltness in the Mediterranean.

   The author gives an account of the continuation of his experiments
on the construction of refracting telescopes with fluid lenses, which
the aid furnished him by the Board of Longitude enabled him to
pursue.    The instrument he particularly describes has a clear aper
ture of 7-8 inches, which exceeds by about an inch that of the
largest refracting telescope in this country. The whole length of
the tube, with the eye-piece, is 12 feet, but       its

tached to the axis, on          the well-known plan of Dr. Mitchell; and a
fourth, devised by Mr.          Dollond, the middle of which is a cube per
forated at right angles,        so that the axis may be inserted in eight dif
ferent ways.
   In addition to his own apparatus and needles, the author obtained
from the Colonial Department the use of a smaller apparatus, with a
needle on Professor Meyer's plan, the same which was used by Cap
tain Franklin, on his last land expedition.      The observations with
this apparatus were made by Mr. David Douglas, of the Horticul
tural Society. The results were as follows:—

   From the observations of 1821 and  1828, the author finds a de
crease in the dip in London, of 17"5 in seven years, or an annual
decrease of 2'-5.
   The average annual decrease for the century preceding 1821 ap
pears, from the most authentic observations, to have exceeded                         3'.

 Remarks on the tendency to Calculous Diseases; with Observations on
   the Nature of urinary Concretions, and an Analysis of a large Part

    The account given by the author of his examination of the urinary
 calculi contained in the Norwich Collection, the total number of
 which is 649, relates more particularly to those which have been
 either purposely divided, or accidentally broken in the extraction,
 and which amount         together   all
                                       about 330. He gives tabular view

Experiments    to determine the Difference in the Number of Vibrations
     made by an Invariable Pendulum in the Royal Observatory at Green
     wich, and in the House in London in which Captain Kater's Erperi
     ments were made.    By Captain Edward Sabine, of the Royal Artil
     lery, Sec. R.S.
                   Communicated by the President and Council.                                           Read
     December 11, 1828. [Phil. Trans. 1829, p. 83.]
   The experiments of which an account is given in this paper, were
made in compliance with a request of the Council of the Royal Soci
ety, made in December 1827, that Captain Sabine would ascertain the
difference in the number of vibrations of a pendulum at Mr. Browne's
house, and at the Greenwich Observatory.        The author gives a de
scription of the instruments used in the observations; the first series of
which were made in Mr. Browne's house, from the 17th to the 20th of
March inclusive, and gave as the mean result, 85963-60 vibrations in
a mean solar day. A reduction is here introduced, derived from some
experiments made on the difference which takes place in the times of
vibration in vacuo and in air; the number of vibrations in the former
case being, under the same circumstances as in the observations, 997
per diem less than in the latter.       A corresponding series made at
 Greenwich in   May,  gave   as the mean 85964. 17 vibrations, thus                                          in
dicating an acceleration of 0.57 vibrations per diem; but the differ
ence of latitude and of height between the two stations would have
led us from theory to expect a total retardation of 0-38 vibration in
the same time.     From a second set of observations at Greenwich, the
diurnal acceleration appeared to be 0-52 vibration.      Taking the mean
of this and the former   result, it appears  that the total amount of the
discordance between theory and experiment is 0.91 vibration per
diem.    The stations are conveniently situated for verifying the ex
istence of this anomaly, and         magnitude  itssuch        preclude all
                                                                   is              as   to

Aurora Borealis, which                on

favourable circumstances, had already been announced        short                             in    a

calculated to determine the forces required for dragging bodies of
various kinds along a horizontal surface, and others for measuring

developements hitherto given being incomplete.            He considers the
principles employed in this inquiry as presenting a solution of many
difficulties, and illustrating peculiarities appertaining to the theory of
logarithms of negative quantities; and when applied to geometry, as
furnishing the means of tracing the form and developing the proper
ties of curves whose equations involve exponential quantities.          He
also states that by their means various differential and other formulae
usually exhibited in treatises on logarithms may be rendered com
plete.     An appendix is subjoined containing several examples of
these applications of his principles.       In the course of his investiga
tions, the author endeavours to explain the remarkable anomaly which
frequently presents itself to the analyst, of developements, in which,
upon substituting a particular value for the variable in each, there is
no approximation to numerical identity between the several resulting
series, calculated to any number of terms, and the respective func
tions which they ought to represent.          He combats the paradoxical
opinion which has been advanced, that equations, which in particular
instances are numerically false, are yet analytically true; and ex
plains the difficulty by reverting to the limitations inherent in the
hypothesis upon which the developement is founded.          He maintains,
in opposition to the opinions of Jean Bernouilli and D'Alembert, that
the logarithms of negative and positive numbers are not in general
the same ; and hence infers that negative numbers have occasionally
even real logarithms.       The chief novelty of his system consists in
showing that any assigned quantity, relatively to a given base, has
an infinite number of orders of logarithms, and an infinite number of
logarithms in each order.
On the Reflection and Decomposition of Light at the separating Sur
 faces of Media of the same and of different refractive Powers. By
  David Brewster, LL.D. F.R.S. L. & E. Read February 12, 1829.
  [Phil. Trans. 1829, p. 187.]
    When white light is incident upon a surface which separates two
different media, the portion that is reflected should, according to the
Newtonian theory of light, preserve its whiteness, provided the thick
ness of either of the media exceed the eighty millionth of an inch.
But since the dispersive powers of bodies are different, it must follow
as a necessary consequence, that reflected light can never under any
circumstances retain perfect whiteness, although the modification it
experiences is not of sufficient amount to become sensible in ordinary
experiments.     The author during his investigations of the laws of
polarization for light reflected at the separating surface of different
media, had occasion to inclose oil of cassia between two prisms of
flint glass, and was surprised to find that the light reflected was of a
blue colour. The fact was new, but might be readily explained
                                                              oil
upon the principle that although the refractive density of    of  cassia
greatly exceeds that   of  flint glass for the mean rays, yet the action

                                                     367
of these two bodies is nearly the same on the less refrangible rays:
hence it may happen that a larger proportion of the former than of
the latter is transmitted, and the pencil formed by reflexion will
then appear blue.     The partial decomposition thus effected in the
incident rays will be the same in kind, though it may vary in degree,
at different angles of incidence, and cannot therefore give rise to any
variation of colour in the reflected rays, although they may differ in
intensity according to the obliquity of the incidence.    By using dif
ferent kinds of  glass, and of  interposed  fluids, the author obtained
various analogous results, different rays of the spectrum being sepa
rated according to the prevalence, in each particular case, of one or
other of the opposite actions exerted upon them by the solid and the
fluid medium. The author directed his attention more particularly
to those conditions in which the nearest approach could be made to
a perfect equilibrium of all the forces which affect the incident rays.
The solids which he employed in his experiments were two prisms of
plate glass, of which the sections were right-angled isosceles triangles,
and differing but very slightly in their refractive indices. The fluids
were castor        oil
                   and balsam       copivi, the former having
                                           of                      less, and the     a
latter   agreater refractive power than the glass prisms;            thin film        a         of
either fluid being interposed between them.                With castor oil, and
within the limit         total reflexion, the reflected light

                                         not follow the same law: and, secondly,
                                                                                     -

that the force which produces reflexion, varies according to a different
law in different bodies. The reflective forces of the solid and the
fluid may be conceived to decrease in various ways: first, they may
respectively  extend to different distances from the reflecting surface,
and decrease according to the same law. Secondly, they may ex
tend to different distances, and vary according to a different law; or,
lastly, they may extend to the same distance, and vary according to
different laws.    Whether the refracting forces follow the same law
in solids and in fluids, it is extremely difficult to determine by direct
experiment; but if we assume the mutual dependence of the refract
ing and reflecting forces, then the experiments recorded in this paper
will establish a variation in the law of the refracting forces of diffe
rent media.
    These facts may be explained on the undulatory theory of light,
by supposing that the density or elasticity of the ether varies near
the surface of different bodies, an hypothesis which has already af
forded an explanation of the loss of part of an undulation in several
of the phenomena of interference; the part lost being, according to
Dr. Young, a variable fraction, depending on the nature of the con
tiguous media.
    The phenomena of periodical colours at the confines of media of
the same or of different refractive powers, are evidently dependent
 on the law of interference, although it may be difficult to point out
the precise mode in which they are produced.              In combinations
where there is much      uncompensated    refraction,  their production is
influenced   by  certain  changes,  such as the formation of a thin and
invisible film on the surface of the solid, the nature and origin of
which the author endeavours to investigate, but which he acknow
ledges he has hitherto been unable to discover. That some unrecog
mised physical principle is the cause of        these phenomena will,

spheric air.      The 9th, 10th, and 11th experiments were made to ex
 amine whether the vibration of the pendulum in air within the ap
 paratus was the same as in the free air of the apartment; this was
 accomplished by vibrating the pendulum alternately in free and in
 confined air, by removing and again replacing such parts of the ap
 paratus as were necessary for that purpose.                  It was found, by this
 means, that the confinement of the medium by the glasses produced
 no sensible effect on the time of vibration.
    From the mean of the eight experiments on the retardation in
 common air, the author obtains 10:36 vibrations per diem, as the re
 duction to a vacuum of the invariable pendulum, vibrating in air of
 45° under a pressure of 30 inches of mercury: and by computing
 the retardation severally for the circumstances of each experiment,
 and comparing the computed and observed retardations, he shows,
 that were the amount of the reduction to a vacuum separately de
 rived from each of the eight experiments, it would in no case differ
 more than 0-14 of a vibration per diem, from the conclusion derived
 from their mean, or one 74th part of the conclusion itself.
    The reduction to a vacuum which would have been previously
 computed for the vibration in air of 45°, and 30 inches pressure, is
 6:26 vibrations per diem. The retardation in air of that temperature
 and density is therefore 4-1 vibrations greater than has been hitherto
 supposed; and the proportion which the experimental reduction bears
 to that which is now shown to have been erroneous,                     for the inva         is,

appears to possess this property in a proportion more than double
that which would be given by the respective densities of air and hy
drogen gas.
   The paper concludes with an investigation of the effect which
the near reduction to a vacuum will have on the variations of gravity
at different parts of the earth's surface, which have been obtained
with invariable pendulums; and particularly of the experiments of
the author himself, which embrace a greater range and variety of
temperature than those of any other experimentalist.     It is shown
that in consequence of the peculiar mode in which those experiments
were reduced to a mean term of comparison, their re-calculation with
the more correct elements now known, would have no other effect
than that of adding an equal amount to the vibrations of the experi
mental pendulum at every station, leaving the acceleration at diffe

Consideration of the Objections raised against the geometrical Repre
  sentation of the Square Roots of Negative Quantities.   By the Rev.
  John Warren, M.A. of Jesus College, Cambridge. Communicated
  by Thomas Young, M.D. For. Sec. R.S. Read February 19, 1829.
  [Phil. Trans. 1829, p. 241.]
   It has always appeared a paradox in mathematics, that by em
ploying what are called imaginary or impossible quantities, and sub
jecting them to the same algebraic operations as those which are
performed   on quantities that are real and possible, the results ob
tained should always prove perfectly correct.    The author inferring
from this fact, that the operations of algebra are of a more compre
hensive nature than its definitions and fundamental principles, was
led to inquire what extension might be given to these definitions and
principles, so as to render them strictly applicable to quantities of
every description, whether real or imaginary.      This deficiency, he
conceives, may be supplied  by  having recourse to certain geometrical
considerations.    By taking into account the directions as well as the
lengths of lines drawn in a given plane, from a given point, the ad
dition of such lines may admit of being performed in the same man
ner as the composition of motions in dynamics; and four such
lines may be regarded as proportional, both in length and direction,
when they are proportionals in length, and, when also the fourth is
inclined to the third at the same angle that the second is to the first.
From this principle he deduces, that if a line drawn in any given di
rection be assumed as a positive quantity, and consequently         itsop
positea  negative quantity,     line drawn
                                a               right

which period several objections have been made to this hypothesis.
The purpose of the present paper is to answer these objections.
   The first of these                        is,

itis  by    in no
              means necessarily           all;  and that these quantities re

they are excluded by the nature            the question, are indeed signs

significant quantities. We have therefore            stronger reasons, priori,    no                                     a
for denying the real existence            what are called impossible roots,

should have for refusing that character            fractional      negative rootsto                   or

   The foot, of which an account is here given, was obtained from
the dead body of a female found floating in the river at Canton, and
had all the characters of deformity, consequent upon the prevailing
practice of early bandaging, for the purpose of checking                     natural                   its

gans, as the thoracic and abdominal viscera, and to the muscles sub

convey impressions to the sensorium, and occasionally excite the
muscles of involuntary motion, which, in common with         muscles,                                      all

of caloric and of renewing the processes of secretion. In like manner
the power of contraction, inherent in the muscular fibre, survives the
destruction of both the sensorial and nervous powers, having an ex
istence independent of either, although in the entire state of the
functions they are subjected to the entire influence of both.
    A difficulty here presents itself. If both the nervous and muscular
powers be independent of the sensorial power, why, it may be asked,
do the more perfect animals survive for so short a time the loss of the
sensorial functions       This the author explains by the dependence of
respiration on all the three powers,       the sensorial, nervous, and mus
cular, and         its
                   consequent cessation when either            these powers                 of                             is

ness whenever the supply of air was not sufficiently rapid.    On ex
amining the air at the end of the experiment, no alteration had taken
place either in the total volume of air, or in the proportion of azote
which it contained; the only perceptible change being the substitu
tion of a certain quantity of carbonic acid for an equal volume of
oxygen gas, amounting to about half a cubic inch per minute, and
being equivalent to the addition of 96 grains of carbon in 24 hours.
   Two experiments were made on the respiration of oxygen gas, ob
tained from chlorate of potash, and containing in the one case two,
and in the other only one per cent. of azote.     Under these circum
stances it was found that the volume of the gas was unaltered, and
that a similar quantity of oxygen gas had been abstracted, but that a
much smaller quantity of carbonic acid had been formed than in the
last experiment, the remaining portion being made up by azotic gas
which had been given out from the lungs of the bird, and the volume
of which was just equal to that of the oxygen absorbed. The bird
was somewhat distressed during the experiment, but recovered imme
diately and perfectly on being released from       confinement.                  its

Thomson's analysis.     But there exists also more radical cause                   a                                       of
error    the method employed by that chemist; for Dr. Turner finds
           in
that when solutions     muriate     baryta and
                                       of          sulphateof    potash              of                         of

are mixed together, a small portion of the latter salt adheres tenaci
ously to the sulphate of baryta, which is precipitated, and escapes
decomposition.      By employing different processes the author avoids
this source of   fallacy;  first, from the chloride of barium, previously
dissolved in water, he throws down sulphate of baryta by adding
sulphuric acid; and, secondly, he effects a precipitation from a simi
lar solution of the chloride, by nitrate of silver, and infers the quantity
of chloride from that of the fused horn-silver obtained, having pre
viously determined, by a separate series of experiments, the exact
composition of horn-silver. The conclusion he draws from his re
searches          is,
             that 100 parts       chloride  barium correspond
                                             of                 of  137:63                          to
parts                     silver, which latter substance contains 34-016
         of of
          the chloride             of
parts            chlorine, and therefore leaves for the proportion                              of       barium
65'984 parts.                The real equivalent               of   barium, however,           will depend
upon that               of   chlorine,      which         is   itself not yet satisfactorily                  de
termined.

On the Reduction to a Vacuum of Captain Kater's convertible Pendu

   Recent investigations having shown that the method employed by
Captain Kater for the reduction of his experiments on the length of
the pendulum vibrating seconds in air, to that of the same pendulum
in vacuo, was founded on erroneous principles, the author undertook
to ascertain, by direct experiment, the actual difference of the num
ber of vibrations of the pendulum employed by Captain Kater, in air
of ordinary density, and in highly rarefied air. The alteration of
density in the medium in which the pendulum is swung, would, in
the first place, if its form were not symmetrical, affect its converti
bility; that    is,
                  the same adjustment       the axes which gave

  Cambridge.    Communicated by the President. Read June 4, 1829.
  [Phil. Trans. 1829, p. 339.]
  The author, in a former paper, read to the Society in February last,
had discussed various objections which had been raised against his
mode of geometric representation of the square roots of negative
quantities.  At that time he had only discovered geometrical repre
sentations for quantities of the form a + b W                     -
                                                  1, of geometrically
adding and multiplying such quantities, and also of raising them to
                       -
powers either whole or fractional, positive or negative; but he was
at that time unable to represent geometrically quantities raised to
powers, whose indices involve the square roots of negative quantities
                                   A/   –
                       – int
                                 n w/       1
(such as a + b W                                ).    His attention has since been
drawn to this latter class of quantities by a passage in M. Mourey's
work on this subject, which implied that that gentleman was in posses
sion of methods of representing them geometrically, but that he was at
present precluded by circumstances from publishing his discoveries.
The author was therefore induced to pursue his own investigations,
and arrived at the general result stated by M. Mourey, that all alge
braic quantities whatsoever are capable of geometrical representation
by lines all situated in the same plane. The object of the present
paper is to extend the geometrical representations stated in his
former treatise, to the powers of quantities, whose indices involve the
square roots of negative quantities.     With this view he investigates
various  equivalent formulae suited to the particular cases, and employs
a peculiar notation adapted to this express purpose; but the nature of
these investigations is such as renders them incapable of abridgement.
An experimental Eramination of the Electric and Chemical Theories
  of Galvanism. By William Ritchie, A.M. F.R.S. Rector of the
  Royal Academy at Tain. Read May 7, 1829. [Phil. Trans. 1829,
  p. 361.]
   After observing that the theory of galvanism originally proposed
by Volta, and generally termed the Electric theory, is still the uni
versally received doctrine among continental philosophers, the author
adduces several experiments proving the fallacy of the principles on
which that theory is founded.      He points out the inconclusiveness
of the reasoning by which it has been inferred that dissimilar metals,
by being simply placed in contact with one another, are instantly
thrown into opposite electric states; for in                all
                                                the experiments which
have been made with       view
                           a      establishing this fundamental prin
                                    of
ciple   of   the electric theory, the metals have been exposed             to   the   oxi
dizing action   the air, which
                  of              constant source
                                    is  a            electric disturb of
an:e, and the operation    which has been strangely overlooked. The
                            of

                                  383
author found, by forming galvanic circles with two different metals
and an interposed acid, that when he used different kinds of acid,
or varied the degree of their dilution, the electro-magnetic effects, as
measured by a delicate galvanometer, bear no sort of relation to the
conducting power of the fluid, as is assumed in the Voltaic hypothesis.
He deduces the same conclusion from experiments made with an ap
paratus by which the fluid is confined in a rectangular box, divided
by a membranous diaphragm into two compartments, so as to allow
of the addition of an acid to the fluid contained in one of the com
partments, and thereby limiting its action to one of the metallic sur
faces. By means of another contrivance, the author ascertained that
of two different metals, the one which, when acted upon by an acid,
combines with the greatest quantity of oxygen, as measured by the
volume of hydrogen disengaged, is always positive with respect to
the other metal.      Even two pieces of the same metal, differing in
hardness, will be acted upon by the same acid in different degrees,
and may thus be brought into different states of electricity. In ge
neral it is the harder of the two pieces of metal which becomes po
sitive; but with steel the reverse obtains.      It would appear, how
 ever, that with the same pairs of metallic discs, the direction of the
 electric current is determined by the nature of the acid employed:
thus nitrous acid, acting upon zinc, copper, or iron, gives rise to a
current in a direction opposite to the current which is produced by
 the sulphuric, nitric, or muriatic acids.   Variations in the tempera
 ture of the metals will also occasion diversities in the results, not
 hitherto satisfactorily explained on any theory.      From one experi
 ment the author is led to infer that an acid is   capable  of combining
 with a  pure metal,  without the latter being previously  reduced to the
 state of an oxide.

  Purposes.   By Michael Faraday, Esq. F.R.S. &c. Read Novem
  ber 19, December 3 and 10, 1829. [Phil. Trans. 1830, p. 1.]
   As an introduction to his paper, the author gives a short account
of the circumstances which have led to the present inquiry. He states
the difficulties that exist in procuring glass sufficiently homogeneous
to answer the purposes of the optician, and adverts to the efforts made
by Guinand and by Fraunhofer to overcome them. As the art was
still imperfectly known in this country, the President of the Royal
Society in the year 1824 suggested the appointment of a committee,
whose labours were facilitated by the Government removing the re
strictions imposed by the excise laws to experiments on glass, and
also undertaking to bear    all  the expenses of   the inquiry,
                                                              as  long as
it held out a   reasonable expectation   of  ultimate success.  An expe
rimental  glass-house   was at  first erected on the  premisesof  Messrs.
Pellatt and Green,     at the Falcon Glass-works; but Mr. Faraday
being unable    to  conduct them  at    that distance from his own resi
dence, the President and Council    of   the Royal Society obtained leave

                                                384
of the President and Managers of the Royal Institution to erect an
other experimental furnace for continuing the investigation on their
premises.
    The author being intrusted with the immediate superintendence of
the experimental part of the manufacture of the glass, conceives it to
be his especial duty, at the present stage of the inquiry, to give an
account of what has been done in his department; for although the
investigation is still far from being completed, yet he trusts that a de
cided step has now been made in the manufacture of glass for optical
purposes; and that it is due to the Society, as well as to the Go
vernment, to render an account of the results hitherto obtained.
    The author begins this account by a statement of the usual defects
incident to glass, which destroy the regularity of             action     light. its              on
These are, on the one hand, streaks, striae, veins, and tails; and, on
the other hand, minute bubbles; the former arising from the want
of   homogeneity, the latter from the intermixture              air. Of these,   of
the first class      defects constitute the most serious evil,
                     of                                                they in               as

the glass, while the latter are injurious merely from the interception
of  the rays, and their dispersion           directions. The greater the dif

passed over in this line was 633-32 feet above the level of high water
at Panamá.    Their constitutions were now beginning to suffer from
the continued exposure to rain, and they therefore determined, after
building a secure station on the banks of the Chagres, to defer all
future operations till the ensuing year, when the dry season should
be established.   On the 7th of February, 1829, they resumed their
labours, carrying on their levels from a point of the river below their
former station, and 152:55 feet above high-water mark at Panamá,
along the course of the river to a place distant about 12 miles from
its mouth, called La Bruja, where the water in dry seasons is very
brackish, and from which there is no perceptible current to the sea.
   The result of this survey fixes the mean height of the Pacific, at
Panamá, at 3:52 feet above the Atlantic at Chagres.         Between the
extremes of elevation and   depression  of the greatest tides in the Pa
cific at Panamá, there is a difference of 27:44 feet; but the mean
difference at the usual spring tides is 21-22.     At Chagres, this dif
ference is only 1' 16 foot, and is the same at all seasons of the year.
Hence it follows, that at high water, the time of which is nearly the
same on both sides of the Isthmus, the Pacific is raised, at mean tides,
 10-61 feet, and the Atlantic 0-58 foot, above their respective mean
levels, giving to the former an elevation above the latter of 13:55
feet.   At low water, both seas being below their respective mean
levels, by the same quantities as before stated, the Pacific will be
lower than the Atlantic by 6:51 feet; so that thus, in the course of
every interval from one high tide to the succeeding one, the level of
the Pacific is at first higher, then equal, and afterwards lower than
the Atlantic; and then again passing back by the same steps it re
gains    itsformer elevation         as
                                  the tide returns.

plains and savannahs, and seldom exceeding from 300              500 feet     to             in

to the analysis of a pencil thus composed, after it has suffered re
flexion at different angles of incidence; and for this purpose makes
the plane of reflexion bisect the right angle formed by the plane of
polarization of the two pencils composing the beam. As the angle
of incidence diminishes from 90°, these latter planes are gradually
turned more and more towards the plane of reflexion; so that the
angles they form together become more and more acute, until the
incidence becomes that of the angle of complete polarization, in the
particular medium from which the reflexion takes place; in that case,
the planes become parallel, and the whole of the beam is then com
pletely polarized. As the angle of incidence still further diminishes,
these planes become again inclined to one another, but in contrary
directions. Thus the total polarization of the reflected pencil at the
polarizing angle is effected by the turning round of the planes of
polarization of one half of the light from right to left, and of the
other half from left to right, each through an angle of 45°. But
when the pencil is only partially polarized, each plane of polarization
has been turned round in opposite directions, from an inclination of
45°, to one either less or greater than this. The light has, in this
case, suffered a physical change of a remarkable kind; for it now
constitutes neither natural nor polarized light, but something inter
mediate between both.        It is not the former, because its planes of
polarization are not rectangular; nor the latter, because they are
not parallel. The examination of a pencil of this description by a
 doubly-refracting medium, which was the test employed by those
 who conceived the polarization to be complete in one portion while
 the remaining portion was wholly unpolarized, does not afford the
 means of deciding this question; for the results, as the author shows,
 would be the same in either case. By applying the law of repar
 tition of light, when doubly refracted, between the ordinary and ex
 traordinary rays discovered by Malus, namely, that it follows the
 duplicate ratio of the sine and cosine of the angle of inclination to
 the principal section of the crystal, we obtain the same expression
 for the intensities of both rays, whichever of the hypotheses we adopt.
 But the proof which a single reflexion is unable to afford is supplied
 by examining the results of a succession of reflexions.    We are thus
 furnished with means of comparing with great precision the deduc
 tions from theory with the results of experiment, and of establishing
 the correctness or fallacy of both hypotheses.      This investigation is
 pursued by the author in the body of the paper, in considerable de
 tail. He finds the formula given by Fresnel, expressing the law of
 change in the plane of polarization by reflexion, to be perfectly con
 formable with observation, the results of which it also expresses with
 great accuracy when applied to rays which have undergone partial
 polarization. He controverts the accuracy of a proposition advanced
 by Arago, that equal proportions of light are polarized at equal an
 gular distances from the angle of complete polarization. As the in
 dex of refraction differs for the different colours of the spectrum,
 the polarizing angle will be different in each.       In bodies of high

dispersive powers, accordingly, the unpolarized light which remains
in the extraordinary image must be coloured at                  incidences, the           all
colours being most distinct near the maximum polarizing angle.
This necessary result                      of
                              the formula, the author finds              experi                       to   be

double refraction may be produced artificially by effecting certain
changes in the mechanical condition of hard and of soft bodies.  In
all these cases, he observes, the phenomena are entirely different
from those of regular crystals; and in none of them is the doubly
refracting force a function of the angle which the incident ray forms
with one or more axes given in position.                  In the year 1815, he no
ticed the depolarizing properties of a thin film of a mixture of resin
and white wax, compressed between two pieces of glass.                         Acciden
tally meeting with the specimen which had originally been the sub
ject of this observation, he found that after fifteen years it still re
tained this property of depolarization, and was induced to pursue the
inquiry to which it led. He varied the proportions of the ingredients,
 and observed in the different cases the modifications produced in the
 phenomena by employing various degrees of pressure.                          He found
 that, in every point, there existed an axis of double refraction, per
pendicular to the plane of the film, and that the doubly-refracting
 force varied with the inclination of the incident ray to this axis, just
 as happens with                all
                             regular uniaxal crystals.           He infers from his
 observations, that the property                             of
                                                uniaxal double refraction           com                       is

 all cases where pressure has not operated, the aggregate does not
 exhibit this property.         These effects are precisely the same                those                     as
                                                  of by

markable confirmation in the doubly-refracting structure which the
author discovered in chabasie; and they also enable us to under
stand the nature of that influence which heat produces on doubly
refracting crystals, as discovered by Prof. Mitscherlich. The optical
phenomena exhibited by fluids under the influence of heat and pres
sure, and by crystals exposed to compressing or dilating forces, are
also in perfect conformity with the above views, and would in them
selves have been sufficient to establish the principle that the forces
of double refraction are not resident in the molecules themselves,
but are the immediate result of those mechanical forces by which
these molecules constitute solid bodies.

On the progressive Improvements made in the Efficiency of Steam En

   The practical adaptation of the steam-engine to mechanical pur
poses is considered by the author as due to Mr. Newcomen, whose
engines were introduced into Cornwall very early in the last cen
tury, and soon superseded the rude machinery which had till then
been employed for raising water from the mines by the labour of
men and of horses.        The terms proposed by Mr. Watt, in virtue of
his patent in 1769, which secured to him, until the year 1800, the

most advantageously communicated.       Equability of velocity is ob
tained, though at the expense of some degree of sliding friction,
when the outline of the teeth of the wheels are involutes of circles.
Friction, on the other hand, is wholly prevented when their form is
the logarithmic spiral; but the angular velocities will then be variable.
Hence these two advantages are incompatible with one another; but
on the whole, the author gives the preference to the involute, which
produces an equability of angular motion. The most advantageous
mode of increasing velocity by a series of wheels is to adjust them
so that the multiplication of velocity shall proceed in a geometrical
progression.

 mission, whatever be the angle of incidence.         The author of the pre
 sent paper   shows that the views from which this deduction was made,
 and the observations on which they are founded, are incorrect.            By
applying to the subject the same principles which he has already de
veloped in the paper lately read to the Society, on the Polarization of
Light by Reflexion, he establishes, on the basis of actual experiment,
what he conceives to be the true laws of the phenomena.             The first
step in his inquiry is the determination of the law according to which
the polarizing force of the refracting surface changes the position of
the planes of polarized light.        He shows that when a compound
pencil, of which the constituent rays are polarized in planes inclined
at angles of 45°, the one being to the right and the other to the left
of the plane of refraction, is refracted, the planes of polarization of
the refracted rays are turned so as to approach to coincidence, not
in a plane parallel to the plane of reflexion, as happens in the reflected
rays, but in a plane at right angles to           This contrariety
                                                it.                    effect,             of
 he observes,   is exactly what   might  have been expected from the op
posite character     of the resulting polarization, the poles       the par        of of
ticles  of light, which were formerly repelled by the force        reflexion,
being now attracted        bythe refracting force.    The author next en
deavoured      toascertain the influence      refracting
                                               of        power      effecting      in
polarization, but experienced great difficulty          prosecuting this

quiry, from the necessity        ofhaving plates without any crystalline
structure. He tried gold leaf       inavariety     ways, but found
                                                         of           almost           it

                                                its on
impossible     to obtain correct results,       account                  of

with films   of  soapy water, and thin plates       metalline glass

refractive   power,   he concludes that the rotation       the planes   ofpo                    of
larization increases with the refractive       power.   By      examination   an
of   the effects produced   at   different angles             of   incidence,        he    deduces

                                                        395
the law expressing the variation of the rotation corresponding to the
 deviation of the refracted ray, when the inclination of the planes of
polarization to the plane of incidence is 45°; namely, that the co
tangent of the inclination of the plane of polarization to that of re
fraction, is equal to the cosine of the difference between the angles
of incidence and refraction.     This formula represents the experi
ments so accurately, that when the analysing rhomb of calcareous
spar is set to the calculated angle of inclination, the extraordinary
image completely disappears; a result which is the strongest test of
the correctness of the formula.
  In order to determine the quantity of polarized light in the                                                  re
fracted pencil, the author follows a method similar to that which he
employed for the reflected rays, and which he has explained in his
former paper.      He deduces as a general result, that the quantity of
light polarized by refraction can never be mathematically equal to the
whole of the transmitted pencil, however numerous be the refractions
which it undergoes; or, in other words, refraction cannot produce
rays truly polarized, that                  is,
                                with their planes         polarization parallel.  of

that a pencil of light reflected from the second surface of a transpa
rent plate, and reaching the eye after two refractions and an inter
mediate reflexion, contains, at all angles of incidence, from zero to
the maximum polarizing angle, a portion of light polarized in the
plane of reflexion. Above the polarizing angle, the part of the pencil
polarized by reflexion diminishes until the cosine of the sum of the
angles of incidence and reflexion equals the cube of the cosine of
the difference between these two angles, when it disappears, and the
whole pencil has the character of common light. Above this last
angle, the pencil contains a quantity of light polarized perpendicularly
to the plane of reflexion, which increases to a maximum, and then
diminishes to zero, when the angle has attained 90°.         The effect of
the two refractions in M. Arago's experiment, was to make the two
quantities of light appear equal, when in fact the one was exactly
double of the other.

On   some   Properties in Achromatic Object-glasses applicable to the
  Improvement   of the Microscope.   By  Joseph Jackson Lister, Esq.
   Communicated  by  Dr. Roget, Secretary.   Read January 21, 1830.
   [Phil. Trans. 1830, p. 187.]
    The principles on which the reflecting, and also the achromatic
refracting telescope are constructed, have been recently applied with
considerable success to the microscope, and have added much to the
power of that instrument.       The author speaks with much commen
dation of the    peculiar  construction adopted in Mr. Tulley's com
pound achromatic microscopes, consisting of a combination of object
glasses of short focus and large aperture, the curvatures of which are
such as very nearly to equalize the refractions produced by each.
As the magnitude of the aperture, he observes, is valuable only in
proportion to that of the pencil of light which it admits, the latter
circumstance is that which chiefly claims attention; and as it is often
erroneously estimated, a method is pointed out of ascertaining it with
sufficient exactness for every practical purpose.     He then enters into
a detailed description of the several parts of an instrument in his
possession constructed on the principles he recommends, referring to
the drawings which accompany the paper.          The magnifying power
may be varied at pleasure, either by drawing out the tubes contain
ing the eye-pieces, or by substituting an eye-glass of different power,
 or differently combined; and by these changes an uninterrupted
range of amplification is obtained from 35 to 800 diameters.             No
 sensible difference as to distinctness is observable, whether the effect
 is produced by changing the eye-piece, or varying the length of the
 tubes.   The construction of the instrument admits of the utmost
variation of magnifying power without the risk of losing sight of the
 object viewed: and every part which relates to the illumination being
 wholly detached from the stage, ample opportunity is afforded of
 rapidly moving the objects, and bringing into view a succession of
 them, while the light remains the same. Minute directions are given
 for the employment of the instrument, and       itsapplication  to  various
 purposes; and great stress   is  laid on the importance   ofa  skilful ma
 nagement    of the light.

         In stating the results of his experience on this subject, the author
      takes occasion to advert to some of the sources of fallacy by which
       incautious observers with the microscope have so often been greatly
       misled. When a pencil of rays proceeding from an indefinitely small
       bright portion of an object is brought to a focus by the most per
       fect object-glass, the image thus formed is in reality not a point, but
       a small circle, and will always appear as such if the eye-glass of the
       microscope be sufficiently powerful. These circles have a consider
      able analogy to the spurious discs of stars viewed through telescopes.
      Like the latter, they become much enlarged by diminishing the aper
      ture of the object-glass; and they are also enlarged by increasing
      the intensity of the illumination. The overlapping of contiguous
      circles of diffusion has given rise to many fallacious appearances;
      such as the spottiness which some surfaces assume, and which has
      been mistaken for globules.       This optical illusion has been the basis
      of some    ingenious  but  visionary  speculations on the intimate struc
      ture of  organic  matter. The     appearance,   in certain directions of the
      light, of lines on the surface of an object, where they do not really
      exist, may be traced to a similar cause.
         The author proceeds to describe the method he uses for measuring
      the dimensions of the objects viewed, and notices different test ob
     jects with reference to their affording the means of judging of the
\   \powers of the instrument. He next enters into a review of the com
     yarative merits of various microscopes constructed by Cuthbert and
      Dollond in this country, and by Chevalier, Selligue, Amici, Utz
      schneider, and Fraunhofer, on the continent.
         The concluding part of the paper is occupied by the developement
      of a principle, from the application of which to the construction of
     the microscope, the author expects that a still greater extension of
     its powers will ere long be obtained.         He remarks, that the circum
     stance which limits the magnitude of the pencil of light, admissible
     with high powers by a single achromatic object-glass,                 that theis,

   The ingenious and beautiful application, made by Capt. Kater, of
Huygens's theorem respecting the convertibility of the centres of
suspension and oscillation, to the determination of the length of the
simple pendulum, is to be considered as a first approximation to the
solution of this problem.    The accuracy of this determination, how
ever, may be affected by many circumstances which the theory does
not take into account; and the object of the author in this paper is
to investigate the limits of the errors that may arise from neglecting
them. Laplace and Whewell have shown that when the knife-edges
are considered as cylinders of small but of equal radii of curvature,
their distance is still equal to the length of the simple pendulum.
The author treats the question with the utmost generality, and dis
cusses    all
           the circumstances which may affect the accuracy        Capt.                  of

simple pendulum corresponding                 to   given deviations     of   the knife-edges.
He also considers the                     which the agate planes are fixed                    on

the theory still further, Dulong attempted, by reversing the process
of Laplace, to deduce the coefficient by which the Newtonian for
mula is to be multiplied, directly from experiments themselves. The
object of the present paper is to compare the investigation of Dulong
with the experiments on the velocity of sound made by Drs. Moll
and Van Beek, of which an account was lately published in the Phi
losophical Transactions. By applying the values of the coefficients
thus obtained, the computed velocities of sound came out much nearer
to the observed velocities; and the author concludes by remarking,
that such differences as yet remain between calculation and experi

unavoidable in observations of so complicated a nature.

   The author proposes the employment of threads of glass in the
construction of torsion-balances, in place of the silver wire, used by
Coulomb for the measurement of minute electric or magnetic forces.
He describes a galvanometer of his invention, acting upon this prin
ciple, the intensity of the galvanic current being measured by the
torsion of a slender filament of glass, to the lower end of which a
magnetized needle is fixed at right angles. He also applies the same
power to the improvement of the sensibility of the common balance
for weighing minute bodies, by affixing to the beam a long glass
thread horizontally in the axis of suspension, by the torsion of which,
when the balance has been brought nearly to a level, the more accu
rate adjustments are to be effected.       On the whole he considers
that glass, from           its
                      perfect elasticity, possesses decided advantages
over metallic wires, for the construction     instruments acting

ject of considerable interest in geology, as tending to identify the
 products of the ancient seas in their most minute particulars with
those of the present ocean. The results of his inquiries are given in
the form of a table, in which the springs, whose waters he examined,
are classified according to the geological position of the strata from
which they issue, and of which the several columns exhibit the total
amount of their saline ingredients; the nature and proportion of each
ingredient, as ascertained by former chemists, or by the author him
self; and lastly, where they contained either iodine or bromine, the
proportions these substances bear to the quantities of water, and like
wise to the chlorine also present in the same spring.    He finds that
the proportion of iodine to chlorine varies in every possible degree;
and that even springs which are most strongly impregnated with com
mon salt are those in which he could not detect the smallest trace
of iodine. The same remark, he observes, applies also to bromine;
whence he concludes, that although these two principles may, per
haps, never be entirely absent where the muriates occur, yet their
relative distribution is exceedingly unequal.   The author conceives
that these analyses will tend to throw some light on the connection
between the chemical constitution of mineral waters and their medi
cinal waters.    Almost the only two brine springs, properly so called,
which have     acquired any reputation as medicinal agents, namely,
that of Kreutznach in the Palatinate, and that of Ashby-de-la-Zouch
in Leicestershire, contain a much larger proportion than usual of bro
mine, a substance, the poisonous quality of which was ascertained

  Experiments to ascertain the Correction for Variations of Temperature,
    within the limits of the natural Temperature of the Climate of the
    South of England, of the Invariable Pendulum recently employed by
    British Observers. By Captain Edward Sabine, of the Royal Artil
    lery, Sec. R.S. Read March 25, 1830. [Phil. Trans. 1830, p. 251.]
   The correction for temperature which the author deduces as the
 general result of his investigation, is 0.44 of a vibration per diem for
 each degree of Fahrenheit between 30° and 60°.        He considers this
 result as entitled to the greater confidence, from the favourable na
 ture of the circumstances under which the inquiry was conducted;
 since the influence of natural temperature is more permanent and
 equable than that of temperatures artificially produced.   He consi
 ders it as desirable, however, that means should be devised of ex
 tending experiments on this subject to a wider range of temperatures.

   In the year 1821, the author published in the Journal of the Royal
Institution an account of a new pyrometer, and of some determina
tions of high temperatures, in connexion with the scale of the mer
curial thermometer, obtained by its means. The use of the instru
ment then described was, however, limited; and the author was
  subsequently led to the invention of a pyrometer of a more universal
  application, both to scientific researches and to various purposes of
  art.   He introduces the subject by an account of the late attempt of
  M.   Guyton  de Morveau, to employ the expansions of platina for the
  admeasurement of high temperatures, and for connecting the indi
 cations of Wedgwood's pyrometer with the mercurial scale, and veri

  The action of metals upon light has always presented           a remarkable,

come more and more faint as the incidence succeeds or falls short of
that angle. They appear best defined in light reflected from galena,
and from metallic lead, and with least distinctness in light reflected
from silver and gold. On examining the effect of successive reflexion
of the same ray by metallic surfaces, the author found that the quan
tity of light which each polarizes in the plane of reflexion, increases
with every reflexion, and that in several cases the whole incident
pencil is completely polarized.
    The action of metals upon polarized light forms the subject of the
second section of this paper, in which he investigates the changes
which polarized light undergoes, according as it is reflected at diffe
rent angles of incidence, and in different azimuths of the plane of
incidence with relation to the plane of primitive polarization.                      The
light experiences in these cases a physical change of a nature inter
mediate between that of completely polarized light, and light wholly
unpolarized, neither does it possess the same characters as that which
has passed through thin crystallized plates.                 Its constitution is ex

the least refrangible rays begin to suffer the double reflexion sooner
than the mean ray, and they sooner reach their maximum of elliptic
polarization, thus exhibiting the inversion of the spectrum.       The
theory of circular polarization, as given by Fresnel, will no doubt
embrace the phenomena of elliptic polarization; and when the nature
of metallic action shall be more thoroughly examined, we may expect
to be able to trace the phenomena under consideration to their true

Researches in Physical Astronomy.     By John William Lubbock, Esq.
     F.R.S. Read April 29, 1830.       [Phil. Trans. 1830, p. 327.]
    The analytic expressions for the variations of the elliptic con
stants given by Laplace in his Mécanique Céleste, are true only when
the square and higher powers of the disturbing forces are neglected
in the computation; and by proceeding on the supposition that all
the planets move in circular orbits and in the same direction, he has
demonstrated that the eccentricities and inclinations vary within
small limits, and that the stability of the planetary system is always
eventually preserved.    But Mr. Lubbock shows in the present paper
that these conditions are not necessary to the stability of a system of
bodies subject to the law of attraction which governs our system;
and he gives expressions for the variations of the elliptic constants
which are rigorously true, whatever power of the disturbing force be
retained.
 On the  Error in Standards of Linear Measure, arising from the thick
    ness of the Bar on which they are traced. By Captain Henry Kater,
    V.P. and Treas. R.S. Read June 17, 1830. [Phil. Trans. 1830,
    p. 359.]
    While engaged in the adjustment and verification of the copies of
the Imperial standard yard destined for the Exchequer, Guildhall,
 Dublin, and Edinburgh, the author discovered a source of error arising
 from the thickness of the bar, upon the surface of which measures of
linear dimension are traced. A notice to that effect was published
 in the Philosophical Transactions for 1826; and the object of the pre
 sent paper is to give an account of the experiments the author has
 since made on this subject, and to describe a scale which he has had
 constructed, so as almost entirely to obviate the source of error thus
 introduced.
    From the experiments detailed in the first part of the paper, the
 following conclusions are deduced:—First, that in a standard of
 linear measure, traced upon the surface of a bar, an error arises from
 the thickness of the bar when it is placed upon a table the surface
 of which is not plane; Secondly, that this error in bars of the same
 material, and of unequal thickness, is within certain limits as the
 thickness of the bar, and depends upon the extension of that sur

                                         409
face of the bar which becomes convex, and the compression of the
surface which is concave; Thirdly, that the error to which the same
scale is liable from this cause, is directly as the versed sine of the
curvature of the surface upon which the scale is placed; Fourthly, that
the error very far exceeds that which would arise from the difference
of length between the arc and its chord under similar circumstances;
so much so, that the sum of the errors from this cause, in a bar one
inch thick, with a versed sine of not one hundredth of an inch, is
nearly one thousandth of an inch, whilst double the difference be
                                                                     -
tween the chord and the arc is not one fifty thousandth.
   The author devised the following method of trying a surface sup
posed to be plane; namely, by applying to it in different directions
a piano-forte wire, one hundredth of an inch in diameter, which bears
a considerable degree of tension without breaking, strung on a bow
6 feet long; a contrivance which, he states, may be applied to a
great variety of useful purposes, when a straight edge is required.
He could detect the nature, and in some degree the extent, of the
irregularities of a surface, by tapping with the fingers upon the wire
whilst it was pressed by the weight of the bow upon the board.
When it yielded no sound, the wire was of course in contact with
the surface, which was, in that case, either convex or plane. When
the wire yielded a sound the surface was concave, and some idea
might be formed of the extent by the acuteness or gravity of the
sound produced, the edges of the concavity serving as bridges which
limited the length of the string. So delicate is this test, that a
cavity can be detected by this method when the interval between
the wire and the surface under examination is imperceptible to the
eye.
   The error in question, resulting from the extension and compres
sion of the surfaces of the bar dependent upon its curvature, is ob
viated in the following manner.        The neutral surface, which suffers
neither extension nor    compression,    is shown by the author to be at
about one third of the thickness of the bar from that surface, which
becomes convex. When the object is to have two points only on the
bar, marking for example the yard, by cutting away one half of the
thickness of the bar at      ends, and placing the points upon the new
                              its
surface, the error arising from flexure        reduced
                                                is        tothe least possible
quantity; but when scale a          of

On the Illumination of Light-houses.   By Lieut. Thomas Drummond,
  of the   Royal  Engineers.   Communicated by Lieut.-Colonel Colby,
  of the   Royal   Engineers, F.R.S. Read June 17, 1830. [Phil.
  Trans.   1830, p.  383.]
   The author, after briefly describing the different methods at pre
sent employed for illuminating light-houses, proceeds to detail what
he considers an improvement upon those now in use. This consists
in substituting for the Argand burner a small ball of lime, ignited by
the combustion of oxygen and hydrogen.
   From this small ball, only three eighths of an inch in diameter, so
brilliant a light is emitted, that it equals in quantity about 13 Argand
lamps, or 120 wax candles; while in intensity, or intrinsic bright
ness, it cannot be less than 260 times that of an Argand lamp. These
remarkable results are deduced from a series of experiments made
lately at the Trinity House; and having been repeated with every
precaution, and by different individuals, there seems no reason to
doubt their accuracy.
   In the best of our revolving lights, such as that of Beachy Head,
there are no less than 30 reflectors, 10 on each side. If, then, a sin
gle reflector, illuminated by a lime ball, be substituted for each of
these 10, the effect of the three would be 26 times greater than that
of the 30. On account of the smaller divergence of the former, it
would be necessary to double their number, placing them in a hexa
gon instead of a triangle; in this case, the expense is estimated at
nearly the same. This method was tried lately at Purfleet, in a tem
porary light-house, erected for the purpose of experiments by the
Corporation of the Trinity House; and               its
                                                   superiority over all the
other lights with which       was contrasted, was fully ascertained and
                             it

scribedon   being  very  splendid.    Distinct shadows were discernible,
even   a as dark brick wall, though          no

                                                       such shadows could
 be  perceived when the other lights, consisting              reflectors, with
                                                                 of

Argand lamps and the French lens, were directed              the same spot.

discernible when the reflector was turned,            so  be itself invisible

On the Electro-magnetic Properties of metalliferous Veins in the Mines
  of Cornwall.    By Robert Were Fox, of Falmouth.      Communicated
  by the President. Read June 10, 1830. [Phil. Trans. 1830, p. 399.]
  The author having been led from theory to entertain the belief
that a connexion existed between electric action in the interior of
the earth, and the arrangement of metalliferous veins, and also the
progressive increase of temperature in the strata of the earth as we
descend from the surface, proceeded to the verification of this opinion
by experiment.    His first trial was unsuccessful; but in the second
he obtained decisive evidence of considerable electrical action in the
mine of Huel Jewel in Cornwall.       His apparatus consisted of small
plates of sheet copper, which were fixed in contact with one in the
veins by copper nails, or else wedged closely against them with wood
en props stretched across the galleries.   Between two of these plates
at different stations, a communication was made by means of copper
wire one twentieth of an inch in diameter, which included a gal
vanometer in     its
                   circuit.                    In
                                some instances, 300 fathoms     copper-                                        of

Sequel to a Paper on the tendency to Calculous Diseases, and on the
   Concretions to which such Diseases give rise. By John Yelloly, M.D.
   F.R.S. &c. Read June 17, 1830. [Phil. Trans. 1830, p. 415.]
   The author, in a paper published in the last volume of the Philo
sophical Transactions, gave the analysis of 328 calculi contained
in the collection of the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital; and has
been since enabled to complete the analysis of the 335 remaining
specimens, which have now been divided.        The results of the ana
lysis are given in a tabular form, exhibiting in the order of their
occurrence from the centre, the consecutive deposits of the different
materials of which the calculi are composed, according to the most
prominent character of such material.       The most remarkable cir
cumstance brought to light in the course of this investigation, is
the discovery of the presence of silex in one specimen composed
principally of oxalate of lime, and weighing about 5 grains.       The
particles of silex were very minute, and were imbedded in, and dif
fused through, the oxalate of lime.      Three examples of a similar
occurrence are   quoted by the author.
   The paper concludes with a few remarks on the statistical con
clusions stated in his former communication.        He thinks there is
reason to believe that the average number of calculous disorders in
Scotland has been much underrated; on the other hand, the prone
ness to those complaints is very small in Ireland.      A much larger
proportion of calculous cases occurs in towns than in the country.
