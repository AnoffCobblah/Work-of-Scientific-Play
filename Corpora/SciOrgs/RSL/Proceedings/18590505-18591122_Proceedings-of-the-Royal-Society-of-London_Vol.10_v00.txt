                                  (Abstract.)
   The author      sketches    the investigation  of the way of throwing
various series of integer terms into arithmetical progressions, such as
the sums of squares, cubes, &c. of figurate numbers, of the powers
of  a number, &c.       He  also gives the resolution  of a given number,

in certain cases, into an arithmetical progression.             Thus, having the
theorem that       N    can be resolved     into an arithmetical      progression
when      16  N+  1  is a square, he is enabled      to detect factors in  N   ;  he
thus shows       that 2079519603 has 43 and 101 among its factors.
Among        theorems which        the method       gives,  may be noticed       the
following, as one of a peculiar and unstudied class.              If in the series
 I,   3, 5, 7, &c. four terms be taken, and the next one omitted, then
 the four next terms taken and the next three omitted, then four
 terms taken and five omitted, and so on, the four terms taken will
 in every case consist of numbers prime to one another.
 II.    Abstract of       a   Memoir     "On      the   Electric   Properties      of
         Insulating      or   Non-conducting          Bodies."     By Professor
         Carlo Matteucci             of Pisa.      Communicated by Major-
         General     Sabine, R.A., V.P. and Treas. R.S.                  Received
         April 14, 1859.
      The object of the author in the first part of this memoir is to
  ascertain by experiment what condition is assumed               by insulating or
  non-conducting bodies in the presence of an electrified body, and in
  what     degree   such condition      is developed in insulating       bodies of
  different kinds.       In  a memoir published nearly ten years ago          (Ann.
  de   Chim.   et de   Phys., xxvii. p. 134),    he had shown that a cylinder      of
  gum-lac, sulphur,        stearic  acid, or the like, suspended     by  a filament
  of silk, and brought near to a body charged with electricity, begins
  to oscillate in the same way as         a  cylinder   of metal.    The non-con
   ducting cylinder, whilst under the influence of induction,               behaves
  like any body charged with opposite electricities, and returns to its
   natural state when the induction ceases.
       These experiments have now been very carefully repeated with
   cylinders formed of various insulating substances, made as nearly as
   possible of the same length and perfectly diselectrized.            The air    was
    rendered perfectly dry, and the           inducing     ball was charged with
    electricity to  a   constant degree, measured       by the torsion-balance.
        After giving a numerical statement of the time of oscillation and
     the moment of the induced force, as determined by experiment for
    cylinders of different insulating substances, and after describing other

                                             3
experiments intended to prove the insulating                  property of the ma
terials employed, the author goes on to observe that there is but one
way of explaining the phenomena in question, namely, by supposing
that the individual particles or molecules of the non-conducting
cylinder acquire different electrical states at their opposite extremi
ties, and that these electrical states, while they are readily developed
and neutralized within      each particle, meet with great resistance                   in
passing from one    particle to another, — a condition of non-conducting
bodies which      constitutes     the molecular         electric    polarization        of
Faraday.
  The author then         gives   the result of some experiments on the
amount of electrical charge communicated to, or given out by an
insulated conducting ball surrounded, at one time by air, at another
time by an insulating substance,         such as sulphur.
  In conclusion, the author thinks that the following propositions
may be regarded as rigorously demonstrated by experiment                       :   —
   1.   The   effects produced    on insulating        cylinders in the presence
of an electrified body, depend on the                 state   of molecular electric
polarity which that body developes in the cylinders ; and thus the
hypothesis of Faraday is directly demonstrated by experiment.
  2. Other      circumstances being alike, the insulating                power of        a
substance is greater in proportion               as its degree     of polarization is
weaker.
  3.  The electric capacity of a conducting body — that  the quan        is,
tity of electricity which    acquires when placed in communication
                             it
with    asource of electricity —     much greater when the body
                                        is                                              is
surrounded with sulphur,          or some other solid isolating substance,
than when surrounded by air.             Similarly,     the body being electrified
from the same source        and then surrounded with                sulphur,       or else
surrounded with air, afterwards yields to the same conductor much
less electricity in the former case than in the latter.
  4. The effects produced          by   insulating     plates interposed between
the armatures of    a   Leyden jar or of         a   magic square     are explained,
together  with the phenomena previously described, both by the
penetration of the electricity into the interior of the insulating sub
stance, and the propagation of electricity along the surface of the
plates.

  III. " On     the Synthesis      of Acetic Acid." By J. A. Wanklyn,
         Esq.     Communicated by Dr. E. Frankland.                         Received
         April 27, 1859.
     I  have  elsewhere* shown that a salt of
                                                             propionic acid results
  when carbonic acid is brought into contact
                                                        with a compound consist
  ing of ethyl and an alkali-metal.           Guided by a well-known principle,
  I also inferred that an analogous reaction is common to the whole
  vinic series.
     Believing, however, that it was desirable to
                                                            investigate other mem
  bers of the series, I have since
                                             undertaken the case of the corre
 sponding methyl-compound, and find that it
                                                          fully bears out the law,
 as will be manifest from the
                                     following details.
     Some   sodium-methyl in mixture with zinc-methyl, zinc, sodium,
 and ether was obtained by
                                   acting with sodium upon a strong ethereal
 solution of zinc-methyl.         The product so obtained was divided into
 two portions — one of which was
                                           exposed to the action of a current
 of dry carbonic acid, and the other
                                               reserved for comparison.
    During the transmission of carbonic acid, the
                                                                      sodium-methyl
 became hot.       After the completion of the reaction, the
                                                                            resulting
 solid was treated with a little
                                       mercury,      in order to convert any free
 sodium into an amalgam, which would
                                                   not decompose water with too
 great violence.
    Subsequent distillation      of the product, with         excess of dilute sul
 phuric acid, yielded     a distillate having most
                                                         distinctly the smell and
taste of acetic acid.       This acid distillate was
                                                               redistilled, when it
proved to be free from sulphuric acid.
    Some of it was converted into a
                                             silver-salt by digestion with oxide
of silver. This silver-salt was
                                         dissolved in hot water, filtered hot,
and allowed to crystallize on
                                    cooling.       An abundant crop of crystals
separated, which was drained from the
                                                    mother-liquor, the employ
ment of a filter being avoided.           The crystals were afterwards dried
in vacuo over sulphuric acid until
                                            they no longer lost weight.
    Determinations of silver were made
                                                 by ignition, the resulting silver
being reheated and reweighed until it
                                                 remained constant.

    Comparison of these results with the composition of acetate of
 silver gives as        follows : —
                                            Calculated.                       Found.

 which leaves no doubt as to the presence of acetic acid.
   Still further proof of the            same was obtained by converting a little
 of the acid           into a soda-salt, and heating it with arsenious acid.
 Abundance of kakodyl was evolved.
   In     order        to remove      any   doubt      which      might exist as to the
 source    of   this acetic acid, and to show that it did not arise from
 oxidation of the ether which                accompanied the sodium-methyl,                    I
 operated upon some of the original                    sample which had never been
 exposed to carbonic acid, and which, as previously mentioned, had
been    laid    aside for comparison.
   I   mixed it with         a   little mercury, distilled with excess of dilute
 sulphuric acid, and         digested    the redistilled        distillate with oxide of
 silver, using the same samples              of acid and of oxide of silver                as in
 the former experiment.
    The distillate neither smelt like acetic acid, nor yielded acetate of
 silver on spontaneous evaporation to dryness in vacuo of its product
 with oxide of silver.           Neither could kakodyl be obtained on heating
 its soda-residue with arsenious acid.
   From        all which it is evident that the acetic acid obtained must
 have been the product             of the action of carbonic acid.             The following
conclusion       is,   therefore, established     :  —
   Dry carbonic acid          is   decomposed         by   sodium-methyl with evolution
of heat, and production of             acetate   of   soda.

I. "On        the Resistance     of Glass Globes and Cylinders to collapse
        from external pressure, and on the Tensile and Compressive
        Strength of various kinds of Glass."                   By William Fair-
        bairn, Esq., C.E., F.R.S., and T. Tate, Esq., F.R.A.S.
        Received May 3, 1859.
                                      (Abstract.)
     The  researches contained in this paper are            in continuation of those
upon the Resistance of Wrought-Irou                   Tubes to collapse, which
have been published in the 'Philosophical Transactions'                      for 1858.
 The results arrived at in those experiments                  were    so important    as
 to suggest       further   inquiry under the       same      conditions of rupture
 with other materials         ; and glass was selected,        not only as differing
 widely in its physical properties from wrought iron, and hence well
 fitted to extend our knowledge of the laws of collapse, but because
 our acquaintance with its strength in the various forms in which it
 is employed in the arts and in scientific research                    is very limited.
 To arrive at satisfactory conclusions, the experiments on this mate
  rial were extended so as to embrace            the direct tenacity, the resist
  ance to compression, and the resistance             to bursting, as well as the
  resistance     to collapse.

   periments upon the direct tenacity of glass made by tearing speci
   mens    asunder are less satisfactory than those in the rest of the
   paper   ;  and it is argued that more reliance is to be placed upon the
   tenacity deduced from the experiments on the resistance                     of globes
   to bursting in which water-pressure was employed, than upon the
   tenacity     obtained     directly   by   tearing     specimens       asunder.    The

     Resistance      of Glass      to Crushing.    —The       experiments in this section
were made upon small cylinders and cubes of glass crushed between
parallel steel surfaces           by means of a lever.              The cylinders       were cut
 of the required length from rods drawn to the required diameter,
 when molten, and then- annealed,                  in this way retaining the exterior
 and first cooled skin of glass.                    The cubes were cut from much
 larger portions, and were in consequence                      probably in a less perfect
 condition as regards annealing.                  Hence, as might have been antici
 pated, the results upon the two classes of specimens,                           although con
 sistent in each case, differ widely from one another.

  the concussion ; it appeared,               however, that the fracture occurred in
  vertical planes,        splitting    up the specimen          in all directions.         Cracks
  were noticed to form some time before the specimen                                 finally gave
  way   ;   then these rapidly          increased in number, splitting                  the glass
  into innumerable            prisms,     which      finally    bent or broke,           and the

   Hence, comparing the results on cyliuders with those ou cubes, we
find a mean superiority in the former case in the ratio of 1-6                                : 1,
due to the more perfect annealing of the glass.
    Chi the Resistance         of Glass Globes           to internal pressure.         — In these
experiments the tenacity of glass is obtained by a method free from
the objections to that before detailed.                      Glass globes, easily obtained
of the requisite      sizes,     iu   a nearly spherical form, were subjected to
an internal pressure obtained by means of a hydraulic                                 pump, uni
formly and steadily increased                till the globe        gave way.        The lines of
fracture radiated in every direction from the weakest part, passing
round the globe as meridians of longitude and splitting                                it up into
thin bands, varying from              ^th      to ^th     of  an inch in breadth.

   The formula which     expresses the relation     of the bursting pressure
to the thickness and diameter of the globe, is —
 ,where a = the longitudinal sectional      area of the material in      square
inches, that is in the line of rupture or line of minimum strength              ;
A = the longitudinal sectional area of the globe in square inches               ;
and   T=   the tenacity     of the   glass   in pounds per       square   inch.
 Hence from the above experiments we deduce          —
                           Pounds.
                      T=4200 for flint-glass,
                         =4800 for     green glass,

                            5000= mean tenacity of       glass.
Here the   mean tenacity is nearly twice that obtained in the experi
ments upon thick bars     ; a result, which perhaps corresponds with the
difference between the crushing strength of cylinders and cubes, and
is largely attributable to the condition of annealing.
    On the Resistance    of Glass Globes and Cylinders to an external
pressure. — The manner of conducting these experiments did not
differ in any essential   detail from that pursued in the experiments
upon wrought iron.        The globes and cylinders, after having           been
hermetically   sealed  in the blowpipe flame, were fixed in a wrought-
iron boiler communicating with a hydraulic pump.              In  this position
an increasing    pressure    was   applied until the globes        broke,   the
amount of pressure at the time being noted by means of a Schaffer
pressure-gauge.     During the collapse the        globes   were    reduced to
the smallest fragments, so that no indication of the direction of the
primary lines of fracture could be discovered.

globes subjected to an external pressure : —

II. "On        the Atomic Weight of Graphite."            By Benjamin C.
         Brodie, Esq., F.R.S., Pres. C.S., Professor of Chemistry
         in the University of Oxford. Received May 5, 1859.
                                 (Abstract.)
     In   this paper the author arrives at the following results      : — That
 carbon in the form of graphite forms a system              of peculiar   com
 pounds, different from any compounds            of carbon yet known, and
 capable of being procured        only from graphite.         That graphite,
 within certain limits, functions    as a distinct element,    capable indeed
 of being converted by certain       processes    of oxidation into carbonic
 acid and thus identified with the other forms of carbon, but having
  a distinct atomic weight, namely 33       (H=l).
      After the detail of certain experiments by which the author was
  led to believe in the existence of a distinct system of compounds of
  graphite,    an  account is given of a peculiar       crystalline substance
   formed by the prolonged       oxidation    of graphite.    This  substance
  consists of transparent plates of a pale yellow colour, which exhibit
   under the microscope an appearance       distinctly crystalline.  The   ana
   lysis of this substance gave for its formula Cu H, O, (C= 12, 0= 16).
   From the ratio of the hydrogen to the oxygen in this substance,
   from the circumstance that it is procured from graphite alone, and
   from its general physical properties, it is inferred that this substance
   is the term in the system       of graphite which corresponds to the
   compound of silicon, oxygen and hydrogen, in the system of silicon,
   procured by Wohler from the graphitoidal form of that element,

                                         12
  and to which Wohler has assigned the formula Si4H405 (Si=2l).
  If it be assumed that this conclusion is correct, the further inference
 is that the bodies are similarly constituted.         On this hypothesis, to
 arrive at the atomic weight of graphite, the total weight of carbon,
  132, is to be divided by 4, which gives the number 33 ; and for the
 formula of the body, putting        Gr=33,    we have Gr4 H4      O,.
     This conclusion     is confirmed in a remarkable manner by the spe
 cific heat of graphite.        The specific heat of the elemental bodies
 varies   inversely    with   their atomic weight.        This law is so well
 established,     that Regnault     has even    proposed       to determine     the
 atomic weight by it exclusively.          There are, at any rate, only two
 numbers which can be assigned as the product of the specific heat
 into the atomic weight of the elemental bodies,                namely, approxi
 mately the numbers 3-3 and 6-6.           But to this law there is       one sin
 gular exception.      Carbon in all its forms is anomalous.          The specific
heats    of diamond, graphite,       and wood-charcoal       are each    different,
and taking the atomic weight of carbon as          6  or  1 2,  no one is accord
ant with the law.         The specific heat of graphite is 0-20187.          Now,
taking the      atomic weight of graphite as 33, we have 33X201=6-63,
a result     in  accordance    with the law.     The inference       is, that the
 assertion that 33 is the atomic weight of graphite is not only a con
venient expression of chemical analysis, but corresponds to a phy
sical fact.

    Before commencing         a research  into the electric conductivity         of
alloys, the author deemed it requisite, as           a   preliminary     step,   to

                                        13
determine      their specific gravities ; and the methods employed                 and
results    obtained in this inquiry are given in the present paper.
    The metals used        were   antimony, tin, cadmium, bismuth, silver,
lead, mercury,      and gold.        The silver and gold        were obtained in a
 state   of purity from      the refiners,    the other metals were purified by
 methods which are described.              The quantity prepared of       each alloy
 was twenty      grammes.        The   fused    alloys were cast in     a  form and
 very     thin, to avoid internal cavities from crystallization.                 Three
 separate determinations were made of their specific gravity, which, to
 gether with the mean result, are given in Tables.                 In every   case the
 alloy was recast at least three times before the first determination, and
 once again before each succeeding one.                  The distilled water      used
 in the weighing was first boiled and allowed to cool in vacuo,                    and
 the    alloys were suspended       in it by    a fine platinum wire, except the
 soft amalgams, which were weighed in a tube similarly suspended.
 In calculating the      specific   gravities, the weight of water displaced
 was corrected for the temperature, the             unit in all cases being distilled
 water at 0° C.       All   the weighings were reduced to a vacuum, and a
 correction was made for the platinum wire which dipped in the water.
      The numerical results      are stated in three Tables,       of which    the first
 gives the specific gravities of the pure metals employed, and the tem
  perature in Centigrade degrees         ;  the second gives the same of the al
  loys  ;  and the third exhibits the mean specific gravities found, and the
  specific gravities as calculated, — 1, from the volume of the metals
  forming the alloy    ; 2,  from their equivalent      ; and 3,  from their weight.
      From the last Table it appears that the alloys of antimony are
  greater in volume than the aggregate of the constituent metals, while
  those    of bismuth, silver, and gold       are less.    The following alloys     ex
  pand greatly on cooling, viz. all those of bismuth-antimony,               bismuth-
  gold, and bismuth-silver,         which      were experimented on        ;  those   of
   bismuth-tin, from Bi6 Sn to Bia Sn, the rest of the series very slightly ;
  and bismuth-lead, viz. Bi, Pb and Bi, Pb (Bia Pb slightly), the rest
  apparently not at all.         Of the bismuth- cadmium series, Bi8 Cd and
   Bi  Cd4 expand very slightly, the rest not at all.            The zinc-alloys     are
   all so very crystalline      that no results of value were obtained re
   specting them.

    This paper is   a continuation  of one published in the     Philosophical
Transactions     for 1852 (p. 289), and discusses       the general question
of the anatomical structure of the          stems of Monocotyledons          and
Dicotyledons, especially in    reference   to some objections taken against
the author's views respecting the stems of the Nymphaeaceae.                Cer
tain peculiarities of the structure of roots are next examined, and
these   are   shown    to be  formed     on   the Dicotyledonous       type in
Victoria.
    The germination of the     seed is described   in  a manner differing to
some    extent from     the accounts given by Planchon,          Trecul,     and
Hooker.      The error of Trecul, in stating that the earlier       leaves are
devoid of a stipule, is shown to depend upon his overlooking the
true axillary position of that organ.
    The Phyllotaxy is next treated, with the development and arrange
ment of the leaves and roots ; lastly, a complete history of the develop
ment of the flower, showing that the apparently inferior position             of
the ovary depends upon a great         enlargement of the receptacle after

       F. Crace Calvert, Esq., and R. Johnson, Esq. Com
       municated by Professor Stokes, Sec. R.S.                     Received
       April 14, 1859.
                                 (Abstract).
    The object of the researches described in this paper, was to carry
out with reference to amalgams the investigations relative to alloys
 contained in     a former paper.    In comparing the results of theory
 and experiment in the manner followed in the former paper, the
conducting power of mercury itself was a constant, which                 it  was
 essential  to know.      The figure given in the former paper was
 mercury =6 77, on the scale silver= 1000. On adopting in the first
 instance this value of the conducting power of mercury, the results

                                            15
obtained with alloys, which consisted               mainly of mercury, appeared
very anomalous      ;  it seemed as      if a very small per-centage   of even the
best conducting metals reduced immensely the conducting power of
mercury.       But it    was suggested       to the authors, that the apparently
high conducting power of mercury obtained by their method, was
probably due to the transference of heat by convection ; that the
 real conducting power of mercury for heat was low, like its conduct
ing power for electricity         ;  that the other metal, contained in small
 quantity in the amalgam, acted by rendering the amalgam viscous,
 and thereby interfering with the transference of heat by convection,
 and that the low conducting             power of mercury would show itself on
 merely inclining       the vessel used in the experiment, so that the box
 containing the warm water should be higher than the other.                     Ex
 periment confirmed this view.                As the apparent conducting power
  of mercury    was   found continually to decrease with an increase in the
  inclination   of the    vessel,   it  was found necessary,     in order to obtain
  correct results, to arrange so that the bar-shaped box containing the
  mercury or fluid amalgam was actually vertical in the experiment.
   In  this way the authors obtained for mercury the figure 54, on the
   same scale as before.         It   is worthy of remark, that mercury comes
   out the worst conductor              of all the metals tried, the figure for
   bismuth, which had previously been the lowest, being 6 1 . This is
   in analogy with water, also a fluid, the conducting power of which
   is known to be excessively          low.    The conducting power of the more
   fluid   amalgams     determined by experiment with the box               vertical,
    proved to be in all cases nearly the same as that of pure mercury,
    in conformity with the law mentioned by the authors in their former
    paper, that alloys in which there is an excess of the number of
     equivalents of the worse conducting metal, over the number of
     equivalents of the better conductor, do not sensibly differ in con
     ducting power from the worse              conductor   alone.   In the   case  of
     amalgams generally, the conducting power obtained by experiment
     was found to agree pretty closely with the number calculated from
     the per-centages     and conducting powers of the component metals.
        In conclusion, the authors give           some further  experiments on the
     conduction of heat by compound bars, formed of metals placed in
     some cases end to end in alternate cubes,           in other cases side by side
     in parallel bars, extending the whole length of the compound bar.

                                          Hi
 Among bars of the latter kind, it was found that it was only in the
 case  of bismuth   and antimony that the compound bar conducted heat
 according to the calculated amount.

        vessels,  of the Human Lung." By A.T.H. Waters, Esq.,
        Lecturer on Anatomy and Physiology,                 Liverpool.        Com

        1859.
    Having   been recently engaged in investigating the anatomy               of the
 human lung,     I beg to lay before the Royal Society some          of the results
 of my observations with         respect to the arrangement     of   the   ultimate
air-tubes and the distribution of the blood-vessels          of the organ.
    The bronchial-tubes of the lungs, after several divisions and sub
 divisions, which for the most part are of a dichotomous nature,
terminate in a dilatation, into which open a number of elongated
cavities,  which constitute the ultimate expressions of the air-tubes.
These elongated      cavities,   to which various names have been given,           I
propose to call air-sacs, as being, in my opinion, more appropriate to
their shape and arrangement than any term hitherto                used   ;  and the
series   of air-sacs   connected     with the extremity of each bronchial
twig, with its system of blood-vessels,        &c,  I  shall call  a  lobulette.
    Every lobule of a lung is composed         of a number of lobulettes, and
thus the description of        a  single lobulette will suffice for that of the
entire lobule.
    Each lobulette consists of a collection of air-sacs, which vary in
number from six to eight, ten or twelve.               The air-sacs     are some
what elongated     cavities, communicating with the dilated extremity of
a  bronchial tube by a circular opening, which is usually smaller than
the sac itself, and has sometimes        the appearance of    a circular hole in
a  diaphragm, or as     if it  had been punched out of a membrane which

                                                 17
bad been     stretched         across the entrance       to the sac.     When this is the
case,   the sac dilates suddenly beyond the opening.                       The    sacs  of the
lobulette   are placed side by side, and are separated                    from each other
by thin membranous                walls.     Their     shape,   when properly inflated,
or when      distended          by some      material which         has   set in them, as
gelatine,   or     a   mixture of wax         and    turpentine, is polygonal.           They
approach       the circular form, but               in consequence        of their mutual
pressure, the parietes become somewhat flattened.                        The    sacs increase
slightly in size        as they pass from the bronchial tube to their fundus,
the latter    being usually the broadest part of the                 sacs  ;  but they often
have an almost             uniform     diameter throughout.             All   the   sacs pass
from the     extremity of the bronchial tube toward* the circumference
of the lobule of which the lobulette forms a part ; they consequently
 radiate from the tip of the bronchial twig. The sacs connected with
 one   lobulette do         not communicate with those              of another lobulette.
 As the sacs pass towards the boundary of the lobulette, they often
 bifurcate   ;     and here       and    there circular       orifices   exist,   leading to
 smaller    air-sacs,      sometimes       only to    a small group      of " air-cells,"   or
 alveoli.      If we     trace the air-sacs from their fundus, we may say that,
 passing   from the periphery of the lobulette,                   and diminishing       some
 what in size, they all terminate in the dilated extremity of the bron
  chial tube     ;    as they      thus    proceed they often join two or three
  together, and these terminate in                a  single mouth.        The tube which
  results from the union of two or more sacs, is smaller in capacity
  than   the   sacs taken together, but greater than either                   of them indi
  vidually.     The dilated extremity of the bronchial tube above alluded
  to  constitutes the " point de reunion" of all the air-sacs, and may
   be considered as the common centre                  of the lobulette.
     The walls of which the            air-sacs are composed         are exceedingly thin,
  and much sacculated, i. e.              they have in them a number of small,
  shallow, cup-like depressions,             separated     from each other by portions
  of membrane which               are more or less raised           and    project into the
  interior of the sac.            The bottom of the air-sac             presents    the   same
  appearance        as the lateral walls        ;   and   the cup-like       depressions,    or
  alveoli, are there very numerous.                The number of       these alveoli varies
  very much      ;   I  have counted as many as ten at the fundus of an air-
  sac in a cat's      lung   ;  in the human lung           I have counted five and six,
  but the number is not              usually quite so great.          Close to the bottom
     vol. x.                                                                        c

                                                   18
in some of the air-sacs in the human lung,                        a   circular opening, similar
to those        already alluded to as leading to other sacs, small and con
stricted, is often seen, and has the appearance                         as   if   it led to another
sac ; on examination, however,                    it will   be found to be produced                       by
a    projection inwards of the membrane of the                               sac, and to lead             to
a    small cavity, or group of alveoli.
   The number of alveoli existing in the air-sacs varies — Rossignol
states that each " infundibulum" (air-sac) contains from ten to twenty
alveoli.        My own observations entirely accord with this statement.
I    have found the number varying from eight to twenty.
     The     air-sacs      externally,    by their fundus, rest on the pleura, but
within the substance of the lung they in part rest on, and are sup
ported by, the bronchial tubes and blood-vessels.
     The      air-sacs      are separated     from each           other by thin walls, the
membrane composing which, in a lung inflated and dried, is very
transparent.              The projection of this membrane in the                           shape     of   a
thin       process,   having     a   sharp margin, constitutes the septa between
the alveoli       ;   and wherever an opening exists leading into                           a    smaller
sac, this membrane projects in a similar way, and forms a circular
orifice which is much smaller than the cavity to which it leads                                       :   —
the sac, in fact, dilates abruptly on the distal side of the opening.
It   is in the membrane              composing these walls, and in the septa of the
alveoli, that the capillaries of the pulmonary artery are spread out.
     The number of             air-sacs   belonging to        a   lobulette varies           :   I   have
counted as many as six communicating with a bronchial tube incised
horizontally, so that probably only half the sacs were left                                      ;   this,
however,        is a larger number than is usually found                      ;   from six to eight
or ten is the more common number.
     Each lobulette          is separated    from those by which it is surrounded,
by walls which appear to resemble in every way the walls of the air-
sacs   ;    and in an adult inflated and dried lung, careful observation is
necessary       to make out the partitions.                  That perfect           septa do exist,
is proved by laying             open,     in a recent lung, a bronchial tube to its
ultimate division, when by placing a fine blowpipe in                                it,   and blow
ing down        it,   a   single lobulette   is   alone inflated.
   The separation of the lobulettes    further distinctly perceptible in
                                                     is
the recent lungs of infants, in which the line of demarcation between
the lobulettes        is   often plainly seen, on the surface.

                                            19
    The observation       of the    foetal lung,     however,      affords most satis
factory evidence       of the separation of the lobulettes, and                 tends   to
confirm the views here taken of the arrangement of the ultimate air-
tubes.
    The recent lung of a full-grown foetus presents on its surface no
appearance of air-sacs, or vesicles, or cells ; but if it be inflated, it
will present different      appearances,     according      as  the inflation has been
partial or entire.         In  a portion      of lung only partially inflated, a
number     of tubes will    be seen   terminating beneath the pleura in caecal
extremities,    their light colour         contrasting       strongly with      the sur
rounding dark-coloured           tissue.      The   exact      arrangement of these
tubes may be sometimes          seen.     They will     be found to exist in groups
or clusters, and      are seen to pass from the caecal ends to a point,                 in
which they terminate, and where they all appear to join ; or, to de
 scribe them in the inverse direction, they pass from a point at some
 distance from the surface,           and radiate towards the pleura.                 The
 tubes are seen to have numerous constrictions and bulgings                        ; they
 terminate in extremities rounded, or nearly so.                   In  a preparation     of
 this kind it is often easy to          see  the bronchial        tube for a short dis
 tance before    it terminates    ; and not only is the terminal group of air-
 sacs (lobulette)     visible, but two or more of the previous ones arising
 laterally from the bronchial tube may be also seen.                    The uninflated
 lung-substance lying between the distended air-sacs is distinctly seen
  when there has been only slight inflation             ;  and the isolated condition
  of  each  group of sacs is very apparent            ;   the sacs passing from        dif
  ferent points     are seen radiating        in different directions.         In  a lung
  which has been fully inflated, the grouped appearance                     is lost, and
  the ordinary condition of the distended lung is observed.
     If, in a foetal lung, we follow out a bronchial                tube, we find that
  the smaller branches of the tube have connected with them clusters
  of little pyriform red-coloured          bodies,   which look very much like            a
  number of    grapes attached to their stalks.            In  a foetus of six months     I
  have found it somewhat difficult to separate each individual body, but
  in a full-grown foetus there is no difficulty in doing so; each little body
  is attached to a short pedicle.             If air    be blown down a bronchial
  tube leading to the exposed bodies,            the latter become distended.
     The little bodies just described            are the ready-formed groups             of
  air -sacs, or lobulettes;      the pedicle with which             each is connected     is
                                                                            c 2

the terminal       bronchial     twig.      The lobulette thus formed is sur
rounded by its sheath, and no communication exists between it and
 adjoining ones.
    That the     appearances       I have    described in the artificially inflated
foetal lung are not the result          of any abnormal distension,      I have   been
able to prove by observing the same appearances                   in the lung of     a
child in which only partial respiration had taken place.
     Do the air-sacs communicate with each other by any orifices ex
cept that by which they communicate with the bronchial tube ?
     Different opinions have been expressed on this point.                    Adriani
states    that he has observed            such orifices, and specially mentions
that they are most clearly to be seen in the stag.                Dr. Thomas Wil
liams considers that the         " intercellular              " intercommunicate,
                                                    passages
and are perforated by secondary passages at every point.                  Rossignol,
 Schultz,     Mandl, and Milne-Edwards, deny the existence                   of such
communications.           From observations, made with much                 care   and
frequently repeated,       I have    satisfied myself that the opinion expressed
by the latter authors is correct.               I have never found, either in the
lung of man        or in that of the dog, cat, pig, sheep,             or any other
 mammal       I  have    examined,      any lateral orifices of communication
 between     the sacs of a lobulette.
     Alveoli of   the  Bronchial Tubes. — The termination of the bronchial
tubes has      a special    character, first pointed out by Rossignol.              He
says,
         " In  the bronchial divisions of the two last, and sometimes three
last orders, it is plainly seen, when they are opened longitudinally,
 that their surface is covered over, or, as it were, honeycombed with
 a number of small, regular, shallow cavities, placed side by side, and
 separated     by thin perfect walls of the same height,              which project
into the interior        of the bronchial tube."           The   existence   of  these
 bronchial     alveoli has been noticed by subsequent              observers;     they
 may be easily seen in        a   lung injected and inflated, and sometimes
 even in one which has been simply soaked in spirit for a few days                    ;
they resemble        the alveoli of the air-sacs       ; they are best seen in the
 lungs of some of the lower animals, as the cat, in which                    they are
 found in the ultimate bronchial tubes              and their dilated extremities.
 In man     I  have    never   seen them, except         at  the extremity of the
 tubes ;   and in many lungs          I  have found no appearance         of them at
 all — they appear to become obliterated with advancing age.                    In the

                                            21
 infant  I  have found them in the last divisions          of the bronchial     tubes,
 and their dilated extremities, but not in the penultimate or earlier
 branches    ;  and even in the last divisions they are not always present
 previous to the dilatation.           In  respect  of the extent, therefore,        to
 which these alveoli exist in the human lung, my observations do not
 quite accord with those of Rossignol.
    The Blood-vessels      of the Lungs. — The branches of the pulmonary
 artery accompany the bronchial             tubes, arrived at the extremity          of
 which, they give off branches to the bronchial alveoli, and terminate
 in vessels which take their course in the walls of the air-sacs in no
 very definite or regular manner.            From   these vessels the pulmonary
 plexus arises.
    The pulmonary        veins, receiving the blood from the plexus             of the
 air-sacs, pass from the periphery of the lobulettes, and running in
 the spaces between        the lobules, make their way, independently, to
 the root of the lung.
    The pulmonary plexus is situated in the walls which separate the
air-sacs, in the septa of the alveoli, and around the margins of the
openings which exist in the sacs.              The plexus consists of       a single
layer of vessels, which,       as   already pointed out by       Mr. Rainey, is in
no instance doubled on itself.           In the  septa  of  the alveoli, and   in the
margins of the orifices alluded to, the plexus does not reach quite to
the free border of the membrane composing them.
    There is no distinct and separate vessel for each alveolus, but the
branches of the terminal artery take their course along the walls of
the air-sacs, and give off branches which for the most part run in
the septa of the alveoli        ;  some    of them, however,      pass across      the
alveoli.     From these vessels, and from the branches first mentioned,
the capillary plexus arises.            The plexus, when formed, maintains            a
tolerably uniform size throughout.              In   a well-injected preparation,
inflated and dried, it will       be seen that the spaces between        the vessels
are somewhat greater in diameter than the vessels themselves.
    The branches of the pulmonary artery              do not anastomose     till they
reach the termination of the bronchial               tubes  ; on the air-sacs they
anastomose       freely.   It  is somewhat difficult       to decide whether the
vessels  of  one lobulette anastomose         with  those  of another.     On look
ing at    a    preparation injected and dried, it seems            as though       the
septum, separating one lobulette from another, resembled                   in every

                                         22
 respect the walls    of the air-sacs  ;  but as  the lobulettes are originally
 separate and independent bodies, as seen in the foetal lung,            it is pro
 bable   that the vessels of each are distinct.          If  so, there must be,
 where the walls of twa lobulettes are in contact, two layers of capil
laries lying side by side      ; and from the mode of formation of the
 lobulettes, and from the fact that        I have    been able, in some prepa
rations of the adult lung, partially to separate            the lobulettes from
 one another,    I believe  that their vessels are distinct, that they ter
 minate in their proper radicle-vein, and that thus the capillaries on
 the outer wall of the lobulette are only exposed             on one side to the
 atmosphere.
    The Bronchial Vessels.      — It has long been held that the bronchial
 arteries   are distributed  to the air-tubes, the areolar tissue, and the
 vessels   of the lungs, and that they pour their contents partly into
 the pulmonary veins,      and   partly into certain      deep bronchial veins,
 which have been described by most anatomists as accompanying the
 arteries within the lungs.        An opinion       has also    been entertained
 that  a  communication     exists between     the bronchial vessels and the
 branches of the pulmonary arteries.           Without referring to the         ex
 periments and results of other observers,         I  proceed to state my own.
    My observations     have been made on the lungs          of the  cat, the dog,
 the   rabbit, the pig, the calf, and the sheep, as well as on those             of
 man.      The following remarks have special           reference   to the results
 obtained in the human lung.
    When the pulmonary artery is injected             so that the fluid    reaches
 the pulmonary plexus but does not pass to any extent into the pul
 monary veins, the blood-vessels of the bronchial mucous membrane
and of the other portions of the bronchial tubes never become in
jected.     When, however, the injection is continued so as to fill the
pulmonary veins, the vessels of the bronchial tubes become partially
injected.
    When the pulmonary        veins   are injected, whether the pulmonary
plexus be well-filled or not, the vessels of the bronchial tubes and             of
the bronchial mucous membrane are always injected.                 The bronchial
tubes    are often seen to be injected when the pulmonary plexus is
only very partially so, the fluid seeming            to find its way from       the
pulmonary veins into the vessels of the bronchial tubes more readily
than into the capillaries of the air-sacs.

                                        23
   When a bronchial artery, as it enters the substance of the lung, is
injected, the vessels of the bronchial tubes become filled — both those
of the mucous membrane and of the deeper portions — and the fluid
finds its way      into the pulmonary       veins.    If  the injection be con
tinued, it is easy to inject the pulmonary plexus through the medium
of  the  bronchial arteries   ; and injection is often found in the branches
of the pulmonary arteries.
    In injecting    a bronchial artery   in the human subject,        I have  always
found that part      of the bronchial tubes     nearest the point       of insertion
of the injection pipe     more   fully injected, both     as regards the mucous
membrane and the deeper structures, than the parts situated towards
the extremity of the tubes.        I  have found the larger branches injected
 nearly to the end of the tubes, but not the fine vessels of the mucous
 membrane.        This seems to me to be due to the fact, that throughout
 the entire extent of the tubes there is so free a communication                  be
 tween the bronchial vessels and the pulmonary               veins, that the fluid
 finds its way into the latter more readily than into the fine plexus of
 the extreme tubes.
     The Bronchial Veins. — The examination             of    a large number of
 specimens, both of the lungs of man and the lower animals, and the
 injection of the vena azygos        on several    occasions,   have not enabled
 me to find the so-called deep bronchial veins, as venx comites                of the
 bronchial arteries.      I have always found a small vein or veins, gene
 rally  a  single one, situated at the posterior aspect of the bronchus,
 and terminating,       as shown by the injection,          in the structures of
 bronchus,     lower part of trachea, and glands at the root of the
 lung, but not passing along the bronchial tubes within the lung, and
 therefore being in no way concerned in returning the blood distri
 buted to those parts by the bronchial arteries.
     A  piece  of human lung well injected by the bronchial artery, ex
 hibits on the mucous membrane of the bronchial tubes, a fine plexus
 of   vessels,  taking for the most part a longitudinal direction ; under
 these    other vessels are found, which run transversely beneath the
 elastic tissue, in the direction of the muscular fibres            ;   these deeper
 vessels    are larger than the superficial ones      ;  there is  a   distinct com
 munication between the two sets.
     I now pass to consider in what manner,           and where,      the communi

                                                       24
cation which undoubtedly exists                            between       the   pulmonary and bron
chial vessels, takes place.
   If the   statement         I   have made with reference                     to the bronchial veins
be true, those vessels do not return the blood supplied by the bron
chial arteries, except so far as the latter vessels distribute it to the
bronchi themselves               and the structures about the root of the lung                               ;
and the next point we have to examine is whether any communica
tion exist between the bronchial arteries and the pulmonary arteries.
In all the    best injections              I   have    made, whether           in man or the lower
animals, in which the injection was introduced by the pulmonary artery,
I have    never found the vessels of the bronchial tubes injected unless the
pulmonary veins were well-filled, and in such specimens                                      I   have seen
vessels    passing from the bronchial                        tubes, and        joining   a branch         of a
pulmonary vein.              I    have         found branches             of the pulmonary artery
containing injection, when the latter has been introduced through the
bronchial artery        ;   but in such specimens                    I   have found portions         of the
pulmonary plexus injected, and                         I   believe       the injection has found its
way through the plexus into the pulmonary arteries.                                      I   have never
seen the vessels            described by some anatomists as passing from the
pulmonary artery to the bronchial tubes.
   With regard to the communication of the bronchial vessels with
the pulmonary veins, it admits of ocular proof.  It is unquestion
ably more easy to inject the vessels of the finer bronchial tubes
through the pulmonary veins, than through the bronchial arteries at
the root of the lung              ;   it   is also possible to inject those vessels to a
certain extent through the pulmonary veins, without injecting the
pulmonary plexus.                 On the             other    hand, the injection                thrown    in
through the bronchial                 arteries rapidly and readily finds its way into
the pulmonary veins.                  These facts seem to prove that the blood dis
tributed by the bronchial arteries within the lung is poured into the
pulmonary veins, and that the whole vascular system of the bron
chial tubes communicates with the same veins.
  It    has been stated by             Mr. Rainey, that the                 vessels   of the bronchial
tubes     anastomose         at the extremity                of the       tubes with     the vessels of
the "air-cells"         (air-sacs).             In this I cannot concur, for             I have      never
been able to     fill   these         extreme         vessels by injection through the                pul
monary artery.              My belief          is,   that at the termination of the tubes,

                                        25
as elsewhere,    the blood of the bronchial       arteries is poured into the
pulmonary veins.
   Dr. Heale    has advanced      the opinion that the bronchial arteries do
not supply the bronchial         mucous membrane at all, and that they
neither communicate with the pulmonary              arteries nor veins.    My
observations have given results entirely opposed to this view.
   With   reference    to the view taken by Adriani, and subsequently
adopted by Dr. Thomas Williams, that the vessels of the bronchial
mucous membrane terminate in the pulmonary veins, and those of
the deeper plexus in the bronchial veins, it is not borne out by the
experiments     I  have   made, which      appear to prove that not only do
the same vessels supply the superficial and deep plexuses of the
tubes, but that both plexuses discharge their contents into the same
receptacles.

       May 14, 1859.
                                    (Abstract.)
   The author     commences      with an allusion to papers published in the
                      '           '                     '
Linnean Society's       Journal     and ' Transactions    respecting groups of
organs, abundantly supplied with nerves, on the bases of the halteres
of Diptera,    also on the nervures      of the wings and on the elytra of
Coleoptera   ; and now gives     a  drawing which shows forth these organs,
and the nerve proceeding to them on the halteres. He then describes,
for the first time, somewhat similar organs on the apices of the palpi
of   some  Diptera, and on their base in many Hymenoptera, as Apis,
 V espa, Nomada, Meyachile,         Bombus, &c.     These are well shown in
the Vespa Crabro, or Hornet, where the nerve is seen expanding in
the thin membrane       which covers in the opening beneath in the wall of
the member.
    In the paper    also,  it is pointed out for the first time, that on   the
apex of the palpi of Lepidoptera there is invariably found a structure
which is more or less of a cavity, generally tubular, and sometimes
extending inwards nearly the length of the last segment,            but some

                                         26
times only a depression.          To it   a nerve   is given which expands on
the apex of the cavity.
    The author then      describes   groups of organs, allied in form to those
on the palpi, which are to be found on the legs of all insects                  yet
examined.        There are about three groups situated about the tro-
chantero-femoral joint, and to them nerves                can be distinctly    seen
proceeding     ;  and in Meloe the branch is seen to pass up the opening in
the wall, to terminate in a papilla in the centre of the membrane
covering it in.
     It is also shown that the bladder-like apex of the palpi, instead
 of being smooth,       as is generally described, is covered with          a great
 number of small         bodies,   something in form like ninepins, some
 times exceedingly small, requiring a £-inch objective to make them
 out, when they can clearly be discerned to be a modified condition of
 true hairs, copiously supplied with nerves.            The author     names these
 " tactile hairs," and points out their         existence   in all palpi used for
 touching, and in other organs subservient to that function.                  These
 tactile hairs are very large in the palpi and antennae of Dyticus mar
 ginalia.     The barrel-like organs of the Lepidoptera          are next investi
  gated, and are shown to have a nerve passing up them              ; but whether
 proceeding to the apex of the nipple-like              papilla on them or not,
  cannot be quite made out.            They   are pointed out as being nearly
 allied to the organs on each of the palpi of the Earwig (Forficula
  auricularia).
      The amhor refers to the       sacs found on the antennae       of all insects,
  which have been fully treated of in two papers read by him before the
  Linnean Society, and published in their ' Transactions              and he lastly
  examines    the probable functions of all these organs, which must be
  of sensation, probably special.
      Attention   is also called to the value of bleaching the tissues by
  chlorine in investigating the structure of insects,          which process    was
  first used by the author and described by him in the papers above
  mentioned.
      About forty     drawings accompany the paper illustrative              of the
  structures described.

III. " On     Lesions of the Nervous System producing Diabetes."
       By Frederick W. Pavy, M.D. Lond. &c. Communicated
       by Dr. Sharfey, Sec. R.S.            Received May 17, 1859.
                                   (Abstract.)
   The author    commenced     his paper by stating, that all the experiments
he had performed since his communication on the            " Alleged    Sugar-
           Function of the      Liver
                                      "  had been' placed in the possession
forming
of the Royal Society, had confirmed the conclusions he had there
arrived at.    As far   as bis knowledge extended,     it might   be said that
in the healthy liver during life there is a substance which            he had
spoken of under the term of hepatine, and which possesses             the che
mical property of being most rapidly transformed into sugar when
in contact with nitrogenized animal materials.            In the liver after
death this transformation        takes place, but in the liver during life
there seems a force       or a condition capable of overcoming the che
mical tendency to     a  saccharine metamorphosis.
   Experiments are mentioned to show that when the medulla oblon
gata is destroyed, and the circulation is maintained by the performance
of artificial respiration, the sugar formed in the liver           as a post
mortem occurrence is distributed through          the system, aud occasions
the secretion of urine possessing a strongly saccharine character.
   Although the destruction of the medulla oblongataleads to this effect,
 yet division of the spinal cord, which has been practised as high as
between    the second and third cervical vertebrae, has not been attended
with   a similar result.   The brain (cerebrum)      has also been separated
from the medulla oblongata by section through the crura cerebri, and
from the results of the experiments in which this operation has been
performed, Dr. Pavy believed that the functions of the brain may be
completely destroyed, without placing the liver in the condition no
ticeable after actual death, or after lesion of the medulla oblongata.
On account of the accidental disturbances, — such       as implication   of the
medulla oblongata, possibly by concussion, obstruction of the respi
ration, and the effects of the great loss of blood sometimes attending
division of the crura cerebri, — the interpretation of the result is ren
dered a little difficult.    In  an experiment, which     proved most con
clusive, performed to corroborate the author's previous observations

                                         28
 whilst his communication was being written, there were none           of these
 disturbing circumstances. In a healthy dog, during a period of diges
 tion, the crura cerebri were completely divided.            The animal was
 thereby thrown into a state of unconsciousness,      but breathed efficiently
 of its own accord.       The urine in     an hour and a quarter's    time was
 found perfectly free from sugar.
    After poisoning by strychnine, the effect is the same as after de
 struction of the medulla oblongata. The circulation being maintained
 by artificial respiration, the urine becomes strongly saccharine.
    Looking to   these facts, and to the effect    of Bernard's puncture of
 the fourth ventricle in producing diabetes, the author is led to regard
 the medulla oblongata as a centre, either directly presiding over the
 functional activity of the liver, or indirectly affecting it by altering
 through the medium of another or other organs the condition of the
blood going to it    ; and he has endeavoured      to establish upon positive
grounds the channel by which the propagation of the nervous influ
ence may take place.        It was this line of research that conducted to
the discovery of the strongly diabetic effect produced by dividing
certain parts of the sympathetic.
    The medulla oblongata being thus presumed to form                 a centre
giving to the liver     a force  which prevents the saccharine metamor
phosis of its hepatine, experiment had already shown that it cannot be
through the spinal cord or the pneumogastrics separately, that the
transmission of nervous influence takes place.        But  an experiment was
performed to determine the effect of dividing both the spinal cord and
the two pneumogastrics together. The cord was crushed between the
third and fourth cervical       vertebrae,  and about half an inch     of each
pneumogastric was cut away from the centre of the neck.              Artificial
respiration was performed to keep up the circulation.              The urine
remained entirely      free  from sugar, and the liver was found in an
exsaccharine state at the moment of discontinuing             the respiration,
and became strongly saccharine afterwards.
    On next dividing all the nerves in the neck, an operation effected
by performing      decapitation, the result that       followed   after three
quarters of an hour's artificial       respiration was strongly    saccharine
urine. After this experiment, and that of division of the spinal cord and
pneumogastrics, reason was afforded for looking to the sympathetic            ;
and from the experiments that have been made and are described,

                                       29
the following conclusions have been arrived at.           The animal     selected
for observation has been the dog, subsisting upon an animal diet, and
operated upon at       a period of full digestion.
    " Division,  on both sides of the neck, of the ascending branches of
the superior      thoracic   ganglion which     run up towards the canal
formed by the foramina in the transverse processes            of the   vertebrae,
for the vertebral artery, occasions      an intensely marked diabetes.       The
urine has been found most strongly saccharine within even half an
hour after the operation. The diabetic condition        is only  of a temporary
character, passing off by the next day, and fatal pleurisy is always
induced.
    " Division    of the ascending branches of the superior thoracic
ganglion on one side of the neck only, has occasioned merely the
presence of a trace of sugar in the urine in an hour and a half s time.
The    same operation then performed on the other side has produced
in half an hour's time an intensely saccharine urine.
    " Carefully    ligaturing  the two vertebral and the two carotid arte
ries does not lead to saccharine urine       ;  but when the carotids have
been tied, and the tissue     in connexion with the vertebrals      before their
entrance into the canals is a little roughly treated, without however
dividing the larger sympathetic filament ascending from the superior
thoracic ganglion, the urine is rendered rapidly and strongly saccha
rine.
    " Division of     the sympathetic filaments that have          entered    the
canals    does   not alone    produce diabetes    ; but   if  the contents of
these canals    be divided, and the carotid arteries        at the same time
 ligatured, saccharine urine is the result.
    " This  result is produced when the contents of the osseous canals
are divided as high as the second cervical vertebra.          It has also arisen
after destroying the structures in the neighbourhood of the vertebral
foramen on the posterior surface of the transverse         process  of the  atlas,
but   has not yet been noticed after a similar operation on the anterior
surface of the process.
    " Dividing    the contents of the canals and the tissue in immediate
 contact with the carotid vessels has not produced diabetes          ; but when
the carotids have been afterwards tied, strongly saccharine urine has
resulted.
    " Of  all the operations on the sympathetic of the dog that have yet

                                      30
been performed, removal        of the superior cervical ganglion the most
rapidly and strongly produces diabetes.          After the removal of one
ganglion, the urine has been found intensely saccharine in an hour's
time, and the saccharine character has remained during the following
day, but has disappeared by the next.          Subsequent removal of the
other ganglion a few days later has been followed in half an hour's
time with a strongly marked diabetic effect, which, however, has
been again only     of a  temporary nature.
    " Division of   the sympathetic in the chest has been several times
succeeded     by saccharine urine.     In one   case after division   on one
side only, the urine was intensely saccharine in       half an hour's   time.
On the other hand, many experiments          have   been made where both
sides   have been operated on, and only       a  merely traceable,   or in a
 few instances, even no effect, has been noticeable.
    " In  the rabbit, removal of the superior cervical ganglia, when
the animal is in a strong and healthy state, is followed by diabetes;
but the effect is not so rapidly produced as in the dog.         It has been
noticed at the end of four hours after the operation, and has bee n
 observed   to exist until the following day.
    " Excision of    the superior cervical ganglia in the rabbit with a
 division of the pneumogastrics above their gangliform enlargement
 close to their exit from the skull, has been attended with the produc
 tion of saccharine urine in a shorter space of time than when the
 ganglia alone have been removed, notwithstanding           that division  of
 the pneumogastrics in the situation referred to, has not been seen by
 itself to cause any positive effect."
    Such is   a simple statement of the principal     conclusions derivable
 from the author's experiments, which are given in detail in his com
 munication.      As to the interpretation of the results that     have been
 obtained, this he leaves for further investigation, in which      he is now
 engaged,   if possible, to disclose. The experiments on the sympathetic
 were commenced under the notion that it might form the medium             of
 transmission of nervous force from the medulla oblongata to the liver.
  From this supposition certain facts have been discovered which are
 left for the present, without discussing whether the notion that led
  to them is right or wrong.

IV. " On      the Electrical Condition      of the Egg of the Common
       Fowl."     By John Davy, M.D., F.R.S.S. L. & E. &c.
       Received May 19th, 1859.
                                 (Abstract.)
    The structure of the    egg suggested     to the author the idea of its
exerting electrical action.     This  was confirmed     on trial.   Using   a
delicate galvanometer and     a suitable apparatus, on plunging one wire
into the white, and the other, insulated, except at the point of con
tact, into the yolk, the needle was deflected to the extent of 5°      ; and
on changing the wires, the course of the needle was reversed.         When
the white and yolk were taken out of the shell, the yolk immersed
in the white, the effects on trial were similar     ;  but not so when the
two were well-mixed     ; then no distinct effect was perceptible.
    Indications also of chemical action were obtained on substituting for
the galvanometer a mixture consisting of water, a little gelatinous
starch, and a small quantity of iodide of potassium, especially when
rendered very sensitive of change by the addition of         a few  drops of
muriatic    acid.  In the instance of newly-laid      eggs, the iodine libe
rated appeared     at the pole connected with the white       ;  on the con
trary, in that of eggs which had been kept some time, it appeared at
the pole connected with the yolk, answering in both to the copper
in a single voltaic combination formed of copper and zinc.
   The author, after describing the results obtained, declines        specu
lating on them at present, merely remarking, that in the economy of
the egg, and the changes       to which it is subject, it can hardly be
doubted that electro-chemical       action must perform       an  important
part, and that in the instance of the ovum generally, i. e. when com
posed of a white and of a yolk, or of substances in contact, of hete-
rogeueous natures.

           ducted from the Membrana Tympani to the Labyrinth,                                         in
           the Human            Ear."        By Joseph Toynbee, Esq., F.R.S. &c.
           Received        May 24, 1859.
     The opinion               usually entertained         by physiologists             is that     two
channels are requisite for the transmission of sonorous undulations
from the membrana tympani to the labyrinth,                                   viz. the air in the
tympanic cavity which transmits the undulations                                to the membrane
of the fenestra rotunda and the cochlea                       ;   and secondly, the chain of
ossicles which conduct them to the vestibule.
     This opinion              is,   however, far from being universally                   received   ;
thus, one writer on the Physiology of Hearing                                contends that         " the
integrity of one fenestra may suffice for the exercise of hearing*;"
another expresses                his conviction that          " the     transmission of sound
cannot take place through the ossiculaf;"                           while Sir John Herschel,
in   speaking of the ossicles, says
                                                 " they     are so far from being essential
to hearing,         that when the tympanum                  is    destroyed and the chain in
consequence         hangs loose, deafness does not follow                      J."
     The object of this paper                  is   to    decide     by experiment how far
the ossicles         are       requisite for the performance of the function                         of
hearing.
     The subject          is   considered under two heads, viz.—
     1.    Whether        sonorous undulations from the external meatus can
reach the labyrinth                  without having the ossicles for            a    medium    .
     2. Whether           any peculiarity in the conformation                     of the chain of
ossicles precludes the passage                 of sonorous undulations through it.
  1   .    Can     sonorous           undulations     reach       the    labyrinth from             the
external meatus without the aid                     of   the ossicles    ?
     This question             has often been answered              in the affirmative, appa
rently because        it       has been ascertained         that in cases where two bones
of the chain of            ossicles      have been removed              by   disease,    the hearing
power        is   but slightly          diminished.       In opposition to this view,                 it
must, however, be remembered,                       that the absence            of the    stapes,    or
even its fixed condition (anchylosis),                     is     always followed         by   total or

nearly total deafness                   ;    and the following experiments, which demon
strate the great facility with which sonorous                                   undulations         pass from
the air to           a    solid body, indicate that the stapes, even when isolated
from the other, bones of the chain, may still be                                     a   medium for the
transmission of sound.
     Experiment                1. — Both        ears having been closed,                 a piece     of   wood,
5 inches long and                      half    an inch      in diameter, was held between the
teeth,         and a vibrating tuning-fork                       C    having been brought within
the eighth of an inch of its free extremity, the sound                                              was heard
distinctly, and it continued to be heard between five and six seconds.
     Experiment                2. — One end           of the     piece     of   wood used in the pre
vious experiment being pressed against the tragus of the outer ear,                                             so
as to close the external meatus                             without        compressing the air con
tained within               it,   a    vibrating tuning-fork              C   placed within         a   quarter
of   an inch             of its   free extremity, was                heard very distinctly              at first,
and       it   did not cease to be heard for fifteen seconds.
     Experiment 3. — Three portions of wood,                                    of the same length and
thickness            as     that used in             the previous experiments, were glued
together so               as   to form         a   triangle somewhat of the                    shape      of the
stapes     ;     the      base        of this triangle           being        placed against the outer
surface of the tragus, as in the previous experiment, the tuning-fork
C    vibrating within                  a    quarter of an inch from its apex was heard for
twelve seconds.
     Considering, as shown                      by   the above experiments, the great facility
with which               sonorous          undulations pass from the air to               a    solid body,      it
may,      I     think, be assumed that the undulations in the tympanic cavity
may be conveyed                   to the stapes even when this bone                       is   isolated       from
the rest of the chain, and conducted                                  by   it   to the vestibule          ;   and
when       it   is   also considered that the absence                      of all   the ossicles, or even
a    fixed      condition of the stapes,                    is   productive of deafness, there                  is
strong evidence                   in    favour of the opinionthat sound* from the
external meatus                   cannot reach the labyrinth without the medium of
the ossicles.
     2.    Is there any peculiarity in                     the conformation         of the chain of ossi
cles which precludes the passage                           of sonorous undulations through
                                                                                                              it?
     This question              has also been answered                in the affirmative, on account
of the various             planes existing           in   the chain   ;   and secondly,        on account       of
the joints existing between the several bones composing this chain.

   The following experiments refer to the influence of the varying
plane of the bones forming the chain, and of its articulations, on the
progress of sonorous undulations through it       : —
   I. Experiments illustrative of    the influence  of the variety    of planes
in the chain.
   Experiment     1. —Three   pieces   of wood,   each   5  inches in length
and half an inch thick, were glued together thus            ^       , so  as to
represent the planes in which the malleus, incus, and stapes                 are
arranged in the chain of ossicles,      while three similar portions were
glued end to end so as to form a straight rod.         A watch     was placed
in contact with    one end  of the straight rod, while the other            was
pressed gently against   the tragus so as to shut the external meatus.
The result    was that the watch       was heard nearly       as distinctly   as
when in contact with the ear.       When     a similar experiment was per
formed with the angular portion of wood representing the chain of
bones, the watch was also heard, but less distinctly than through the
straight portion.
   Experiment 2. — A tuning-fork        C,   being made      to vibrate, was
placed in contact with one extremity of the angular piece of wood,
the other being placed against the tragus of the ear         ; and as soon as
the sound ceased to be heard, the straight portion was substituted,
when the tuning-fork    was agaiu    heard, and it continued to be heard
for about three seconds.
   Experiment 3. —A vibrating tuning-fork         C   was placed at one ex
tremity of the angular piece of wood, the other extremity being held
between   the teeth  ; the fork was at first heard very distinctly, and
when its sound could no longer be distinguished, the straight piece
was   substituted,   and it was    again heard for        the space of two
seconds.
   Experiment 4. — Instead of the horizontal portion of wood repre
senting the stapes, three portions of the same size were made into
a triangle, and this was glued to the anterior surface of the inferior
extremity of the piece representing the incus, thus                    •   The
previous experiment was then repeated with the substitution             of this
apparatus for the angular one, and with nearly the same result, viz.
the fork was heard through the straight piece about three seconds

                                                35
after it had ceased to be heard by the apparatus representing the
chain of bones.
  Experiment          5. — A piece of very thin paper was gummed oyer the
end    of   a glass    tube 6 inches     in diameter              ;   to the outer surface          of
this paper was glued        a   model of the chain of ossicles similar to the
one used in the previous experiment                        ;   a vibrating         tuning-fork      C
being placed in the interior of the tube and within              a quarter of an
inch   of the paper, the sound           was    heard through the free end of the
chain placed between            the teeth       for ten seconds              ;   when the sound
ceased to be heard, a straight piece                 of wood          was substituted, and the
sound was not heard through it.
  II.   Experiments illustrative           of    the influence              of   the articulations
in the chain.
  Experiment           1. — Three    pieces      of wood,               each      about 5 inches
long and half an inch in thickness, were separated from each other
by pieces of india-rubber as thick              as   ordinary writing-paper, and they
were then fastened        together so      as   to assume              the angular form pos
sessed by the chain       of ossicles.    The tuning-fork                  C being placed at      the
free extremity        of the chain, the other extremity being held                            between
the teeth, it was found that the sound was heard as distinctly and
for the same length of time, as when it passed through                                     the chain
formed of three portions glued together.
  Experiment          2. —When eight layers            of the india-rubber             were placed
between     each piece     of wood, there            was       still very little difference        in
the intensity of the sound from that observed when it passed through
the portions glued together.
   Experiment 3. — -One, two, or three                         fingers having          been    placed
between     the first and second          pieces       of wood, and eight layers of
india-rubber between the second and third,                        a   very slight diminution
in the intensity and duration of the sound was observed as compared
with its passage through similar pieces when glued together.
  Experiment 4. — The back of the hand was placed in contact with
the teeth, and the end of the vibrating fork                           C   was pressed        against
the palm     ;   the sound was heard very distinctly                        for several seconds         ;
and when it ceased to be heard,                      a piece          of solid wood        3 inches
long was substituted, through which the sound of the fork was again
heard faintly for four seconds.
  The inference from the            two series        of experiments             above detailed    is,
                                                                                   d   2

                                          36
that neither      the variation of the plane existing in the chain                    of
ossicles,  nor the presence of the articulations, is sufficient to prevent
the progress of sonorous undulations                 through      this chain    to  the
vestibule.
   The experiments and observations                  detailed    above    lead  to  the
following conclusions : —
    1. That the commonly          received   opinion in favour of the sonorous
undulations passing to the vestibule through the chain of ossicles                    is
correct.
    2. That    the stapes, when disconnected            from the incus, can still
conduct sonorous undulations to the vestibule from the air.
    3. So far as our present experience           extends,    it appears that in the
human ear sound always travels to the labyrinth through two media,
viz. through the air in the tympanic cavity to the cochlea, and through
one or more     of the  ossicles to the vestibule.
VI. " On      the Electrical Discharge in vacuo with an Extended
       Series   of the Voltaic Battery." By John P. GASsio^Esq.,
       V.P.R.S.       Received May 24, 1859.
   In   a recent    communication, since ordered for publication in the
Philosophical      Transactions,     I  described some experiments on the
electrical discharge in a vacuum              obtained by the          absorption    of
carbonic acid with caustic potassa, and            I  showed that, when the dis
charge from an induction coil was passed             through such a vacuum, the
stratifications became altered in character and appearance                      as the
potassa was more       or less heated.          I  have also     in   a former paper
(Phil. Trans.     1858,    p.  1)  shown that the stratified discharge can
be obtained from the electrical machine.
    A description of     an extended       series  of   a  water-battery was com
municated by me as far back as December 1843 (Phil. Trans. 1844,
p. 39).     This battery consists of 3520 insulated cells: some                   years
had elapsed since it was last charged, and I found the zincs                       were
 very much oxidated      ;  on again charging it with rain-water,              I ascer
 tained that there was sufficient tension to give a constant succession
 of minute sparks between two copper discs attached to the terminals
 of the battery, and placed about ^th of an inch apart. On at
 taching the terminals of the battery to the wires in a carbonic acid

                                             37
vacuum-tube         inserted about     2 inches apart,      I obtained      a stratified
discharge     similar to that from       an induction    coil.
    The experiment         was   repeated    with 400     series   of Grove's nitric
acid    battery. In this case distinct sparks between two copper discs
were obtained, and the luminous layers were shown in a peculiar and
striking manner, thus proving that the induction coil is not necessary
for the production         of the  striae, as in most     of   the   experiments the
only    interruption of the battery circuit           was through        the vacuum-
tube.
     I had another tube prepared, substituting for metallic points balls
of gas-carbon.         At first the stratified discharge was obtained         as before,
 while   little or no chemical action took       place in the battery     ;  on heating
the potassa, the character of the stratifications gradually changed, and
 suddenly a remarkably brilliant white discharge, also stratified, was
 observed ; intense       chemical action was at the same time perceptibly
 taking place in the battery, and on breaking the circuit, the usual vivid
 electrical flame-discharge was developed at the point of disruption.
      The continuation of      these experiments     will necessarily occupy much
 time, involving, as they do,          the charging of so extended a series of
  the nitric      acid battery, and with the requisite care necessary                 for
  the proper insulation of each cell        ;  other phenomena were observed
  which require further verification, but         I hope that     after the recess the
  result which      I hope  to obtain may be of sufficient interest to form the
  subject   of  a  future communication.
   VII. "Note         on the    Transmission of Radiant               Heat     through
          Gaseous Bodies."          By   John Tyndall, Ph.D., F.R.S.                 &c.
          Received     May 26, 1859.
       Before    the Royal Society terminates its present session,                I  am
   anxious to state the nature and some of the results of an investiga
   tion in which     I am now engaged.
       With the exception of the     celebrated memoir       of M. Pouillet on Solar
   Radiation     through    the atmosphere, nothing, so far as           I  am aware,
   has been     published    on the transmission of radiant heat               through
  gaseous     bodies.     We know nothing of the           effect   even   of air upon
  heat radiated from terrestrial sources.

                                            38
   The law of inverse         squares      has     been    proved by Melloni to be
true for radiant        heat passing        through        air,  whence     that eminent
experimenter inferred that the absorption of such heat by the atmo
sphere,     in a distance      of  18    or 20 feet, is totally inappreciable.
With regard to the action of other gases upon heat,                        we are not, so
far as I am aware, possessed of a single experiment.
   Wishing to add to our knowledge in this important particular,                           I
had a tube constructed, 4 feet long and 3 inches in diameter,                          and
by means of brass terminations and suitable washers,                        I closed   per
fectly the ends of the tube by polished plates of rock-salt.                       Near to
one   of its extremities,       a T-piece        is attached to the tube, one            of
whose branches can be screwed              to the plate of an air-pump, so as to
permit the tube to be exhausted              ;  while the gas to be operated on is
admitted through          the other branch of the T-piece.                   Such a tube
can be made        the channel     of calorific rays of           every   quality, as the
rock-salt transmits all such rays with the same facility.
   I first   permitted the obscure heat emanating from                    a source  placed
at one end       of the tube, to     pass through           the latter, and fall upon      a
thermo-electric      pile placed at its other end.                  The tube contained
ordinary air.        When the     needle       of   a  galvanometer connected         with
the pile had come to rest, the tube was exhausted,                      but no change in
the position of the needle was observed.                     A similar     negative  result
was obtained when hydrogen gas and a vacuum were compared.
   Here    I  saw, however, that when a copious radiation was employed,
and the needle pointed to the high degrees of the galvanometer, to
cause   it to    move    through    a sensible space,            a  comparatively large
diminution of the current would be necessary                   ; far larger, indeed, than
the absorption       of the air,  if  any, could produce            :  while   if I used a
feeble source, and permitted          the needle to point to the lower degrees
of the galvanometer, the total quantity of heat in action                           was so
small, that the fraction of it absorbed,             if any,    might well be insensible.
   My    object then was to use powerful currents, and still keep the
needle    in   a  sensitive   position   ;     this was effected        in the following
manner     : — The galvanometer        made use         of  possessed two wires coiled
side by side round the needle          ;   and the two extremities of each wire
were connected with a separate thermo-electric                   pile, in such a manner
that the currents excited by heat falling upon the faces of the two piles
passed in opposite directions round the galvanometer.                         A source of

                                       3!)
heat of considerable intensity wag permitted to send its rays through
the tube to the pile at its opposite extremity        ; the deflection of the
needle was very energetic.        The   second   pile was now caused    to ap
proach the source of heat until its current exactly neutralized that of
the other pile, and the needle descended to zero.
    Here then we had two powerful forces in perfect equilibrium          ; and
inasmuch as the quantity of heat in action was very considerable, the
absorption of a small fraction of        it might   be expected  to produce a
sensible effect upon the galvanometer-needle in its present          position.
When the tube     was exhausted,     the balance    between   the equal forces
was destroyed, and the current from the pile placed at the end          of the
tube predominated.         Hence the removal of the air had permitted a
 greater amount of heat to pass.         On readmitting the air, the needle
 again descended to zero, indicating that a portion of the radiant heat
was intercepted.      Very large   effects were thus obtained.
   I  have applied the same mode       of experiment to     several gases and
vapours, and have, in all cases, obtained abundant proof of calorific
absorption.     Gases vary considerably in their absorptive power —pro
bably as much as liquids and solids.          Some   of them allow the heat
to pass through them with comparative facility, while other gases
bear the same relation to the latter that alum does to other diather-
manous bodies.
    Different gases are thus shown to intercept radiant heat in different
 degrees.    I have made other experiments, which prove that the self
same gas exercises a different action upon different qualities      of radiant
heat.     The investigation of the subject referred to in this Note is
now in progress,    and   I hope at some future day to lay a full descrip
tion of it before the Royal Society.

       Bunsen, For. Memb. R.S., and              Henry Enfield Roscoe,
       Ph.D., Professor of Chemistry in Owens College, Man
       chester.    Received May 26, 1859.
                                  (Abstract.)
    In the three communications* which they have already           made to the
 Royal Society upon the subject of photochemistry, the authors showed
                   * Phil. Trans. 1857, pp. 355, 381 and 601.

                                                  -10
that they have constructed              a moat delicate         and trustworthy instrument
by which to measure the chemical action                        of light, and by help of which
they have been able to investigate the laws regulating this action.
In the      present      memoir, the authors proceed,                     in the first place, to
establish     a    general      and absolute            standard of comparison for                the
chemical action of light                ;   and in the second                place,    to consider
the quantitative relations                 of the chemical action             effected    by direct
and diffuse sunlight.         They would                 endeavour,        in this part of their
research,     to    lay the foundation of               a new       and important branch of
meteorological science, by investigating the laws which regulate the
distribution,          on the earth's surface,            of the chemical activity               ema
nating from the sun.
     The subject-matter of            the preseut        communication is divided under
five heads     :   —
     1.   The comparative and absolute measurement                                of the chemical
rays.
     2. Chemical action   of diffuse daylight.
     3.   Chemical action of direct sunlight.
     4.   Photochemical         action of the sun,               compared with that of                 a
terrestrial source of light.
     5. Chemical action          of the constituent parts of solar light.
     The first     essential    for the measurement of photochemical                       actions,
is the possession          of         of constant light. This the authors
                                a source
secured      with a     greater amount of accuracy than by the method de
scribed in their former communications, by employing a flame                               of pure
carbonic oxide gas, burning from                    a   platinum jet of       7   millims. in dia
meter, and issuing at a given rate, and under a pressure                              very slightly
different from that of the atmosphere.                           The action which such              a
standard flame produces in                  a   given time on the sensitive mixture of
chlorine and hydrogen, placed at a given distance,                                is taken as the
arbitrary unit         of photochemical illumination.                      This action     is,   how
ever, not that which            is   directly observed          on the scale of the instru
ment.       The true action           is    only obtained           by   taking account of the
absorption         and extinction           which       the light undergoes            in passing
through the various glass-, water-, and mica-screens                              placed between
the flame and the sensitive gas. These reductions can be made                              by    help
of the determinations given in Part                     III.   of   these Researches, as well
as   by   experiments detailed in the present Part.                        When these sources

                                                        11
of error          are eliminated,         it   is possible, by means               of this standard
flame, to reduce the indications of different instruments to the same
unit of luminous intensity, and thus to render them comparable.
For this purpose, the authors define the photometric unit for the
chemically active             rays, as the amount of action produced in one
minute,       by     a    standard        flame       placed at       a    distance of one         metre
from        the    normal         mixture       of chlorine and hydrogen                 ;    and they
determine experimentally for each instrument                                   the number of such
uuits which          correspond to one division on the scale of the instru
ment.  By multiplying the observed number of divisions by the
number of photometric units equal to one division, the observations
are reduced to a comparable standard.                                It is proposed          to call this
unit      a chemical       unit of light, and ten thousand of them                      one chemical
degree      of light.
     According           to this standard of measurement,                        the chemical illu
mination of a surface, that                    is,   the amount of chemically active light
which falls perpendicularly                     on the plane surface,              can be obtained.
It    has    thus been found that the distance to which two flames of
coal-gas and carbonic oxide, each fed with gas at the rate                                     of 4-105
cubic cent. per second, must be removed from                              a   plane surface, in order
to effect upou           it   an amount          of chemical action              represented      by   one
degree  of light, was, in the case of the                        coal-gas       flame, 0-929 metre,
in that of carbonic oxide 0-561 metre.   The chemical illuminating
power, or chemical intensity, of various sources of light, measured
by the chemical action effected                        by    these   sources at equal          distances
and in equal             times,    can also be expressed                  in terms of this unit of
light  ;    and these         chemical intensities may be compared with the
visible light-giving              intensities.         In like manner,           the authors define
chemical brightness as the amount of light, measured photochemi-
cally, which falls perpendicularly                       from    a    luminous surface          upon    a
physical point, divided                by   the apparent magnitude of the surface                       ;
and this chemical brightness of circles of zenith-sky of different sizes
has been determined.                  Experiment shows that the chemical bright
ness      of various      sized     portions of zenith- sky, not exceeding                     0'00009
of the total         heavens,        is   the        same   ;   or, that the chemical action
effected     is    directly proportional               to the apparent magnitude of the
illuminating        surface of zenith-sky.
     It   is, however, important                 to express          the photochemical actions

                                       42
not only according to an arbitrary standard, but in absolute measure,
in units of time and space.          This   has been   done   by determining
the absolute volume of hydrochloric          acid formed by the action     of   a
given source of light during       a given space of time.       For this pur
pose, we    require to know —
   »=the volume of hydrochloric acid formed by the unit of light.
   A=the thickness of sensitive gas through which the light passed.
   j=the surface-area of the insulated        gas.
    a=the coefficient of extinction of the chlorine and hydrogen for
           the light employed.
   1= the number of observed units of light in the time t.
   When      these   values are known, the volume of hydrochloric           acid
which would be formed in the time t, by the rays falling perpendi
cularly   on    the unit of surface,     if the light had been completely
extinguished by passing through          an infinitely extended    atmosphere
of dry chlorine and hydrogen, is found from the expression
                                   q    l-io"*"
   In this way the chemical illumination of any           surface   may be ex
pressed    by the height     of the column of hydrochloric          acid which
the light falling       upon that   surface   would   produce,   if  it passed
through an unlimited atmosphere of chlorine and hydrogen.                  This
height, measured in metres, the authors propose to call a Light-
metre.     The chemical action of the solar rays        can be expressed in
light-metres     ;  and the mean daily, or annual height thus obtained,
dependent on latitude and longitude, regulates the chemical climate
of  a place, and points the way to relations for the chemical actions
of the solar rays, which in the thermic actions            are already repre
sented by isothermals, isotherals, &c.
   In order to determine the chemical action exerted by the whole
diffuse daylight       upon a given point on the earth's          surface, the
authors were obliged to have recourse to an indirect method              of  ex
perimenting,       owing to the impossibility      of measuring the whole
action directly, by means       of the sensitive mixture of chlorine and
hydrogen.        For the purpose of obtaining the wished-for result, the
chemical action proceeding from a portion of sky at the zenith, of
known magnitude, was determined in absolute measure,                 and then,

                                      4:5
by means of     a photometer, whose peculiar construction can only be
understood by      a  long description, the relation between           the visible
illuminating power of the        same portion      of zenith sky and that of
the total heavens was determined.          As, in the case of lights from
the same source but of different degrees of intensity, the chemical
actions are proportional       to the visible illuminating         effects, it was
only   necessary,  in order to obtain the chemical action produced by
 the total diffuse light, to multiply the chemical action of the zenith
 portion of sky by the number representing the relation between                the
 visible illumination    of the total sky and that of the             same zenith
 portion.
     The  laws according to which     the chemical rays are dispersed by
 the atmosphere can only be ascertained from experiments                      made
 when the sky is perfectly cloudless.           In   the determinations made
 with this specially-arranged photometer, care was therefore taken
 that the slightest trace of cloud or mist was absent, and the relation
 between the visible illuminating      effect    of  a  portion    of sky at the
 zenith and that of the whole visible heavens,              was   determined for    .
  every half-hour from sunrise to sunset      ;  the observations being made
 at the summit    of  a hill near Heidelberg,     from which the horizon was
  perfectly free.
     The amount of chemical illumination which            a point on the earth's
  surface receives from the whole heavens, depends              on the height    of
  the sun above     the horizon    and on the transparency of the atmo
  sphere.    If the atmospheric transparency undergoes much change
  when the sky is cloudless, a long series of experiments must be made
  before  the true relations of atmospheric extinction of the chemical
  rays can be arrived at.        The authors       believe,  however, founding
  their opinion on the statement of Seidel in his classical research on
  the luminosity of the fixed stars, that the alterations in the air's
  transparency with a cloudless sky are very slight           ;  and they there
  fore  think themselves justified in considering the chemical illumi
  nation of the earth's surface, on cloudless days, to be represented
  simply as a function of the sun's zenith distance.         Although, from the
  comparatively small number of experiments which have been made,
  owing to the difficulty of securing perfectly cloudless weather, the
 constants contained in the formulae         cannot lay claim to any very
  great degree of accuracy, the authors believe that the numbers ob

                                                                   44
    tained are sufficient to enable them to determine the relation accord
    ing to which the chemical energy proceeding from the sun is diffused
    over the earth when the sky is unclouded.
         From        a series    of observations                   made on      June    6, 1858, the relation
    between           the    amount of light optically measured                             falling     from the
    whole sky, and the amount (taken as unity) which, at the same
    time, falls from a portion of zenith sky equal to | o*ootp of tne wnole
    visible heavens, has been calculated for every degree of sun's zenith
    distance from              20° to 90°            ;    the results being tabulated, and also
    represented             graphically.            These numbers, multiplied                        by the che
    mical light proceeding from the same portion of zenith sky for the
    same zenith distances,                       must give the chemical action effected by the
    whole diffuse daylight.                        The amount of chemical light which falls
    from the zenith portion of sky                             is,   however, the chemical brightness
    of that portion of sky.                        This chemical brightness                    has been deter
    mined,        by   the chlorine and hydrogen photometer, on various days,
    and at different hours, when the sky was perfectly cloudless.                                               A
-   table contains the chemical action, expressed                                       in degrees of light,
                                    on the earth's surface                             portion of zenith sky
                                                                                by
    which       is    effected                                                  a
    equal in area to            1   ri\)   ^th   of the whole visible               heavens,    under the cor
    responding sun's zenith distances from 20° to 90°.                                         A     curve repre
    senting the relation between the action and the height of the sun,
    shows that although the single observations were made on different
    years       and    at    different times                  of the year and           day,    they all agree
    closely amongst themselves,                         and hence another proof                is   gained of the
    slight effect which variation                        in   the air's transparency produces              ;   and
    it   is   seen that the total chemical action effected                              by the diffuse light
    of    day     may be represented                          as    a    function      of the       sun's zenith
    distance.
         The numbers thus obtained                             have         only to be multiplied         by the
    corresponding             numbers of the former table,                             in order to give the
    chemical action effected                       by    the total diffuse light of day for zenith
    distances         from 20° to 90°.                   A    table and graphic representation of
    these numbers             is    given.          Knowing the relation                 between       the sun's
    altitude and the chemical action, the chemical illumination                                          effected
    each minute at any given locality at                                a   given time may be calculated        ;
    this calculation has been made for                               a   number of places for each hour
    on the vernal equinox, tables and curves representing the alteration

                                         45
of luminous intensity with the height of the          sun at these places being
given.
     From these data it is possible also to calculate the action produced
by the whole diffuse light, not only for each minute, but during any
given space     of  time.     For the following places the amount of che
mical illumination expressed in degrees of light which falls from sun
rise to    sunset on the vernal equinox, is —

      Experiment     has shown that clouds exert the most powerful influ
 ence     in reflecting the chemical rays       ;  when the sky is partially
 covered by light white clouds, the chemical illumination           is more than
 four times as intense        as when the sky is clear.         Dark clouds and
  mists, on the other hand, absorb almost all the chemically active
  rays.
       The chemical action of the direct sunlight           was   determined by
  allowing    a known fractional    portion of the solar rays to fall perpen
   dicularly on the insolation    vessel  of the chemical photometer. The
   solar rays reflected from the mirror of a Silbermann's heliostat
   were passed through a fine opening of known area into the dark
   room, and a large number of reductions and corrections had to be
   made in order to obtain, from the direct observations, the action,
   expressed in degrees of light, which the sun shining directly upon
   the apparatus would have produced          if  no disturbing influences had
   interfered.    This action of direct sunshine      was determined on three
   different cloudless days for various altitudes      of the sun.    As the sun
   approached the zenith the observed         action rapidly increased     ; thus
    at  7h  9' a.m.,   on  September     15,  1858,   when     the sun's zenith
    distance was 76° 30', the reduced action amounted to 5-5 degrees of
    light, whilst at   9h 14' a.m. on the same day, the zenith distance
    being 58° 11', the action reached 67-6.         This   increase  in the sun's
    illuminating power     is  owing to the      diminution    in length of the

                                                       1(5
column of air through which                        the        rays pass.        If   we suppose           the
atmosphere to be throughout              of the density corresponding                                   to a
pressure 0-76 and a           temperature 0°, and consider it as a horizontal
layer, and     if A   represent the action effected before entrance into                                 the
atmosphere, the action, when the ray has passed through a thickness
of atmosphere —I, is represented by

are calculated.       A     comparison between the actions W, thus obtained,
and those, W0, found by experiment, shows as close an agreement as
could be expected where the observational errors are necessarily so
large.
     From    these experiments         it     is   seen, that         if   the sun's rays were not
weakened       by passage through                  the atmosphere, they would produce
an illumination       represented            by    318 degrees of light;                 or they would
effect   a   combination in one minute on                         a   surface on which they fell
perpendicularly,       of    a   column of hydrochloric                       acid 35    .

height, assuming that the rays are extinguished by passing through
an infinitely extended           atmosphere of chlorine                       and hydrogen.              By
help of the above formula,               it   is   also found that the sun's rays, after
they have passed            in   a   perpendicular               direction     through        the atmo
sphere to the sea's level, under                   a   mean pressure           of 0-76 metre, only
effect an action      of    14-4 light-metres, or that under these conditions
nearly two-thirds of their chemical activity have been lost by extinc
tion and dispersion in the atmosphere. The total chemical action
emanating from the sun during each minute                                is   therefore represented
by   a   column of hydrochloric               acid 35 metres in height, and having
an area equal to the surface                 of   sphere whose diameter
                                                  a                       the mean           is

radiates into space during each      minute of time represents a chemical
energy, by means      of which   more    than 25 billions of cubic miles of
chlorine and hydrogen may be combined to form hydrochloric              acid.
In like manner the amounts of chemical action have          been calculated,
which the sun's rays, undiminished         by atmospheric extinction, pro
duce at the surface    of the chief planets.      The first column of num
bers gives the mean distances of the planets from the sun, the second
contains the chemical action expressed in light-metres.

    By aid of the formula already given, the authors      have been enabled
to calculate the chemical action       effected  each minute by the direct
sunlight, not only at different points on the earth's surface, but at
various heights above the sea's level.         Both these series of relations
 are  tabulated,    and graphically     represented.     On  comparing    the
 numbers and curves giving the action of the total diffuse light with
 those  of the direct solar light, the singular fact      becomes apparent,
 that from the North Pole to latitudes below that of Petersburg,
 the chemical action proceeding from the diffuse light is, throughout
 the day on the vernal equinox, greater than that effected             by the
 direct sunlight  ;  and that in lower latitudes, down to the Equator,
 the same phenomenon is observed,           if not for the whole, still for a
 portion of the day.      It is further seen, that for all places, and on
 every day when the sun rises to a certain height above the horizon,
 there is a moment at which the chemical action of the diffused light
 is exactly equal to that of the direct sunlight.        The times  at which
 these phases   of equal chemical illumination occur      can be calculated   ;
 they can also be actually determined, by allowing the direct sunlight
 alone, and the whole diffuse daylight alone, to fall at the same time
 upon   two pieces    of the  same    sensitized photographic    paper;    the

                                            48
period at which        both papers become           equally blackened,     gives the
time of the phase of equal chemical intensity.                 Experiment proved
not only that these         points of equality which the theory requires
actually occur, but also that the agreement between                   the calculated
and observed times of occurrence of the phases is very close, giving
proof that the        data upon which        the theory is founded are substan
tially correct.
    The formula, by help of which the chemical action of the direct
sunlight effected       at any place during any given time can be calcu
lated, is next developed,        and the direct solar action at the following

    The authors next proceed          to examine       the chemical brightness of
 the sun compared with         a  terrestrial source of light.         For this pur
 pose the intensely bright         light produced by         a wire of magnesium
 burning     in the air was employed.              Experiment     showed that     the
 chemical intensity        of the sunlight,       undiminished      by atmospheric
 extinction, is 128 times greater than that from a surface                  of incan
 descent    magnesium of like apparent magnitude                ;  or that burning
 magnesium effects        the same chemical illumination           as the sun when
 9° 53' above      the horizon, supposing of course            that both luminous
 sources present to the illuminated            surface the same apparent magni
 tude.     A totally different relation         was found to exist between        the
 visible illuminating      power, i.   e.    the effect produced on the eye, of
 the two sources       in question.     Thus, when the sun's zenith distance
 was 67° 22', the chemical brightness             of that   source was 36-6 times,

bat the visible     brightness   525 times as large as that of the terrest rial
source   of light.
    In the last section of this communication the chemical action of
the constituent       parts of the solar spectrum         is investigated.    The
sun's rays      were reflected from      a Silbermann's      heliostat, and after
passing   through      a narrow slit, they were decomposed by two quartz
prisms.     The spectrum thus produced            was allowed to fall upon a
white screen covered        with  a solution  of quinine, and    any desired por
tion of the rays could be measured by           a finely-divided scale, and the
position noted by observation of the distances from the fixed lines.
For the purpose         of identifying   the fixed lines in the lavender rays,
the authors      were, by the kindness     of Mr. Stokes, allowed the       use of
an   unpublished map of the most refrangible portion of the spectrum,
prepared by that gentleman.             As the various components of white
light are unequally absorbed by the atmosphere, it was obviously
necessary     to conduct      all the measurements         so  quickly after one
another,   that    no  appreciable difference in the thickness of the column
of air passed through should occur.
    This has      been accomplished,      and a series of exact measurements
 of the chemical actions of the spectrum for one particular                zenith-
 distance  of the sun obtained.        The action on    the sensitive gas shows
 the existence     of several maxima    of chemical intensity in the spectrum.
 Between the lines G in the indigo and H in the violet the greatest
 action was observed, whilst another maximum was found to lie near
 the line  I   in the ultra-violet rays.     Towards the red or least refran
 gible end    of the spectrum, the action      became imperceptible about the
 line  D in the orange, but at the other end of the spectrum the action
  was  found to extend as far as Stokes's line U, or to a distance from
 the line   H   greater than the total length of the ordinary visible spec
  trum.    Tables and curves representing the action are given.

 IX. "     On the Occurrence          of Flint-implements, associated with
        the Remains       of Extinct Mammalia, in Undisturbed Beds of
        a  late Geological Period."           By Joseph Prestwich, Esq.,
        F.R.S., F.G.S. &c.           Received May 26, 1859.
                                     (Abstract.)
    The author       commences      by noticing     how comparatively rare are
 the cases even of the alleged discovery of the remains of man or of
 his works in the various superficial          drifts, notwithstanding    the ex
 tent to which these deposits are worked            ;  and of these few cases so
 many have been disproved, that man's non-existence on the earth
 until after the latest geological changes, and the extinction of the
 Mammoth, Tichorhine Rhinoceros, and other great mammals, had
 come    to be considered almost in the light of an established fact.
 Instances, however, have from time to time occurred to throw some
 doubt on this view, as the well-known                cases of the human bones
 found by Dr. Schmerling          in a cavern     near Liege, — the remains     of
 man, instanced by       M. Marcel de Serres and others in several caverns
 in France,   —  the flint-implements in Kent's Cave, — and many more.
 Some    uncertainty,     however, has always attached to cave-evidence,
 from the circumstance that man has often inhabited such places at
 a comparatively       late period, and may have disturbed the original
 cave-deposit    ; or, after the period of his residence,         the stalagmitic
 floor may have been broken up by natural causes, and the remains
 above    and below it may have           thus become       mixed together, and
 afterwards sealed up by a second floor of stalagmite.             Such instances
 of an imbedded broken stalagmitic floor            are in fact known to occur    ;
 at the same time the author does not pretend to say that this will
 explain all cases of intermixture in caves, but that it lessens the value
 of the  evidence    from such sources.
    The subject has, however, been latterly revived, and the evidence
 more carefully sifted by Dr. Falconer ; and his preliminary reports
 on the Brixham Cave*,          presented last year to the Royal Society,
announcing       the carefully    determined occurrence of worked flints
   * On   the 4th of May, this year, Dr. Falconer further communicated to the Geo
logical Society some similar facts, though singularly varied, recently discovered
hy him in the Maccagnone Cave near Palermo. — See Proc. Geol. Soc.

mixed indiscriminately                   with the bones of the extinct Cave Bear and
the Rhinoceros, attracted great and general attention amongst geo
logists. This remarkable discovery, and a letter written to him by
Dr. Falconer on the occasion of his subsequent visit to Abbeville
last autumn, instigated                   the author to turn his attention to other
ground, which, from the interest of its later geological phenomena
alone, as described by                   M. Buteux in his "Esquisse Geologique du
Departement de la Somme,"                        he had long wished and intended to
visit.
     In    1849            M. Boucher       de Perthes,         President     of the "Society
d' Emulation " of Abbeville,                    published the first volume of               a   work
entitled     " Antiquites           Celtiques et Antediluviennes,"             in which he an
nounced the important                    discovery of worked flints in beds of undis
turbed sand and gravel containing the remains of extinct mammalia.
Although treated from                    an antiquarian     point of view, still the state
ment of the geological                   facts by this gentleman, with good sections
by M.       Ravin, is perfectly clear and consistent.                        Nevertheless, both
in France and in England, his conclusions were generally considered
erroneous         ;    nor has he since obtained such verification of the pheno
mena as to cause so unexpected a fact to be accepted                                 by men of
science.          There         have,    however, been some            few   exceptions to the
general incredulity.                    The late Dr. Rigollot, of Amiens,               urged by
M. Boucher                 de Perthes, not only satisfied himself               of the truth of
the fact, but corroborated                     it,   in 1855,     by   his "Memoire sur des
Instruments                en Silex trouves      a    St. Acheul."       Some    few geologists
suggested             further inquiry      ;   whilst Dr. Falconer,          himself convinced
by    M.     de Perthes'            explanations        and specimens,        warmly      engaged
Mr. Prestwich to                examine     the sections.
     The author, who               confesses    that he undertook            the inquiry full of
doubt, went last Easter,                    first to Amiens, where he found, as de
scribed       by
           Dr. Rigollot, the gravel-beds of St. Acheul capping                                      a
low chalk-hill mile S.E. of the city, about 100 feet above the level
                            a
of the Somme, and not commanded by any higher ground. The

         occasionally  found                                                2 to   8  ft.

         as above, in patches    of sand.   Teeth and bones of the ele

         near base.    This bed is further remarkable for containing
         worked flints (" Haches
                                     " of M. de Perthes, and " Langues
         de Chat" of the workmen)                                           6  to 12 ft.
         Uneven   surface of chalk.
   The flint-implements            are found      in considerable numbers in 26.
On his first visit, the author obtained several                  specimens     from the
workmen, but he was not successful in finding any himself.                        On his
arrival, however, at Abbeville, he received a message from                  M. Pinsard
of Amiens, to       whose cooperation he expresses himself much indebted,
to inform him that one had been discovered the following                        day, and
was left in situ        for his inspection.         On returning to the spot, this
time with his friend Mr. Evans, he satisfied himself that it was
truly in situ,       17  feet from the surface,        in undisturbed ground, and
he had a photographic            sketch of the section taken*.
    Dr. Rigollot also mentions the occurrence in the gravel of round
pieces of hard chalk, pierced through with a hole, which he considers
were used as beads.             The author found         several,  and recognized in
them     a  small fossil sponge, the Coscinopora globularis,              D'Orb., from
the chalk,       but does not feel quite satisfied about their artificial
dressing.       Some specimens          do certainly appear as though the hole
had been enlarged and completed.
   The only mammalian remains the author here obtained, were
some specimens of the teeth of ahorse, but whether recent or ex
tinct, the specimens           were    too imperfect to determine        ;  and part of
the tooth of an elephant (Elephas primigeniusl).                      In the gravel-pit
of St. Roch,          1J mile distant, and on           a lower     level, mammalian
   * On revisiting the pit, since the reading of this paper, in company with
several geological friends, the author was fortunate to witness the discovery and
extraction by one of them, Mr. J. W. Flower, of a very perfect and fine specimen
of flint-implement, in a seam of ochreous gravel, 20 feet beneath the surface.
They besides obtained thirty-six specimens from the workmen. — June, 1859.

 remains      are far    more    abundant,      and     include   Elephas      primige-
 nius, Rhinoceros       tichorhinus,    Cervus somonensis,         Bos priscus,       and
Equus*      ;  but the workmen         said   that no worked flints were found
there,   although they are mentioned by Dr. Rigollot.
   At Abbeville the author was much struck with the extent and
beauty     of M. Boucher         de Perthes'      collection.     There were many
forms    of flints, in which      he, however, failed to see         traces   of  design
or work, and      which     he should only consider as accidental           ;  but with
regard     to those    flint-instruments      termed      "axes" ("haches") by
M.   de   Perthes, he entertains not the slightest doubt of their artificial

 and   were the work of        a people probably unacquainted with the use
 of metals.      These implements are much rarer at Abbeville than at
  Amiens, fig. 1 being the common form at the former, and fig. 2 at
 the latter place.       The author was not fortunate enough to find any

 four fine tusks were obtained   on this last visit.

specimens        himself   ;  but from the experience             of M.     de Perthes, and
the evidence of the workmen, as well as from the condition of the
specimens       themselves,      he is    fully   satisfied   of the    correctness   of that
gentleman's opinion, that they there also occur in beds of undisturbed
sand and gravel.
    At Moulin Quignon, and at St. Gilles, to the S.E. of Abbeville,
the deposit occurs, as at St. Acheul, on the top of a low hill, and
consists     of  a subangular,       ochreous and ferruginous flint-gravel, with
a few    irregular seams of sand, 12 to 15 feet thick, reposing upon an
uneven surface         of chalk.       It  contains no shells, and very few bones.
M.   de Perthes states that he has found fragments                      of the  teeth  of the
elephant here.          The worked flints and the              bones occur generally in
the lower part of the gravel.
    In the     bed   of gravel    also on which Abbeville             stands,  a number     of
flint-implements have been found, together with several teeth of the
Elephas primigenius,            and, at places,       fragments of freshwater shells.
   The      section,   however, of greatest interest is that at Menchecourt,
a suburb        to   the  N.W. of Abbeville.               The deposit there is very
distinct in its character           ;  it occurs patched on the side of a chalk
hill, which commands it to the northward                     ; and it slopes down under
the peat-beds of the valley of the Somme to the southward.                                The
deposit consists, in descending order, of —
      1.  A mass of brown sandy clay, with angular fragments of
         flints and chalk rubble.      No organic remains.        Base very
         irregular and indented into bed No. 2                                  2 to 12 ft.

         men),    analogous    to the    loess,   containing land shells,
         Pupa, Helix, Claurilia of recent species.           Flint-axes and
         mammalian      remains are said to occur occasionally             in
         this bed                                                               8 to 25 ft.
     3. White sand (" sable aigre ") , with 1 to 2 feet of subangular
         flint-gravel at base. This bed abounds in land and fresh
         water shells of recent species of the genera Helix, Succinea,
         Cyclas, Pisidium, Valvata, Bithynia, and Planorbis, to
         gether    with  the    marine    Bucdmm       undatum,     Cardhtm
         edule, Tellina solidula,   and Purpura lapillut.        The author
         has also found the Cyrena consoirina and Littorina rudis.
         With them are associated numerous            mammalian     remains,
         and, it is said, flint-implements                                      2 to 6 ft.
     4. Light-coloured       sandy    marl,  in places very hard, with
         Helix, Zonitet, Succinea, and Pupa. Not traversed                      3  +

   The Mammalian         remains     enumerated      by  M. Buteux from this pit
are, — Elephas      primigenius,      Rhinoceros      tichorhinus,      Cervus somo-
nensis ?, Cervus tarandus priscus,              Ursus spelaus, Hycena speltea,
Bos ptimigenius,        Equus adamaticus,          and   a   Felis.     It   would    be
essential to determine how these fossils are distributed               — which occur
in  bed  No.    2, and which in bed       No.   3.    This   has not hitherto been
done.      The   few marine shells occur mixed indiscriminately                with the
freshwater species, chiefly amongst the flints at the base of No. 3.
They    are very friable and somewhat scarce.               It   is on the top of this
bed of flints that the greater number of bones are found, and also,
it  is said,   the greater number of flint-implements.                   The author,
 however,     only saw some long          flint flakes     (considered      by   M.    de
 Perthes   as  flint knives) turned out of this          bed    in his  presence,    but
the workmanship         was not      very clear or apparent          ; still it  was as
much so as in some of the so-called flint knives from the peat-beds
and barrows.         There are specimens,          however, of true implements
("haches")in         M.   de   Perthes' collection from Menchecourt;                 one
noticed     by the author was from            a  depth of      5, and another       of  7
metres.      This would     take    them out from bed No.               1,  but would
leave it uncertain whether they came             from No. 2 or No. 3.             From
their general     appearance,    and traces of the matrix, the author would
be disposed     to place them in bed        No.    2, but  M.     de Perthes believes
them to be from No. 3        ;  if so, it must have been in some of the sub
ordinate clay seams occasionally intercalated in the white sand.
   Besides the concurrent testimony of all the workmen at the dif
ferent pits, which the author             after careful       examination       saw    no
reason    to doubt, the flint-implements           (" haches") bear upon them
selves internal evidence       of the truth of M. de Perthes' opinion.                 It
is  a peculiarity of fractured chalk flints to become deeply and per
manently stained and coloured, or to be left unchanged, according to
the nature of the matrix in which they are imbedded.                     In most clay
beds they become        outside of     a bright opaque white or porcelainic              ;
in white calcareous       or siliceous sand their fractured black surfaces
remain almost unchanged           ;  whilst in beds of ochreous             and ferru
ginous sands, the flints are stained of the light yellow and deep brown
colours so well exhibited          in the common ochreous gravel                 of the
neighbourhood        of London.       This change is the work of very long
time, and of moisture before          the opening out of the beds.              Now in

                                          5(i
looking over the large series of flint-implements in M. de Perthes' col
lection, it cannot fail to strike the most casual observer that those from
Menchecourt are almost always white and bright, whilst those from
Moulin Quignon       have a   dull yellow and brown surface ; and it may be
noticed that whenever       (as is often the case) any of the matrix adheres
to the flint, it is invariably of the same nature, texture, and colour
as  that of the respective      beds themselves.         In the    same way at St.
Acheul, where there are beds of white and others of ochreous gravel,
the flint-implements      exhibit corresponding variations in colour and
adhering matrix     ; added    to which,    as the  white gravel contains chalk
debris, there    are portions    of the gravel in which the flints are more
or less coated with     a film of deposited carbonate of lime ; and so it is
with the flint-implements          which    occur     in   those    portions     of the
gravel.     Further,   the surface    of many    specimens      is covered   with fine
dendritic    markings.       Some    few implements          also    show,    like   the
fractured flints, traces of wear, their sharp edges being blunted.                    In
fact, the flint-implements        form just as much a constituent part of
the gravel itself, — exhibiting       the action of the same later influences
and in the same force and degree,           — as the rough        mass   of flint frag
ments with which they are associated.
   With regard     to the geological age      of  these beds, the author refers
them to those usually designated as post-pliocene, and notices their
agreement     with many beds of that age in England.                   The Menche
court deposit much resembles            that of Fisherton near Salisbury           ; the
gravel of St. Acheul is like some on the Sussex                  coast  ; and that of
Moulin Quignon       resembles     the gravel at East Croydon, Wandsworth
Common, and many places near London.                        The author      even sees
reason,   from the general       physical phenomena, to question whether
the beds     of St. Acheul and Moulin Quignon may not possibly be
of  an age   one stage older than those of Menchecourt and St. Koch ;
but before that point can be determined,            a  more extended knowledge
of all the organic remains of the         several deposits is indispensable.
   The author next proceeds            to inquire into the causes which led
to the rejection of this and the cases before meutioned, and shows
that in the case of     M.  de Perthes' discovery,        it was in a great degree
the small     size  and indifferent       execution of the figures            and the
introduction     of many forms about which there might reasonably
be a  difference of opinion ; — in the case of the arrow-heads in Keut's

                                             57
Cave    a  hidden error was merely suspected                  ; — and   in the case of
the Liege cavern         he considers      that the question was discussed                 on
a false issue.      He therefore     is  of opinion that      these and many similar
cases require reconsideration          ; and that not only may some              of   these
prove true, but that many others, kept back by doubt or supposed
error, will be forthcoming.
    One very remarkable instance has already been brought under the
author's notice by       Mr. Evans        since   their return from France.                In
the 13th volume of the 'Archaeologia,'              published in 1800, is          a paper
by Mr. John Frere, F.R.S. and F.S.A., entitled
                                                                     " An Account of
Flint- Weapons discovered          at Hoxne in      Suffolk," wherein that gentle
man gives a section         of  a  brick-pit in which numerous flint-imple
ments had been found, at          a depth of 1 1 feet, in a bed of gravel con
taining    bones   of   some unknown          animal    ;  and concludes from the
ground being undisturbed and above the valley, that the specimens
must be of very great antiquity, and anterior to the last changes of
the surface of the country,              —a    very    remarkable       announcement,
hitherto overlooked.
    The author     at once proceeded         in search of this interesting locality,
and found a section now exposed to consist of —
                                                                                     feet.
   1. Earth and a few flints                                                          2
   2. Brown    brick-earth,  a carbonaceous      seam in middle     and one of
        gravel at base ; no organic      remains.   The workmen      stated that
        two flint-implements (one of which they shortly picked up in
        the author's presence) had been found about 10 feet from the
        surface during the last winter                                               12
   3. Grey clay, in places carbonaceous      and in others sandy, with recent
        land and freshwater     shells   (Planoriii, Valvata,    Succineo,  Piri-
        dium, Helix, and Cyclas) and bones of Mammalia                                 4
   4. Small subangular flint-gravel and chalk pebbles                                 2J
   5. Carbonaceous    clay (stopped by water)
    The   weapons      referred to by        Mr. Frere      are described by him as
 being found abundantly in bed No.                 4 ;    but at the spot where the
 work has now arrived, this bed is much thinner, and is not worked.
 In the small trench which the author                  caused    to be dug, he found
 no remains either of weapons or of bones.                   He  saw, however, iu the
 collection of    Mr. T. E. Amyot, of Diss,               specimens    of the    weapons,
 also an astragalus of the elephant from, it was supposed,                        this bed,

                                       58
and, from bed No. 3, the teeth of a horse, closely resembling those
from the elephant-bed of Brighton.
    The    specimens   of the  weapons    figured by   Mr. Frere, and those
now in the British Museum          and elsewhere,     present a singular simi
larity in work and     shape to the more pointed forms from St.        Acheul.
    One very important       fact connected with this section, is that it
shows the relative age of the bone and implement-bearing                   beds.
They form      a thin lacustrine deposit, which    seems to be superimposed
on the Boulder Clay, and to pass under a bed of the ochreous sand
and flint-gravel belonging to the great and latest drift-beds            of the
 district.
    The author purposely abstains for the present from all theoretical
considerations, confining himself to the corroboration of the facts : —
    1.  That the flint-implements are the work of man.
    2.  That they were found in undisturbed ground.
    3.  That they are associated with the remains of extinct Mammalia.
    4. That the period was a late geological one, and anterior to the
surface assuming its present outline,           so far as some   of its minor
features    are concerned.
    He   does not, however, consider that the facts, as they at present
 stand, of necessity    carry back Man in past time more than they bring
forward the great extinct Mammals              towards   our  own time,      the
evidence     having reference only to relative and not to absolute time         ;
 and he is    of opinion that many of the later geological changes may
have been sudden or of shorter duration than generally considered.
In   fact,   from the evidence     here exhibited, and from all that he
knows regarding drift phenomena generally, the author                  sees   no
reason against     the conclusion that this period of Man and the ex
tinct Mammals       — supposing   their contemporaneity to be proved —
was    brought    to a sudden end by       a  temporary inundation      of the
land; on the contrary,        he sees much to support        such a view on
purely geological considerations.
    The paper concludes with a letter from         Mr. John Evans, F.S.A.
and F.G.S., regarding       these implements from an antiquarian         rather
than   a geological point of view, and dividing them into three     classes : —
    1.  Flint flakes, — arrow-heads or knives.
   2. Pointed weapons       truncated at one end, and probably lance or
spear heads (fig. 2).

                                          59
   3. Oval or almond-shaped            implements with a cutting          edge all
round, possibly used as sling-stones or as axes (fig. 1).
   Mr. Evans points out, that in form and workmanship those of the
two last classes differed essentially from the implements of the so-
called    Celtic   period, which     are usually    more or less ground        and
polished, and cut at the wide and not the narrow end               ; and that had
they been found under any circumstances,                  they must have      been
regarded as the work of some other race than the Celts, or known
aboriginal     tribes.  He fully concurs with Mr. Prestwich,              that the
beds of drift in which they were found were entirely undisturbed.
 X. " Observations        on the Discovery       in various Localities of the
        Remains of Human Art mixed with the Bones of Extinct
        Races     of Animals."        By Charles Babbage, Esq., M.A.,
        F.R.S. &c.       Received May 26, 1859.
    Statements have recently been made relative to the discovery of
 works of human art occurring           in a breccia amongst bones       of ancieut
 animals, hitherto     supposed to have been extinct long anterior to the
 existence of our race.       These observations are supposed by some to
 prove the great antiquity of the human race            ;   whilst others, equally
 competent to form an opinion, admit that the intermixture                 of such
 remains presents a most perplexing mystery.
    Whatever may be the result of yet unpublished or of future and
 more extensive observations, it is certainly premature to assign              this
 great antiquity to our race, as long as the occurrence of such mix
 tures can be explained by known               causes  admitted to be still in
 action.
    Two    places have recently been pointed out          in which such mixtures
 are  stated to occur :  —   1st, certain localities in France ; 2nd, certain
 caves   in Sicily.    The latter    have   been visited by     Dr. Falconer, and
 as the information        respecting them which we at present possess,
 though     small, is yet much more definite than what is known of the
 French locality, my explanations will chiefly relate to the latter.
     It is stated that one of the Sicilian caves has its sides perforated
 by marine animals.
     That on penetrating         the  stalactitical  incrustation     covering the

                                        60
  roof of the cavern, and detaching fragments, it was found to consist
  of a breccia of bones of animals long extinct, mixed with fragments
  of flint or stone, bearing evident traces    of human art.
     In order to explain     these  circumstances, it is only necessary to
  admit the upheaval of     the land and the occurrence    of torrents.
      1st Period. — Let   us   suppose    two caverns, a lower, A, and au
  upper,   B C, communicating with       each other by a long rent    or  pipe
  P.    This pipe   may be supposed     of any height, sufficient when filled
  with water to produce the required force.
     The lower    cavern is supposed    to be nearly at the level of the   sea.
   Pholades and other marine animals will perforate or attach them
  selves to the bottom and sides      of the  cavern, and if the  sea entirely
;

                                         Gl
fill it : the roof, too, or at least that portion adjacent to the mouth of
the cavern, may        be similarly    affected.     The rocks in which     these
caverns occur may be of any geological age.
    2nd Period. — By the gradual or quick upheaval of the strata in
which     these caverns   occur, they may become dry.
    During    the rising, or at a later period, fragments          of rock may
have accumulated at the open mouth of the lower cavern, and thus
have stopped up its entrance,            leaving the roof, sides, and floors
bearing evident traces of having been an ocean cave.
    3rd Period. — Ages may         have   elapsed    during which other strata
may have been depositing in other portions                 of our globe.      But
ultimately     the earth became       inhabited     by those ancient, but now
extinct mammalia, whose remains abound in its caverns.
    4 th Period. — Ages may again           have intervened when man, in his
 first rude   state of  existence,   entering this deserted den through the
 opening its former occupants had used,               might  have   been glad to
 shelter himself from an inclement            climate in this bone-house of      a
 more ancient world.
     During this period       traces  of man's skill would probably        be left
 within his miserable     abode    ; pottery,   if he possessed   the art ;  char
 coal or charred wood,       if  he were acquainted with fire ; rude cutting
 instruments     of flint or other hard        stone, perhaps spear or arrow
 heads.

   Fig.  4 represents   the caverns at the end of the fourth period.
   Zith Period. — Torrents entering by the aperture at C, might now
have swept through the upper cavern, perhaps at successive       intervals
of time.     The   effect  of such torrents would    be to wash from the
sloping floor of    the upper cavern,    the mixed remains of animal and
human life, together with the earliest traces of human art.
   In  some   of  these catastrophes, the workman, as well as his work,
may have been entombed         together in the lower cavern.
   Thus in the      course   of time the whole of the lower cavern may
have been filled up even to the roof.
   This   state is represented   in fig. 5.

                                          63
                                                                                  •
    The  effect of infiltration through the roof would now            cement into
 a breccia the mingled remnants from the upper chamber, and enclose
 them, as it were, in a marble monument, in their new, though not
 their latest resting-place.
    But the infiltration proceeding from the roof would              act first, and
 most powerfully, in cementing the upper part of the intruded mass.
    The lower portion would be less consolidated, and therefore                  less
 capable of resisting any pressure from above.
    6th Period. — In the progress of time, some                 torrent of extra
 ordinary magnitude may have penetrated through the upper cavern,
 and, filling the channel or pipe P, have acted               by its hydrostatic
 pressure on the semi-consolidated matter in the lower one.                  As the
 water accumulated in the pipe, the pressure would become immense,
 and ultimately the materials included in the lower cavern would give
 way at their     point of least       resistance.     This would probably be
towards the middle or bottom of the original entrance.                    The first
sudden rush would probably clear out the greater part of the con
tents of the lower cavern, leaving, however, —
    1st.  Those    portions     attached     to the roof     by   the   infiltrated
matter.
    2nd. Those portions on the flcor more consolidated by pressure
than the middle which gave way              ;  and also other portions of the
loose rubbish    which     the form of the floor at the entrance of the
cave might have intercepted          in its course.
    After this reopening of the lower          cavern,  the access of air would
accelerate   evaporation from its roof, and that portion of the breccia
still adhering to it would gradually acquire the external coating of
stalactite which usually occurs in caves.
   In the meantime the dropping from the roof, falling upon the
floor, might also contribute to consolidate the remaining fragments,
and, although more slowly, cover the whole of them with                   a  stalag-
mitic floor.
   In this  state, on entering the lower cave, the walls would be found
perforated by marine animals, and no traces of animal life or of human
art would present itself      ;  but on excavating the floor, both would be
found below the stalagmite          ;  whilst   if the curious inquirer should
drive his pick into the roof, its fragments would bear testimony to
the same fact.

   That   caverns are occasionally filled with water, and after remaining
full perhaps for centuries,     are drained by artificial or natural causes,
is well known.      A very interesting    case presented   itself to me when
visiting the caverns of Mitchelstown       in Ireland.
   These caverns had recently (1833) become accessible, and were
then very imperfectly explored.         I expressed to the guides my wish
to visit some of the unexplored portion, and, after traversing various
chambers during six hours, we entered a long and lofty cavern, the
floor of which sloped rather steeply towards one side.             The whole
floor was covered      with   a coat  of soft red mud, about three inches
thick, still holding a portion of the water in which it had been sus
pended.      No trace whatever of the footsteps of man or of animals
appeared ; the impression of our own feet alone marked the track
up to the point which we had reached.            Being rather in advance of
my companions, my attention was suddenly attracted by what ap
peared to me to be about a bushel of soot lying in a small heap on
the floor.     On examination,     I found it to consist of a moist spongy
substance,   of a  black colour, which might,     if dry, have assumed the
form of   a coarse   black powder.     Asking the opinion of my guide,     he
suggested    that it might have been the remains of a fire lighted by
some previous explorer      ;  but this was inadmissible.     I looked round
for matter of the same kind,          but on further    search   I could  uot
detect   any other instance      ; however, accidentally     casting my eye

                                                   65
towards       the      roof of the       cavern,    I   observed    a   black patch vertically
above the heap of supposed soot lying on the floor, and from 20 to
30 feet above it.               The dotted line, a                       b, fig. 5, may repre
sent the position.
     On my return from                the cavern    I   examined the black sooty matter,
and found that it left but very small traces under the action of the
blowpipe.
     On the following day, having                  made inquiries as to the drainage               of
the neighbouring            country,      I   was informed         that about twenty years
before my visit, a stream                of water had       been diverted from the valley
in which it originally flowed, into another adjacent valley.
   I then visited several quarries, in one of which, about a mile from
the caves,        I   observed    a   small stream of water terminating in a little
pool or sink.          In this pool      I    noticed slight eddies, which occasionally
sucked in very small particles floating on the surface                        of the      water.
     I   now visited the valley from which the original stream had been
diverted, and found at some elevation a peat bog to which it had pro
bably given rise. This peat was in several parts nearly black                         ;   the most
decayed portion greatly resembled                       the black matter      I   had brought
from the cavern.            The origin of this black matter in the                  cavern now
became apparent.
    The large         caverns    I had visited       were    considerably below the level
of the    peat moss, and the stream which flowed through                          it. A portion
of its waters         was conveyed by sinks and crevices                 into the caves, and
kept them continually full.                    There must, however, have been some
very small leakage through which, when the stream which supplied
the water was cut off, those caverns were, after many years, laid dry.
    A    small mass of unconsolidated                    peat, sufficiently   light to       float,
must have been conveyed by the water into those caverns.                                    When
it arrived at the spot on which the black matter was found, the
piece of peat which still floated must have been pressed against the
roof of the cavern.               Remaining        there undisturbed for years, it may
have become            by decomposition           specifically heavier than water, and
then have subsided vertically down on the floor to the place on which
I   found   it,   leaving in the black spot on the roof the certificate of its
former residence.               On the other hand, the piece of peat may have
retained its power of floating, and only have descended                            to the floor
of the cavern by the             slow escape       of the water.
    VOL. X.                                                                       F

     Such circumstances as these ought to induce us to examine with
great caution, any instances                 of   the occurrence            of works of human art
mixed with the remains of animals not yet proved to have been co
existent with man.              Accident might have conveyed and hidden in the
Mitchelstown            caverns, a portion           of human        dress instead          of   a   patch   of
peat.         It   is obvious that under slightly altered circumstances, in
struments formed by man, the bony remains of his frame, or those
of other       recent animals, might, by                  still existing        causes, be conveyed
into deep recesses in the bowels                         of the earth,          and there deposited
with        the remains of animals of an entirely different geological
age.
     Cases might occur in which                   the water passing in larger quantity
would        convey into such caverns                     a    quantity         of    suspended          mud,
differing in its character at various seasons, and thus silt up the
confused relics of distant ages in                   a   regularly stratified deposit.
     It     is quite        possible that      the human              remains might                  thus    be
enclosed        beneath the stalagmitic                      crust, whilst           the   more       ancient
remains were scattered                 above      it,    uncovered,     or covered               by   another
coat      of stalagmite.
     If   we suppose          the existence       of two upper          caves,        B    and C, at dif
ferent heights, each separately communicating with the lowest cave,
A,    as in fig.       7,   then still more          remarkable facts                might       ultimately
present themselves             to those whom accident should lead to examine
the lowest cave.               If, for example, the highest of                         these     caves      (C)
contained only the remains of the extinct races of animals, and the
other, or middle cave              (B), nothing but             those   of      man and the works
of his own hands, the following                    series      of   events might occur               :—
     1st.   A   flood directing its course wholly through the middle cave
(B), might wash down the fragments of                                 the    bones         and works of
man from           that cave, and deposit them on the floor of the lowest
cavern      (A).
     2nd.    In long
                   a          series   of   years,    a   thick stalagmitic covering might
be formed, giving an entire new stony floor to that cavern.
     3rd.    Afterwards
                      another flood, rising to    higher level, acci        a
dentally taking its course through the highest cave (C), might cover
this new stalagmitic floor of the lowest cave (A) with the bony frag
ments of these more ancient animals.
     4th. The continued infiltration                      from above            might       again        cover

                                          67
these remains with another thick coating of stalagmite               ;   such altera
 tions might even be several times repeated.
    The   annexed    sketch will explain this case more clearly            :—
                                        Fig. 7.
    The   great geological law, that the order       of succession      of strata in
 dicates the order of their antiquity, the lowest being always the
 oldest, is limited by the condition that those strata shall not have
 been removed      from their original beds.
    But   the action   of causes still existing may have produced apparent
 deviations from this order, and the present state of geological science
 seems to require an examination         of such exceptional     cases.
    If a great river, similar to the Mississippi        or the Amazon, flowed
 through    a country whose superficial stratum consisted of a thin bed
 of chalk     succeeded    by gault,     then during     thousands of ages         it
 would distribute, by means          of an ocean    current, its milky burden
over the bottom of the existing ocean, on which, after                a   lengthened
 interval, a bed of chalk would reappear.
    When the superficial        bed   of chalk  over   which    the river flowed
was cut through, its waters would begin to act on the newly-exposed
gault  ;  and after another period of equally vast length,             a  stratum of
gault might cover       the chalk, thus producing an extensive inversion
of the two strata.
    But this would     be dependent      on the relative fineness       and specific
gravity of the particles of the two substances.              It  is possible that
the particles of gault,      if  larger or of greater specific gravity than
those  of the chalk, might arrive         at a greater   terminal velocity, and
                                                                   f   2

even overtake and pass through          those   of the chalk still    suspended,
thus forming      a bed  below the chalk, or a mixed bed of chalk passing
into gault, and then ultimately        a bed  of gault above the chalk.
    In such circumstances few or none of the larger fossils would
occur, but possibly the remains of infusorial animals might enable us
to identify the material of the ancient and of the new but inverted
deposit of gault.
   The    case  of remains of human art found imbedded with              bones  of
extinct     races  of animals in deposits of ancient gravel,            seems   to
require a different explanation.
    Admitting,     however, the existence     of  those  animals to have been
contemporaneous with the original distribution of the gravel, it by no
means certainly follows that the race         of man   was coeval with them.
    For the remains of man and his rude arts might occur on the
surface    of that gravel long    ages after the extinction   of  those races   of
animals.       Several causes might produce their mixture         : —
    1st.  A   vast lake bursting    its barriers by erosion, or by an earth
quake, might carry before it in its impetuous course the superficial
remains of man, mixed up with vast quantities of gravel, containing
the bones of the extinct races of animals, and deposit them over a
large area of land at a lower level.
    2nd. The change of the course          of  a  river, or of  a   branch of its
delta, might produce the same mixture           of the remains of two distinct
and far distant ages.          It  might, by the clearing out of its new
channel, carry off the gravel and the remains of extinct animals, and
deposit them, mixed up with specimens                of human art, on spots
which, after a few centuries, might again reappear as dry land.
   3rd.    A narrow     pass, the outlet   of  a stream    of water, might     be
stopped up by the avalanches falling from a glacier after a severe
winter, and the lake formed by the stream             might thus periodically
rise, until the    pressure broke through the barrier.
    4th. Amongst       the phenomena occurring          during earthquakes, it
has been      observed   that large cracks have suddenly opened and             as
suddenly closed, either immediately or shortly after.               During  these
momentary or temporary openings, the remains of the arts of man,
and even man himself, may have dropped into the chasm.                     Under
such    circumstances, remains of man and his arts might occur in

                                              fl9
formations      of any    date.      If   the cleft occurred        in rock or in anv
very    hard material,     traces of it would remain to indicate their origin.
If   it occurred     in clay or softer material, the track through which
these    remains entered might be partially or even entirely obliterated.
If   the cleft    occurred     in tolerably compact gravel and then imme
diately closed,     it would scarcely          be possible at a future       period to
trace   its origin.
    The discussion       of the recent observations of Mr. Prestwich on
flints,   worked apparently by the hand of man, found deeply im
bedded      in ancient gravel, as well as the extensive observations of
Dr. Falconer on the bone-caves                   of Sicily, have given a new and
important interest to the great             question of the antiquity of the resi
dence    of our race on the planet we inhabit.
    Having examined a few of these flint-instruments,                    I am satisfied
that    several   of them      have     been worked         by human hands.       This
opinion is founded upon the previous examination many years ago                       of
the mode      then   used for making gun-flints.
    Amongst the many valuable observations of Dr. Falconer,                         one
fact    to which      he   testifies     deserves      the most marked attention,
and    may possibly assist in directing              us to the true solution    of the
problem.
    Dr. Falconer has noticed the fact that the greater portion of these
bones    belong to the Hippopotamus,              and also that they occur    in their
 several    deposits   in enormous numbers.                 In  each cave there must
 have been     several thousands,       if not    tens   of thousands, of individuals.
 The question immediately suggests                itself, what causes produced this
 vast   collection    of individuals       of the      same   race   entombed in    one
 common sepulchre?
    It is scarcely possible to       suppose      that any instinct could have led
the   Hippopotamus, when death approached, to have chosen particular
spots    where the bones of his race were exposed to his view.                  If this
were so,     then most probably the existing race would possess the same
instinct.
    Another question arises        : Were these remains originally deposited in
different localities, and afterwards transported by some common cause
to these     various caverns and beaches           ?  Water seems the only probable
mode      of conveyance     : if  this were so, traces of the rolling action          of
water must be found on            all the bones, but this          I  apprehend is not

                                            70
   the case.     Moreover, it is difficult to conceive how water could have
   collected the boues of a multitude of individuals of the same race,
  distributed over a wide extent of country, into a few favoured
   localities.     The    bones   of all other animals inhabiting        the same
  country, and remaining on its surface, would have been exposed to
  the same action, and should have been deposited in the same tomb.
  If these   animals all perished at the same time in each locality, some
  common cause must have produced the catastrophe.
      Although the existing evidence may be insufficient to lead us to
  the true solution of this interesting question, yet it may be useful to
  throw out hypotheses, which, by accounting for some of the facts,
  shall direct the attention of future observers to the examination of
  such special     points as may either partially support          or directly dis
 prove these conjectures.
     With this view      I  shall offer two conjectures, one dependent on the
 subsidence of the land, the other upon the rising of the waters.
      Conjecture    I, — By the subsidence of the land.
     Let   us imagine that the basin       of the bottom of the Mediterranean
 had at a former period been on               a  level with, or just above      the
 African continent.         Sicily and the various islands would then have
 stood above it as mountain chains.
     One portion of the drainage of this land may have been effected
 by a vast river passing into the Atlantic through              the opening now
 known as the Straits of Gibraltar.
     In this   state  of things   extensive  freshwater lakes and other large
 rivers    may have       contributed     to support    large   herds of Hippo
 potami.
     In such circumstances the gradual           subsidence   of this land would
 check the outflow of its rivers, and occasion extensive marshes and
lakes,   a state    of things    favourable to the increase       of the Hippo
 potami.       As the subsidence       proceeded,   those animals which       dwelt
on the banks of the lakes and rivers would be driven inland.                   The
waters     of the Atlantic, entering through the channel of the former
river, would convert the low ground and the marshes into                  sea, and
thus gradually isolate the sinking land from the African coast.
    When this      state   of the country had      caused   the Hippopotami      to
multiply     rapidly, an increased       rapidity in the sinking     of its lands
through the waters, might drive those animals rapidly to the higher

                                          71
lands, which would then form islands, on the borders of which they
would congregate       in multitudes, until numbers of them, collected in
ravines, rushing       on in their attempts to escape in search          of food,
might trample       each other to death and leave their bodies at the foot
of impassable precipices washed by this new             sea.
     Conjecture    II. — Let    us suppose that the basin       of the Mediter
ranean was formerly dry land shut in from the Atlantic by a barrier
at the Straits of Gibraltar.        In  these circumstances the whole       of the
present Mediterranean Sea would have been a country sunk more or
less under the level      of the    ocean  ;  just  as a large tract  of country
 around the Dead Sea is at present.
     The country included in this great depression might be warmer
 than others situated in the same latitude, and would be full of lakes
 fed by rivers, since there could be no drainage except from evaporation.
 It   would   therefore probably       be    favourable to the growth of the
  Hippopotamus.
     Imagine     now some convulsion           to  have  opened   the Straits    of
 Gibraltar,    so as to have allowed the waters         of the Atlantic to enter
  this vast basin.     The salt river thus introduced might require          days,
 or weeks, or months, or years, before it filled this immense cavity           ; it
 might also increase       its velocity as it wore away the channel of its
 entrance.
     Under these circumstances the Hippopotami               would be gradually
 driven to the higher ground, and those             mountainous regions which
 now form the islands of the Mediterranean                 would then have re
 ceived on their shores the hosts         of animals, driven by this inundation
  to seek dry land on which to repose and food on which they might
  subsist.
     Both of    these hypotheses account for the aggregation in different
  localities, of the remains of large numbers of animals of the same
  class, dwelling    amongst rivers and lakes         ; both equally account for
  their destruction on the same spots, either by trampling each other to
  death in the rush to escape, or by the slower processes of drown
  ing or starvation.      But neither hypothesis accounts for the fractured
  state  of these   bones, even though        the animals should have      rushed
  over the precipice.      It might   be expected     that some portion of these
  Hippopotami,      escaping from the deluge which destroyed their race,
  would have reached          the  plains of some larger      island,   and   then

                                              7:2
 separating in search         of food,      have     left their       carcases,   wasted   by
 famine,    variously scattered at       a  distance from each other.
    The following questions are thus suggested for inquiry : —
     Are the bones of young and of old animals mixed indiscriminately
 throughout the whole of these bone-beds                   ?
     Is it possible to distinguish the             bones       of  females    from those of
 males   ?
    Do the bones         of the larger and stronger individuals                     occur in
 greater abundance near the top              of the       bone-beds,     and those of the
 smaller and feebler animals nearer the bottom                     of those    beds ?
     If  the  sea   followed these       animals quickly,             the young and the
 feeblest would perish before they reached the great deposits                       of bones.
    Although not        at all confident that either            of   these explanations is
 the true one,    I  look upon them as open to less objection than any
 other of which       I  have    yet heard, and therefore give them                   a  tem
 porary assent.
    The conclusion        to which      these     remarks        lead, is that whilst      we
 ought to be quite prepared to examme any evidence which tends to
 prove the great antiquity of our race, yet that                    if  the facts adduced
can be explained and accounted for by the operation                        of  a few  simple
and natural causes, it is unphilosophical                    to infer the coexistence of
man with those races of extinct animals.
    The interest     and importance        of  the subject are such, that new and
still more    extensive     researches     cannot fail to be made            ;  and if  these
remarks shall in any way contribute to lighten the labour of future
inquirers, or to promote the true explanation of the facts, they will
have    fully attained the object of their publication.
XI. "Remarks             on Colour-Blindness."                   By Sir John F. W.
           Herschel, Bart., F.R.S.
    [Extracted from a Report by Sir J. F. W. H. on Mr. Pole's paper
on the same subject *, and communicated at the request of the Pre
sident and Council.]
    I consider this paper       as  in many respects            an exceedingly valuable
contribution to our knowledge of the curious subject of colour-blind-
              * " Proceedings,''   vol. viii. p. 1 7 '2 ; and vol. ix. p. 716.

                                                     73
aess — 1st, because it is the only clear and consecutive account of
that affection which has yet been given by a party affected, in pos
session of a knowledge of what has yet been said and written on it
by others,        and     of the theories        advanced           to account for             it,   and who,
from general         education and habits of mind,                    is   in   a   position to discuss
his own          case scientifically       ;   and     2ndly, for the reasons the author
himself alleges           why such        a   person    is    really more favourably situated
for describing the phenomena                     of colour-blindness,               than any normal-
eyed person          can possibly be.             It   is    obvious that on the very same
principle that       the latter considers himself entitled to refer all his per
ceptions         of colour to three primary or elementary sensations —
whether these three be red, blue, and yellow,                              as Mayer (followed              in
this respect        by the generality of             those who have written on colours)
has done,         or red, green,           and      violet,    as    suggested            by   Dr. Young,
reasoning on         Wollaston's account of                 the appearance           of the spectrum
to    his      eyes — on    the very same principle                 is   a   person in          Mr. Pole's
condition, or one           of any other description of abnormal colour-vision,
quite     equally entitled to be heard, when he declares that he refers his
sensations        of colour        to two primary elements,                  whose combination in
various proportions               he recognizes, or thinks he recognizes,                       in all hues
presented        to him, and which,            if   he pleases to call yellow and blue, no
one can         gainsay him       ;   though, whether these terms express to him
the same          sensations they suggest               to us, or whether his sensation                    of
light with absence of colour corresponds to our white,                                     is   a    question
which must          for   ever remain open (although                I      think     it   probable that
such      isreally the case). All we are entitled to require on receiving
such      testimony        is,
                         that the party giving   should have undergone
                                                                    it
that sort        of education of           the sight and judgment,                    especially with
reference        to the prismatic             decomposition          of natural and artificial
colours,        for want    of which the generality of persons whose vision                                is
unimpeachably             normal, appear to entertain very confused notions,
and are         quite incapable           of discussing         the subject of colour in                   a
manner         satisfactory to the photologist.
     It   is   as necessary       to distinguish between our sensations                         of colour,
and the         qualities of the light producing them, as                       it   is   to distinguish
between         bitterness, sweetness,           sourness,       saltness,      &c, and the             che
mical       constitution         of the   several      bodies which we call bitter, sweet,
&c.         Whatever       their      views    of prismatic analysis or composition

                                                 74
might suggest       to Wollaston          and Young,           I   cannot persuade          myself
that either of them recognized the sensation of greenness                                as a con
stituent of the sensations they received in viewing chrome yellow, or
the petal of a Marigold on the one hand, and ultramarine, or the
blue Salvia on the other        ;   or that they could fail to recognize a certain
redness     in the colour of the violet, which Newton appears to have
had in view when he regarded the spectrum as                             a    sort of octave      of
colour, tracing in the repetition of redness in the extreme refrangible
ray, the commencement of a higher octave too feeble to affect the
sight in its superior          tones.           Speaking       of my own          sensations,       I
should say that in fresh grass, or the laurel- leaf,                      I   do not recognize
the sensation      either of blue or of yellow, but something sui generis                             ;
while, on the other hand,            I   never fail to be sensible of the presence
of the    red element     in either violet, or any of the                 hues to which the
name     of purple is indiscriminately given               ;    and my impression in this
respect     is borne out by the similar testimony                  of persons, good judges
of colour, whom       I   have questioned on the subject.
  I    would wish, then, to be understood as bearing in mind this
distinction when speaking of the composition of colours by the super
position of coloured lights on the retina.   It seems impossible to
reason ou  the joiut or  compound  sensation which ought to result
from the supraposition in the sensorium of any two or more sensa
tions which we may please to call primary                           ;   so that    if,   following
common usage,     speak in what follows of red, yellow, and blue (or
                   I
in reference to Young's theory of red, green, and violet) as primary
colours, refer only to the possibility of producing all coloured sensa
          I
tions by the union on the retina of different proportions                                of lights,
competent separately to produce those colours, which                               is    purely   a
matter of experience.
  It   is   necessary to premise this, when            I       remark that    I    by    no means
regard as      a   logical sequence             Mr. Pole's conclusion in            §     15, that
because      he perceives    as colours only yellow and blue, therefore the
neutral impression resulting from their union must be that seusation
which the normal-eyed call green.                     On the contrary,         I   am strongly
disposed to believe         that he      sees    white as we do, for reasons which                I
am about to adduce.
  Mr. Maxwell        has lately announced his inability                      to form green        by
the   combination of blue           and yellow.         On the other hand, the pris

                                           75
matic analysis of the fullest and most vivid yellows (those which
excite the sensation of yellowness in the greatest perfection), as the
colours of bright yellow flowers, or that of the yellow chromate of
mercury,     clearly demonstrates the fullness, richness, and brilliancy
of their colour to      arise from their reflexion        of the whole, or nearly
the whole of the red, orange, yellow, and green rays, and the sup
pression of all, or nearly all the blue, indigo, and violet portion of the
spectrum.      On the hypothesis of an analysis of sensation correspond
ing   to an analysis    of coloured light, these facts would seem incom
patible with the simplicity           of the   sensation    yellow, and it would
appear impossible (on that hypothesis) to express them otherwise
than by declaring red and green to be primary sensations, and yellow
a mixture    of them — a proposition which           needs only to be understood
to be   repudiated — quite       as decidedly as that the sensation        of green
ness is a mixture     of the sensations of     blueness    and yellowness, and for
the same reason     ;  the complete want of suggestion of the so-called
simple sensations     by the asserted complex ones.
    Mr. Maxwell's      assertion    that blue and yellow do not make green,
assuredly appears startling as contradictory to all common experience                ;
but the common experience            appealed   to is that   of artists, dyers, and
others in the habit of mixing natural colours as they are presented                to
us in pigments, coloured tissues,            &c, who      have for the most     part
never seen     a prismatic spectrum, or at least attended to its phaeno-
mena.      The perceptions of colour afforded by such objects              are those
 of white light from which certain rays            have    been abstracted by ab
 sorption, that is to say, they are negative hues, or hues of darkness
rather than of light, inasmuch as all the colouring of the artist is
 based,   not on the generation, but on the destruction of light.               This
 circumstance, which is not generally recognized, eveu among edu
cated artists, has vitiated all the language          of chromatics    as applied to
art, and so placed a barrier between the painter and the photologist,
which has to be surmounted before they can come to                   a  right under
standing of each        other's     meaning.      It  is evident,   that, to make
experiments      on the subject         free  from     this  objection, absorptive
colours must be discarded, at least in bodily mixture with each other.
 Thus it is true that        a   dingy green     may be produced by rubbing
 together in powder prussian blue and the yellow chromate of mer
 cury above mentioned          ;  but both these       agree in reflecting a con

                                           76
  siderable, and the latter     a very large proportion of green light, to the
 predominance of which in the joint reflected beam its tint is owing.
  So also, when blue and yellow liquids (not acting chemically on each
 other) are mixed, as in water-colour drawings, greens, sometimes
 very lively ones, are produced.              In these    cases the yellow absorbs
 almost all the whole of the incident blue, indigo, and violet light, and
 the blue a very large proportion of the red, orange, and yellow, both
 allowing much green to pass         ; and   to this, rather than to   a mixture  of
 the other rays, the resulting tint is due.
     In the light transmitted by cuprate of ammonia of a certain thick
 ness, the red,     orange, yellow, and green            are wholly   extinguished,
while the blue, indigo, and violet are allowed to pass.               The result is
 the fullest and bluest blue it is possible to obtain.            From this result,
 compared with that derived from the analysis of natural yellows, it
 follows that the union on the retina of the yellowest yellow, and the
 bluest blue, in such proportions that neither shall be in excess, so as
 to' tinge the resulting light either yellow or blue, is not green, but
 white.     The   same    conclusion     follows from dividing       the spectrum
 into two, the one portion containing all the less refrangible rays up
 to the   limit of the   green   and blue, the other all the remaining rays.
 If   the blue portion be suppressed, and the remainder reunited by                a
refraction in the opposite direction, the resulting beam is yellow,               if
 the other, blue, both vivid colours —but             if  neither, white of course,
and not green, results from the exact recomposition of the original
 white beam.
     It may be objected to this, that in the complementary colours
 exhibited    by doubly- refracted pencils in polarized light, yellow             is
often found to be complementary to purple, and blue to orange.
But in neither of       these pairs    of colours is the spectrum divided in
the manner above indicated         ;  and, moreover, in many instances yellow
and blue are        found as complementary             colours in the oppositely
polarized pencils     ;  of which examples will be found in the scale of
tints produced by sulphate of barytes in my paper " On the Action
of Crystallized Bodies in Homogeneous Light " (Phil. Trans. 1820,
                " Rich yellow"                                         "full blue"
Table    I.).                        appears also as opposed to
in the   scale  of complementary tints exhibited by mica in my " Trea
tise on    Light" (Encyc. Metrop., art. 507). It is not asserted that
either   a  good yellow or     a good    blue cannot be produced          otherwise

                                                    77
than in a           particular manner, but that they                  can be produced in that
particular          manner, and that when                so produced, their union               affects
the eye      with no sensation of             greenness.
     Let two very narrow strips of white paper, A, B, be placed parallel
to one     another in sunshine, so as to be seen projected on a perfectly
black ground             (a hollow shadow),         and viewed through a prism having
the refracting           edge parallel to them, the refraction being towards the
eye,   and let the nearer             B   be gradually         removed         towards A, so that
the red   portions of B's spectrum shall fall upon the green portion of
A's.     Their union will produce yellow, or, if too far advanced,
orange.         On the other hand, it will               be seen that the yellow space in
B's spectrum              on which the blue of A's falls is replaced by                     a   streak
of white, — whiteness, and not greenness,                            being the resultant of the
joint action            of   these   rays on the retina.               If      the strips be made
wedge-shaped, tapering to fine points, andA being still white, B be
made of paper coloured with the yellow chromate of mercury before
mentioned, the whiteness of the streak where the blue of A mixes
with    the yellow of B near the                       pointed extremities will be very
striking.
     There is a certain shade of cobalt-blue glass which insulates, or
very nearly so, a definite yellow ray from the rest                              of the spectrum,
suppressing the orange and                    a   great deal of the green.            If the     spec
trum    of B,        formed and coloured as last described, be viewed through
this glass      ,   a very well-defined image            of    it,   clearly separated      from its
strong     red and very faint blue                images,     will   be seen.      As the   glass in
question            allows blue rays to pass, the white object, A, besides its
definite    yellow image, will form               a   broad blue, indigo, and violet train
nearer     to the eye. Now let                 B   be gradually brought up towards                  A,
so   that the violet, indigo, and blue rays of this train shall coincide in
succession    with the yellow image of B, — no sensation of greenness will
arise    at any part of its movement.     Again,      white card be laid
                                                                      if   a
down       on       a   black surface, the edge nearest the eye, when refracted
towards         the spectator by          a   prism, will of course be fringed with the
more refrangible            half of the spectrum. Let this be viewed through
such     a   glass,       and in the blue space so seen introduce one half of                        a
narrow rectangular slip  of paper thus coloured, having its upper edge
in   contact with the lower edge of the white card, the other half pro
jecting laterally beyond the card.                       In this arrangement the definite

                                                   78
image     of   the yellow paper insulated by the glass                     will   be seen divided
into a yellow half, projecting beyond the blue fringe, and a purplish-
or bluish-white          one   within       it,   hardly to be distinguished              from the
image     of the white          paper,      of which       it    seems    a   continuation, and
which through the glass in question appears                          a   pale blue.      This   same
purplish tint      was observed to arise also under the following circum
stances   :— Laying down in                a    good diffused light           a   paper of an ex
ceedingly beautiful             ultramarine         blue, and beside          it,     and somewhat
overlapping        it,   another coloured with the same yellow chromate,                           I
set upon the line         of junction       a     sheet   of   glass inclined to the plane             of
the papers upwards towards the eye, so as to allow the blue to be
seen by transmitted             light, while the yellow reflected from the glass
was at the same time received into the eye.                           By varying the inclina
tion of the glass, the yellow reflexion could be made more or less
vivid, so as either to be nearly imperceptible                            or quite to       kill   the
blue    of the paper.           But    at no stage         of its intensity, gradually in
creased from one to the other extreme,                         was the slightest tendency to
greenness       produced.            The colour         passed      from blue to yellow, not
through green, but through                  a     pale uncertain purplish tint, not easy
to describe, but         as remote         from green as could be well imagined.
   Of     course      in all such          experiments one eye only must be used.
Stereoscopic superposition of colour, which at first sight would ap
pear readily available, does not satisfy the requisite conditions, and
yields no definite results.
   The conclusions from               these facts may be summed up as follows                      —
                                                                                                   :
1st.   That in     no case can the sensation                   of   green be produced by the
joint action on the             of two lights, in neither of which, separately,
                               eye
prismatic green          exists  ;2ndly. That the joint action of two lights,
separately producing             the most lively sensations                 of blue and yellow,
does not give rise to that                 of   green, even when           one    of   them contains
in its composition the totality of green light in the spectrum                                         ;
and, 3rdly. That all our liveliest sensations of yellow are produced                                   by
the joint action of rays, of which those separately exciting the ideas
of red and green form       large majority
                                      a    and that    decided yellow
                                                                ;                 a
impression       is   produced by the union of these only.
   From these premises                it   would     seem       the easiest possible step to
conclude the non-existence of yellow as                        a    primary colour.         But this
conclnsion     I   am unable to admit in the face                      of the facts, — 1st, that

                                                       79
a yellow ray, incapable of prismatic analysis into green and red, may
be shown to exist, both in the spectrum and in flames in which soda
is present   ;   and 2ndly, that neither red nor green, as sensations,                                      are
in the remotest           degree suggested              by that yellow in its action on the
eye.     Whether under these circumstances the vision of normal-eyed
persons should be termed trichromic                          or tetrachromic, seems an open
question.
   That Mr. Pole's vision                     is oftchromic,       however, there can be no
doubt.       If I    could ever have entertained any as to the correctness
of the    views      I   have        embodied of the subject in that epithet, after
reading all      I have         been able         to meet with respecting                   it,   this paper
would have dispelled it.                      That     he sees blue as we do, there                    is    no
ground for doubting              ;   and I       think   it   extremely likely that his sensa
tion of whiteness           is      the same as ours.                Whether his             sensation        of
yellow corresponds to ours of yellow, or of green,                                it   is   impossible to
decide, though the former seems to me most likely.
   One of the most remarkable of the features                                 of this       case, and in
 deed   of all similar          ones,    is   the feebleness         of   the efficacy            of the     red
 rays of the spectrum in point of illuminating                            power, which certainly
 very strongly suggests an explanation drawn from the theory of three
 primary coloured species                    of light, to      one   of which the colour-blind
 may be supposed absolutely insensible.                            Mr. Pole himself evidently
 leans to this opinion.                 I     had satisfied myself, however, in the case
 of the late Mr. Troughton, that the                          extreme red — that pure and de
 finite red which          is    seen     in     the solar spectrum            only when the more
 luminous red         is   suppressed,            and in which       I    cannot persuade myself
 that any yellow exists, was not invisible to him, — though of course not
 seen as red     ;   and on supplying                  Mr. Pole with          a   specimen        of   a   glass,
 so compounded             of   a    cobalt-blue and          a   red glass as to transmit posi
 tively no vestige              of any other ray, but that copiously,                             so that       a
 candle      seen        through        it     appears       considerably         luminous,         and the
 window-bars against                a   cloudy sky are well seen              if  other light be kept
 from falling on the eye, — am informed  I    him that he saw throughby
    " gas,
 it        fire and other strong lights with perfect distinctness," and
 that the colour so seen                is   a   "very      deep dark     yellow."          Now     it     seems
 to me impossible to attribute this to any minute per-centage                                       of yellow
 light of the same refrangibility, which this                             can be supposed              to con
 tain.  The purity of its tint    extraordinary   is                      ;   and its total intensity

                                                        80
so small, that supposing                     it reduced         to one- tenth       of its illuminating
power by the suppression of the whole of its primary red constituent,
I   cannot imagine that any gas-flame or fire-light would be visible
through          it,   or any other luminous body but the sun.
    Still   it   remains        a    fact, however explained, that the red rays                             of the
spectrum generally are to the colour-blind                                  comparatively but feebly
luminous.              Mr. Pole speaks of red in more places than                                     one as      "a
darkening power                 ;"   and in the letter          I     have received              from him in
reply to my query as to the visibility of light through the red glass
above mentioned, he insists strongly on its action as darkness.                                                 This,
however, can only be understood                              of the       effects   of    red        powders in
mixture, and not of red light                     ;     and as, to our eyes, an intense blue
powder, such as prussian blue, has, besides its colorific effect, a vio
lent darkening one (owing to its feeble luminosity),                                     so, to the colour
blind, red powders, when added to others, contribute but little light
in proportion to the bulk they occupy in the mixture, and therefore
exercise     a    darkening power by displacing others more luminous than
themselves.            I    think     it   therefore very probable that red appears to
the colour-blind                as yellow-black              does    to    the normal-eyed,                 or, in
other words, that our higher                      reds are          seen by them as we see that
shade     of brown which               verges    to yellow — that of the                faded leaf         of the
tulip-tree for instance.                    Now   it    is   worthy of remark, that                   it   is   very
difficult for the normal-eyed to become                              satisfied that the browns are
merely shades              of   orange and yellow.              Brownness (such at least has
always been my own impression)                        is   almost as much distinct sensation
                                                                                    a
as greenness           ;   so that   I     am not at all surprised at the expression in
§   22,   that the " sensation of                 red      as   a   dark yellow         is   certainly very
distinct from           full    yellow," or that         a   colour-blind       person should, after
long and careful investigation, arrive at the conclusion that red                                                 is
not to him             a   distinct colour.       I      find all this completely applicable
to my own perception of the colour brown.
    Mr. Pole (§11) appears                      to lay great stress on the fact, that in                          a
closed colour circle in which red, yellow, and blue are so arranged
that each shall graduate into both the others, there occurs in the
space where red and blue graduate into each                                    other,        "   a   hue   of red
which       is   to him absolutely insensible,"                     and that this red corresponds
not to that colour which, under the name of carmine, offers to the
                                                                                                       " crim

son."        Invisibility, as an              element       of colour, must not                  here be con
founded        with invisibility            as   light.          It     is certain that he sees the
crimson.           It    is not to him black, but (just what it ought to be on
the supposition             that his vision is dichromic, and the union of his
colours produces            white)        a neutral, obscure grey ; grey being only an
abbreviated         expression for feeble illumination                            by white light.       In   a
circle   coloured with three               elements         graduating into each other, there
is no    neutral point — none, that                   is,   where whiteness or greyness can
exist   ;   but when coloured with only two                              elements,          such as yellow
and blue       {positive yellow and blue, that                            is,   whose       union produces
white, not         green), there are of necessity two neutral points which
would be   both equally white, i. e. equally luminous, the two ex                           if
tremities of each of the coloured arcs graduated off by similar de
grees.   But this not being the case with the yellow arc, one of its
ends to the         colour-blind corresponding to                       a    continuation        of the red,
and so being deficient in                 illuminating power, the point of neutrality
will be that where               a   feebler yellow      is      balanced by          a   feebler blue, and
will therefore            be less luminous,           i.    e.      less white or more grey than
the other neutral                spot.     It    is   evident, from the general tenor                        of
Mr. Pole's expressions throughout                                this    paper, that his ideas on
the subject         of colour        are gathered mainly from the study   of pigments
and absorptive            (i.   e.   negative) colours, and not from that of prismatic
(or     positive)        ones.        In other words, his language        that of the       is
painter,      as distinguished             from the photologist                   ;   the distinction con
 sisting     in this — that in the former colour                             is   considered in its con
 trast      with whiteness, in the other with blackness                                 ;    and thus   it   is
 that black         is    considered by many painters as an element of colour,
 as   whiteness necessarily              is   by photologists.
 I       may perhaps be allowed to add                           a   few words as to the statistics
 of this subject.               Dr. Wilson                           as the result        of his inquiries,
                                                            is it

 that one       person          in every eighteen                    colour-blind         in some marked
 degree, and that one in fifty-five                      confounds red with green.                     Were
 the average        anything           like this,   it   seems inconceivable that the exist
 ence       of the phenomenon of colour-blindness,                                 or dichromy, should
 not be one             of vulgar notoriety, or that    should strike almost all
                                                                        it

on an average,       of one soldier in           every fifty-five       unable to distinguish
a scarlet coat       from green           grass would          not issue in grave inconve
nience,    and     ere    this    itself into prominence by pro
                                   have forced
ducing mischief.  Among the circle of my own personal acquaint
ance I have only known two (though, of course, I have heard of
and been placed in correspondence with several) ; and a neighbour
of mine, who takes great delight in horticulture, and has a superb
collection of exotic flowers, informs me that among the multitude of
persons who have seen and admired                        it,   he does not recollect having
ever met with one who appeared                    incapable of appretiating the variety
and richness of the tints, or insensible to the brilliancy of the nume
rous shades of red and scarlet.                    It    may be, however, that the per
centage     is   on the increase         —certainly       we hear          of more   cases    than
formerly    ;    but this probably arises from the fact of this, like many
other subjects, being made more generally matter of conversation.
   In further      reference       to the question of the superposition of colours
in the spectrum, or of the intrinsic                    compositeness        of rays of definite
refrangibilities,   I      may mention           a    phenomenon which          I     have been
led to noticein the prosecution of some experiments on the photo
graphic impressions of the spectrum on papers variously prepared,
which appeared to me, when                  first noticed, quite incompatible with
the simplicity of those rays at least which occupy the more luminous
portion of the spectrum, extending between the lines marked D and                               E
by   Fraunhofer,         and clearly to demonstrate the presence                       of    green
light    over nearly the whole             of that interval.            In   these experiments
the spectrum formed by two Fraunhofer flint prisms, arranged so as
to increase       the dispersion, and adjusted to the position of least de
viation for the yellow rays, was concentrated                         by   an achromatic lens,
and received on the paper placed in its focus, which could be viewed
from behind.         A    series     of white papers impregnated with                 washes    of
various colourless or very slightly coloured                         chemical preparations,
and dried, were exposed              ;   and the spectrum being received on them,
and the centre of the extreme red image as viewed through                              a    stand
ard glass, adjusted to           a   fiducial pinhole     ;    a   sensitizing wash of nitrate
of silver, or any other fitting preparation,                       was copiously applied to
the exposed surface while under the action of the light.                             Now, under
these     circumstances,    I        uniformly     found that whereas            the spectrum
viewed     from behind through the paper exhibited all over the space

                                          83
 in question   a dazzling very pale straw-yellow, hardly distinguishable
 from white,     yet as the photographic         action proceeded, and the
translucency of the paper began to be somewhat diminished also by
incipient    drying, very nearly the whole of that space became occu
pied by a full and undeniable green colour, so as to give the idea of
a distinctly    four-coloured     spectrum — red, green,     blue, and  violet  ;
the yellow being in some instances almost undiscernible,                and   in
others limited to a mere narrow transitional interval rather            orange
than yellow.       It was  at the same time evident that a great extinction
of light (illumination independent of colour) had          also been operated,
the vivid glare of the part of the spectrum in question being reduced
to a degree of illumination        considerably inferior to the red part, or,
at all events,     not much superior.        The change of colour was far
greater than could be         attributed to any effect of contrast, and was
proved decisively not to be due to that cause by hiding the adjacent
red and blue when the        green remained unaffected      in apparent tint.
     When, for the photographic           preparations   wetted as described,
ordinary, dry, coloured papers were substituted, the change of colour
in question was always produced whenever the thickness of the paper
and its absorptive power         were not such as to destroy or very much
enfeeble the more refrangible light.           Taking,   as a term   of compa
rison,   a purely white, wove, writing-paper,       I found that the substi
tution of writing-paper, tinted with the ordinary cobalt blue com
 monly met with, sufficed to give a very great extension of the green,
 almost to the extinction of the yellow, while, when the papers used
 were pale-yellow      or   clay-coloured,   answering to the tints called
 " buff"    or  " maize
                          "
                             (nearly approximating      to Chevreul's   orangi
 4 and 3), and which might naturally have been expected to transmit
 yellow rays more abundantly at all events than the blue, the spectra
 (viewed at the back of the papers) were particularly full and abun
 dant in green, occupying the whole of the debateable ground.                 In
 the case   of the former,   a narrow yellow space was seen, and the blue
 was    very much enfeebled,       and separated from the green by       a very
  perceptible suddenness      of transition.   With the latter the   green was
  finely exhibited, and the yellow confined to        a narrow orange-yellow
  border  : the blue and violet much enfeebled.
     On further considering these facts, there seemed to be but three
  ways of accounting for them : — 1st, by the effect of contrast.          This

                                         8-1
I   consider to be disposed of by the suppression of the adjacent
colours, as recorded above.        2ndly, by extinction of a yellow element
of colour over the     space  DE, allowing        a substratum    of green to sur
vive  ; or, which comes to the same, by the extinction of the red ele
ment over the same space, which, by its combination with (an as
sumed elementary) green, produced the original brilliant straw-yellow.
And 3rdly, by admitting as a principle, that our judgment of colours
absolutely, in *e, and independent of contrast, is influenced by the
intensity of the light by which they affect              the eye, and that very
vivid illumination     enfeebles    or even        destroys   the  perception    of
colour.    As the apparent     change     of colour from pale-yellow to green
in the   cases  above    related was always accompanied with a great
diminution of general intensity, it occurred to me to produce such
diminution by optical means, which should operate equally on all the
coloured rays, and diminish         all their intensities in the same' ratio.       .
This was accomplished by viewing the spectrum (as projected on
purely white paper) by reflexion on black glass, or by two successive
reflexions in different planes,      and     I  found the very same effect       to
take place.     That portion DE of the spectrum which in the unre-
flected state appeared       dazzlingly bright       and nearly colourless, was
seen by one such reflexion, and            still more   so by two, green.     The
extension of the green region was greater, and the limitation of the
yellow portion more complete, according to the amount of illumina
tion destroyed by varying        the angles        of incidence on the    glasses.
When much enfeebled           by two cross reflexions, the aspect           of the
spectrum was that represented in Chevreul's                coloured picture   of it
from the line   A  to H.     When     enfeebled     by other means, as by view
ing the spectrum thrown          on   a   blackened      surface, the effect was
exactly the same.
    The last of our   three alternatives, then, would appear to be esta
blished as the true explanation        ;  and in respect of the second,       it is
 eliminated by the consideration that neither the slight degree of
coloration in the bluish papers, or the tint of the pale-yellow ones
which effected the change, would give rise to so great a preferential
extinction of yellow or red rays as an explanation founded on that
alternative    would   require.      The phenomenon is certainly           a very
striking one, and has created       great surprise in those to whom        I have
shown it.

                                    (Abstract.)
    The object of the following       investigation is to give   a  firmer basis
to the    calculus of operations, to assign the strict limits           and con
nexion    of  the mathematical sciences, and to found them upon purely
inductive      considerations,    without   any metaphysical       or a    priori
reasoning.
    Starting with the indemonstrable          but verifiable hypothesis, that
objects exist external to the subject, we recognize equality as exist
ing between objects with common and peculiar properties,               in respect
of their common properties.          Operations, which, when performed on
equal objects,     produce equal objects as their result, are recognized as
equal,   in respect to the common properties considered in the equali
ties  of the objects.     When    one operation is performed on an object,
and   another on the resultant object, the single operation by which the
first object is transformable into the last is regarded as the product
of the other two, the order        of  succession  being important.        When
 the  resultant object is the same as the original operand, the product
of the operations is termed       unity.    When two operations performed
on the same       object produce different resultant objects,    the operation
of transforming one of these resultant objects into the other, is re
garded    as the quotient     of the two former operations.         Two opera
tions are   termed reciprocal when their product is unity.            Hence the
quotient    of two operations    is the product   of the  one and    of the reci
procal   of  the other.    When two objects are combined in any manner
so   as  to produce     a third, and the two first are formable from any
fourth by two known operations, the single operation by which the
third object can be also formed from the fourth, is termed the same
combination      of the two first operations. From this we gain the con
ception    of null or zero, as the operation of annihilating any object in
respect   to any place.     The product of a combination of two opera
tions   and  a  third operation,  is the same combination     of the products

of   each   of    the combined operations severally and the                  third operation,
in the particular order thus                  specified,     provided all the operations and
products are performable on the same operand.
     The    above      general conceptions and laws of combined operations
hold for any operations whatsoever with their appropriate                                     operand
objects;        but the nature of the operations and operands requires
especial        study.        In mathematics, objects                are       only considered with
respect      to their three most general properties                             :   first, as contem-
platable in discontinuous succession, whence number and Arithmetic ;
secondly, as contemplatable                      in continuous         succession,         whence ex
tension and Geometry                 ;    and thirdly, as contemplatable                     in   a con
tinuous succession bearing a relation to another continuous succession,
whence          motion in time and Mechanics.                        The problem of mathe
matics      is,   first, to discover the laws of these successions                          as respects
results (that          is,   statically),    by means        of considerations drawn from
contemplating operations (that   dynamical)         is,
                                               secondly, to investi        ;
gate the relations of these laws, giving rise to statical algebra                                      ;
thirdly, to          reduce       all dynamical           to statical laws,         as   in dynamical
algebra     ;     and fourthly,      to make the expression of all the results de
pendent on the most simple, viz. those of common arithmetic.                                         The
purpose of the problem               is     to prepare the mind for the further investi
gation of nature, and to increase practical power immediately.
     In Arithmetic           we    conceive      objects spread out in               a   scale, and by
aggregating those contained between                          any one and the beginning                 of
the scale, form statical groups, whose distinctive character                                 is   derived
from the scale.               The operation by which any group                        is   formed from
the first object         is    termed an integer, the especial laws of which are
next investigated.                All objects being interchangeable in respect to
discontinuous succession,                 an aggregate        is   not changed by altering the
disposition of its parts.                   This   leads to the first two laws               of commu
tation      and association in addition.          The possibility of arranging
objects at once              in two horizontal directions, and    third vertical     a
direction, leads to the laws                 of commutation and association in multi
plication.           Combining           these   with the two former,               we have the law
of commutative distribution.                       From the laws of association in multi
plication       is   immediately deduced the law                   of repetition or indices.
     Having obtained              these laws, we proceed to study their relations                      in
the algebra          of integers,        first, statically, in order to reduce all results

                                                   87
to the     form of a numerical                integer      ;    secondly, dynamically,         con
sidering the effect           of     a variation        in the integer employed.               This
leads to the         conception          of
                                         formation (Lagrange's "analytical
                                              a
function    "),     as a    combination of a fixed and independently variable
integer.       Such a combination                 is,   therefore, also itself dependently
variable.        The inversion of formations, whereby the independent
variable    is   expressed as  formation of the dependent variable, imme
                                     a
diately engages            our attention.         The inversion of         a   sum leads to        a
difference, with the limitation                   that the minuend should be greater
than the subtrahend.                  The inversion of           a   product leads to      a   quo
tient, with the limitation               that the dividend should be               a   multiple    of
the divisor.         The inversions of             a    power lead to the root and loga
rithm, with increasing limitations.                       The study of discontinuous              ob
jects then allows the application of these inversions to the solution
of problems in common life.
   The operation by which any group in the arithmetical scale already
described    formable from any other group in the same scale, leads
               is
to the conception           of
                      fraction, necessarily expressible, according to
                                 &
the general laws of operation, as the quotient of two integers.  The
operands of such operations must admit of being separated into
certain numbers of equal                  parts, or rather, in order that they may
admit    of any fractional operation, into any number of                           equal      parts.
 Thus discontinuous approaches continuous succession.   The laws of
fractions are the same as the laws of integers, provided the indices
used are all integers. The object of the statical algebra of fractions
is   to reduce all combinations of numerical fractions to numerical
fractions.        The inversion of formations                   is   less limited than before.
There    is   the same limitation respecting differences,                   but none respect
ing quotients.       The attempt to convert all fractions into radical
fractions      (whose denominators are some powers of the radix of the
system     of numeration),           leads to the conception            of convergent infinite
series, and hence allows an approximation to the inversion of                             a   power
with   a   constant index.
     In Geometry, the notion of continuous succession or extension                                 is
derived from the motion of the hand, which recognizes separable but
not separated parts.               This motion          gives    the conception of surfaces,
which by their intersections two and two, or three and                                 three, give
lines and points.            Recognizing          a   line as the simplest form of exten
                                                                               h   2

                                                     88
sion, we distinguish the straight lines, which coincide when rotated
about two common points, from the curves, which do not.                                            These
straight lines are shown to be fit operands for the integer and fraction
operations.         By moving         one coinciding                line over another so as to
continue to coincide (by sliding), or to have one point only in com
mon (by rotating),              or no points in common (by translation),                               we
obtain the conceptions of angles and parallels, which suffice to show
that the exterior angle of             a       triangle is equal to the two interior and
opposite, and that two straight lines meet or not according as the
exterior angle they make with                        a    third is not or is equal to, the
interior angle.          Angles are then considered statically as amounts                                 of
rotation not exceeding a semi-revolution.                              Proceeding       to examine
the relations of triangles and parallelograms, we discover the opera
tion of taking       a   fraction of       a   straight line, and therefore of a triangle
and of any rectilineal figure.                     We    see    that this operation         is,   in fact,
the same as that of altering                   a   third line into       a   fourth,    so that the
multiples of the third and fourth, when arranged in order of magni
tude, should lie in the same order                        as   those of the first and second
when similarly           arranged.       The relation of two magnitudes, with
respect to this order, we             term their ratio, and the equality of ratios
proportion.         The inversion and alternation of the four                               terms    of   a
proportion        are now investigated.                   The operation of changing any
                                                                             it,
magnitude into one which bears                      a    given ratio to      is    called    a    tensor.
The laws of tensors, being investigated, are shown to be the same as
those of fractions.     They, however, furnish the complete conception
of infinite and infinitesimal tensors,                   by
                                        letting one or other of the mag
          is by
nitudes           which the ratio       is      given become           infinite or infinitesimal.
Thence        developed the law, that tensors differing infinitesimally                               are
equal for all assignables.             Consequently tensors may be represented
by convergent series of fractions.           The algebra of tensors allows of
the inversion of          a    sum with the same limitation as in the case of
fractions,    the complete inversion of                        a   product of tensors, and the
practical inversion of           a   power with          a     constant integral index.              This
algebra applied to geometry allows of the investigation of all statical
relations,    that       is,   of all the geometry of the ancients, in which
magnitudes alone were considered, without direction.                                   In   respect       to
areas, the consideration          of the parallelogram                swept out    by   one straight
line translated so as to keep one point on another straight line, leads

                                          89
  to an independent algebra        of areas,   in which the generating lines are
  considered immediately.          The laws of the relations of lines thus
  discovered, are shown to be identical with the laws of the relations
  of tensors.     Consequently, with certain limitations, the whole of the
  algebra of tensors may be interpreted as results in the algebra of
  areas.    This   leads to a perfect conception       of the principle of     homo-
  nomy, or dissimilar operations having             the same laws, and conse
  quently the same algebra.
     In dynamical or modern geometry, all lines             are considered as in
 construction, having initial and final points.           If the  initial points of
 any two straight lines are joined to a third, not on either, and the two
 parallelograms be completed, the lines drawn from the point parallel
 to the given lines are dynamically              equal to them     ;   if these   last
 lie on each other, the first two lines have the same direction              ; if the
 last have only one point in common and lie in the same straight line,
 the first have opposite directions       ;  and   if the last do not lie in the
 same straight line, the first have different          directions, and the angle
 between     the last is the angle between the first lines.          Similar defini
 tions can be given of direction         in the case of angles and circular
 arcs.     If from    the final point of any line we draw         a   line equal to
 a second,     and   join the initial point of the first with the final point
 of the line thus drawn,       we are said to append the second to the first,
 and the joining line is called the appense            of the other two.        The
 laws of appension are shown to be the same as those of addition,
 and are hence expressible by the same signs of combination, the
 difference in the objects combined preventing any ambiguity.                    We
thus get the conception of a point as an annihilated line.
    The tensor operation, considered dynamically, leads to the opera
tion of changing a line dynamically so that it should bear the same
relation to the result as two given lines bear to each other in magni
tude and direction.         This assumes three principal forms according
to the difference of direction.        If there is no difference of direction,
the operation is purely       a tensor.     If the directions differ by a semi-
revolution, the rotation of one line into the position of the other may
take place on any plane.          The operation is then termed a negative
scalar   ;  the tensor, which includes the operation of turning through
any number of revolutions, is distinguished as a positive scalar.                   If
the rotation be through any angle, but always on the same plane,

                                                90
the operation is here termed                a   clinant.           If    the rotation may take
place on any variable plane, the operation is a quaternion.
  The laws           of scalars     are immediately              proved to be the same as
those    of   tensors,    but in addition they introduce the idea of negativity.
This           in the algebra of scalars, to invert a sum generally,
        enables us
and thus allows of a perfect inversion of the first two formations.
But     a power      with   a fixed integral exponent can only be inverted on
certain conditions.           This partial inversion, however,                    leads to a solu
tion of quadratic equations, and to    proof that formations consisting
                                                      a
of a sum of integral powers, cannot be reduced to null by more
scalar values of the variable than are marked by its highest exponent.
Hence     if such      a formation is always equal to null, all the coefficients
of the variable must           be   null.    We thus obtain the method of inde
terminate coefficients,           by which we are enabled to discover a series
which obeys the laws of repetition with respect                               to its variable, and
becomes        equal to a power when its variable is an integer.                                  This
enables us to define a power with any index, as this series, and hence
to attempt the inversion of powers with variable indices, which we
succeed in accomplishing under certain conditions.                             This investigation
introduces the logarithm               of   a tensor, powers with                    fractional   and
negative exponents,           and the binomial theorem for these powers.                            It
also induces us to consider the laws                       offormators, or the operations
by which         a   formation of any variable is constructed.                            They     are
shown to be commutative and associative                                in addition, associative     in
multiplication,          directly distributive            and repetitive, but not generally
commutative in multiplication, nor even inversely distributive.                               When
formators are commutative in multiplication                              and distribution,        they
are entirely homonomous with scalars, which may even be considered
as a species         of formators.      The results of the former investigation,
therefore, show that logarithms, fractional and negative powers, and
the binomial theorem hold for these commutative formators.
   The            of tabulating logarithms and of approximating to
              necessity
the solutions of equations, leads to the consideration of a method of
deriving consecutive values of formations for known differences of
the variable, and of interpolating                    values       of the     same formation       for
intermediate values of the variable                       that   is,   the algebra
                                                  ;                                of differences.
Considering the two operations of altering                         a     formation by increasing
the variable, and taking the difference between                              two different values

                                              91
 of the formation       (of which operations the first is necessarily unity
 added    to the   second),    we regard them as formators, and immediately
 apply the results       of that algebra, which furnishes all the             necessary
 formulae.      For approximating to the roots of equations, we require
 to consider    the case where the variable          changes    iufinitesimally,   thus
founding the algebra          of differentials,    which is, in fact, a mere sim
plification    of that of    differences,    owing to all the results being ulti
mately     calculated for     assignables    only.    Finally, to find the alteration
in a formation       of commutative formators, when the variable formator
is increased      by any other formator,            we found the algebra        of deri
vatives.
     In applying the results of scalar algebra           to geometry, we start     with
the fundamental         propositions that the appense of the sides of an en
closed figure taken in order is           a  point, and that when the magnitude
and     direction of the diagonal of         a parallelogram or parallelopipedon,
 and lines    parallel the     sides which      have the same     initial point   as the
 diagonal,    are given, the whole figures are completely determined.                 In
 order to introduce        scalars,    a unit-sphere     is imagined, with its radii
 parallel to the lines in any figure, and in known directions.                 Any line
 can    then be represented       as the result    of performing     a scalar operation
 on the corresponding         radius.
      The first object is to reduce the consideration of angles to that of
  straight lines, by the introduction             of cosines   and    sines, which   are
  strictly   defined as the scalars          represented by the relation of the
  abscissa    to the abscissal       radius, and the ordinate to the ordinate
  radius respectively.        These definitions immediately lead to the rela
  tions between the cosines         and sines of the sums of two angles, and
  those   of the angles    themselves,      whatever be their magnitude or direc
  tion, and thus found goniometry.
      Defining   a  projection    of any figure on any plane to be that formed
  by   joining the points on that plane corresponding according to any
  law with those of the figure, we have the fundamental relation that,
  if the first, and therefore the second figure is enclosed, the appense of
  the sides    of the  second    in the order indicated by the sides of the first,
  is a point.        The orthogonal projection of any figure, by means of
  planes drawn perpendicular to any line, being all in one line, each
  projection can be represented          as the result    of a  scalar operation per
  formed on the same unit radius, and hence this projection leads to one

                                                     92
 invariable relation between scalars.          By choosing three lines at right
 angles       to each      other on which to project, we obtain three scalar re
 lations from every solid figure.                    If   the figure is plane, then by pro
jecting       on a line and on a perpendicular                         to that line, we get two
 scalar relations.
     Applying         these results to transversals, where a line parallel to one
 unit radius cuts several other unit radii, produced either way                                    if   neces
 sary, we obtain, by considering two intersected radii, the results                                         of
 trigonometry,            and     by considering three or                 four intersected radii,
 those    of anharmonic ratios.
    As any line drawn from the centre of the unit-sphere may be con
 sidered as the appense of three lines drawn along or parallel to three
 given unit radii, it may be expressed                       as the sum              of the results of
 three scalar operations performed on these radii respectively.                                            By
 properly varying these three scalars, the final point of the line may
 be made to coincide with any point in space.                                 But   if there   be a given
 relation between               the scalars,     then the number of points will be
 limited, and the whole number of the points constitutes the locus of
 the original concrete equation referred to the accessory abstract equa
 tion.    The consideration of this entirely                     new view           of coordinate        geo
metry is reserved for a second memoir.
     Proceeding next to the laws                    of clinants,          we readily demonstrate
that they are the same as the laws of scalars                             ;    they introduce           a new
conception, however, that of rotating through an angle not necessarily
the same       as a   semi-revolution, that           is,   of   a   plane versor.         By the        con
crete equation         of coordinate geometry,              it   is    immediately shown that
all clinants can be expressed as the sum of                           a   scalar, and       of the pro
duct     of    a   scalar       by   a   fixed, but arbitrarily                chosen     versor.  The
simplest versor to select                is   the quadrantal versor, which, under the
name     of quadrantation,           is   now studied. The two addends of                      a   clinant,
considered as a sum, are called its scalar and vector                               ;   its two factors,
considered as         a   product, are its tensor and versor.                       The laws of         these
parts are then studied.
   The statical algebra of clinants has for its object the reduction of
all combinations of clinants given in the standard form of the sum of
a   scalar and vector, to a clinant of the same form.                                The application
of this to the        series obtained for        a   general scalar power, leads to two
series, called cosines and sines               of   the variables,            as distinguished          from

                                           93
 the goniometrical        cosines and sines of an angle, with which they are
 ultimately shown to have a close connexion, which                  can be rendered
 most evident       by assuming as the unit-angle that subtended by a cir
 cular arc of the length of its radius.            Studying these series quite in
 dependently       of these relations  to angles, we discover that they bear to
each    other the     same relations as the goniometrical cosines and sines,
 and that     if the  least tensor value of the variable for which the cosine
  series becomes       null, is known, all its other       values  can be found by
 multiplying this by four times any scalar integer. This last product
 must be added to the least tensor value of the variable for which
 both the cosine or the sine series become equal                to given scalars, in
 order to find all the solutions          of such equations.         Supposing the
 values   of such     series  tabulated by the method of differences           for all
 scalar   values of the variable, so that such least tensor               values   can
 always be found,          we are now able       to assign the meaning of any
  power whose base and index are both clinants, and the logarithm of
 any   clinant.      This  enables  us to invert completely all the simple for
 mations, sum, product, power with variable base and constant index,
 or constant base and variable index         ;  and hence to solve all equations
 of four dimensions with clinant          coefficients,   and to show that every
 formation consisting of a sum of integral powers with clinant coeffi
 cients, can be expressed as a product          of as many simple formations as
 is determined by the highest index          of the variable.       The   cosine and
sine series can also be generally inverted.             The versor of any clinant
 having a known angle (which is always equal to the cosine of its
angle added to the product of the sine of its angle into a quadrantal
 versor), can now be shown to equal the cosine series added to the sine
 series   multiplied     by  a quadrantal versor, when the variable of the
series is the scalar ratio      of the  angle   of the clinant to the     angle sub
 tended      by a circular arc equal to its radius.         From this the ratio of
the circumference to the diameter          of  a circle is shown to be twice the
least tensor value      of the variable, for which the cosine        series is equal
to   null  ;  and as that value can be readily assigned in            a  convergent
series, the former ratio is determined.           The   same investigation shows
the    relation already      mentioned between        the goniometrical       cosines
and sines, and the cosine and sine series.
    Clinant algebraical geometry allows            us to interpret    all results of
clinant algebra when referred to lines on one plane.                   It thus fur

nishes    a complete explanation of the          imaginary       points and lines
in the theory of anharmonic ratios, when viewed in relation to the
unit radii,     as  already explained.       In the    case  of coordinate      geo
metry of     two, and even three dimensions, the possibility          of interpret
ing the results of a clinant operation performed on          a   given unit radius
in   a given   plane, allows us to understand the whole theory            of " ima
          " intersections.      The theory of scalar and clinant algebraical
ginary
coordinate geometry will form the subject of a future memoir.
     Proceeding to quaternions, we find their laws to be the same as
 those   of clinants while the plane remains unaltered         ;  but  if the  plane
is alterable, they cease to be commutative in multiplication, that re
lation    being replaced by one between            certain related quaternions
 called their conjugates.         This makes the algebra of quaternions
 (which is not here systematized,        as being too recent) entirely different
 from that of scalars.
     In  mechanics    the motion of any point is not considered absolutely
 as  in dynamical geometry, but relatively to          some external, constant,
 independent motion, as the apparent motion of the fixed stars                ;  this
 gives the conception       of time.     But the   necessity  of considering the
 motion not merely of         a  point, but of   a body, gives rise to the com
 parison of the motions of various bodies, and to a conception of their
 equality, when the products of their velocities, multiplied by               a con
  stant which is always the same for the same body, but different for
  different bodies,     are  equal.    This constant is the       mass,    which in
  bodies   of the  same   kind varies   as the volume.
     By considering the        case of the mutual destruction of motion, we
  eliminate    time and      simplify the problem, thus founding statics;
  and by conceiving the motion of any body to be destroyed by the
  application of variable motions equal and opposite to those actually
  existent, we reduce dynamics to statics.

  Communications received since the end op the Session.
 I. "On      the frequent occurrence      of Vegetable Parasites in the
        Hard Structures of Animals." By Professor A. Kolliker,
        of Wiirzburg.       Communicated by Dr. Sharpey, Sec. R.S.
        Received May 30, 1859.
     As far  as I am aware, Quekett has been the first to point out that
  vegetable  parasites, viz. Conferva,   occur frequently in the skeleton
  of Corals (Lectures on Histology, vol. ii. p.   153. fig. 78. and p. 276)    ;
  but although he mentions in the same place that the tubuli described
  by Carpenter in the shells of Bivalves have also a great resemblance
  with Conferva,    he did not venture any further step, and he adheres
  to the view of Carpenter, who regards them as a typical           structure.
  Some years later, Rose       ("On    Parasitic   Borings    in Fossil  Fish-
  Scales," Transactions of the Microscopical      Society of London, vol. x.

                                           9G
  p.   7,  1855) discovered a peculiar tubular structure in fossil fish-
  scales, which he regarded as being occasioned                 by parasites, and
  possibly by Infusoria, but he was not able to give any good proof
  of this hypothesis.         The same must be said of E. Claparede (Mull.
  Archiv,    1857,    p.    119), who found     similar   canals   in the test  of
  Neritina fiuviatilis, and showed that they do not really belong to
  the shell, without being happier in determining the nature of the
  parasite, only suggesting that it might possibly be a sponge.
      Such was the state of things, when Prof. Wedl of Vienna and               I,
 independently of each other, took up the question.              The observations
  of Wedl, which concern only the parasites of the shells of Bivalves
 and Gasteropods, were communicated to the Vienna Academy on the
  14th of October, 1858, and are therefore previous to my own, which
 were presented       to our Wurzburg Society on the 14th of May, 1859 ;
 but    I received   Wedl's memoir only on the 16th of May, and may
 therefore say that my observations, which are also extended over many
 more groups of animals, were quite independent of those                   of the
 Austrian microscopist.          This being the case, it may be regarded as a
 good proof of the correctness of our observations and the truth of
 our conclusions, that we agree in the principal facts, there being
 only this discrepancy between us, that Wedl calls the parasites Con
ferva, whilst       I regard them as Unicellular Fungi.             The botanists
 will   decide this question better than we ; only      I  beg leave to say, that
 all the numerous parasites observed          by myself were unicellular,     and
 that the sporangia were quite of the same kind as those of uni
 cellular fungi.       I   may further add, that the frequent anastomoses
 of the parasitic tubes remind one of the anastomoses observed in the
mycelium of some unicellular fungi, whereas such connexions have
not yet, so far as       I know, been observed amongst the Conferva.
     I now give a short enumeration of the animals in whose skeleton
I   observed    these vegetable    parasites.
                                    1. Spongia.
    Two undetermined          species  of  sponges,  which    I  got through the
kindness of      Mr. Bowerbank, show        a great many parasitical tubes     in
the horny fibres of their skeleton.            These     are  most elegant   and
numerous in one species from Australia, in which the tubes form a
superficial network in the outermost parts of the horny sponge-fibres
and more straight canals in their interior, and           possess a great many

                                       97
round sporangia, which in some cases even showed young outgrowths
in form of short ramifying tubes.
                             2.  Foraminifera.
    In an extensive  collection of sections of Foraminifera which       I owe
to the kindness of my friend           Prof. Carpenter,    there  were  many
genera which showed numerous filaments of fungi in their test itself,
viz. Polystomella,     Orbitolina, Heterostegina, Amphistegina, Cal-
earina, Alveolina,   and Operculina.        The last genus shows best that
these parasitic tubes,    which     sometimes    are very large, are quite
different from the two kinds of tubes rightly described by Carpenter
as belonging to the test itself.       They generally run     at right angles
to the finer tubuli, and are easily distinguished from both kinds of
typical tubuli by their irregular     course, and by their frequent branch
ing, and    even anastomosing.       They    are absent  in many specimens
of the above-named     genera, and could not be found in Cycloclypeus,
Nummulina, and Nonionina.
                                 3.   Corals.
   All  the genera of Corals which      I investigated  contained parasitical
fungi, viz. Astraa diffusa, Porites clavaria, Tubipora musica,
Corallium rubrum, Oculina diffusa, Oculina, sp., Alloporina mirabilis,
Madrepora cornuta, Lobalia prolifera, Millepora alcicornis, Fungia,
sp.    The fungi were most frequent in the genera Tubipora, Astraa,
Porites, and Oculina, the last three of which contained also many spo
rangia, which in the    red coral were very scarce and often wanting.
                               4. Bivalves.
    I agree with  Wedl that the tubuli described by Carpenter in the
shells of Bivalves are all parasites. Many of them agree in every
respect with those     found in other hard structures of the Inver-
tebrata, of whose parasitical nature there can be no doubt         ; and even
possess sporangia, as those of Thracia, Lima, Cleidotharus,          Anomia,
Ostrea, Meleagrina.       With    respect   to those of the genera Litho-
domus,    Area,  Pectunculus,    Nucula, Cardium, it is true that their
straight course and more     regular distribution speak in favour of their
typical occurrence   ; but as in some cases true parasites also are very
regularly distributed through the shells, there can be no doubt that
even these do not really belong to the structure        of the shells.

                                          98
                                5.    Brachiopods.
     The test of    some  Terebratula shows,       besides the large well-known
  canals, minute    tubuli running straight through the fibres. A vertical
  section of Terebratula australis, which I got from Prof. Carpenter,
  showed that the minute canals referred to belong to a vegetable
  parasite of the same kind as those of the Bivalves.
                                0.    Gasteropoda.
     Nearly    all examined Gasteropods, viz. Cerithium             tuberculatum,
  Aporrhais pet-Pelecani, Turbo rugosus, Murex brandaris, Murex
  trunculus, Haliotis, Vermetus, Trochus, Littorina littorea, Terebra
  myurus, Tritonium cretaceum,          contained vegetable parasites in their
  shells, and in some these were as numerous as in the Bivalves, and
 showed also sporangia.         Besides these fungi, the shell of Trochus
 also contained in its most superficial layers unicellular pyriform            algae
 with green contents.
                                   7.  Annelids.
     Even in this group the unicellular          parasites   were   found, viz. in
 the calcareous tubes of two Serpula from the Scotch coast.
                                 8. Cirrhipeds.
     The  same parasites also occurred very numerously in the shells            of a
 large Balanus.       On the other hand, the       genera Diadema and Lepas
 were free from them       ; and with regard to the straight tubes of       Polli-
 cipes described by Quekett, which           also occur    in Tubicinella,   I   am
 inclined to reckon them amongst the typical structures.
                                    9. Fishes.
    The   scales  of Beryx ornatus, from the clay, contain very numerous
and pretty parasitic structures, which almost totally agree with those
figured by Rose in his fig. 5.         They undoubtedly also belong to the
simplest form of fungi, but are         of greater interest, inasmuch as they
are fossil and seem to constitute a new genus.              I was not able to find
parasites in any other fish-scales, notwithstanding that               I examined
scales   of all living and many fossil         species   of Ganoids and many
Teleostei.
    These are the facts which      I  have   been able to gather, up to this
time.     I have no doubt that all      will ageee with me      in regarding this
question as one of great interest for the zoologist as well as for the
botanist.     The former will now be obliged to study these parasitical

                                               99
structures as thoroughly as possible, in order to decide which tubular
structures       of the hard tissues of animals          are typical and which are
not ; and for the botanist a new field of investigation is opened, which
not only draws attention by the somewhat strange forms offered for
investigation, but is also of great interest in a physiological                    point of
view.       It   seems to me probable that the parasites dissolve the car
bonate      of lime of the hard structures into which they                penetrate,       by
means      of exudation of carbonic acid, which secretion would                    seem to
take place only at the growing ends                  of the fungial tubes,         as they
never      lie in larger cavities, but     are always closely surrounded by the
calcareous mass.          In   some cases, as       in the horny     fibres   of   sponges,
it seems probable that the parasites simply bore                       their canals        by
mechanical force, as is the case when vegetable                parasites make their
way through           the cell-membranes            of Conferva      or other          plants.
Besides this, it deserves         also to be remembered that nearly all the
parasites here spoken of occur in marine animals.
      In   concluding    this notice,      I     may further mention          that      these
parasites afford an excellent means                 for demonstrating         the double-
refracting power of the shells of the several genera mentioned in
this communication.  I was first struck with this fact in examining
a horizontal section of Lima scabra obtained from Dr. Carpenter,
and finding that many tubuli appeared double.    In following this
matter, it was easy to show that all the tubuli running in                         a   certain
direction,        and in an oblique way through              the section, appeared
simple at the upper surface of             it,   and became double in the inferior
layers, so that the distance of the two images                     increased with the
shortening of the focus.            When the preparation was inverted, the
reverse      was the case.        The same phenomena as in Lima were also
observed in Anomia,              Ostrea,   Murex truncatus,            Turbo       rugosus,
Tritonium cretaceum, and Balanus, the shells of which animals have
therefore all such structure, that they refract the light in the same
                        a
way as the well-known            double-refracting      crystals*.
      According to Brewster (Bibl. Univ. de Geneve, 1836. ii. 182), who seems the
      •
only person  who has hitherto observed the double-refracting power of       shell,     a
viz. of the mother-of-pearl, that shell (Meleagrina) shows the same phenomena
as the double-axed double-refracting Arragonite, on which question      am not as
                                                                               I
yet   able to give an opinion.

          phammonium-Compounds.                    By A. W. Hofmann, LL.D.,
          F.R.S. &c.       Received      June 1, 1859.
      In  several previous communications *           I have shown that dibromide
 of ethylene is       capable   of fixing either      one or two molecules      of tri-
 ethylphosphine,        a monatomic and        a  diatomic bromide being formed,
 which      I  have respectively represented        by the formulae   —

 There are other products formed, resulting from secondary reactions.
     It  was not quite easy to obtain a sufficiently satisfactory experi
 mental foundation for the diatomic nature of the second compound.
 This    substance   presents an extraordinary degree of stability            ; in its
 general characters it is closely allied to the numerous monatomic
 bromides, both of the nitrogen- and of the phosphorus-series, which
in the course of       these researches     have come under my consideration.
Lastly, the oxygenated derivative of the bromide                  resembles   so per
fectly the monammonium-               and the monophosphonium-bases,              that
more than once during my experiments                  I was inclined to doubt the
correctness of my interpretation.
    There is no direct proof of the diatomic character of the com
pound.         Why should we reject the simple formula deducible from
experiment ? The hydrocarbons C8 H8 are very prone to molecular
transformations without change of composition.                 The idea suggested
itself, that the diatomic          saline molecule might        be   split into    two
monatomic saline molecules,

    It  is true Ca Ha figures in this formula as monatomic, whilst we
should expect it endowed with diatomic substitution-power.                      But
the connexion between composition and substitution-power is by no
means finally settled       ;   in fact, we know of many cases in which,
under conditions not sufficiently established, the atomicity of a mole
cule changes: witness the radical " allyl," which is capable of re
 placing one or three equivalents of hydrogen.
    But without going this length, the             scission   of diatomic ethylene
into two monatomic molecules may take place                   in many other ways.
The transformation of dibromide of ethylene into hydrobromic acid
 and bromide of vinyl,
                       (C,  HJ"     Bra=HBr+(C4 H,) Br,
 is a familiar example.          The splitting of the ethylene-compound into
bromide of formyl and bromide of methyl,
                   (C,  HJ" Bra= (C, H) Br+             (Ca  H,) Br,
 has   never been observed,        but did not appear altogether unlikely.
    Our analytical methods          are insufficient to distinguish between
           [(C4   H,), (Ca Ha)      P] Br and       [(C4 H5), (Ca   H) P] Br ;
 and what      I  have   represented as a diatomic              ethylene-compound
might have been, after all,           a  monatomic bromide — the bromide of
formyl-triethylphosphouium,             the complementary methyl-compound
                              [(C,H5), (CaHa)P] Br
 existing possibly among the secondary products of decomposition.
    In the    presence  of    these and several similar self-raised objections,
by which every observer endeavours to test the truth of his con
clusions, I was induced again to appeal to experiment.
    The prosecution of this line of the inquiry has led me to the disco
very of a new class of diatomic bodies, which, while it confirms incon-
testably the correctness          of my interpretation, appears to claim the
attention of chemists for several other reasons.
    I have  established, in the first place, that the monatomic bromide
                           [(C.IUCC^BOPjBr
may be readily converted into the diatomic bromide
                          [(ctHs).(c4H4)"pj''             Bra
by the simple addition of triethylphosphine.                Nothing is easier than
to prove the transformation, the platinum-salt of tie two bases pre-
    vol.   x.                                                          i

  senting      a  remarkable difference of solubility,     and other differences
  not less striking.
     To   remove every doubt, the bromide, obtained by treatment             of the
  brominetted bromide with triethylphosphine,             was converted into the
 corresponding        iodide, which in its properties and composition was
  found to be identical in every respect with the characteristic iodide,
 which      I  have  fully described in my last note upon this subject.
     The transformation of the monatomic into what I have represented
 as the diatomic compound being satisfactorily established, the con
 clusive experimental          demonstration of the diatomic nature of the
 latter presented itself without difficulty in the conception of bromides
 containing at once phosphorus and nitrogen, the molecular expression
 of which would no longer admit of division.
    This class of dibromides actually exists ; they are readily produced
 by submitting the bromide of the brominetted body to the action of
 ammonia or monamines instead of triethylphosphine.
    I  have formed as yet only three representatives          of this  new class of
 bodies,      which   I   propose to designate       as phosphammonium-com-
 pounds      ;  their examination    is sufficient to fix the character of the
 class  ;  it would    have been easy to construct scores       of similar bodies.

    Both the bromide         and the corresponding chloride are very soluble,
and little adapted for analysis         ;  I  have therefore fixed the nature of
this body by the preparation and analysis of the platinum-compound.
For this purpose the bromide generated in the above reaction was
treated with oxide of silver          ;  it is thus converted into   a powerfully

       A. W. Hofmann. Received June 9th, 1859.
    Some   time ago*     I communicated       to the Royal Society some re
sults obtained in studying the action of dibromide of ethylene upon
phenylamine.       The principal product of this reaction was found to
be a  well-defined crystalline compound with basic characters.               By
the analysis of the base itself, and of several          of its combinations, it
had been proved that the formula
                           ^u***"- c„H, J            w
is the simplest atomic expression for the new substance                ; but the

as representing the true constitution         of the basic body, which thus
appears as a diammonia, in which 2          equivs. of hydrogen are replaced
by 2 equivs. of phenyl, and        4  equivs. of hydrogen by 2 molecules      of
diatomic ethylene.
   This view involves the      existence   of a  basic compound,
                        C„H1,N,=(C„H,),
i.e. of a diphenyl-diamine        in which only one molecule of diatomic
ethylene has been substituted for hydrogen.
   Experiment      has not failed to realize the body pointed out by
theory.     A mixture of dibromide of ethylene with a large excess of
phenylamine     (1  vol. of dibromide of ethylene and 4 vols. of phenyl-
amine) rapidly solidifies to a crystalline mass.                 Treatment with

 water removes       from this mixture a very considerable proportion of
 hydrochlorate       of phenylamine, leaving                  a brown resinous substance,
 which gradually but imperfectly solidifies.                          This      substance   forms a
 hydrochlorate which is difficultly soluble in concentrated hydro
 chloric acid, and which may be readily purified by repeated crystal
 lizations from boiling alcohol.  The pure hydrochlorate dissolved
 in water, and mixed with potassa or ammonia, furnishes the free base,
 which generally separates as an oil, rapidly solidifying into a cry
 stalline substance.  This may be further purified by repeated crystal
 lizations from diluted alcohol.

remained to prove experimentally that the former, when submitted
to the action of dibromide of ethylene, may be readily converted into
the latter.       Nothing     is       easier than to accomplish this transforma

     The deportment of phenylamine under the influence of dibromide
 of ethylene gives a fair illustration of the nature of the substances
 which are generated, under the influence of diatomic molecules, from
 primary aromatic monamines.
     To complete the study of this subject, I have examined, moreover,
 the action of dibromide of ethylene upon ethylauiine, as a repre
 sentative of the monamines containing an ordinary alcohol-radical.

    Dibromide of ethylene acts upon ethylamine even in the cold, the
 products of the reaction varying according to the relative proportions
 of the two bodies, and according to the temperature.                Among other
 products    invariably  occur the two bromides corresponding                to the
 two salts   of the phenyl-compounds         mentioned in the previous para
 graphs.

   I  have fixed the composition of the former compound by the ana
lysis of the dibromide of the dichloride and of the base itself, all of
which    are remarkably       well-defined crystalline      bodies,   and that of
the latter by the examination       of  a well-defined platinum-salt.
   The first   base, separated    by the action of anhydrous baryta from
the  dry bromide, distils as an oily liquid of a powerfully ammoniacal
odour, which solidifies into a brittle crystalline mass not unlike
fused stearic acid.        The composition of the body is remarkable.

and thus     constitutes the dioxide of the diatomic metal, ethylene-
diethyl-diammonium.
   The second     base is liquid, and boils at    1 85°.    It is easily obtained
from the dibromide, which, being extremely soluble, may be readily
separated   from the bromide of the first body.          I have   experimentally
established that this body may be readily procured by the action of
dibromide of ethylene upon the dioxide previously mentioned.
   The dioxide,
                                 CiaH„NaOa,
presents   considerable interest in a theoretical point of view.           I  have
determined the vapour-density of this compound by Gay-Lussac's
process.     Experiment     gave the number       2-26.     Assuming     that the
molecule    of the body under examination corresponds               to 4 volumes
of vapour, the theoretical density is 4-fl2.

                                          108
    The extraordinary        discrepancy      between     theory and experiment
may be removed in two ways:               viz. either by halving the formula,
or by assuming that the molecule of the dioxide of ethylene-diethyl-
diammonium corresponds to 8 volumes of vapour, in either of                   which
cases the theoretical density becomes           2.31, closely agreeing with the
experimental number 2-26.
    I  shall discuss the vapour-densities of the diammonias somewhat
more fully in a future communication                ;  but  I cannot refrain   from
pointing out even now, that, by dividing the formula by 2, we arrive
at an expression containing         1 equiv. of oxygen       (0=8), which, in the
eyes    of  those who consider the number 16 as the true                  molecular
value    of oxygen, must appear perfectly inadmissible.

                            I. Acrolein, — Metacrolein.
                      1.  Acrolein and Hydrochloric Acid.
     By acting on acrolein, C8 H4 0a, with dry hydrochloric acid gas,
  a  body is formed of the composition C8 H5 0, CI, resulting from a
  direct combination of one atom of aldehyde with one atom                     of the
  acid.    This   substance    is insoluble in water, and can be washed with
  it in order to   free  it from any     excess   of  acid or acrolein which     may
  be  still present.     By drying, which       can only be done over sulphuric
  acid at low temperatures, the body, for which the authors propose
  the name of hydrochlorate             of acrolein,    is  obtained in a mass      of
   white crystals, presenting       a texture like that of velvet.        It  melts at
   32° C. into   a  thick oil, having     a  smell of slightly rancid fat.       It  is

                                           109
readily soluble    in alcohol or      ether,   on evaporation of which         it  re
mains behind as a      thick oil.     When boiled with water, it remains, as
far as   can be seen, unchanged.           Dilute solutions of the alkalies       ap
pear not to act on      it.    Heated with solution of ammonia, in a sealed
tube, at 100°    C,   it is   decomposed,    chloride of amonium and acrolein
ammonia being the result.             It  does not combine      with bichloride of
platinum when in solution in alcohol, and very slowly reduces boiling
ammoniacal solution of nitrate            of silver.     Heated alone, it decom
poses   into acrolein and hydrochloric acid.             By the action of    concen
trated hydrochloric acid acrolein is set free.               Dilute sulphuric     and
nitric acids decompose it likewise, setting acrolein free. Heated
with hydrate of potash it gives off hydrogen, and there distils at
the same time an oily body, which solidifies into magnificent colour
less crystals, analyses       of which prove it to        be an isomeric acrolein,
for which the authors propose the name Metacrolein.
   Metacrolein as thus obtained is insoluble in water, but is capable of
being recrystallized       from alcohol or ether.          The crystals form very
long needles, more especially when melted metacrolein before solidify
ing is allowed to flow about in a glass tube.                 They   resemble    very
much in appearance the crystals of acetamide,                   possess a peculiar
aromatic smell, and have a taste            at   first producing     a  cooling and
afterwards a burning sensation.            They    are lighter than water.      They
melt at about 50°      C,    becoming solid at about 45°C.          Before melting
 they    are somewhat volatilizable,         on which       account    they can     be
 distilled  in the vapour of water.            On being heated, metacrolein is
changed into common acrolein.                Dilute alkalies do not       effect any
 change in this substance.           By heating with mineral        acids, common
 acrolein is set free.         On leading dry hydrochloric           acid gas over
 metacrolein in a bulb-tube, the metacrolein melts and combines with
 the acid, producing         the already-named hydrochlorate            of acrolein.
 From this behaviour, the authors believe the acrolein contained in the
 combination of hydrochloric         acid to be metacrolein, and not common
 acrolein.    If metacrolein      be viewed as C1a Hs 04, the formula          of the
 hydrochloric     acid compound would then be C^Hj.Ol, 2HC1;                      and
 the formation     of  metacrolein may be assumed to take place accord
 ing to the following equation, C1aH80„ 2HCl+2KOHO=C„ II.O,
  + 2KC1+ 4nO.           The evolution of hydrogen has been found to be
 the result   of a secondary      action.

                        2.   Acrolein and Hydriodic Acid.
   These substances           act very violently on each other           if the acid in
the gaseous form be led into acrolein, producing a hissing noise, as
when red-hot iron is plunged into water.                    The resulting substance is
insoluble in alcohol, ether, acids, and alkalies.                 Bisulphide of carbon
dissolves   out   a  little free iodine.        Heated alone, iodine is set free.
                                 3. Acrolein and Water.
   Acrolein    mixed with two or three times its volume of water, and
exposed    to the temperature of boiling water for eight days, under
goes a gradual         change.       Acrylic acid is produced, and           a resinous
substance,    soluble in ether, melting at about 60°, and becoming
solid at 55°C.          At common temperatures it is hard and brittle, like
resin.    The per-centage composition of this resin, on analysis,                   was
found to be the same as that obtained by Redtenbacher, and named
Desacrylharz *, viz. carbon 66-6, hydrogen 7.4.
                      4.   Metacrolein and Hydriodic Acid.
   When dry hydriodic            acid gas is passed over dry metacrolein, the
latter melts, and changes into a heavy yellow solution, resembling in
smell and appearance              the hydrochlorate          of acrolein.    It can be
washed with water, and appears at ordinary temperatures to solidify
into crystals   ;   placed over sulphuric            acid to dry, it decomposes,    be
coming brown, and setting iodine free.                       From the analogy in its
formation, this compound can be properly viewed as hydriodate                        of
acrolein.
                                      II.  Aldehyde.
                      1.  Aldehyde and Hydrochloric Acid.
   Lieben found that by the action of hydrochloric                   acid on aldehyde,
a body of the composition Cs H8 Oa Cla was produced, having a con
stant boiling-point of from 1 16° to 117° C.f
   The authors confirm Lieben's paper as to the replacement of Oa
by Cla in two atoms of aldehyde, and have further obtained a new
combination, analysis of it giving the formula as Cla H1a 04 Cla, in
which two equivalents of oxygen are replaced by the same number of
equivalents of chlorine in three atoms of aldehyde.                    By the action of
                         * Liebig's Annalen,     vol. xlvii. p. 145.

                                         Ill
water,  this compound, like that of Lieben, is resolved into hydro
chloric acid and aldehyde.            By heat, it is broken up into aldehyde
and the body Ca H8 Oa Cl^.            The authors propose for it the        name
protoxychloride       of aldehyde.
                      2. Aldehyde     and Hydriodic Acid.
    By the action of hydriodic acid on aldehyde             a  compound is pro
duced    that   decomposes       with water into the aldehyde and the acid
again, on which account it could not be purified.               On heating, it is
suddenly decomposed at 70°             C,  leaving  a  black resinous residue,
which     on distillation     gave off vapours     of iodine.    In its  mode  of
formation it is analogous to the bodies produced by the action of
hydrochloric acid on aldehyde.
            3. Aldehyde and Sulphurous Acid — Elaldehyde.
    Dry sulphurous acid gas led into anhydrous aldehyde in cold water
is absorbed with great avidity, 1 1 grammes of aldehyde absorbing 1 9
grammes of the acid, whilst an increase of volume takes place.               The
absorption-coefficient       of aldehyde for this acid was found to be 1 .4
times greater than that of alcohol for the same, and seven times greater
than that of water for it.          No chemical combination appears to take
place, as, on passing a stream        of carbonic acid through the fluid     at a
slightly elevated temperature, almost all the sulphurous acid can be
driven out again.         If   aldehyde, saturated with sulphurous       acid, be
left for about      a week at ordinary temperatures          in a well-stoppered
bottle,  it suffers in this time almost        a complete change into a body
for which the authors propose at present the name Elaldehyde.
To obtain it pure, the fluid is mixed with as much water as is neces
sary to dissolve      it up  ;  the acid is saturated by degrees with chalk,
and the fluid obtained is distilled so long as oily drops pass into the
receiver.     The common aldehyde is          separated  in  a resinous form by
digesting for some time with'solution          of caustic  soda or potash.    By
repeated    distillation, the elaldehyde can be obtained free from every
thing but a little water.         Analysis gives the formula of this aldehyde
as C4  H4 0a.      It is therefore isomeric with common aldehyde. As
it was obtained in quantity by the foregoing method, its properties
were   further examined.          Its boiling-point was found to be 124°C,
and   solidifying-point       10° C.    Whilst solidifying it likewise starts

                                           112
 into crystals, the melting-point            of which is also       10°  C.    The alde
 hyde here described under the name Elaldehyde                        is identical with
 that of Weidenbush*.             Its mode of production from common alde
 hyde is the same         ;   its boiling-point      likewise agrees with that        of
 the aldehyde of Weidenbush.
    The elaldehyde of Fehlingf the authors                    believe   to be identical
with that they have obtained, and also that obtained by Weidenbush.
That which         goes far to prove the identity          of the two latter is their
 vapour-densities.        That of Weidenbush's          is given as 4-58, whilst   that
of Fehling's is 4-52        ;  both are converted into common aldehyde by
 heating gently with dilute sulphuric acid, and both crystallize at low
temperatures.          The only material discrepancy            between     them is the
boiling-point of 94° C. given by Fehling for elaldehyde, whilst                    Wei
denbush gives the boiling-point            of his aldehyde       as 125° C.
                            III.  Oil of Bitter Almonds.
               1.  Oil of Bitter Almonds and Hydrochloric Acid.
    This      acid  does not combine with           oil of bitter      almonds.     Ex
periments made in sealed tubes, heated first to 100°                     C,   and after
wards to 200°, gave no signs of a combination having been effected.
                2.  Oil of Bitter Almonds and Hydriodic Acid.
    Much        better results    can   be    obtained when hydriodic acid is
allowed to act on oil of bitter almonds.                  The   gas is absorbed, pro
ducing an increase          of volume and of temperature, and at the same
time    a  little water. At the end of the operation two layers appear,
of  a dark-brown         colour.    The upper        one,   which is about a sixth
part of the quantity of the under one, consists of concentrated hy
driodic acid, whilst the under one, a heavy oil, is a compound of
iodine and oil of bitter almonds.              To obtain the substance in a pure
state, it was first washed well with water, to remove excess of the
acid  ;   next treated with moderately strong solution of sulphite                    of
soda, to remove        any excess of oil    ;  lastly, on washing with water, the
salt was removed from it.             It can be dried rapidly over sulphuric
acid at a temperature not higher than 20° C. A higher temperature
produces gradual decomposition.

stance, 6 grammes of oil of bitter almonds absorbed                                 11   grammes of
hydriodic acid gas.  Analyses of the substance lead to the formula
   H1„ Oa

              which will be observed to be   atoms of oil of bitter     3
almonds, in which 2(Oa)   replaced by 2(Ia).
                                          is The authors pro
pose for   the name Oxyiodide of Benzaldehyde.
             it                                 The substance
thus obtained melts at 28° C., and solidifies                        at about 25°   C. into almost
colourless rhombic plates                if   rapidly cooled down.              When in        a   liquid
state, the crystals mostly occur in groups                               of long    needles.         The
colour of the            substance       in   a   melted state          is   brownish yellow         ;   at
moderate temperatures, and on standing in the air,                                 it   becomes       still
darker in colour.            It    possesses       a    smell very much resembling cress.
It    volatilizes    at     common temperatures,                     its vapour     attacking         the
eyes powerfully.             Its vapour           at higher        temperatures, when carried
away by that of water, becomes more and more intolerable,                                            pro
ducing    a    very inflammatory               effect on       the      eyes and nose, which             is
more painful and permanent than that from acrolein.                                 It   is   insoluble
and sinks in water, but can be distilled in the vapour of it.   Watery
solutions  of carbonates and sulphites of the alkalies do not act on it.
Alcoholic solution of potash decomposes       by degrees on heatingit                                    a
little, producing much iodide of potassium, some benzoic acid, and
an oily body that remains dissolved in the alcohol, which                                     is   not oil
of bitter almonds.    Alcoholic and watery solutions of ammonia
change    slowly into iodide of ammonium and oil of bitter almonds.
          it
Boiled with solution of nitrate of silver, yields iodide of silver, and
                                                                it
a    smell of oil of bitter almonds.                         Concentrated hydrochloric               acid
changes        by degrees, becoming brown                          concentrated sulphuric acid
           it it

dissolves          on heating, with the separation of iodine.
     In conclusion, the authors remark that the action of hydrochloric
acid on aldehyde may be regarded as consisting in the replacement
of two equivalents of oxygen                      by   two of chlorine in one, two, or three
atoms of this body           :    thus,

     In the      case   of acrolein, the action of hydrochloric acid                    is   different    ;
it   combines directly with             it,   no elimination of water taking place.                       If
 we conceive,           however, that, in the action of this acid on common
 aldehyde,        the water which              is   there produced        is    the effect          of    a
 further     decomposition, then we may readily                       suppose           that,   if   this
 further decomposition had taken place in the case of hydrochloric
 acid and acrolein,            a     body derived from            two atoms of acrolein,
 and having          0a   replaced by Cla, corresponding to the second term in
 the combination of aldehyde and chlorine, would have been the re

     There    is   a    curious connexion which               may be mentioned, in this
substitution       of chlorine for oxygen in aldehyde,                between           the formula
of   these bodies containing chlorine, and those                     of   the isomeric modi
fications of aldehyde.

mixture of acetic acid and glycol.                     As the    monoacetate        is    easily ob
tained, and for this purpose need not be quite pure,                          it   is   possible         by
this method to prepare the body in question on                            a    large scale and
with great facility.            It   is   simply necessary to conduct               a    stream of
dry hydrochloric           acid gas into the monoacetate,                 maintained at the
temperature of 100° C., till the quantity of oil precipitated on the

addition of water ceases to increase.         The whole is then well       washed
with water, dried by means of chloride of calcium, and distilled.
Almost the entire quantity passes over between 144° and 146°C.

considerable quantity of heat is evolved during                the passage of the

free iodine.     On removing the iodine by means of dilute potash, a
mass   of small white crystals is brought to light, which I at                   once
suspected to be iodide of ethylene.                To  remove    all doubt on this

from rising during the passage of the hydriodic             acid gas, by sur
rounding the vessel containing it with cold water, a liquid product is
obtained, which is coloured dark-brown by free iodine.            This    I have
not as yet been able to discover any means of purifying,               it being
soluble in water, and decomposed          by distillation.     I believe,   how
ever,   it is the compound corresponding to chlorhydrine              of glycol
                 discovered by    M. Wurtz.       A portion of this liquid,
from which     I  had simply removed the free iodine, by agitation with
mercury, gave, on analysis, numbers agreeing tolerably well with
the formula of iodhydrine.       After the analysis, however, I discovered
that it contained     a  considerable quantity of iodide of mercury in
solution.     Another portion, from which I had removed the iodine
                                                          ,
by means     of metallic silver, gave, on analysis, 1 1 1 per cent. carbon
and 3-5 hydrogen, instead of 13'9 carbon and 3-0 hydrogen.                  After
all, an analysis is not necessary to enable us to arrive at the composi
tion of this body.      The products formed by the action of potash on
it furnish us    with almost as convincing a proof of its composition as
any analysis could do.       They   are iodide   of potassium and oxide of
ethylene.
    Iodhydrine cf glycol is soluble in water and alcohol, but insoluble
in ether. It has no taste at first ; after a time, however, it almost
burns the tongue, it is so pungent.         It  is decomposed     by heat into
iodide of ethylene, and probably glycol.          It acts with great energy
on the salts of silver.

    A  stream   of hydriodic acid gas was conducted into a mixture of
equivalent quantities of glacial acetic acid and glycol, the tempera
ture of which was prevented from rising during the action of the gas.
As   soon as a portion   of the liquid gave a considerable quantity         of an
oily precipitate on the addition       of water, the     passage   of the     gas

 was interrupted    ;  for the prolonged action of the gas is apt to give
 rise to the formation of iodide of ethylene.       The liquid thus obtained
 was well washed with very dilute potash, dried in vacuo, and ana
lysed.     The numbers obtained lead to the formula                     „

    Iodacetine has a sweetish pungent taste.         It  is insoluble in water,
but soluble in alcohol and ether. Its specific gravity is greater than
that of water. It crystallizes in tables when exposed to cold. Heated
with potash, it   gives iodide   of potassium,   acetate  of potash, and oxide
of ethylene.     It is readily decomposed by the salts of silver.
    This compound can also be prepared with great facility by ex
posing monoacetate        of glycol to the action of hydriodic acid gas.
The liquid must       be kept cold during the action        of the gas, which
 should be interrupted as soon as the addition of water to a portion
of it  causes an abundant oily precipitate.       The whole is then washed
with dilute potash, and dried in vacuo.             A specimen prepared in
 this manner gave, on analysis, 22'62 per cent. carbon and 3-43 hy
 drogen, instead of 22-42 carbon and 3-27 hydrogen.
    I hope soon to have an opportunity of studying these iodine com
pounds more particularly.

 VI. "Experiments           on some        of the Various Circumstances in
       fluencing Cutaneous Absorption."                    By Augustus Waller,
       M.D., F.R.S., Professor of Physiology, Queen's College,
       Birmingham.            Received June 27, 1859.
    In some former experiments*             I  endeavoured     to elucidate the phae-
nomena of cutaneous absorption on the lower animals (batracia), by
immersing the hinder extremities in various solutions, and afterwards
watching the period at which the absorbed substances                     reached the
tongue, where their presence was detected by means of some reagent
applied to its surface      ;   as, for instance, a salt      of iron, when the   legs
were immersed in a solution             of yellow ferro-cyanide of potassium          ;
Prussian    blue was then formed              as  soon    as the ferro-cyanide     was
brought to the tongue.
    Furthermore,     I  was able      to detect,    by the aid of the microscope,
the  " lieux  d' election," or preference        spots, where the cyanide escaped
from the vessels.
    On the   present     occasion     I shall endeavour to elucidate cutaneous
absorption on the higher animals, and,                 if possible, to give a more
definite view of this function,          by determining, by accurate measure
ment, the degree of rapidity,             the peculiarities, &c, which it may
offer in various conditions.

Froriept Tagenl/erichte,  1851.

                                                     123
  A     very simple mode of demonstrating the existence                               of    cutaneous
absorption      is by immersing the leg of a young guinea pig, not more
than half-grown,             into    a   mixture of equal               parts of chloroform               and
tincture of aconite.                After     15    minutes' immersion, the part will be
found insensible at the surface                      and extremities, and, after                 a    short
time, symptons of poisoning by aconite will supervene,                               viz.    :   nausea,
efforts at vomiting,                sometimes        vomiting          of bile,   coldness       of the
surface and extremities, circulation very weak, laborious respiration,
slight convulsive symptoms, and death.
  The influence of            age, or  of thickening of the cuticle, is easily seen
in the    same way       ;   for, if instead of a young animal we take an adult
one, we obtain no poisoning, but merely local insensibility and slight
disturbance of respiration, &c.
  Another not          less instructive             experiment consists in replacing the
mixture of chloroform and tincture of aconite by simple tincture of
aconite.       In this       case, the limb may be indefinitely immersed without
our     obtaining      either        local insensibility,              or death, or indeed                any
symptom whatever of the presence of aconite in the system.
  A fourth experiment, which consists in dividing the sciatic                                        nerve,
shows the influence of innervation on the function of absorption                                      ;   for,
if performed      on an adult animal, and consequently one incapable of
absorbing aconite in quantity sufficient to cause death, the powers of
absorption      will   be generally            found        so    much        augmented that the
animal will be poisoned by immersion of the limb in simple tincture
of aconite.
   In    this experiment            I    attribute the acceleration in the cutaneous
absorption to the paralysis of the blood vessels, as in my experiments
on the sympathetic nerve, where                       I   showed that in blood vessels the
passage    of the blood is completely regulated by nerves springing
from the spinal cord.     When the vascular nerves are paralysed, the
artery becomes         greatly distended, and the blood flows faster within it.
The foot after the section of the sciatic                        is,   on this account, more hot
and red    ;   and for the same reasons                   it
                                                          is     easy to account for the more
rapid absorption of medicinal agents.
  A fifth experiment consists in placing                               a   ligature on the limb, in
order to impede the powers of absorption of the animal.                                     Although
the ligature does produce this result,                      I     was rather surprised to find
how much less efficient                  it   was    than    is    generally represented             ;    for,

                                         124   ,
whenever the least symptoms of a toxic influence made their appear
ance, a ligature    placed over the limb rarely succeeded in saving the
animal.
    In order to obtain results more susceptible of measurement,              I  pro
ceeded to substitute atropia for aconite, and to make use            of the albino
rat in lieu of the guinea pig.          By this  means,    I possessed an agent
whose intervention was immediately detected               by its action on the
iris.   My choice of      the albino    rat was for the like reason, t.      e.  the
facility which it offered       for exact    and easy measurement,       in which
respect this animal is far preferable to any other with which I am
acquainted, unless we except the white mouse, which, however, is so
liable to die from slight causes,          that it is little adapted for most
physiological experiments.
    The  modus operandi which          I  generally adopt is to immerse          the
limb into   a  small 2-drachm bottle containing sufficient of the mixture
to cover the foot and part of the leg.           The strength of the solution
of atropia being generally that from half a grain to one drachm of
some menstruum, such as chloroform, alcohol,             &c, I generally prefer
simply to hold the animal during the experiment to any other mode
of restraint.     By   these means      I  am able   to  guard against      several
causes   of error, such     as the direct contact    of the solution with the
eye or mouth, and,         at the same time, avoid any unnecessary dis
comfort to the animal.
    Chloroform     and Atropia. — A solution of atropia in chloroform
will generally    be found to cause dilatation      of the pupil after the foot
has been   immersed from two to five minutes.           The dilatation, having
once commenced,       is usually very rapid, and the pupil very soon attains
double or treble its normal diameter, which is about          | to \ a millimetre
during day-time.        It  is easy to recognize that this dilatation is not in
very simple ratio to the time occupied in its expansion, the expansion
of  the pupil being more nearly in proportion to the square of the time
occupied than in a simple arithmetical ratio. Immersion of one limb
causes both pupils to dilate equally,          except in some few instances,
where one pupil expands much more than the other, from some con
stitutional   peculiarity,    which   remains the same whichever           foot be
immersed.
    Although    I have never failed to obtain dilatation        of the pupils by
the immersion of the foot in this solution of atropia, yet, in some

                                                   125
cases,     it takes       place      more   slowly than in others.                 The     age   of the
animal has, in this respect, a most marked retarding influence.                                       On
animals only about          third grown, it will often occur at about 2|
                                 a
minutes          after immersion, while in the adult it generally requires
five minutes and upwards.
     The local      effects      of immersion        are redness,           heat, and swelling         of
the      foot,    accompanied sometimes                    with    extravasation          from       some
smaller      vessels,         when the immersion has been prolonged for ten
minutes          and upward.            The sensibility of the part is likewise di
minished, but in no case                so as to produce insensibility. The amount
of irritation       is    of    course variable, according              to the duration          of the
immersion.          It    is,   however, important to remark that full dilatation
of the pupils may               be obtained without             any symptons beyond those
of   a   temporary active vascularization of the part, which quickly dis
appears when the irritating cause                    is    removed,         and which presents no
more active symptoms than those produced by neuro-paralysis of the
vessels after section               of the sciatic   nerve.
     If instead      of immersing the limb                  as above, we merely plunge                 it
for   a   moment in the solution, we likewise may have dilatation of the
pupil, but more slowly.
  The same effects are obtained                      even although the limb be washed
on its withdrawal from the solution, which would lead to the inference
that the effect in that case                is   owing to absorption of the atropia, at
all events beneath the cuticle.
      In the      case    of    a    solution of atropia in turpentine,               a    still more
curious effect           is   observed,     viz. that during immersion in the liquid
the pupil scarcely,             if   at all, dilates   ;   whereas,         immediately after the
removal of the limb, the dilatation commences.                                   Dilatation of the
pupils      will generally persist from twenty-four                           to thirty-six      hours,
and the return to the normal size                          is   very gradual.        In   some cases
the pupil may be affected                   after an immersion of nine minutes, the
dilatation        reaching three millimetres                ;   while in others, only            a   very
slight influence          is    obtained on the pupil after an immersion of from
twelve to fifteen              minutes.      If    the limb       is   then removed         from the
solution, the pupil dilates to its maximum                             in
                                                                        a     few minutes.           After
two or three minutes' immersion, the animal shows signs of consider
able pain.         Much inflammation of the part follows the action of this
solution, which           is    followed     by   oedema.
      When       we immerse the tail                 of the animal instead of its foot,

                                           126
absorption takes place much more slowly, dilatation                   of the pupil being
produced only after the lapse of about twenty minutes.
     Atropia and Alcohol. — If         we substitute alcohol instead             of chloro
form as a solvent, we find that absorption is extremely slow.                      Instead
of obtaining dilatation of the pupils in two or three minutes, we find
that an immersion of twenty to thirty minutes in the alcoholic solu
tion will only produce very slight effects.                     At the    same    time the
local irritation is much less than that caused by chloroform.                      Alcohol
of various strength, from proof spirit upwards, had the                      same    result
as a solvent.
     Atropia in water, with    addition of sufficient acetic acid for
                                    the
its solution. — The absorption of atropia in this state is very slow,
thirty minutes' immersion frequently producing no dilatation of the
pupils.     Dilatation is then promoted by removal of the limb from
the solution.
     Watery extract of Belladonna.           —When         rubbed over the leg and
tail, this substance      was not found, after the lapse            of   an hour, to      pro
duce any dilatation  of the pupil.
  Tincture of belladonna, with half its quantity of chloroform, pro
duced dilatation at the end of fifteen minutes. The part was found
on    removal to be completely insensible, and considerably                        swollen
from oedema, which lasted for several days.
     Atropia with strong alcohol and ammonia produced dilatation                           of
the pupil after twenty-five minutes' immersion.                       In this     case,   the
ammonia was added for the purpose of ascertaining how far irritation
of the part      was conducive to absorption.        Slight vesication was the
consequence        of the   presence      of ammonia. The acceleration of the
absorption was very slight, as the solution produced no dilatation
until after twenty-four minutes' immersion.
   Absorption of Morphia. — The foot of a young rat at one-third of
its growth was immersed in a solution consisting of half a grain of
acetate    of morphia in twenty drops of alcohol and                      one drachm       of
chloroform.        In   five   minutes the pupils          gradually dilated to the
maximum      ;    the limb was then withdrawn          ;   foot hot, red, and rather
swollen.     Irritation of the skin          caused no cry, the animal merely
withdrawing        the part.     Somnolency existed,            from which any noise
aroused    it,   but only for   a   moment.        When placed on its back,               the
animal remained in that position.                Respiration       accelerated.      Vision
when roused very imperfect, as was shown                   by   its falling off the table.

The    pupils   continued      fully dilated, the iris being reduced         to an
almost imperceptible circle, the dilatation exceeding that which           I  have
been able to attain even with atropia.           I  will not dwell more fully    at
present on this last interesting fact, which is opposed to what we
generally meet with in the administration                of morphia.      Twelve
hours after, pupils normal, animal quite well.
   Strychnia and Chloroform.           — After  three minutes' immersion of
foot, dilatation   of pupils ensued.       After   five minutes, the immersed
limb was very sensitive,          apparently more so than normal.            Limb
removed     from     solution   : spasms   about the      throat now appeared,
which were rapidly       succeeded     by stiffness of the trunk, increasing
into tetanic spasms.        Death, two minutes after removal.
   Strychnia and Alcohol. — Foot immersed in a solution of alcohol
and strychnia for upwards of thirty-five minutes ; no symptoms of
strychnine poisoning.         Removed from solution and washed.            Twelve
hours later, no dilatation nor contraction of pupils.
   The   above observations evidently show that medicinal substances
may be very rapidly absorbed into the circulation under certain cir
cumstances, among which, the most important is the choice of the
menstruum in which they are dissolved.
   It  remains for us to examine         into the effect of temperature, in
flammation, neuro-vascular paralysis,          &c,   on absorption.    But, what
is of still more importance,        we have   to   see  how far these facts are
applicable to man in health and disease.
    Meanwhile,     I  take this opportunity        to state that   a  remarkable
 uniformity    exists  between     cutaneous   absorption     in man and in the
lower animals, and       I  believe   that the application      of these  facts to
 practical medicine promises to be very important and extensive.
 VII. "On        Spontaneous        Evaporation."        By Benjamin Guy
       Babington, M.D., F.R.S., &c.                  Received June 7, 1859.
                                     (Abstract.)
    The object of this communication is to make known certain powers
 of attraction and repulsion, hitherto,         as far as     I know, unnoticed,
 which   are possessed by soluble substances         in relation to their solvent,
 and which, in the case of water (the solvent here considered), are
 measured by the amount of loss, on spontaneous evaporation, in the

                                              128
  weight of solutions of different salts and other substances,            as compared
  with the loss of weight in water.
      The force which          holds together the particles of a vaporizable
  liquid is gradually         overcome,     if   that liquid be exposed     to air,   by
  another force which separates,            expands, and diffuses those particles
  in the form of vapour         ;   and this separation takes place, even at a
  common temperature, so rapidly, provided the surface be sufficiently
  extensive,     that an easy opportunity is afforded of determining the
  loss  of weight by      a  common balance.
      A   subject for investigation, possessing         much interest, thus presents
  itself, and, in its pursuit,          some      new  and unexpected results are
  encountered.
     The method which             I  have   pursued has been to expose to the
  atmosphere, for a definite period, solutions of different salts, and also
  pure water under like conditions of quantity and area, temperature,
  atmospheric moisture, and atmospheric pressure.
     Different     salts and other        soluble substances       are thus found     to
  possess, when      in solution, different powers of retarding or accelerating
  evaporation, and hence, from its amount, as compared with that which
 takes place in pure water, we can estimate                the comparative value      of
 those powers.
     The powers       themselves      being established as facts, the next point
 is to endeavour to discover the cause or causes on which they depend,
 and    a  wide field of inquiry is thus opened.
     The following      are the instruments which have been employed               : —
     1.   A  balance,   for one of the scales of which is substituted a flat
 metal plate, six inches square,            on which the vessels to be weighed
can be conveniently supported.               This    balance   will turn sensibly  at a
grain, even with a weight of 4 lbs. on either side.
     2.   A  number of copper pans            tinned within, all of the same size,
being precisely        5  inches     square     inside,   with   perpendicular    sides
fths of an      inch in height, also      a  number of earthenware pans of the
same dimensions,            The   area   of  25 square inches has been chosen,
partly     because    this size is convenient for manipulation, and partly
because      the results obtained can be easily represented in decimals.
This facility of decimal calculation would                 be  of importance should
such pans come into general use as hygrometers, for which purpose
they are well adapted.

                                      129
    3.  Specific gravity bottles and counterpoises.
    4. Thermometers      of various    degrees  of delicacy and      range,   for
ascertaining freezing, temperate,      and boiling points.
    5.  Test tubes for   use, in connexion with     these   thermometers,      as
well   in freezing mixtures   as over the spirit lamp.
    6.  A  barometer.
    7.  Various salts and other soluble     substances,   furnishing, when in
solution, the materials for examination.
    The mode of procedure which I have adopted has              been,   to state
my facts in the form of propositions, and to prove              each    of  these
propositions    by experiments.
    The propositions are as follows : —
    1st proposition. — That in many aqueous           solutions   of  salts   and
other soluble substances      evaporation is retarded, as compared with
the evaporation of water.
    2nd proposition.   — That in solutions of    salts which retard evapora
tion,    that retardation is in proportion      to the quantity of the salt
held in solution.
    3rd proposition.  — That    different salts and other substances soluble
in water have different degrees of power in retarding its evaporation.
    4th proposition.  —That     the power of retarding       evaporation does
not depend on the specific gravity of a solution.
     5th proposition.  —That     in aqueous solutions of salts, the power of
 retardation    does not depend on the base, whether we compare solu
 tions containing like weights of the salt, or solutions of like specific
 gravities.
     6th proposition. — That    in aqueous solutions of salts, the power of
 retarding evaporation does appear to depend upon the salt radical or
 acid, although    the retardation is not altogether independent of the
 influence of the base.
     7th proposition.  — That   salts with two equivalents    of an acid   have a
 greater power of retarding evaporation than salts with one equivalent.
 There are, however, exceptions.
     8th proposition.  —That    there are some salts which, being dissolved
 in water, do not retard its evaporation, and        some salts which, so far
  from retarding, actually accelerate evaporation.
     The truth or probability of the foregoing propositions is established
  by numerous experiments, but in this abstract I shall, for the sake

                                                        130
of brevity, only        state     the result of one or two experiments in proof
of each.
  The first proposition is proved by the fact that a solution of hydro-
chlorate of soda in the proportion of 480 grains to four measured
ounces of water, when exposed under the conditions already stated to
spontaneous evaporation, lost only 33 grains in weight after twelve
hours' exposure, — while four ounces by measure of water lost 53grains,
— and after twelve hours' further exposure lost only                                     109 grains,     while
the water lost        1 74    grains      ;   that      is,   the water, as compared with the
solution, lost weight in the ratio nearly of                          5   to 3.
  The       second     proposition            is   proved        by   the fact that         a    solution     of
240 grains of hydrochlorate                        of   soda    in four    ounces          by measure         of
water lost in twelve hours 73 grains by evaporation, while four ounces
by measure    of pure water lost 81 grains, — this  in   proportion                 is      a
of only about   of the latter to of the former whereas, when double
                   8                               7                      ;
the quantity or 480 grains of salt were dissolved, the pure water,
as compared        with the solution, lost in the proportion of                              5   to 3.
   The third proposition    proved by the fact that a solution of 480
                                       is
grains of nitrate of potassa in  ounces or 1920 grains of water lost
                                                   4
in twelve hours         95 grains         ;   while      a    solution    of the      same strength       of
hydrochlorate of            soda lost only 70 grains                  ;   and again,        a    solution of
loaf-sugar, in which 480 grains were dissolved                             in   1   920 grains of water,
lost in 20 hours        1    75 grains, while            a    like solution of hydrochlorate of
soda lost only 117 grains.
  The fourth proposition    proved by the fact that 480 grains of
                                              is
gum-arabic dissolved in 920 of water had specific gravity of -072,
                                      1                               a                              1
while   a   solution of hydrochlorate of soda of like strength had                                   a    spe
cific gravity of                      after              hours, the former had lost by eva
                       1•   149   ;            1   1|
poration     7 1   grains, while the latter had lost only 50 grains.                                     Here,
therefore, the solution of the lighter specific gravity was less retarded
in its evaporation than the heavier solution.                                 In contrast with this
fact,   a   solution of hydrochlorate                   of ammonia of 480 grains to                      1   920
grains of water, having               a   specific gravity of only 1-060, lost by evapo
ration, in    8    hours and 44 minutes, 17 grains, while                             a   like solution of
hydrochlorate of soda lost 24 grains.                                 Here, then, the solution of
lighter specific gravity was more retarded in its evaporation than the
heavier solution.            The conclusion              is   decisive that specific gravity has
no necessary         connexion with the phoenomena.

                                        131
    The fifth proposition      is proved by the fact that   in the following
solutions    of salts of potassa, all of the  same strength (namely       1  salt
to 10 water), a difference       in the amount of evaporation in each will
be  observed to have taken place, and it must be borne in mind that
in solutions      so weak we cannot       expect that difference to be very
great.
   The reason for employing weak solutions was the necessity for
having all of the same strength, one in ten being the extent, to which
the least soluble salt submitted to examination, namely, the sulphate
of potassa, will, at a low temperature, dissolve.
                                                                  grams.

          Tartrate of potassa lost in 35 hours      .   .          151
    The   above     solutions were next made all of one specific gravity,
 namely     1 '060, temp. 62° Fahr., instead of being all of one strength,

     The sixth proposition is rendered probable by the following ex
 periment, in which solutions are employed of acetic, nitric, sulphuric,
 and   hydrochloric acids, combined respectively with potassa,              soda,
 and   ammonia, in the proportion of 100 grains of the salt to              1000
 grains   of water.       After the expiration of  10 hours and 20 minutes,
 the solution of the three acetates lost respectively, for the potassa
  salt 35 grs., for the soda salt 35 grs., and for the ammonia salt
  28   grs.     In the solutions of the three nitrates, the loss was re
  spectively 24, 25 and 25.         In the solutions of the three sulphates,

                                          132
 the loss was 30 grs., 37 grs., and 29 grs. respectively, while in the
 solutions of the hydrochlorates it was 17, 18, and               19   grains.
     The   seventh     proposition is proved by an experiment in which                  a
 solution of 100 grains of carbonate of potassa                  dissolved in 1000
 grains of water is compared with            a like   solution    of bicarbonate       of
 potassa.      In  ten hours the solution      of the carbonate lost 45 grains,
 while that of the bicarbonate lost only 36 grains.                     In comparing
 like proportions and quantities of sulphate and bisulphate of potassa,
 the respective losses in 13 hours were, for the former 53 grains, for
 the latter 45 grains.         Similar comparisons of the acetate and bin-
 acetate    of ammonia,        phosphate     and    biphosphate,         sulphate   and
 bisulphate      of  potassa,   tartrate   and bitartrate       of   soda    show   like
 results.     In the course of investigating             this   proposition      it was
 remarked incidentally that in all the salts examined, with the single
 exception of carbonate and bicarbonate of soda, the bin-acid solution
 (the proportion       by weight of salt to water being equal) is of less
 specific gravity than the mono-acid solution, though                     possessing   a
 greater power of retarding evaporation.
     The eighth proposition, which seems extraordinary and even
paradoxical, is proved by an experiment in which saturated solutions
 of — 1, ferro-cyanate of potassa, 2, bitartrate of potassa, 3, sulphate
of copper,      4, chlorate   of  potassa,  and    5,  distilled water, were com
pared.      In   9  hours and 20 minutes, their losses by evaporation were
respectively 34 grs., 38 grs., 34 grs., 29 grs., and 29 grs., where we
perceive    that in the chlorate of potassa        solution there has occurred
no retardation at all, while in the following               experiment, in which
120 grains       of  each  of the salts examined        were    dissolved in 1200
grains of water,      namely, — 1,   solution of sulphate of copper, 2, solu
tion of ferro-cyanate of potassa,          3, solution     of carbonate of soda,
and 4, distilled water, the number of grains lost by evaporation after
15£ hours' exposure were,
                                 — 1,   120 grs. ; 2, 113 grs.        ;   3, 106 grs. ;
4, 103 grs.
    It is thus perceived that       in all the three solutions          a  more rapid
evaporation had taken place than in distilled water alone.
    One or two other propositions are in process of investigation.
   The paper concludes with          a  table of the freezing-points, boiling-
points, and specific gravities, as well of weak as of saturated solutions,
of the salts which have been submitted to examination.

         Double Stars."         By The Lord Wrottesley, V.P.R.S.,
         &c.    Received May 27, 1859.
      In a communication addressed to the Royal Society        "On the results
 of Periodical Observations of the Positions        and Distances     of certain
 Double Stars," printed in the Philosophical        Transactions for 1851,     I
 took occasion to remark that the differences between mean results ob
 tained on different evenings were greater in proportion than those of
 the separate or partial measures obtained on the same evening, which
 arise from chance errors of observation, and that this circumstance
rendered the application of the Formulae of the Calculus of Probabi
 lities to the reduction of the observations embarrassing and difficult.
 In other words, the      differences  between the mean      positions and dis
tances obtained on different nights were greater than would have
been anticipated by one who had merely computed the probable error
of a single    measure   in the usual manner from      the data furnished by
the sums of the squares of the partial differences         from the mean.
     The observations     made since    1851  fully confirm the anomaly in
question.      It is probable, therefore, that there is some cause which
modifies sensibly and in some unknown manner the results obtained.
It   may be temperature acting on the micrometer screw;              it may be
the state of the atmosphere or the method of making the observation            ;
but     whatever it be, the observations show conclusively that such
causes are sometimes       in operation.
     For the purpose of obtaining some numerical expression, however
imperfect, of the effect produced, I adopted the following method : —
I   took the difference between two mean results of position obtained
on two different nights, where not more than about two months in
tervened between the observations        ; and  I ascertained   also the mean
of the probable errors of such positions as computed in the ordinary
method.       In order that each star might be subjected to exactly the
same treatment,      I selected   always the observations of the first two
nights on which it      was observed,    except when the two consecutive
means were obtained at too long an interval apart.                Now    as the
number of partial measures of angle obtained on each separate night
very often did not exceed six, these probable errors are certainly not
       vol. x.                                                         L

                                                  134
theoretically correct, or to be depended                       upon absolutely as a test                 of
the accuracy of the observation                      ;    but it may perhaps be assumed
that any errors arising from this cause will not materially affect                                      the
mean       of   a very great number            of results.
     It   appeared       then that the mean of 218 differences                    taken at hazard
from among such as were most accessible,                               and from observations
made by different observers,                   was 37'-67, and that the corresponding
mean       of the        of all the probable errors was 13'- 29 ; that is to
                     means
say,      the latter is 35.27 per cent. only of the value of the former.
As     some     proof that the       cause, whatever          it may    be, is not very variable
in its operation,         I   may add that the first 110 differences, which were
all obtained before the end of 1854,                          give these numbers, 37'.79,
1   1'-86, and 31-37 per cent, respectively.                        Again, the last 108 differ
ences, which were all derived from the observations                               of   one observer
only, give 37'-56,             14'75, and        39 27 per cent.            Of    these      108       last
differences,        the first 50, taken from the middle epoch                     of all the obser
vations, give 40'-06, 14'-60, and 36-44 per cent., and the last 58                                       of
the 108 give 35' 40, 14'-88, and 42-03 per cent.                             There     is,   however,
a   circumstance which must be taken into account in making                                    a    com
parison between the first             1   10   differences and mean probable errors,
and the last 108.             During the course of the observations from which
the former were derived,              it   was the practice to take always                    10 mea
sures     of    each star on each night when possible                   ;   during the observa
tions from which the latter were derived,                      6    measures only were taken.
This would tend           to make the differences less in the former case                          ;   and
with respect to its effect on the probable errors,                          if   we put   F    for the
error of       a   single measure         in each case, the probable                errors in the
former case should be less by                    a       quantity    =0-0768xF;              for   if   we
put   C    for the constant and           P    for the probable error, then we have

 The facts   above disclosed create the difficulties in applying                                       the
Calculus of Probabilities which have been before referred to.
    In    the first place, the partial measures                 obtained on each             separate
night are generally too few               in   number to eliminate the effects                 of one
sided chance         errors.

                                                    135
     In the   second place,        it   seems probable that some cause remains in
action during a whole night, modifying the result, whose origin and
law remain to be discovered, but which seems tolerably constant in
its operation.
     The observations of my Catalogue of double                        stars are drawing to a
close, and      it   became extremely desirable that                  if   there were any fault
in the reductions              or method of computing                  hitherto     employed it
should be speedily remedied, and the necessary corrections made                                    ;   I
therefore applied to the Astronomer Royal,                             stating the embarrass
ments arising from the above-mentioned causes,                               and requesting his
opinion as to the best mode of proceeding.                            The Astronomer Royal
exhibited on this, as on all other occasions,                        where his aid has been
solicited, the greatest readiness to give me the benefit of his extensive
knowledge of all that appertains to Astronomical                             science.
     Mr. Airy        observed    that    if   there were a constant cause of error on
any   night, no multiplication of observations on that night would tend
to   remove        it,
                and in that case he knew of no mode of proceeding
which would quite meet the difficulty but the adoption of the follow
ing formulae.
     Assuming that all the observations                        are equally good,        or can be
made so by grouping discordant measures, let                     /         be the probable error
of   a   single observation, and          e       the probable value of the error of each
night.        Let S,,    Sa, Ss,   &c. represent the sums of the squares of the
errors obtained in the usual manner from the observations on the
first, second, third, &c. nights respectively, and put                                  na,   &c. for
the number of observations obtained on each of those nights                                   ;   then
the observations          of   the first night give,
                               («,-lXr=-4549XS,                  ;
those     of the     second,
                                K-l)/2=-4549xSa,
and so on      :     and from the sum of all these equations                 /      may be accu
rately determined.
     Then to find        e,   compare the mean result obtained from the obser
vations on all the nights,              i.   e.    the mean of all the means, with the
separate      means for separate evenings                 ;   then putting     S   for the sum of
                                                                               l    2

which gives the value of       e.
   If A   be taken to represent      any convenient constant, the combining

   Mr. Airy, however, while remarking that           the mode    of proceeding
above described is the only one which really meets the difficulties          of
the case, admits at the same time that it would not be expedient to
use so elaborate    a process    in dealing with observations like those in
question, in which the ordinary errors of observation are large in
amount, and in which such extreme             accuracy in the results is not
obtainable as in some other cases to which the principles of the
Calculus are applicable.
    He  suggests   therefore that all the observations of all the several
nights should be combined together for the purpose of obtaining the
probable error and weight of the final result         ;  and this may be done
in two different ways      : — First, by treating all the single   measures  of
all the nights, as   if  they had been made on one and the same night,
and obtaining the final result and its probable error and weight ac
cordingly in the usual manner         : Secondly, by treating each group or
set  of 6 or 10 as a single observation.
   The only other method of proceeding is that          above described as the
correct one, but which has not been adopted, as being too cumbrous
for the occasion.      This will    be designated as the    Third Method.
   For the purpose of ascertaining         the result   of employing   each  of

                                                    137
these three        methods,         I   requested      my assistant,       Mr. Morton,                to ob
serve    three     stars, selected from among those                         which present only
average difficulties, a very great number                       of   times, so that the measures
should be sufficiently numerous to eliminate all one-sided errors.
   The observations of Position only have been                            used      ;   but these have
been dealt with in the three different methods                             above described,                that
is,   the final result and its probable error and weight have been ob
tained by each of the three modes.                           The results       are here subjoined,
and the errors and their squares are given in full as to two of the
stars, together with the whole computation                           ;   and   it       is   to be hoped
that this may not only prove interesting to observers                                   of double      stars,
but may throw some light on the curious mathematical question                                               in
volved in the inquiry which                 is   the subject of the above remarks.
      Among the      stars selected as above                 mentioned for the trial of the
three methods, was              2   Comae     Berenices, or           2   1596.          Now this star
had been very frequently observed during the six years from 1843 to
1848, at the time        of the Parallax investigation, to which reference
has     been      already made.  The comparison then made between the
mean     of all the measures of position obtained                          and the value              of the
angle    of position given by Struve, gave reason                          to believe either that
the angle had not altered during                      a   period of sixteen years, or at least
that    it   had altered very little.             The observations of                   1859       fully   con
firmed this opinion.              Rejecting from the observations of 1843-8 those
made on two nights, when less than                          6   measures were                obtained, the
result       of   1859    differs only       8'   from that of 1843-8.                       I     was thus
enabled, for the purposes of this inquiry, to treat these observations
of 1843-8,         156    in number,        as   if    they had all been made within                        an
interval       of time not greater than about two months.                                      Now these
observations had been made                       by   three different observers,                   and while
the     results of separate
                         nights                     were very discordant,
                                                              probable                       the
errors derived from the partial values of nights, the results of which
differed greatly from the general                         mean, were as remarkably small                      ;
on the other hand, the observations of the same star in 1859, 215 in
number, were             by   one observer only, and the results                of different nights
agree very closely.The applications of the three methods to the
early and late observations of this star therefore illustrate very
strikingly the       effect      produced         by   discordancy in the values obtained
on     different nights,          when the peculiarities                 of the object              observed

                                     138
are eliminated.      Thus the good observations of          1859    give the e'
equal to 89' only, while in those of 1843-8 the               attains the great
value of 8731'.
    The  values  of/a given by the observations of the three       stars accord
very well, considering the different circumstances under which they
were obtained.      It will  be seen also that  little effect  is produced on
the mean result by using these different methods of reduction.
    In  the account of the American         Coast Survey of 1856, and at
pages   307-8, will   be found a formula by which the probable error is
deduced from the differences from the mean alone, the probable error
or P=0.845347        —r==,       where  e represents the error of a single
observation.
    I have tested this   in the case of three  stars in which n was equal    to
6, 10, and 156, respectively, and the probable error deduced was a
little greater in the first two cases, and a very little smaller in the last.

        Received         September 23,          1   859.
   Sir, — I      have the honour to acquaint you for the information                        of
the President and Council of the Royal Society, that my voyage has
happily terminated, and that our exertions have met with as great a
measure     of     success      as the most sanguine amongst us could expect.
But     as the general          result of Lady Franklin's            "Final Search" will
doubtless be made public before this letter reaches you, my object is
simply to acquaint you with the nature and extent of such observa
tions of scientific interest as we have been enabled to make.
   My last communication, dated 5th May,                           1858,    informed you of
the unfortunate circumstances which led to our first Arctic winter
being spent in an ice-drift out of Baffin's Bay.                           During the winter
of 1858-59         we were        frozen up in a secure anchorage in Brentford
Bay, which         I   have     named      " Port Kennedy ;" it is in Latitude 72°
01'    N. and Longitude            94°    15' W.
   Here a magnetic observatory was built, the instruments                             supplied
to us set up, and hourly observations continued during the interval
between     autumn and spring travelling.                       Fortunately    I   was able to
carry with me a          9   I -inch   dip-circle upon my journey to the Great Fish
River     this spring, and                                   of making ob
                                       embraced every opportunity
servations with          it,   many of them in the immediate vicinity of the
point of maximum inclination.                   Indeed     it   gives me much satisfaction
to state    that I      believe        our entire series of magnetical observations
will   be found complete               — in   as far as we were provided             with the
necessary    instruments and favoured with the opportunities                         of using
them.
  Meteorological             records have been carefully kept throughout                  the
voyage,     and the          " Weather Books " supplied               by   Admiral FitzRoy

                                         149
 filled up   ; also, comparisons     of temperatures shown by        a   black-bulb
 thermometer in the sun's rays, and by others suspended against black
 and white surfaces,       with those of   a  thermometer in the shade, were
 frequently made during two years.
     Dr. Joseph Hooker having        suggested that some observations should
 be made on the temperature          of the soil  at different depths, such were
 registered at short intervals throughout             the winter and spring of
 1858-59.
     Observations upon the amount of ozone present in the atmosphere
 were made during        the winter and spring        of 1857-58,    and also for
 eleven months at       Port Kennedy, 1858-59.
     Whenever      opportunity    offered, the polariscope, supplied         at the
instance of Professor Stokes, was applied to halos,          &c, and the amount
 and plane of polarization noticed.
     The direction of the Aurora       and its influence on an electroscope,
together with the periods of maximum and minimum                       intensity of
atmospheric electricity, were observed.
     The periods of maximum and minimum barometric pressure                    were
recorded, as deduced from hourly and two-hourly                observations.
    A  series  of experiments     was made on the change produced in sea-
water by congelation at different temperatures.
     Deep-sea temperatures         and specific gravities were taken when
opportunity      offered ; also  of the surface    of the  sea constantly.
    The great    comet was     seen at   Port Kennedy,        and a few angular
measurements taken for determining its change of position, at in
tervals between      13th September and 8th October.
    Selections of native plants, from Port Kennedy and from Disco,
have been brought         home in Wardian cases, for the Royal Botanic
Gardens at Kew.          Considerable     collections have also been made in
the various branches of Natural History             ; and Geological specimens
from the lands visited have been brought home for scientific friends
of the Expedition,        who will speedily make public          any interesting
results  :  for these collections, and also for many of the observations
made during the voyage,         I am  chiefly indebted to the Surgeon, David
Walker, M.D.
    A  series  of Tidal observations     was taken at     Port Kennedy ; these
will  be discussed    by the Rev. Professor Haughton, F.R.S., of Trinity
College, Dublin.
                                                                  m2

     Our geographical discoveries amount            to nearly 800 miles  of  coast
 line ; they are interesting not only in            consequence   of their extent
 and the important         position they occupy, but also from the great
 difficulty of access, whether by          sea  or land, to this newly explored
 area.     With the exception of        a comparatively     small and unimport
 ant part of the shore of Victoria Land,             the whole of the coasts     of
 Arctic America      are now accurately delineated,
    My    sledge journey to the Magnetic           Pole in February     completed
 the discovery of the coastline of the American Continent.                The in
 sularity of Prince of Wales Land was ascertained,             and the discovery
 of its coastline completed, by a sledge party under the direction
 of the Sailing-master, Captain Allen Young, as also the west coast of
 North Somerset         between Bellot Strait and       Four River Bay. Lieute
 nant Hobson, R.N. and his sledge party completed the discovery of
 the west coast of King William's Island, picking up the Franklin
 records   ;  whilst with my own          I  explored its eastern and southern
 shores,   returning northward by its west shore from the Great Fish
 River.
    Repeated attempts were made last year before the close of the
 navigable season, to reach        open     water visible in the broad channel
westward of North Somerset            ;  but a narrow barrier of ice across the
western      outlet of Bellot Strait, and there hemmed in so firmly             by
numerous islets as to continue unbroken throughout the autumn gales,
                                                       ' Fox,'
foiled my sanguine         hope of carrying the                according to my
original     plan, southward to the Great Fish River, passing east of
King William's Island and from thence to                some wintering    position
upon Victoria Land.           From   a very careful scrutiny    of the ice during
my journeys over it in February, March, April, May, and June, it
was evident that in this western sea it was all broken up ; whilst east
ward and southward of King William's Island there was hardly any
ice last autumn       ;  and therefore in all probability       we saw,    in that
barrier of ice some three or four miles wide, the only obstruction to
our complete success.
    The wide channel         between     Prince   of Wales Land     and   Victoria
Land,    upon which        I have   conferred the name of Lady Franklin,
admits a vast and continuous stream of very heavy ocean-formed ice
from the north-west, which presses upon the western                face  of King
William's Island        and chokes up     Victoria Strait.

                                     151
    I cannot divest   myself of the belief that had Sir John Franklin
 been aware of the existence of a channel eastward of King William's
 Land (so named until 1854), and sheltered from this impenetrable
ice-stream,   his ships would safely and speedily have passed through it
in 1846,   and from thence with comparative ease to Behring Strait.
   Having enumerated the different subjects which have engaged the
attention   of the officers  and myself and have employed much       of our
time,   it only remains for    me to express   a  hope that these will be
found to be    in some measure a justification   of any moderate   expecta
tions  which the President and Council of the Royal Society may have
formed at the time of my departure from England in 1857, or at
least  to afford proof that my desire to be rendered useful in the ad
vancement     of science has in no  degree abated since then.

I. " On         Recent       Theories and Experiments regarding Ice at or
         near its       Melting-point."                By Professor James Thomson,
         Queen's College, Belfast.                          Communicated by Professor
         William          Thomson, F.R.S.                   Received September 9, 1859.
     My object in the following paper is to                      discuss    briefly the bearings
of   some      of the leading theories of the plasticity and other properties
of   ice at or near its melting-point,                    on speculations on the same sub
ject advanced by myself*, and, especially, to offer an explanation of an
experiment made by Professor James D. Forbes, which to him and
others has seemed to militate against the theory proposed by me, but
which, in reality,          I believe     to be in perfect accordance with that theory.
     In the year        1850,    Mr. Faraday          f invited    attention, in         a     scientific
point of view, to the fact that two pieces of moist ice, when placed in
contact, will unite together, even when the surrounding temperature
is such as to keep them              in   a   thawing state.    He attributed this pheno
menon to a property which he                        supposed ice to possess, of tending to
solidify water in contact with                  it,   and of tending more strongly to so
lidify   a    film or   a   particle of water when the water has ice in contact
with     it   on both sides than when                it   has ice on only one side.
     In January         1857,    Dr. Tyndall, in             a   paper (by himself and              Mr.
Huxley)         read    before    the Royal Society and in                  a   lecture delivered
at the        Royal Institution, adopted this fact                  as the basis         of   a   theory
by which         he proposed to explain the viscosity or plasticity of ice,
or its capability           of undergoing change of form, which                               was   pre-

  viously known to be the quality in glaciers in virtue of which their
  motion down their valleys is produced by gravitation.                    Designating
  Mr. Faraday's fact under the term " regelation," Dr. Tyndall de
  scribed the capability of glacier ice to undergo changes of form, as
  being not true viscosity,        but as being the result of vast numbers of
  successively occurring        minute fractures, changes        of position of the
  fractured parts, and regelations of those parts in their new positions.
  The terms fracture and regelation then came to be the brief expres
  sion  of his  idea   of the plasticity of ice. He appears to have           been led
  to  deny the applicability of the term viscosity through the               idea that
  the motion occurs by starts due to the sudden fractures                 of parts in
  themselves    not viscous     or plastic.    The crackling,        he   pointed   out
  might, according to circumstances, be made up of separate starts
  distinctly sensible to the ear and to the touch, or might be so slight
  and so   rapidly   repeated    as to melt almost into a musical tone.             He
  referred to slight irregular variations in the bending motion of the
  line marked by      a  row of pins on a glacier by Prof. Forbes, as being
  an indication     of the    absence    of any quality that could properly be
  called viscosity, and of the occurrence of successive fractures and
  sudden motions in a material not truly viscous or plastic. I can only
  understand his statements         on this subject by supposing that he con
 ceived the material between          the cracks to be rigid, or permanent in
 form, when existing under strains within the limit of its strength, or
 when strained less than to the point          of fracture.
     This theory    appeared     to me to be wrong *       ; and  I  then published,
    * While  the offering  of my own theory    as a substitute for Professor Tyndall's
 views seems the best argument      I can adduce against them,   still I would point to
 one special objection to his theory. No matter how fragile, and no matter how much
fractured a material may be, yet if its separate fractured parts be not possessed of
some property of internal mobility, I cannot see how a succession of fractures is
to be perpetuated.      A heap of sand or broken glass will either continue standing,
or will go down with sudden falls or slips, after which a position of repose will be
attained ; and I cannot see how the addition of a principle of reunion could tend
to reiterate the fractures after such position of repose has been attained.      When
these ideas are considered in connexion with the fact that while ice is capable of
standing, without immediate fall, as the side of a precipitous crevasse, or of lying
without instantaneous slipping on a steeply sloping part of a valley, it can also
glide along, with its surface nearly level, or very slightly inclined, I think the
improbability of the motion arising from a succession of fractures of a substance
having its separate parts devoid of internal mobility will become very apparent.
If, on the other hand, any quality of internal mobility be allowed in the fragments
between the cracks, a certain degree at least of plasticity or viscosity is assumed,

                                            154
 in   a paper   communicated to the Royal Society,                 a   theory which had
 occurred to me mainly in or about the year 1848, or perhaps 1850 ;
 but which, up till the date of the paper referred to, had only been
 described to      a few friends verbally.           That theory of mine may be
 sketched in outline as        follows : — If to       a mass of ice at its melting-
 point, pressures     tending to change its form be applied, there will be
 a   continual    succession     of   pressures      applied to particular          parts —
 liquefaction occurring        in those      parts through         the lowering of the
 melting-point      by   pressure —evolution          of the cold by which the so
 melted     portions had been       held in the frozen state — dispersion of the
 water so produced in such directions as will afford relief to the
 pressure    — and   recongelation, by the cold previously evolved, of the
 water on its being relieved             from this pressure          :  and the cycle     of
 operations will then begin again ; for the parts re-congealed, after
 having been melted, must in their turn, through the yielding of other
 parts, receive pressures       from the applied forces,             thereby to be again
 liquefied and to proceed through successive operations as before.
     Professor Tyndall, in papers and lectures subsequent                    to the publi
 cation of this theory, appears to adopt it to some extent, and to endea
 vour to make its principles cooperate with the views he had previously
 founded on      Mr. Faraday's fact of         so  called "regelation"*.
     Professor James D. Forbes adopts Person's view, that the dissolu
 tion of ice is a gradual,        not  a   sudden process,         and so far resembles
 the tardy liquefaction         of fatty    bodies     or of the metals, which            in
 melting pass through intermediate stages of softness                    or viscosity. He
 thinks that ice must essentially be colder than water in contact with
in order to explain the observed plasticity or viscosity.              That fractures — both
large and exceedingly small
                               —  both  large  at rare  intervals,  and  small, momentarily
repeated —do, under various circumstances, arise in the plastic yielding of masses
of ice, is, of course, an undoubted fact : but it is one which I regard not as the
cause, but as a consequence,       of the plastic yielding of the mass in the manner
supposed in my own theory.         It yields by its plasticity in some parts until other
parts are overstrained   and snap asunder, or perhaps also sometimes slide suddenly
past one another.
    *  I suppose the term regelation   has been given by Prof. Tyndall as denoting the
second, or mending     stage in his theory    of "fracture and regelation." Congela
tion would seem to me the more proper word to use after fracture, as regelation
implies previous melting.     If my theory of melting by pressure and freezing again
on relief of pressure be admitted, then the term regelation will come to be quite
suitable for a part of the process of the union of the two pieces of ice, though not
for the whole, which then ought to be designated as the process of melting and
regelation.

it   ;   that     between              the ice and the water there is                         a   film varying in
local temperature from side to side, which may be called plastic ice,
or viscid water              ;       and that through this film heat must be constantly
passing from the water to the ice, and the ice must be wasting away,
though the water                      be what is called ice-cold.
     There is          a manifest difficulty                    in conceiving the possibility of the
state      of things here                     described     :    and       I   cannot help thinking that
Professor Forbes                      has been himself               in some degree sensible                    of the
difficulty        ;    for in         a note    of later    date by a few months than the paper
itself, he        amends              the expression             of his idea by             a statement         to the
effect that           if a   small quantity of water be enclosed in a cavity in ice,
it will undergo                                  " regelation              " that     is,   that the ice will in
                                 a   gradual                           ;
this      case be gradually increased                           instead of wasted.                In     reference    to
the first case,            I         would ask,       — What         becomes        of the cold of the               ice,
supposing             there to be no communication with external objects                                               by
which heat might                          be added to or taken from                         the water and ice
jointly considered                    ?      Does   it    go into the water and produce viscidity
beyond the limit of the assumed thin film of viscid water at the sur
face      of the       ice   ?        Precisely       a   corresponding question may be put re
latively to the second                       case — that of       the large quantity              of   ice enclosing
a    small quantity of water in which the reverse process                                           is   assumed      to
occur.            Next, let an intermediate case be considered — that of                                        a   me
dium quantity of water in contact with                                 a       medium quantity of ice, aud
in which no heat, nor cold, practically speaking,                                       is    communicated to
the water or the ice from surrounding objects.                                              This,   it   is   to be ob
served,      is       no mere theoretical case, but                        a    perfectly feasible one.             The
result, evidently,               if    the previously described theories be correct, ought
to be that the mixture of ice and water ought to pass into the state
 of uniform viscidity. Prof. Forbes's own words distinctly deny the
 permanence of the water and ice in contact in their two separate
 states, for he says,                  " bodies of different               temperatures cannot continue
 so without interaction.                         The water           must give off heat to the ice, but
it       spends       it   in an insignificant thaw at the surface,                               which therefore
 wastes even though the water be what                                      is   called ice-cold."        Now the
 conclusion arrived                    it,   namely, that        a   quantity of viscid water could be
 produced in the manner described, is,                               I     am satisfied,       quite contrary to
 all experience.                     No      person   has ever,            by   any peculiar application               of
 heat to, or withdrawal of heat from,                                 a    quantity of water, rendered                 it

                                               156
visibly and tangibly viscid.              We   even know that water may be cooled
much below the ordinary freezing-point and yet remain fluid.
     Professor Forbes regards             Mr. Faraday's fact of regelation             as being
one which receives its proper explanation through his theory described
above     ;   and,     in confirmation of the supposition that ice has a tendency
to solidify        a   film of water in contact with       it,
                                                         and in opposition to the
theory given by me, that the regelation                  is    a   consequence     of the low
ering of the melting-point in parts pressed together, he adduces                              an
experiment made by himself, which                  I   admit presents       a    strong appear
ance   of proving the influence of the             ice in solidifying the water, to be
not essentially dependent on pressure.                  This experiment, however,            I
propose to discuss and explain in the                 concluding part of the present
paper.                                                                                       ,
     Professor Forbes accepts my theory of the plasticity of ice                      as   being
so far correct that         it    points to some of the causes which may reason
ably be considered,               under peculiar     circumstances, to impart to a
glacier       a   portion of its plasticity.       In the rapid alternations of pres
sure which take place   in the moulding of ice under the Bramah's press,
it   cannot, he thinks, be doubted that the opinions of myself and my
brother Professor Wm. Thomson are verified*.
     Mr. Faraday, in his recently published               '
                                                               Researches in Chemistry
and Physics,' still adheres to his original mode of accounting for the
phenomenon he had observed, and for which he now adopts the name
"regelation;"             or, at least,    while   alluding        to the views of Prof.
Forbes as possibly being admissible as correct, and to the explanation
offered by myself as being probably true          in principle, and possibly
having        a   correct bearing on the phenomena of regelation, he consi
ders that the principle originally assumed by himself may after all be
the sole cause of the effect.               The principle he          has   in   view, he then
states as being, when more distinctly expressed,                     the following    :— " In
all uniform bodies possessing cohesion, i.                e.   being either in the liquid
or the solid state, particles which are surrounded by other particles
having the like state with themselves                tend to preserve that state, even
though subject to variations of temperature, either of elevation or de
pression, which,         if  the particles were not so surrounded, would cause

them instantly to change their condition."                       Referring   to water in
illustration,    he says that it may be cooled many degrees                    below 32°
Fahr., and still retain its liquid        state   ;  yet that    if a piece  of the   same
chemical substance       — ice —at    a higher temperature be introduced, the
cold water freezes and becomes warm.                    He points out that it       is cer
tainly not the change of temperature which                    causes the freezing     ;   for
the ice introduced is warmer than the water                 ;  and he says he assumes
that    it is the difference in the condition of cohesion existing on the
different sides of the changing particles which sets them free and
causes the change.        Exemplifying,        in another direction, the principle
 he is propounding, he refers to the fact that water may be exalted to
 the temperature of 270° Fahr., at the ordinary pressure of the atmo
 sphere, and yet remain water             ;   but that the introduction             of the
 smallest particle of air or steam will cause it to explode, and at the
 same time to fall in temperature.               He further alludes to numerous
 other substances     — such     as acetic acid, sulphur, phosphorus,             alcohol,
 sulphuric acid, ether, and camphine — which manifest like phenomena
 at their freezing- or boiling-points, to those referred to as occurring with
 the substance of water, ice, and steam               ;  and he adverts to the ob
 served fact that the contact of extraneous substances                   with the parti
 cles   of a fluid usually   sets these particles free to change their state, in
 consequence,      he says, of the cohesion between them and the fluid
 being imperfect      ;  and he instances that glass will permit water to
 boil in contact with it at 2 1 2° Fahr., or by preparation can be made
 so that water     will remain in contact with it               at 270°   Fahr. without
 going off into steam      ;   also that glass       can be prepared so that water
  will remain in contact with it at 22° Fahr. without solidification,
  but that an ordinary piece of glass will set the water off at once to
  freeze.
     He afterwards      comes to a point        in his reasoning which          he admits
  may be considered as an assumption.                  It  is  "that many particles in
  a  given state     exert   a  greater sum         of their peculiar      cohesive     force
  upon a     given particle of the like      substance in another state than few
  can do    ;  and that as a consequence           a water particle      with  ice on one
  side, and water on the other, is not so apt to become                     solid as with
  ice on both sides ; also that a particle            of  ice at the surface     of a mass
   [of ice] in water is not    so apt to remain ice as when, being within the
   mass    there is ice on all sides,        temperature remaining the same."

                                         158
This supposition evidently contains two very distinct hypotheses.
The former, which has to do with ice and water present together,                      I
certainly do regard as an assumption, unsupported                    by any of the
phenomena which Mr. Faraday has adduced.                     The other, which has
to do with a particle of ice in the middle of continuous ice, and
which assumes that it will not so readily change to water, as another
particle  of ice in contact with water,         I think  is to be accepted    as  pro
bably true.     I  think the general bearing of all the phenomena he has
adduced is   to show that the particles of a substance when existing all
in  one state only, and      in continuous contact with         one another, or     in
contact only under special circumstances with other substances,                    ex
perience a difficulty      of making a beginning        of their change of     state,
whether from liquid to solid, or from liquid to gaseous, or probably
also from solid to     liquid   : but  I do not think anything has been ad
duced showing        a  like difficulty as to their undergoing a change             of
state, when the substance          is present in the two states already, or
when a beginning of the change has already been made.                        I  think
that when water and            ice are   present     together, their     freedom to
change their state on the slightest addition or abstraction of heat, or
the slightest change of pressure,           is perfect.        I  therefore cannot
admit the validity        of Mr. Faraday's         mode    of accounting for the
phenomena of regelation.
    Thus the fact of regelation which Prof. Tyndall has taken as the
basis of his theory for explaining the plasticity of ice, does in my
opinion as much require explanation as does the plasticity of ice which
it is applied to explain.         The two    observed     phenomena, namely the
tendency of the separate pieces of ice to unite when in contact, and
the plasticity of ice, are indeed, as      I believe,   cognate results    of a com
mon cause.        They    do not explain one another.            They both require
explanation    ;  and that explanation,        I  consider, is the same for both,
and is given by the theory          I have myself offered.
    I now proceed to discuss the experiment by Prof. Forbes, already
 referred to as having been adduced in opposition to my theory.                    He
 states that mere contact without pressure            is sufficient to produce the
 union of two pieces of moist ice *          ;   and then states, as follows, his
 experiment by which he supposes that this is proved                : — "Two     slabs
   * " On some Properties of Ice near its Melting-Point,"        by Prof. Forbes, Pro
 ceedings Royal Soc. Edin., April 1858.

                                       159
of ice, having their corresponding      surfaces   ground tolerably flat, were
suspended in an inhabited       room upon a horizontal glass rod passing
through two holes in the plates of       ice, so that the plane    of  the plates
was vertical.    Contact   of the even surfaces was obtained by means of
two very weak pieces of watch spring.             In an hour and a half the
cohesion was so complete, that, when violently broken in pieces, many
portions of the plates (which had        each   a surface   of twenty or more
square inches) continued united.         In fact it appeared as complete as
in another experiment where similar surfaces were pressed together
by weights."       He concludes that      the effect  of pressure in assisting
'
   regelation' is principally or solely due to the larger surfaces of con
tact obtained by the moulding of the surfaces to one another.
     I have myself repeated     this experiment, and have found the re
sults just described to be fully verified.      It was not even necessary to
apply the weak pieces of watch-spring, as I found that the pieces of
ice, on being merely suspended on the glass rod in contact, would
unite themselves strongly in a few hours. Now this fact I explain by
the capillary forces of the film of interposed water as follows:      — Firstly,
the film   of water between the two    slabs — being held up against gravity
by the capillary tension, or contractile force, of its free upper surface,
and being distended besides, against the atmospheric pressure, by the
 same contractile force of its free surface round its whole perimeter,
 except for a very small space at bottom, from which water trickles
 away, or is on the point of trickling away        — exists under     a pressure
 which, though     increasing from above downwards, is everywhere, ex
 cept at that little space at bottom, less than the atmospheric pres
 sure. Hence the two slabs are urged towards one another by the ex
 cess  of the external atmospheric pressure        above   the internal water
 pressure, and are thus pressed against one another at their places of
 contact by a force quite notable in its amount.          If, for instance, be
 tween the two slabs there be a film       of water of such   size and form as
  might be represented by a film one inch square, with its upper and
 lower edges horizontal, and with water trickling from its lower edge,
 it is easy to show that the slabs will be pressed together by a force
 equal to the weight of half a cubic inch of water. But so small a film
  as this would form itself even   if the  two surfaces of the ice were only
  very imperfectly fitted to one another.      If,  again, by better fitting, a
  film be produced of such size and form as may be represented              by  a

                                                   160
square film with its sides 4 inches each, the slabs                            will   be urged toge
ther by a force equal to the weight of half                         a   cube of water, of which
the side is 4 inches         ;   that   the weight of 32 cubic inches of water or
                                         is,
    •
            pound, which           very considerable force. Secondly, the film of
1   1   5                    is
                             a
water existing, as         it    does, under less than atmospheric pressure, has
its freezing-point raised           in   virtue of the reduced pressure               ;   and   it   would
therefore freeze even               at the temperature              of the surrounding                 ice,
namely the freezing-point                  for atmospheric              pressure.         Much       more
will     it   freeze in virtue  of the cold given out in the melting by pressure
of the         ice at   the points of contact, where, from the first two causes
named above, the two slabs are urged against one another.
        The freezing of      ice to flannel or to           a   worsted glove             on    a    warm
hand is,       I   consider, to be attributed               partly to capillary attraction
acting in similar ways to those just described                          ;   but in many of the ob
           of this phenomenon there will also be direct pressures from
served cases
the hand, or from the weight of the ice, or from other like causes,
which will increase              the rapidity        of the moulding of the                 ice to the
fibres of the wool.

   The President then    addressed  the Society as follows  : —
      Gentlemen,
In   an address lately delivered at a Meeting       of the Society for the
 Promotion of Social Science,    a noble Lord,   a Fellow of this Society,

                                       162
called the attention of his hearers to the advantages                       which    the
world in general       had derived from the cultivation                of the physical
sciences.      No  one indeed    can be better qualified to give an opinion
on this subject than the distinguished           individual          to whom     I  have
alluded.      His first communication to the Royal Society was in the
                                                                                        '
year   1 796, and was published in the ' Philosophical                  Transactions
for that year.     From that time to the present day he has, without any
intermission, laboured for the advancement of all kinds of knowledge,
and so he still continues to labour with all the determination and
energy     and intellectual    vigour of youth       ;   and      I  may confidently
affirm that little has been done worthy of note during this interval
of sixty-four    years which     has escaped    his acute observation.              The
influence, however, which the physical           sciences have had in adding
to the conveniences       and comforts, and advancing the material pros
perity of mankind        is too obvious to escape the notice of                a   much
less close    observer than Lord Brougham.                If   our houses and our
cities are better and more economically lighted              ;  if our    population is
better and more cheaply clothed        ;  if our  fields are more productive            ;
if we  travel by steam and communicate with those who are hundreds
of miles distant from       us by the telegraph     ;   if a   brighter light shines
in our light-houses to guide the mariner at night               ;   these and a thou
sand   of things besides are but the result of the application by prac
tical men, of the discoveries made in the physical sciences, to prac
tical purposes. To the same cause may be attributed much of the
political greatness of the British nation.           The British flag floats in
every sea ; our colonies are      established in every region of the earth ;
we contemplate in them with a reasonable               pride the germs of future
nations, which,      when our fortune may possibly be changed, will
speak    the same language with ourselves,             inheriting       our literature,
our political institutions, and not only our religion but our religious
freedom,     inheriting   also our knowledge, and adding knowledge to
it ; but none of this could have been,         if  it    were not that the astro
nomer had instructed the sailor how, with nothing but the heavens
above him and the waters         on every side, he may find his exact posi
tion on the surface of the globe.
    But it would      be a grave mistake to suppose              that such as those
which    I  have now enumerated are the only advantages                    which have
been derived from the cultivation      of  the physical sciences.             To know

                                             163
their full extent, we must take into the account not only the direct
but also the indirect           results to which it has led           ;   and   I    trust that         I
may be excused          if,   on the occasion of the present anniversary,                  I       oc
cupy some portion of your time, not by an elaborate discussion of
the subject, but by offering to you some suggestions as to the other
ways in which inquiries such as those in which you are yourselves
engaged have already affected, and may be expected                              still more to
affect hereafter, the habits, the modes                of thought, the fortunes and
moral condition of mankind.
     It   is   not our business to depreciate         that form of civilization which
existed in times long since past, and especially of that remarkable
people who during some centuries before and after the Christian                                   aera
were       distinguished      for their still unrivalled        excellence          in art, their
noble literature,        when Aristotle sat at the feet of his master Plato,
when students          in of intellectual improvement from all parts
                            search
of Greece resorted to the Lyceum of Athens, when from opposite
quarters of the Mediterranean Sea the Greek colonies of Alexandria
and       Syracuse supplied       a    list of mathematicians and               poet3 to add
lustre to their parent state.              Neither let      us forget what we owe to
                                                                                         by by
another people, whose civilization               is   to be measured,            not             their
wealth and luxury, their ambition and their conquests, but                                       those
monuments of art which still draw visitors to Rome, their historians,
moral philosophers, and poets.                  But, great      as are the obligations
which we owe to these nations of antiquity,                    it   cannot be denied that
the civilization        which exists among us at the present                        time    is    of   a
higher order than that which existed formerly                   :    and   it   is   not difficult
to show that
                    it
                    is      to the greater extension of        a    knowledge of natural
phenomena, and the laws which govern them, that this improvement
is   mainly to be attributed.
     Knowledge and wisdom are indeed not identical; and every man's
experience must have taught him that there may be much know
ledgewith little wisdom, and much wisdom with little knowledge.
But with imperfect knowledge     difficult or impossible to arrive
                                           it   is
at   right conclusions.              Many of the      vices,   many of the miseries,
many       of the follies and absurdities by which human society                        has been
infested and disgraced may be traced to               a   want of knowledge.                It    was
from      a    want of knowledge that Roger Bacon was persecuted by the
Franciscan monks, and Galileo by the Inquisition                     ;    that Servctus was
     vol. x.                                                                     N

                                               164
 hurned by Calvin          ;  while others would have burned Calvin in his
 turn   if they had had the opportunity of doing                    so.    So it was that
 juries   were    found to convict and judges to condemn poor igno
 rant women        as witches     ;   that within the last two centuries well-
 educated     men     believed      that they might read their              destiny in the
 stars  ;  and that as lately as the year 1638, on the occasion of the
  birth   of Louis      XIV.,       Richelieu       compelled the dungeons of the
 Inquisition     to give up the astrologer Campanella, in order that he
 might cast the horoscope of the future king                     ;  and    so  it is that  at
 the present day grown-up ladies and gentlemen occupy themselves
 with the humbler and less romantic mysteries of turning and rapping
 tables.     Cooperating with          a    purer religious faith, the advancement
 of knowledge        has     humanized        our institutions.         It   has   banished
 slavery   ; it has caused our laws to be more merciful, and the ad
 ministration     of them      more     just   ;  it has promoted religious and po
 litical freedom,     and,     with one or two miserable exceptions, it has
 rendered even despotic governments more attentive to the claims and
 wishes of their        subjects.          If   sanitary  and other         improvements
 (these being the results of greater knowledge) have added to the
 average length of human life, be it observed that this fact includes
 another fact, namely, that they have added to human happiness                         ; for
 true it is that the causes which tend to the shortening of life are,
with few exceptions, such             as   produce either physical pain or moral
 suffering.
     The investigation of the physical sciences is especially favourable
to   the training of some of the more important faculties of the mind,
so that we may well anticipate                 much ultimate advantage            from the
movement which            is   already begun, having for             its object, not      to
supersede      the study        of ancient languages and ancient literature
 (which at the present time, in addition to mathematics, are supposed
to form the staple of a first-rate education), but to add an elementary
knowledge of the principal               physical sciences       to the list.       The in
cluding of some of these at least in the instruction of early life will
operate beneficially in various ways.                  The first   step in all physical
investigations, even in those which admit of the application of mathe
matical reasoning and the deductive method afterwards, is the obser
vation of natural phenomena              ;   and the smallest error in such obser
vation in the beginning is sufficient to vitiate the whole investigation

                                            165
afterwards.        The  necessity     of strict and minute observation, then, is
 the first thing which the student of the physical sciences has to learn             ;
and it is     easy   to   see   with what great advantage          the habit thus
acquired may be carried into everything else afterwards. Slovenly
habits of observation are indeed the source of a large proportion of
the    evils which     mankind       bring   upon themselves     — of blunders in
private life by which an individual causes the ruin of himself and his
wife and children, of blunders in statesmanship which bring cala
mities on nations. It is to these, moreover, that impostors and
fanatics of all kinds        and in all ages have         been indebted for their
influence and      success.
    It  would  be easy to show how in various other ways                the study  of
the physical sciences cannot fail               to  be a useful training      for the
mind.       Very much indeed might              be said on   this subject   ;  but to
enter fully into it would not only occupy too much of your time,
but would involve        us   in   a metaphysical      discussion unsuited to the
present occasion.         There are, nevertheless,        two or three     points to
 which   I  shall venture, however briefly, to allude.
    Investigations     of this kind, more than almost any other, impress
 the mind with the necessity of looking carefully at both sides of a
 question, and strictly comparing the evidence              on one side with that
 on the other    ;  and in this manner they help to correct and improve
 the judgment.        As in     every   such investigation classification is an
 important    and indeed       a necessary     element,   another effect is that of
 promoting and strengthening the best kind of memory — a memory
 founded on some actual relation of objects to each other, and not
 on mere apparent resemblance             and juxtaposition.      Lastly, physical
 investigations more than anything besides help to teach us the actual
 value and the right use of the imagination,           — of that wondrous faculty
 which, left to ramble uncontrolled, leads us astray into           a  wilderness of
 perplexities and errors,        a  land of mists and shadows         ;  but which,
 properly restrained by experience          and reflection, becomes the noblest
 attribute of man — the        source    of the poetic genius, the instrument
 of discovery in    science,   without the aid of which Newton would never
 have invented fluxions, nor Davy have              decomposed the earths and
 alkalies, nor would Columbus have found another continent bevond
 the  Atlantic Ocean.
    In the pursuit of the physical           sciences,  the imagination     supplies

                                                 166
the hypothesis which bridges over the gulf that separates the known
from the unknown.                   It   may   be only a phantom       it may prove to
                                                                          ;
be a reality.         But       as these sciences      relate to matters of fact which,
if not   directly, may be made indirectly                     cognizable by the external
senses, they afford us peculiar facilities, far beyond what exist                          in other
departments of knowledge, of testing the accuracy of the views which
the imagination             has suggested,        so that we may at once determine
when it has been too excursive, and,                 if it   has been so, call it back to its
right place.          There may be instances of mere accidental discovery ;
but, setting these aside,                 the great advances         made in the inductive
sciences are, for the most part, preceded                     by a more or less probable
                     The imagination, having some small light to guide                              it,
hypothesis.
goes     first.      Further observation, experiment, and reason follow.
Thus, for example,       had been long suspected that there
                                   it                           some                       is
sort of relation between electricity and magnetism.   Much thinking
on the subject had strengthened this suspicion   the mind of Oersted.in
Still   it   was    but     a     hypothesis,   and might even now have been re
garded       by    many as no better than              a   dream,    ifit     had not been that
in the year         1820        the Danish philosopher            devised      the experiments
which demonstrated the law of reciprocity between an electric current
and the magnet, and the identity of the two forces.                                As   an instance
of   an opposite kind,          I    may refer to the doctrine of phlogiston as pro
pounded by Stahl.                  While the art of chemical experiment                   was im
perfectly understood, that doctrine was very generally received                                     as
affording     a    true explanation of the phenomena of combustion.                               But
no sooner had Lavoisier and his friends introduced                             a   more accurate
mode      of experiment by weight and                     measure,    than    it   was proved to
have no foundation in reality, and consigned to the same place                                  in the
history of science with epicycles and vortices and animal spirits.
     But the       effect kind of instruction in the physical sciences
                             of   some
being recognized as an essential part of     liberal education, may be
                                                              a
contemplated under another point of view. Except in the case of

knowledge of them may not be turned to                          a   good account.          Is    there
any country gentleman or farmer who might                              not derive advantage
from knowing                something of vegetable            physiology        and chemistry?

gardener    ? — is there    any   county magistrate, or mayor, or alderman
of a borough, to whom it would not              be useful to know something             of
the principles on which what are called sanitary measures                    are to be
conducted      ? — and  is there anyone in any situation in life to whom it
would not be a benefit to know something of animal physiology, of
the functions of his own body, and of the influence which his bodily
condition exercises over those moral and intellectual faculties by which
he is distinguished       from the rest of the animal creation         ?  If it did not
teach him how to cure disease,            it might    be useful for him to know
how far disease may cure itself, and what are the limits of Nature
in this respect    ?   To   man, looking      at him as an individual,         there is
no art so important        as that   of understanding       and managing himself,
— an art     so simply and       well expressed     by the two significant words
TuSdi aeavToy, which were inscribed over the heathen oracle of Delphi.
To correct bad habits when             once acquired is no very easy task            ;   a
strong sense and a strong will, such as only                  a  limited number of
persons possess, are necessary           for that purpose.         But it would        go
far towards preventing           the acquirement of such habits,             if  young
persons, during the period of their education, were made to understand
the  ill  consequences       to which     they must inevitably lead, and how,
eventually, the body must suffer and the mind be stupefied                          and
degraded, not by the reasonable            indulgence, but by the abuse of the
animal instincts.
   In the Introduction         to his ' Inquiry into the Human Understand
ing,' David Hume, having referred to the remarkable progress which
had been lately made in a knowledge             of astronomy and other physical
sciences,    has suggested      that " the   same method of inquiry, which has
been applied      with  so great advantage       in these sciences, might also be
applied with advantage          to those other sciences which         have for their
object the mental power and economy."                     I  call your attention to
this remark, because it brings me to the consideration of another
subject,    namely, the influence which the pursuit of the physical
sciences,     conducted as it has been more or less since the days of
Galileo    and Kepler, has exercised over other studies, and in the
advancement of other kinds of knowledge.                  It needs no argument to
prove,    for it must be sufficiently           plain   to   everyone,     that   other
sciences as well as the physical          have at the present       time a very     dif
ferent character from that which they had formerly.                 It   was probably

                                             168
 from the operation of various causes (a principal one, however, being
 the too exclusive and undue importance attached to the Aristotelian
logic in the schools), that some                centuries had elapsed      since the
revival of learning before the inductive method (which, by the way,
is nothing more than the logic which we all make use of instinctively
 in the ordinary concerns           of life) became   generally applied to the in
 vestigation of the phenomena and laws of the material universe.                 But
 a  still further time      elapsed, even after the publication    of Lord Bacon's
views on the subject, before other sciences began               to partake of this
 movement        ;   and when they did so, it seems not possible to doubt
 that it was the result of the impulse which the rapid growth of the
 physical sciences had communicated to them.
    That such          was  the opinion of David Hume as to the influence
 thus exercised          on one class     of inquiries in which he      was  himself
 engaged,      I   have already shown.         But long before Hume wrote, the
same     impression had existed on the mind of Locke, as will be suffi
ciently obvious to anyone on reading the Introductory Chapter                      of
his 'Essay on the Human                   Understanding.'     In fact Locke had
originally directed his attention to Natural Philosophy and Medicine                ;
and his researches in Moral and Intellectual Philosophy were engrafted
on his earlier studies.           So in the case of Dr. Berkeley   : his treatise on
 ' Vision ' contains the essential                                                    '
                                           part of those doctrines which he after-
                                 '
wards published in his             Treatise on the Principles of Human Know
           '
ledge    ;   and   it is easy to see how, step by step, these gradually arose out
of his former studies of Natural Philosophy. I make no reference to
the modern German school of metaphysicians, and indeed am quite
incompetent to do so.              Neither do   I refer to another order of meta
physicians,         one   of whom informs       us how ideas    and  emotions and
volitions are produced by big and little vibrations of the molecules of
the nervous system           ; while another undertakes to explain      " the action
of material        ideas   in the mechanical machines of the brain."             But
with      regard      to   the   more     eminent of     our  English writers     on
these      subjects,      and what     has   been   called the Scotch     school   of
metaphysicians, including             Reid, Adam Smith, Dugald         Stewart, and
 Brown, it may be truly asserted that the advantage               which they have
had over the dreamy metaphysicians of former times is to be attributed
to their having in their mode of inquiry followed the example which
 had been set them in the study of the physical sciences.

                                              1G9
    I must not exhaust your patience by going on to explore so wide
a field as that on which           I  have   just  entered.    The subject is    one to
which justice cannot be done without a much more ample discussion
than would be convenient on an occasion like the present.                      All that
I  shall say     besides     may be comprised in            a very few     words.     In
                    '          '
composing his          Essays      on what is now called      Political Economy,      we
may presume that David Hume's mind was influenced by the same
considerations as when he composed those other Essays to which
I  have alluded      ; and it is not too much to say that these researches
of Hume's may          be regarded as having, more than anything besides,
contributed     co  lay the foundation of that vast science which has been
since developed through the labours of Adam Smith and Horner,
and of others who are still alive among us.
    At the  same time, in giving this credit to Hume, we must not over
look what    is due to one     of our own body, and         an original Fellow    of the
Royal Society.          Sir William Petty contributed           several papers to the
'                                         In                   of his life he had been
  Philosophical Transactions.'                 an early part
engaged   in giving lectures on Anatomy and on Chemistry at Oxford                      ;
and his mind having been thus prepared he entered                          on the con
sideration   of other subjects, such            as taxation and trade as affecting
the material prosperity of nations, and social statistics.              His 'Discourse
                                 '
on Political Arithmetic             seems    to have been the last result of his
labours, it having been first published after his death,                    by his soil,
Lord Shelburne.           In his Preface       to this Discourse he thus expresses
himself (and     I   quote the passage because it will serve to show how in
these later investigations his mind was influenced by those in which
he had been previously engaged)              : — " The method     I  take to do this is
not very usual     :   for, instead of using only comparative and superla
tive words, and intellectual arguments,               I have taken the course      (as a
specimen   of the political arithmetic I have long aimed at) to express
myself in terms of number, weight, or measure ; to use only arguments
of sense, and to consider only such causes as have visible foundations
in Nature."
   It would be easy to adduce from other sciences analogous illustra
tions of the proposition which             I   have ventured to advance.          Com
pare the natural theology of Derham, Paley, and the Bridgewater
Treatises, all founded on the observation of natural phenomena,                    with
the speculations       of the ancient philosophers, or with           the abstractions

                                       170
and a    priori arguments of Dr. Samuel Clarke.             Compare the un
ravelling    of early history    by   Niebuhr and Arnold with anything
regarding history that had been done before, or the best practical
treatises   on politics and government of modern times with the elabo
rate but fantastic scheme      of Plato's republic.
    If I  have made too large a demand on your patience by dwelling on
matters which have no special or exclusive relation to our body, you
will,  I hope, accept it  as a sufficient apology that   I have   done so under
the impression that whatever relates to the advancement of knowledge
generally cannot be altogether uninteresting           to those who are the
living representatives of the great men by whom the Royal Society
was founded, and who themselves           now constitute the most ancient
scientific institution in the world.
   Looking    at what more particularly      concerns ourselves,    I   may con
gratulate you on the results obtained during the last year.                In the
volume of    the ' Philosophical   Transactions' which is now in the course
of publication,    we find that there is scarcely any department          of phy
sical knowledge which is not honourably represented             ;  at the same
time that, besides the abstracts of the principal papers, many inves
tigations which have not been deemed to be of sufficient importance, or
sufficiently original to have a place in our annual volume, but which
nevertheless    are  of considerable interest,   are recorded and published
from time to time in the smaller volume bearing the title of 'The Royal
Society's Proceedings.'      By  means   of this less pretentious publication
many facts,     many thoughts and suggestions are preserved,                which
might otherwise have been neglected or lost, but which, being thus pre
served, may prove to be     of much value hereafter. Our weekly         meetings
have    been well attended, and have been rendered more attractive by
a  practice which is not altogether new,         but which has been          more
generally adopted than heretofore during the last Session             ;  I  allude
to that of the authors of papers communicated to us giving an oral or
vivdvoce explanation of their contents,     — those explanations being ren
dered more intelligible by a reference      to diagrams, or to the apparatus
used for experiments, and even by experiments actually                displayed.
Such illustrations are useful both to the authors and to others, by
causing the subject-matter        of the    several   communications        to be
better understood      ; and they are useful in another way, inasmuch as
they lead to conversations      and discussions, and to the interchange          of

                                                   171
opinion    at the time, from which we may all                  of   us derive something
to think of, and reflect on afterwards.
    Having occupied so much of your time already, I do not feel jus
tified in making a further demand on it by entering into a recapitu
lation of what        has been        done       in the way of scientific            discovery
during the last year.             There    is,     however, one subject to which       I   am
led to advert because         it
                              is      of more than usual interest, not only on
account    of   its connexion with             scientific investigations,      but also on
other grounds.
     After an interval of         two years, Captain         M'Clintock and        those who
were associated with him have returned in safety from their voyage                          of
discovery, and their investigations in the Arctic regions.                      The result
has been that, although our most earnest wishes have not been realized,
it   cannot be said that our more reasonable                   expectations have been
disappointed.         There seemed to be no more than                 a   small probability
that any of those who accompanied Sir                         John Franklin when he
quitted his native country in the year 1845 should be still alive in
the dreary and inhospitable regions                   in which, after the     loss    of their
vessels,   they had been imprisoned.                      Captain   M'Clintock's careful
inquiries have fully dissipated whatever faint hopes might have been
entertained of its being otherwise, leaving us only the poor consolation
of knowing that the sufferings of these gallant spirits are at an end.
  As scientific discoverers, Captain M'Clintock and his officers have
well fulfilled their mission, as proved by the magnetic observations
                                          is
which Captain M'Clintock has already communicated to the Royal
Society, and of which General Sabine, with his usual perspicuity,
gave us some account at one             of our evening meetings.
     In speaking of       those   engaged in the late expedition,         I   am     unwilling
to pass over in silence           the name         of Mr. Young, who, having         been the
commander of          a   merchant-ship,           took so much interest in the pro
jected enterprise that he not only contributed ^6500 towards defraying
the expenses     of   it,   but volunteered his personal services on the occa
sion, by acting as master            of the        vessel.   Nor ought     I   to omit      to
notice the name             of Dr. Walker, who, being               engaged    as surgeon,
acted also as naturalist to the expedition, and availed himself                       of such
scanty opportunities as those ice-bound countries afford of extending
his researches        in natural       history.          Of the results which          he has
been able to obtain       I   am not      in   a   condition to give you an account at

                                            172
 present    ;   but they will,    I doubt not, in due time be communicated
 to the public.
      The   greatest     honour which       the Royal Society has to bestow,
 namely the Copley Medal, has been awarded to Professor Wilhelm
 Eduard Weber of Gottingen, foreign member of the Royal Society,
                                                       '                          '
 for his investigations         contained in his          Maasbestimmungen            and
 other researches in electricity, magnetism, acoustics,               &c.
                                                                                   '
     The first work in which Professor Weber                  was engaged    was     The
 Theory of Undulations,'           published in conjunction with his brother
 Ernest in 1825.          This work     is still one   of standard authority.          It
 contains not only       a complete account of all that was previously known
 on the subject of waves in water, but is the repository of many original
 and important         experiments throwing         light on this subject.           The
 volume      contains also      many valuable investigations            in   acoustics.
 Subsequently to this, Professor Weber communicated to PoggendorfFs
 'Annalen' numerous memoirs containing his further observations in
 acoustics,     among which were his experiments on the longitudinal
vibration of rods and strings            ; on reed organ-pipes      ;  on grave har
 monic sounds      ; and also his method of determining the specific heat of
bodies by their sonorous vibrations.              In this department of physical
 science he has been a worthy coadjutor             of Chladni and Savart.
     In association with his brother Edward, then Anatomical Prosector
in Leipsic,     he in 1835 published the details         of  an anatomical, physical,
and mathematical investigation of the mechanism of the human organs
of locomotion,       one result    of which   was the promulgation        of  a theory
of animal progression more nearly in              accordance     with observed facts
than any that had been proposed previously.
    On his     association   with M. Gauss in the Magnetic Observatory at
Gottingen, Professor Weber devoted himself almost exclusively to the
subject of magnetism and electricity.                 The annual volumes of the
' Results     of the Observations of the Magnetic Union,' published by
these    eminent philosophers          between     1838     and 1843,    contain the
description of several new instruments, some of which have been the
models of those which are now used in all observatories. They include
also a great variety       of important original     researches.
    It ought not to be omitted that the researches of Gauss and Weber
with reference       to the    transmission of electric signals did more to

                                            173
excite    attention     to   the   practicability of an electric telegraph than
anything that had been done previously.
  In     1846 Professor Weber published a memoir on
                                                                         " The Measures
of Electro-dynamic Forces " (" Electrodynamische Maasbestimmun-
gen "), a work not less remarkable for the original mathematical than
for the experimental researches embodied in it. A high authority
has pronounced this to be " one of the most important works both
with regard to mathematical theory, and the practical application
of it, that has been published in this department of science since the
researches of Ampere
                        " and the same                           " His
                              ;           authority has added,
transformation       of Ampere's law of electric action,                so as to exhibit
the analyses of the plus and minus elements in each stream, and
his deduction thence of the law of statical from that of dynamical
action, seems to me, both as            a   specimen      of mathematical analysis
and of physical philosophy, exceedingly beautiful."
  More recently Professor               Weber     has    produced        two additional
memoirs on the same subject, one of which contains                       a   mathematical
and experimental investigation of the phenomena of dia-magnetism
discovered     by   Faraday.
       Professor Miller,
  AsI     have not the opportunity of presenting                  it   to him in his own
person,  I   request     of you,    as Foreign Secretary, to cause the Copley
Medal which    I     now place in your hands to be conveyed to Professor
Weber, with     a      request     that he will be pleased to accept            it   as the
indication of the very high estimation in which his scientific labours
are held by the        Royal Society of London.
  One of the Royal Medals has been awarded to Arthur Cayley,
Esq., F.R.S.,          for   his    Mathematical        Papers     published      in   the
Philosophical       Transactions,      and in various English                and Foreign
Journals.
  From the first institution of the Royal Society                  a    large proportion
of the papers communicated to them have related to Pure Mathe
matics   ;   and none have         contributed    more than these            to maintain
the credit of the Philosophical          Transactions.           Among writers of the
present time, no one has been               a   more    earnest    or more successful
labourer in this department of science than                Mr. Cayley.         His nume
rous papers on these subjects bear testimony to his unwearied indus

                                              174
try   ;   and the undivided           opinion    as to their value and importance
held by those who are best qualified to judge of them, sufficiently
establishes Mr. Cayley's claim to be regarded as one of the most
eminent and profound mathematicians of the age in which we live.
    Mr. Cayley       is among the foremost           of  those who are successfully
developing what may be called the organic part of algebra into a
new branch        of  science, as much above ordinary algebra in generality
as   ordinary algebra is itself above arithmetic.                  The  effect is a vast
augmentation of our power over the comparison and transformation
of algebraical forms, and greatly              increased   facility of geometrical in
terpretation.
   To      give any    full account of Mr. Cayley's labours would be im
possible, from mere want of space ; and such account, were it given,
would be intelligible to none but the highest order of mathemati
cians ; moreover,         you are well aware,         it could not     come    from my
own knowledge of the subject.                  I  have, however, considered       it my
duty to lay something before                you, in the most general terms             of
description,       about     these     very remarkable        papers,   obtained from
those who are competent to describe                 them.
    Mr. Cayley's memoirs relate almost exclusively to pure mathe
matics      ; and a considerable proportion          of them belong to the subject
Qualities, defined by him to denote               the entire subject of rational and
integral functions, and of the equations and loci to which these give
rise    ; in particular the memoirs upon linear transformations and co-
variants, and many of the memoirs upon geometrical subjects, belong
to this head.           Among        the memoirs upon other subjects may be
mentioned        Mr. Cayley's earliest memoir (1841) in the Cambridge
Mathematical Journal, " On a Theorem in the Geometry of Position,"
which contains the solution in a compendious form, by means of a
determinant, of Carnot's problem of the relation between the distances
of  five points in space       ;   the memoir in the same Journal,            " On   the
Properties of a certain Symbolical Expression,"                  which is the first of a
series of memoirs upon the attraction of ellipsoids, and the multiple
integrals       connected therewith         ;   a memoir in       Liouville's Journal,
which contains the extension of the theory of Laplace's functions to
any number of variables            ;  and the memoirs in the same two Journals,
on the inverse        elliptic   integrals or doubly periodic functions.            The
earliest of the memoirs upon linear transformations was published

                                          175
(1845 and 1846) in the Cambridge and the Cambridge and Dublin
Mathematical Journals, and under a different title in ' Crelle.'              The
antecedent state of the problem was as follows            : — The theory of the
linear transformations of binary and ternary quadratic functions had
been established by Gauss, the same being in fact the foundation of
his researches upon quadratic forms, as developed in the ' Recherches
                    '
Arithmetiques     ;    and that of the linear transformations of quadratic
functions   of any number of variables had          been considered by     Jacobi
and others.       A   very important       step was made     by Mr. Boole, who
showed that the fundamental property of the determinant (or, as it is
now commonly called, discriminant)             of a quadratic form applied to
the resultant (discriminant)        of  a  form of any degree and number of
variables, — the property in question being, in fact, that of remaining
unaltered to    a factor pres, when the coefficients      are altered  by a linear
transformation of the variables,         or as it may for shortness be called,
the property     of invariancy    :  the theorem just referred to, suggested
to  Mr. Cayley the       researches   which led him to the discovery of           a
class  of functions (including as a particular case the discriminant),
all of them possessed of the same characteristic property.                  These
functions, called at first hyperdeterminants, are now called invariants           ;
they are included       in the more general class of functions called co-
variants, the difference        being that these      contain as well the va
riables as the coefficients      of the given form or forms.          The theory
has an extensive       application    to geometry, and in particular to the
theory of the singularities of curves and surfaces.              This theory for
plane curves was first established (1834) by          Pluckerupon geometrical
principles  ;  the analytical theory for plane curves is the subject of a
memoir by     Mr. Cayley in ' Crelle,' and of his     recent memoir in the    Phi
losophical Transactions,
                              " On   the Double Tangents of a     Plane Curve,"
based upon a Note by         Mr. Salmon.        The corresponding geometrical
theory for curves of double curvature and developable surfaces, was
first established in    Mr. Cayley's memoir       on this subject in ' Liouville'
          '
and the Cambridge and Dublin Mathematical Journal.'                   The theory
for surfaces in general, is mainly due to Mr. Salmon.                Among    Mr.
Cayley's other memoirs upon geometrical subjects, may be mentioned
several papers on the Porism           of the in-and-circumscribed      polygon,
and on the corresponding theory in solido ; a memoir on the twenty-
 seven right lines upon a surface of the third order, and the memoir

                                            176
 in the Philosophical        Transactions,    "On    Curves of the Third Order."

  (forming a series not as yet completed) comprise a reproduction of
 the theory of covariants,           and exhibit the author's         views on the
 general subject.         Mr. Cayley has written           also   a  Report on the
 recent progress of theoretical Dynamics, published in the                  '
                                                                              Reports
 of   the British Association' for 1857.
        Mr. Cayley,
     In the    name     of the Royal Society of London, I request your
 acceptance     of this Royal Medal, in testimony of the strong sense
 which     they entertain        of the value of your labours, and of the
 satisfaction which       it affords them that       so eminent a mathematician
 as yourself    should be included in the list of their Fellows.
     The other Royal Medal             has  been   awarded to     Mr. George Ben-
 tham, F.L.S., for his important contributions              to the advancement of
 Systematic and Descriptive Botany.
     The remarkable accuracy which distinguishes all Mr. Bentham's
 scientific   researches,      the logical     precision   that   characterizes his
writings, and the sound generalizations which his systematic works ex
hibit may     be in a great measure traced to the influence            of his uncle,
the late celebrated         legal theorist Jeremy        Bentham,     who directed
much of his early studies, and under whose                  auspices   he published
                                     '
one     of his earliest works,          Outlines  of   a New System       of Logic'
His mind     was further imbued in youth with a love           of Natural History,
and     especially Botany      ; and this taste was cultivated and nourished
by a study of the works of the elder DeCandolle.
    Fortunately    for the cause of Botany in England,            Mr. Bentham    has
devoted himself almost exclusively to that science;               and to his excel
lent powers of observation, close reasoning,              concise   writing, and in
defatigable perseverance          our country owes the distinction of ranking
amongst its Naturalists          one so preeminent for his valuable labours
in Systematic Botany.
    Amongst     Mr. Bentham's numerous writings,              those  hold the first
rank which are devoted to the three great natural orders, Leguminosae,
Labiatae, and Scrophulariaceae. These orders demanded a vast amount
of analytic study     ;  for they are amongst the largest and most widely

                                         1T7
distributed of the vegetable        kingdom,       and had been thrown            into
great confusion by earlier writers.           They    have     been   the subject   of
many treatises       by Mr. Bentham,        and especially of two extensive
works,    the contents of which have lately been                   embodied in the
"  Systema Vegetabilium" of the DeCandolles.                     On their first ap
pearance these works secured for their author              a  European reputation,
and will always rank high as models of skilful classification.
    It would    occupy too much time to specify the very numerous
monographs       and papers which       Mr. Bentham          has communicated       to
various scientific societies and periodicals in this country and on the
Continent, and especially to the Linnean             Transactions       and Journal.
That " On the Principles of Generic Nomenclature " may                       be noted
as an example       of his power of treating         an apparently simple, but
really abstract and difficult subject in       a  manner at once philosophical
and practical.      Mr. Bentham's        most    recent    work, that on British
Plants, is the first, on the indigenous Flora of our Islands, in which
every species     has been carefully      analysed and described from spe
cimens procured       from all parts of the globe        ;   it is distinguished for
its scientific accuracy, advanced general views, and extreme simplicity,
— a combination of qualities which         can result only from an extensive
series  of  exact observations,    judiciously arranged and logically              ex
pressed.
       Mr.   Bentham,
                                     '                                     '
   The early volumes of the            Philosophical       Transactions       contain
numerous papers relating to Botany and the other sciences                       which
are usually comprehended under the general                designation of Natural
History.      As  these sciences, but especially Botany, became more and
more extended,       it was thought      desirable that another Institution
should be called into existence,         which might share with the Royal
Society the privilege of promoting           the cultivation       of them,    and  of
communicating to the world from time to time the progress which
has been made in this department           of knowledge        :  and such was the
origin of the Linnean Society in the year           1 788.       The Royal Society,
however,    does not on that account feel the less interest in this class
of scientific investigations.     It   is accordingly with great satisfaction
that the Council have awarded to you one              of the Royal Medals, and
that, in the name       of the Society,    I   now place it in your hands, in

                                    178
testimony of their high appreciation of your researches,       and of the
respect which    they have for you as a fellow-labourer     iu the field of
science.
   On the motion of Mr. Faraday, seconded by Sir Henry Holland,
the best thanks of the Society were voted to the President for his
excellent address,   and he was requested     to permit the same to be

   The apparatus        used in the following experiments, was described in
my Paper      ;   but in the present instance, only two of the cells were
employed, viz. that exposed to ordinary white light,                   and that from
which all light is excluded.              In order more effectually to prevent
the possible admission of light, the following precautions were adopted
with the dark cell        : — 1. The     perforated zinc floor was covered with
thick   brown paper.          2.  The under     surface  of the lid   was lined   with
black cloth,        to secure      accurate    adjustment when shut.           3. The
opaque black glass was covered             with an additional      coat  of black oil-
paint.     4.   The lid   was    never   opened    in any light except that of a
candle or of gas.
   March 20th,        1859.  — A number of        ova  of the Silkworm (Bombyx
mori), all of the same age, were            placed in each of the two cells. No
change was observed          until May 18th (sixty days after the commence
ment of the experiments), when one larva emerged from the ovum
in each cell    ;  and during twelve days,         larvae continued to emerge in
the light and in the dark at the same rate.
   June 9th. — Sixteen          larvae, as nearly as possible       of the  same size,
were selected in each cell, and the rest removed.                   The experiments
then proceeded         with    these   thirty-two    individuals,     and   no   death
occurred from first to last.

    From this it is seen that the mean period occupied by the meta
 morphosis in the darkened cell was eighteen days fifteen hours, and
 in the light cell seventeen days sixteen hours.
    The longest and shortest periods in the darkened cell twenty-two
 days and seventeen days,             in the light cell nineteen days and seven
 teen days.
    June 9th. — On         selection     of    sixteen      of the largest      larvae from the
 inhabitants of each cell, it was noted that, when sixteen were selected
 from the darkened cell and several                        of similar size       removed,       only
 four could be found as large in the white cell, the remaining twelve
selected were therefore           of   a   rather smaller size.             This difference in
the   two cells became           less obvious afterwards, but, throughout                         the
experiments, there was              a   slight difference of size in favour of the
darkened cell.
    With    these exceptions, no difference could be detected                         between the
results obtained in the cell from which light was completely excluded
and   in that   exposed       to its   full influence.
    The    larvae, the silk produced,              and the moths from the two cells,

                                          18H
 when     placed side     by    side,  could   not   be distinguished      from one
 another.
     The   ova were   of the same colour when first deposited, and under
 went the same changes of appearance,              at the same time, in the dark
 and in the light.
     So far, therefore, as the direct agency         of light is concerned in the
 development,      growth, nutrition, and coloration of animals, the results
 of   these experiments closely correspond with those already recorded
 in my Paper.
 IV. " On       the Effects      produced    in Human Blood- corpuscles             by
         Sherry Wine, &c."            By William Addison, Esq., F.R.S.,
         Fellow of the Royal College            of Physicians, Loudon.            Re
         ceived September         10, 1859.
                                      (Abstract.)
     The author has found that when             a small drop of fresh blood is
placed beside a similar drop of sherry wine on                 a  slip of glass, and
viewed with the microscope, after being covered as usual with a                   thin
piece    of  glass, certain changes     are seen to take     place in the blood as
it mingles with the wine, which are thus described               : —
     " In   those  parts where the wine is mingling with the blood — at
the outer edges of the mass — various altered corpuscles will be seen.
They float in the fluid, separated from each other, having now no
longer any disposition          to adhere   together in rolls.        Their outlines
are altered,     and sundry markings appear in their interior.               After   a
short time — perhaps        ten minutes, sometimes        sooner  — numerous cor
puscles    will be observed       throwing    out  matter from their interior        ;
two, five, or ten molecular spots fringing their circumference.                 Some
of  these molecules      grow larger and seem coloured ; others of them
elongate into tails     or   filaments, which frequently attain to an extra
ordinary      length, and      wave   about in    a   very remarkable       manner.
They all terminate,       at the extremity farthest from the corpuscle, in
a  round globular enlargement.          A single corpuscle may very frequently
be seen    with five or six of these tails.
    " During the observation of          these    phenomena, numerous mole
cular particles are seen continually passing from the corpuscles              ;  they

                                          187
 float about in, and disturb the transparency of the fluid             : moreover,
 they have an extremely vivid movement.
    " At the expiration of half        an hour, many      of the tails or filaments
are seen assuming the form of           a  necklace of beads      ; and those also,
 separating from the corpuscles, float about with a singular indepen
 dent movement in the fluid."
    When blood is similarly          mingled with a fluid consisting of two
parts of sherry wine and one part of               a solution made with      a grain
and   a  half of common        salt and a grain    of bicarbonate of   soda to  half
a fluid ounce of water, the transparency of the fluid part of the blood
is not   altered,    " but the corpuscles      are changed in appearance,       and
the tails or filaments which are now seen issuing from them are gene
rally thicker and much more conspicuous than when the wine alone
is used.       The molecules which separate from the corpuscles are
larger, and the tails which break away from the corpuscles upon any
slight motion of       the  fluid, present various dumb-bell, necklace-like,
serpentine, globular, and other shapes."
    Under      particular   but    accidentally    produced    conditions    of the
mingled      fluids, the author has "repeatedly           seen the tails suddenly
retract, not into the interior of the corpuscle, but into a globular
 ball at its side             Sometimes the tail shortens to only half its
length, becoming in a corresponding              degree   thicker."    The tail in
thus shortening may become             bulged in the middle of its length, ex
hibiting at that part       a  globular or discoid enlargement.          This glo
bule or disc may then burst, and in such case the blood-corpuscle
finally exhibits only       a  small round particle remaining at the point
of its circumference from which           the tail had proceeded.
    After describing       in   detail various other appearances         which    he
noted in his experiments, and which, as well as those above men
tioned, are delineated in several drawings which illustrate the paper,
the author thus states his views           as to the nature of the phenomena
observed     : —
    " In  these experiments, a mixture          of a saline  solution and sherry
wine, or the wine alone, is added to           a drop of fresh blood.      The   ad
dition must change the properties of the fluid in which the corpuscles
naturally swim.         The   change in the fluid produces changes           in the
corpuscles, shown by their altered appearance,             their indisposition any
longer to adhere in rolls, and the various markings seen within them.

                                        188
 Some   time after these changes        the corpuscles discharge molecular
particles, and emit tails or filaments, which, separating from the
corpuscles,     materially    alter  the transparency    and aspect   of the
fluid.
    "The    first alteration of the fluid element       of the blood — that,
namely, produced by the addition of the extraneous fluid — causes no
visible troubling or change in it ; but the second alteration, which
consists in the appearance        of a great number   of molecular particles,
is visibly produced by the agency        of the corpuscles. The molecular
particles are seen coming out of the corpuscles, separating from them,
and disturbing the transparency of the fluid."
    In corroboration of his opinion that the filaments         and molecules
are emitted from the blood-corpuscles,         and not produced by a preci
pitation   or solidification     of coagulable matter in the plasma, the
author especially draws attention to the fact that, so far as he ob
served,   the molecules appear only in those parts of the fluid where
the corpuscles have been altered and are fringed with similar mole
cules, or emitting tails    ;  whilst in other parts, where such changes
are not occurring in the corpuscles, the fluid is perfectly clear, and
free from molecules.       Moreover, the emission of tails and molecules
is not the result of   a breaking up of the corpuscles     ; for many of the
latter may be seen emitting long tails without any alteration of their
natural form ; and although no doubt the corpuscles are finally broken
up, this process does not take place sooner in those         with tails than
in those which have none.
    In connexion with his present observations, the author             relates
two cases of febrile and inflammatory disease (already reported by
                                             '
him in the ' London Medical Gazette            some years since), in which
molecular matter existed abundantly in the liquid part of the blood.
The molecules in      these cases, as    in his present experiments, he     be
lieves to have     proceeded      from the blood-corpuscles,    and likewise
through the operation of some abnormal influence, which, however,
must have acted upon the corpuscles during their circulation in the
living body.
    The author next refers to certain inferences from the foregoing
observations calculated to elucidate questions in pathology and
practical medicine, which, however, he has already made known in
his Gulstonian Lectures.

    To produce the effects described, brown sherry of the best quality
was employed.         Inferior sherry wines alter the outline of the cor
puscles, but do not cause the production either of tails or molecules.
With other sherry wines of         a better kind, the author finds   it preferable
to mix them with a fourth or a fifth part of the saline solution instead
of one-third    ; he has tried port-wines and various mixtures of brandy
and water, with and without sugar, but almost always without the
effect here described.
V. "Researches on the Phosphorus-Bases." — No. VII. Tri-
       phosphonium-Compounds.                 By A. W. Hofmann, LL.D.,
       F.R.S. &c. Received October 18, 1859.
    In several previous communications          I  have submitted to the Royal
Society the results which        I  have obtained in examining the deport
ment of triethylphosphine          with dibromide of ethylene,      as the proto
type   of diatomic bromides.          I have   shown that the final product of
this reaction is     a  diatomic salt corresponding          to two molecules   of
chloride of ammoninm.
    The further prosecution of the study of triethylphosphine              in this
 direction has led me to investigate the derivatives generated             by the
phosphorus-base, when submitted to the action of triatomic chlorides,
 bromides, and iodides.
    The most     accessible   terms of this group being chloroform, bromo-
 form, and iodoform, the changes          of triethylphosphine     under the in
 fluence  of  these agents have more especially claimed my attention.
                  Action of Iodoform      on Triethylphosphine.
    Both   substances     unite with energy at the common temperature.
 In order    to avoid the inflammation          of the phosphorus-base, small
 quantities of the materials should be         mixed at a time. The products
 of the reaction vary with the relative proportions of the two                sub
 stances.
    By adding gradually crystals of iodoform             to a moderate    bulk of
 triethylphosphine      until   a new   addition produces no longer an eleva
 tion of temperature,     a viscous mass of    a  clear yellow colour is obtained,
 which, when treated with alcohol, changes to             a white powder of cry

                                            190
 stall in e aspect  ;  these    crystals are easily soluble in water, difficultly
 soluble in alcohol, and insoluble in ether.            Two or three crystalliza
 tions from boiling alcohol render them perfectly pure.                The analysis
 of this body has led me to the formula
                                     ^38  ^« ^3
 which represents       a  compound of one molecule of iodoform,           and three
 molecules of triethylphosphine,

                         phosphine.
 Iodoform       thus fixes three molecules of triethylphosphine,               giving
 rise to the formation        of the tri-iodide of  a  triatomic metal, of a      tri-
 phosphonium corresponding to three molecules of chloride of ammo
 nium.

    The    aqueous     solution of the iodide yields with iodide of zinc a
white crystalline precipitate which is difficultly soluble in water, and
 appears     to be slightly decomposed         by recrystallization.      It consists
of   one molecule     of the triatomic iodide and three         molecules   of iodide
 of zinc,
                                C38 H46P3I3,3ZnI.
    By treating the tri-iodide with the various           salts  of silver,  a series
of triatomic compounds is easily obtained, which contain the different
acids.
    The trichloride furnishes with dichloride of platinum             a  pale yellow
precipitate, which is insoluble in water, but dissolves in boiling con
centrated hydrochloric acid.              From this solution it is deposited on
cooling in brilliant rectangular plates, which contain
                              C38H46P3Cl3,3PtCl4.
    I have vainly tried to produce a trioxide which would correspond
to the tri-iodide.
    The tri-iodide is promptly attacked by oxide of silver, with formation
of iodide of silver, and of an exceedingly caustic fixed base, which
remains     in solution.      This  base no longer belongs to the same series.
By treating its solution with hydriodic acid, or with hydrochloric
acid and dichloride of platinum, it is at once perceived that the action

                                           191
of the oxide of silver       has profoundly      changed the original system of
molecules.        Hydriodic     acid    no longer produces the salt difficultly
soluble in alcohol      ;  by evaporating the solution a crystalline residue
is obtained, which         easily separates into a viscous, extremely soluble
substance, and splendid           crystals of an iodide, very soluble in water
 and alcohol, but insoluble in ether.             The analysis of this iodide      has
 proved it to contain
                                      rCaH3

     This formula represents the iodide of methyl-triethylphosphonium,
  which was formerly obtained by            M. Cahours and myself,           by acting
  with iodide of methyl upon triethylphosphine.
     The alkaline liquid, obtained by the action of oxide of silver upon
  the tri-iodide, when saturated with hydrochloric             acid, yields no longer
  the platinum     salt, difficultly soluble in water but soluble in hydro
  chloric    acid.    In   a  dilute solution     no precipitate      whatever takes
  place,    and only after considerable           evaporation well-defined        deep
  orange-yellow octahedrons are deposited, which contain
                  CMHMPC1, PtCl3=              CtH5    .  p CI, Pt    Cla

      From     these   results it is obvious that the triphosphonium-salt,
   when submitted to the action of oxide of silver, passes over into                   a
   monophosphonium-compound.                 The latter    is not the sole product   of
   the  reaction   ;  I   have   already alluded to the viscous            deliquescent
   substance    which accompanies         the iodide of methyl-triethylphospho
   nium.      This   is an iodide, which, in the solution            produced by the
   action of oxide of silver upon the original tri-iodide, exists in the form
   of oxide.      The latter    substance     is easily recognized by evaporating
   the solution    of oxide of methyl-triethylphosphonium,                and adding a
   concentrated solution of potassa, when the oily globules characteristic
   of the dioxide       of triethylphosphonium           separate,   which    disappear
   immediately on       addition of water.
      The metamorphosis of           the tri-iodide,   under the influence of oxide
   of silver, is represented      by the following equation        : —

       The tri-iodide which forms the subject of this Note is not the only
    product of the reaction between iodoform and triethylphosphine.
    There are other compounds formed, especially when          the iodoform is
    employed in great excess.        The nature of  these bodies,   which may
    be divined from the examination      of the corresponding compounds in
    the diatomic series, is not yet fixed by experiment.
       I  have satisfied myself that chloroform     and bromoform       act  like
    iodoform upon triethylphosphine.
       The phosphorus-base acts, even at the common temperature, upon
    tribromide of allyl. The mixture of the two bodies solidifies into a
    crystalline mass, in the examination of which      I am engaged.
       The reactions which     I have pointed out in this Note have induced
    me to extend     piy experiments to tetratomic  bodies.    The chloride of
    carbon, Ca Cl4, obtained by the final substitution of chlorine for the
    hydrogen in marsh-gas, appeared to promise accessible results.            On
    submitting     this body, remarkable for its great indifference under
    ordinary circumstances, to the influence of triethylphosphine,       I  have
     observed   with astonishment   a most powerful reaction.       Every drop
     of triethylphosphine    which is poured into the chloride of carbon,
    hisses like water falling upon red-hot iron.     On cooling, the mixture
    solidifies into  a mass of white crystals, which will  be the subject   of a
     special communication.

    The following communications         were read : —
I. " Note      respecting    the Circulation of Gasteropodous       Mollusca
        and the supposed        Aquiferous Apparatus        of the Lamelli-
        branchiata." By M. H. Lacaze           Duthiers. Communicated
        by Professor    Huxley.        Received October 19, 1859.
    A memoir upon the aquiferous        system and the oviducts    of Lamelli-
branchiate Mollusks by Messrs. Rolleston and Robertson, was read
before the    Royal Society at the Meeting on the 3rd of February, 1 859.
The abstract of this memoir, contained in the ' Annals and Magazine
of Natural History,'      reached me in the month      of July; and  I was not
a  little surprised to find that  a structure which  1 had so elaborately stu
died in the course of my various journeys to the sea-shore, and which
 I had carefully described in a number of species, was something quite
different from what      I  had imagined it to be.     Without entering into
minute anatomical details, which would not tend to elucidate the
question,    I find that Messrs. Rolleston and Robertson consider that
the organs, the ducts, and the orifices supposed to be the ovaries or
their excretory ducts, are, in fact, nothing        but an aquiferous appa
ratus, and that the openings placed on each side of the foot are the
excretory orifices of this system.        They discover elsewhere the ducts
whose office is to convey away         the products of the genital glands.
 The enunciation of       an opinion    so opposed   to what   I, in common
with many other authors, had maintained, seemed to require             a recur
 rence to direct observation.        But on repeating my examination of
 Cardium edule,     Tellina solidula, Mactra stultorum, and Donax ana-
 tina,   I have precisely verified my previous conclusions.
     On throwing injections into the genital orifices, the sexual glands
 have become turgid ; and on examining fragments of such injected
 genital glands microscopically, the injected substance was seen mixed
 with the ova or spermatozoa.           These facts   may be observed      with
 especial ease in Cardium edule.
     In addition to this,   I  have seen ova actually laid by living females
 of Modiola and My till, one of the valves of whose shell was removed,
 on irritation of the genital orifice ; and in others the ova or the
 spermatic fluid may be made to pass out of their orifices, at the
 breeding season, by pressing gently upon the foot.
     In Spondylus gaderopus the genital orifice        is situated in the sac

                                             194
of Bojanus,    and    I   had great difficulty in finding it when investigating
this subject.       It   was, in fact, only by chnnce that             I opened     the sac
of Bojanus and       observed     a  little rose-coloured cylinder issuing from
an orifice in its interior.         This cylinder, like a thread of vermicelli
in aspect, was composed             of reddish ova mixed with mucus, and
agglomerated.          I  might multiply examples,            but it seems to be use
less to do so, for       I should simply reproduce             the   facts which     I  have
brought forward in the memoir which                    I  published in the
                                                                                 '
                                                                                   Annates
des Sciences      Naturelles,'       on my      return from        a   long stay in the
Balearic isles.
   In this memoir,         besides,  I  have not merely drawn attention to the
circumstance, that after oviposition the aspect of the gland changes
completely, which might lead an observer                    to mistake the apparatus
of reproduction for something quite different, but I                          have     given
figures of this condition of Pecten varius, Sec. In fine, I                   believe that
the structure    of the     male and female organs           of the Lamellibranchiate
Mollusca is such as it was described              to be before the observations            of
Messrs. Rolleston and Robertson.
   But   does the system        of aquiferous     vessels, whose occurrence in the
Mollusca     has    been     sometimes       admitted, sometimes           denied,     really
exist in the Acephala         ?   In the abstract       to which      I refer, those cita
tions, which doubtless existed in the memoir, have not, and probably
could not have appeared.            It  is well known that the belief in this sup
posed   aquiferous system has been gradually becoming weaker.                            The
necessity   of explaining the        extreme dilatation and contraction              of the
bodies  of molluscous animals            led anatomists to seek for and describe
such a system     ;   but at present the explanation of these facts is found
in the direct mixture         of water with the blood, or            the ejection    of the
latter liquid.    MM. Leuckart and Gegenbaur                  have made observations
tending to prove the occurrence of this process in the Ptcropods                        ; M.
Langer of Vienna has published               a special    memoir on the circulation
of Anodon,     and the great point he makes out is the passage                     of water
into the blood by the intermediation                 of    the organ      of Bojanus.       I
believe   that  I have      demonstrated      in Dentalium the orifices by which
the direct communication of the circulatory                    apparatus with the ex
terior of the body takes place          ;  and lastly,   1  have found a Gasteropod,
and one which assuredly occupies                a  very high place        in that group,
which presents the same arrangement.

                                                195
     I
     hope to be able before long to bring out a complete Monograph
of the anatomy of Pleurobranchus aurantiacus, in which the exist
ence     of an external orifice of the circulatory apparatus shall                      be put
beyond doubt.     As the figure which accompanies this Note                           shows, a
very small orifice (6, fig. A, and c, fig. B) with a raised rim                       is visible
above the external              genital organs and in front of the principal
branchial vein.    This orifice, hidden by the contractions of the body,
is   very conspicuous in the dead animal.     On injecting milk or any
other liquid by         it,   the fluid   is   seen always to enter the heart           ;    and
on slitting      up the branchial vein, there          is   seen within    it   an aperture
(d, fig.     B) leading into        a    little canal which     is   connected     with the
external aperture, and             is    the channel whereby the fluid                injected
enters      the heart.    I     have varied the method           of injection in         every
possible way, and always with the same result.                       I    cannot conceive
that there       is   any rupture of the parts or any extravasation of the
injection, so that     I      believe    (as may be verified in spirit           specimens)
that in the Pleurobranchus                the circulatory apparatus communicates
directly with the exterior.
     The demonstration of         a     direct communication between the exterior
and the circulatory           apparatus, renders the assumed              existence     of   an
     Vol.   X.                                                                    V

aquiferous system              a   priori    less necessary,             in order to explain the
great changes    of volume of the body of Mollusks. But I believe
that, in addition, microscopic examination will show the direct con
tinuity      of the genital glands with the lateral orifices placed                             at the
base   of the foot in the Lamellibranchiata.
  This communication of the vascular apparatus with the external
water, has a very important bearing on the history of the nutritive
processes.        The physiological              conceptions derived from the study
of the higher animals are singularly affected by finding creatures
which can at will throw out a portion of their blood, or, on the
contrary, dilute with water that which                            is,   par   excellence,   the nutri
tious element.
   This would           be sufficient to prove,               were   it    necessary to do so, how
wide   is    the difference between the vital processes                         of the lower   and   of
the higher animals.

                                             (Abstract.)
  The results of the experiments which                            are recorded by the author
are divided into three classes, which tend to show —

                                        197
     1st. That    a tendon, having been        divided,  may reunite     without
  leaving permanently     a cicatrix.
     2ndly. That the uniting new material may be drawn out to any
 required length, and in such case may, under gradual and carefully
 regulated extension, even acquire the thickness of the tendon itself             ;
 but that   if  the divided ends are widely separated         after the section,
 and so remain, reunion will not take place.
    3rdly. That the addition of new tendon        does uot impair the strength
 of the muscle, unless the length be more than sufficient, in which
 case it occasionally weakens the muscle.
    The process     of reunion    is explained,    and the appearances       pre
 sented by the tendon in the various stages        of reunion   are detailed and
illustrated by coloured drawings.         Preparations of the parts operated
 on were also exhibited.      The author concludes that, when the divided
 ends  of the tendon   are held in apposition and the limb is kept at rest,
 reunion will take place without         leaving   a cicatrix ;  but that when
 extension is made, the new material becomes           organized, and persists
 as a  permanent structure.
 III. " On     the Curvature     of the Indian Arc."        By the Venerable

        municated     by Professor        Stokes,     Sec.   R.S.     Received
        November 8, 1859.
                                   (Abstract.)
    In a paper published in the Philosophical        Transactions for   1 855, in
 which the author calculates         the effect which the attraction of the
 mountain mass north of India has upon the plumb-line at stations in
the plains on the south, he applied the deflections as corrections to
the astronomical amplitudes, to ascertain         what influence they would
have upon the determination          of the curvature of the Indian Arc of
Meridian.      The method      he   adopted was to compare together the
two    measured    arcs between     Kaliana and Kalianpur, and between
Kalianpur and Damargida.            The calculation brought out an ellipse
of which the ellipticity is             Colonel Everest had deduced by a
comparison of the same arcs, but with uncorrected amplitudes, an
                                                                p 2

                                       198
ellipticity          These two values are on opposite sides of the mean
ellipticity for the whole earth, from which they differ by about ^ths
and ^ths of the mean.
    In  these calculations the ellipses are found which exactly           accord
with the measured lengths and the corrected latitudes in the one case,
and in the other the latitudes uncorrected for deflection.               A more
 correct method has been followed by Captain           A. Clarke, R.E., in the
volume of the Ordnance Survey just published                 by Lieut.   Colonel
James,    R.E.    Captain Clarke takes the latitudes of the three stations
 mentioned above, as corrected for mountain attraction by Archdeacon
 Pratt, and supposing the corrected latitudes as well as the elements
of the mean ellipse subject to error, he determines, according to the
 method of least squares, the ellipse which best corresponds with the
 mean ellipse and    with the three corrected latitudes.          The resulting
ellipse depends     of  course  upon the height attributed to the mean
ellipse, which is left arbitrary,    to be assigned at the end of the cal
culation.     In this way Captain Clarke        shows     that it is possible to
obtain an ellipse which differs much less from the mean ellipse, and
yet which      makes   the differences     between   the three latitudes      cal
culated from the ellipse and the observed              latitudes corrected for
deflection, very small.
    Since this calculation was made          by Captain      Clarke, the author
communicated to the Royal Society an approximate estimate                 of the
effect   of the deficiency of matter in the ocean south of Hindostan,
on  the plumb-line.      On seeing Captain Clarke's result, he felt anxious
to ascertain   what effect this new disturbing       cause would have      upon
it.   The present paper contains         a repetition   of the calculations of
Captain Clarke, with the additional corrections to the latitudes due
to the defect   of attraction of the   ocean introduced into them.         Capt.
Clarke's result, the author finds, is thereby improved,              the ellipse
obtained coming out somewhat nearer to the mean ellipse, while the
errors in the latitudes, which already were very small, are still further
reduced.      The following are the values of the semi-axes a b (in feet)
and   of the reciprocal of the ellipticity corresponding, — I. to the mean
ellipse, as determined by Captain Clarke        ;  II.  to the first of the two
ellipses (corresponding to two different degrees of importance assigned
to the mean ellipse) obtained by Captain Clarke by combining the mean
ellipse with the Indian     Arc;   III.   to the ellipse    II. recalculated by

 anpur,   which in Captain            Clarke's   ellipse were +l"-05, — 0"-95,
  + l"-20,    are now reduced to         + 0"-93, -0"-37, + 0"74.
     In conclusion, the author calculates the distance of a point in the
 latitude of Kaliana from the centre of the earth in the three ellipses,
and finds it to he near 7000 feet greater in the ellipses                II.  and   III.
than in the mean ellipse           I.     That deviations     to such an extent       as
this from the mean ellipse should actually occur he thinks                       likely
enough, and he is not disposed to have recourse to some yet un
discovered cause to reconcile the Indian Arc with the mean ellipse.
The occurrence of marine fossils in mountains and                  elevated    regions,
shows that great changes of level of the land relatively to the water
have actually taken place           ;  and it seems unlikely that an extensive
internal change        in the state of the earth would cause an upheaval or
depression of the land or the water alone             ; it might rather   be expected
that both would         be affected,    though unequally.        Hence the absolute
change    of distance of the land from the            centre  of the earth may     have
been much greater than the elevation relatively to the water, while
the phenomena adduced indicate that even the latter must have been
very great.
IV. " Comparison of some recently determined                     Refractive Indices
       with Theory."            By the Rev. Baden Powell, M.A., F.R.S.,
       F.G.S., F.R.A.S., Savilian Professor of Geometry in the
       University of Oxford.               Received November 17, 1859.
    In  a series    of   papers   inserted in the Philosophical        Transactions
(1835, 1836, 1837), and afterwards, in a more correct and complete
form, in my Treatise ' On the Undulatory Theory applied to the Di
spersion of       Light' (1841),       I   endeavoured to investigate the great
problem of the explanation of the unequal refrangibility                  of light   on

                                           200
the principles of the undulatory theory, as proposed by                      M. Cauchy
about 1830,        by numerical         comparison with the indices observed,
 more   especially in cases of the most highly dispersive media then
 examined.
   The general result then arrived                at    was,   that while the theory
 applied perfectly through           an extensive        range of media of low and
 moderate     dispersive power, it did not apply well to those of higher                     ;
and to the highest in the scale (which of course formed the true
test of the theory) it did not apply within any allowable limits of
accuracy.        Since that time little has been done towards prosecuting
the subject.
   In the experimental part of the inquiry, about                     1849,    I   had ob
served the indices for a few new           media*; but         these were not       high in
the scale   ;   yet though perhaps thus of little importance,                I   have now
thought      it  as well to go through           the calculation        for them      :  the
results are of the same general character as just described.
   Soon after, finding that my friend, the Rev.                 T. P. Dale, F.R.A.S.,
was desirous to carry on some               researches        of this kind,       I  placed
at his disposal the apparatus with which                   I  had determined all my
indicesf.
   In  1850 that gentleman communicated to the                     Royal Astronomical
Society   a  short general account of his observations               J relative    to some
substances      not very high in the scale.
   In 1858, Mr.Dale, in conjunction with Dr.                 J. H.Gladstone, F.R.S.,
presented     to the Royal Society § a valuable series              of determinations,
evincing highly interesting results relative to the change of refractive
power in various substances            under different temperatures.
   None of these media being high in the scale, they have little
bearing on the main object of my inquiries.                   In two   cases  (viz. water
and alcohol) the indices agree so closely with mine, that it was not
worth while to recalculate them.              In two other cases I have carried
out the nnmerical comparison, which affords                   a  good agreement         with
the theory.
   Very recently        the same gentlemen         have, however,       published some

 stance at the very summit        of the     scale, for which      I  had long been
extremely desirous to obtain some determinations of indices*.
     Among these results only two sets are in a form in which they can
be made available for comparison with theory. These are the indices
for   the standard rays in bisulphide        of carbon, and for solution of phos
phorus in that medium, which            I  have now calculated theoretically.
     The results (given in the sequel) in both                cases indicate discre
pancies between        theory and observation too great to be due to any
reasonable allowance for error          ;   and we are confirmed in the con
clusion before arrived at, that,       for     highly dispersive substances,       the
theory, in its present state, is defective.
     But  these comparisons are all made by means               of the  same formula
employed in my former researches,               viz. that derived from Cauchy's
theory by Sir       W. R. Hamilton, which           he communicated to me, and
which     I explained in a paper in the Philosophical             Magazinef .
     Considering the unsatisfactory           condition   in which      the question
was left when tried by the test of the higher media in my former
inquiries,     it is a matter of some        surprise that in the long interval
since the publication       of those results no mathematician            has been in
duced to revise the theory.         Some       criticisms indeed were advanced
by    Mr. Earnshaw|, and others by Prof. Mosotti                      and  the Abbe'
Moigno§, bearing on the general principle.                  Sir W. R. Hamilton's
formula      in   particular   was  founded        on certain assumptions con
fessedly     but approximate.       It    remains then       a  promising    field for
inquiry to analysts, whether       a  better formula might not be deduced,
or other improvements made              in the general theory, by which a
method applying          so well to lower       cases   might     be made      equally
successful     for the higher.

 ness in the line   H   which renders its index a little uncertain.        It  may
 be owing to this circumstance that the assumption            of that index may
 have occasioned     the discrepancy between theory and observation.

fairly allowed to errors of observation.
   In the   second case     it is yet more clearly apparent that the theory
is defective.    The ray C was not observed ; but the theoretical index
is evidently in error to      a large amount, as it is even lower than that
of B.    The indices for D and C            are perhaps within      the limits  of

I. "On      the Electric      Conducting     Power of Alloys."                By A.
       Matthiessen,         Ph.D.      Communicated by Prof.               Wheat-
       stone.     Received November 17, 1859.
                                   (Abstract.)
    In this paper   I have   given the determinations of the electric con
ducting power of upwards of 200 alloys, and have found that the
metals employed may be divided into two classes, viz. —
    A. Those metals which, when alloyed with                each other, conduct
electricity in the ratio of their relative volumes.
    B. Those metals which, when alloyed with             one   of  class  A, or with
each other, do not conduct electricity         in the ratio of their relative
volumes,   but always lets.
   The alloys may be divided into three groups            ;   viz. —
    1. Those made of the metals of class         A  with each other.
    2. Those made      of the metals of   class  A with     those   of  class B.
   3. Those made of the metals of class B with each other.
    From the experiments described in the paper          I have     tried to deduce
the nature   of alloys, and    have arrived at the following conclusions         : —
   A. That most alloys       are only a solution   of  one metal      in the other  ;
for, —
   1.  On looking    at the curves belonging to the different groups, we
see  that each group of alloyshas a curve of a distinct and separate form.
Thus for the first    we have nearly straight lines ; for the second, the
conducting power decreases always rapidly on the side of the metal
belonging to class B, and then turning, goes almost in a straight
line to the metal belonging to class      A;    for the third group we find         a
rapid decrement      on both sides of the curve,        and the turning-points
united by almost     a  straight line.

                                                      20G
    2. On examining that part                       of the curve where     the rapid decrement
 takes place, we find that with the lead and tin alloys it generally
 requires twice as many volumes of the former as                               of the latter to
 reduce a metal        of   class       B    to a certain conducting power.
    3.     That the turning-points of                 these curves are not chemical com
 binations we may assume from the fact that they only contain very
 small per-centages          of the         one metal.
   4.     That the alloys at the turning-points                        have    their calculated
specific gravities.
   5.  From the similarity of the curves of the conducting power of
alloys, where we may assume we have only a solution of one metal
in the other, we may always draw approximatively the curve of the
alloys of any two metals                    if we   know to which class they belong.
   B. That          some alloys are chemical combinations                  ;   for —
    1.    At the turning-points of the curve we generally find contraction
or expansion.
   2.     We   have no regular form                  of curve,   so that we cannot a     priori
approximatively draw it.
   3.     At the turning-points of the curve, the alloy retains large per
centages       of   each metal.
   4. The appearance                (crystalline        form, &c.) of the alloys at these
points is different from each other.
   C. That          some alloys are only mechanical mixtures ; for example,
bismuth-zinc, lead-zinc, some silver-copper alloys, &c.
  The question now arises, To what is the rapid decrement of the
conducting power of the metals belonging to class B, when alloyed
with other metals, due              ?
  The only answer             I   can at present give to this question                  is,   that
most of their other physical properties                     are altered in     a   like manner   ;
for where we find no marked change                          in most of the physical pro
perties,    as in group       I,    and in the second group on the one side of
the curve, then we have nearly their calculated conducting powers.
   In the Appendix          I     have given some determinations of the con
ducting power of pure gold, which                      I    find has   a   higher value than
that generally quoted.
   In conclusion,       I    may take this opportunity                 of thanking Dr. M.
Holzmann        for the excellent manner in which he has carried out the
greater     part of the experiments.

         Received November 24, 1859.
      Problem.       To find        a       proceeding by which                   the divisibility of               a
proposed integer N by                   7   or 13, or by both                7 and   13, may be deter
mined through the same rule.
      Solution.      We        can designate                the number         N by abed             . . .   mn,   so
that (a) be the first or highest, and (n) the last or lowest digit in
it,therefore we may put
                                            N= abode             .
                                                                 .
                                                                 .    mn.

                                      209
    1.  Take the first digit, and having placed it below the fourth,
make the subtraction in the usual way, thus               :
                                N'=6erfe     . . . tnn
                                      —a
   2. Take the first digit of N', and having placed it below the
fourth,   effect the subtraction, thus     :
                                N"=cde      . . .mn
                                      -b
   3. Continue in the same way till you have effected the subtrac
tion upon (n), and you will have the rule             :
   Is N'" '" = ... Fm'n'    divisible by   7  or 9, or by     7 and 9 at the same
time? then     is the number    N divisible      too by 7 or 13, or by 7 and 13
at the same time.
   Ex.l.                      N. =71491
                              N' =            =    1421
                                      ^^
                              N"=       ^j=:420=7-60;
 therefore   N is divisible by  7.
   Ex.   II.                  N =246571
                              N' =    f   *71

                                        6371
                              N"=        — 4 =6331
                              N"'=        3fg=325=5*           13;
 the number     N is divisible by   13.
    Ex.  III.            N= 1,1 83530            8  03
                                 1,8 2 5

                                              8,4 6 3
                                                 4 5   5=5-7-13;
 the proposed number N is divisible both by              7  and by 13.

  Remark. — The       above     proceeding       is but     the application     of    a
general    principle, inherent to our decadic system.              The author    is in
possession    of similar proceedings for all prime numbers up to                107 ;
above     that limit (except a few cases) the rules become more                 com
plicated, and lose the high value of easy application.
  Taking again N=abcde          ... mn,   we have the following             Table for

Therefore we can operate thus         : —          9,4 0   1

                     9 1 8
   Hence the rule      : — If a multiple     of the digit to    be subtracted be
below the divisor,        we  can  convert subtraction        into addition.   If
it be beyond the divisor, we can subtract the excess instead of the
multiple.

     I  take the liberty to present to the Royal Society the results        of an
  extended series    of investigations into the development of the      vertebrae
  of the plagiostomous        and some other fishes.

                                        A. Structure.
     The chorda dorsalis of the Plagiostomes, of Chimara, Acipenser,
Scaphirhynchus, Toxodon, and Lepidosiren,                         shows   four distinct parts,
viz. —
     1st.    The outer elastic          membrane,       a homogeneous             elastic coat,
which is not unfrequently perforated with holes of different sizes, of
the same kind as those of the fenestrated membrane of Henle.
     2nd. The proper sheath, formed of connective tissue                            of fibrous
appearance,       and generally provided with many plasm-cells.
     3rd. The inner elastic layer, a reticulated elastic membrane                        ;   and
     4th. The gelatinous substance of the chorda itself, made                            up of
soft      cartilage-cells, of different        sizes    and generally provided with
nuclei.
     Of     these four layers     it would    seem that only the            third and fourth
are present in the higher animals, from the                       Amphibia (with the         ex
ception of the fiatrachians) upwards ;                      if,
                                               at least, my opinion be
correct, that the structureless envelope of the chorda of these animals,
generally called the sheath proper, corresponds to the third layer in
the cartilaginous fishes.  On the other hand,    seems that many of it
the osseous fishes present the same complications                            of structure     as
the Plagiostomes,         if it   is   true that the bodies of their vertebrae are
developed       from the proper sheath of the chorda.                       So, for instance,
there exists     a   beautiful elastic internal layer outside of the remnants
of the gelatinous chorda in the              genus     Orthagoriscus.
                           B. Form of the chorda proper.
     1st.   The chorda retains in         some instances           its original cylindrical
form, and this       is   the case when the vertebral column shows no indi
cation of vertebral bodies (Cyclostotnes, Acipenser, Chimara, Lepi
dosiren, Tilurus, Hyoprorus* (anterior vertebra)), as well as where
vertebral divisions exist (Leptocephalus, Helmichthys, Hyoprorus
(last vertebra)).
   2nd. In other cases the chorda              is   contracted in the middle region
of   each vertebral body, which              seldom happens where there                 is   no
trace   of ossification (Hexanchus), but               is   very generally the case in
 *     Two genera belonging       to the Leptocephalidse,         described by   me (see Kaup,
Apodal Fishes of the British Museum.          London, 1856).

                                                            216
ossified     vertebrae (Squali, osseous fishes, perennibranchiate amphibia,
Caecilia)          .
     3rd. Lastly, the chorda may be separated                                   into as many parts as
there are interstices between the vertebrae, which remaining parts in
some        cases           are      totally     absorbed         (Rata and most of the higher
animals)       .
                                      C. Anterior end of               the chorda.
     1st.    In many full-grown                     fishes     the chorda dorsalis reaches with
its anterior attenuated end to the base of the cranium, and its cranial
part is in some cases enveloped                               in its whole length by the cranial
cartilage.              This fact          has been long known with regard to the                         Aci-
penseridae,             Cyelostomi, and Sirenoidei                     ;    but the same thing occurs
amongst the Squali, and has been observed by Stannius in Prionodon,
and by me in Heptanchus,                            Centrophorus, Acanthias, and Squatina.
In   these last fishes the chorda reaches                                  as far as the region      of the
hypophysis,                 and is bent upwards at its termination, so that the end
itself lies underneath the interior perichondrium of the cranium, or
at least very near the surface                         of the cartilage.             In other   cases only
the hinder part of the chorda is enclosed                                      by the cranial cartilage,
whilst the anterior half lies in                        a   groove at the under part of             it,   as in
Leptocephalus and Helmichthys.                                    In   one    case   (Tilurus) the whole
cranial part of the chorda                        is   free, and situated underneath the base
of the cranium,                     between      its cartilage and the perichondrium*.
     2nd. In            some genera            of Squali and           most   of the   osseous fishes, the
cranial part of the chorda                        is   reduced to the anterior half of the first
ligamentum intervertebrale.
     3rd.     In the            genus Chimara,              the chorda ends in the foremost part
of the vertebral column.                            In this       case the connexion          between      the
cranium and the column                         is   maintained by an articulation, which on
the side               of the column              is   formed          by   the cartilaginous      vertebral
arches.
     4th.     In the            Raiidnc,     finally, the chorda ends at               a   greater distance
from the skull                  ;   and in this case also the anterior part                 of the column,
which       is     formed only              by   the coalesced arches,           is    connected   with the
cranium                by   a   real articulation.
   * In all        these fishes there exists rather          strong connexion between the vertebral
                                                              a
column and the cranium                 ;   in Squatina besides this there are two lateral articulations
between the cartilaginous                  arches of the first vertebra and the lateral parts of the
cranial     cartilage.

                                         217
  II.    Ossification and Development         of the Bodies of     the Vertebrae.
   A.     General remarks on the part which the chorda takes in the
                            formation of    the vertebra.
    1 st.   In all  cases where the chorda ossifies, it is only its second layer,
or the sheath proper, which undergoes changes. At the same time
the elastica externa disappears totally, or is at least dissolved in such
a manner that its remuants are scarcely distinguishable, whilst                 the
elastica     interna and the chorda proper generally remain unaltered.
In   one case only, viz. in Scymnus           lichia,  ossification is to be seen
even in the gelatinous substance          of the chorda.
    2nd. The ossification         of the sheath of the chorda has             been
observed        as yet only in the Plagiostomes and in certain genera of the
osseous       fishes  ; but it very probably will be found in all osseous
fishes. On the contrary, it is absent in all higher Vertebrata           — accord
ing to my observations, even amongst the Batrachia.
       B.    Changes    of the sheath  of  the chorda during ossification.
                               1.   Vertebral column.
    1st.   In the Plagiostomes the sheath of the chorda in the first
place     assumes a greater hardness in certain parts,           these parts being
transformed into fibro-cartilage          or real cartilage, whilst the inter
vening parts retain their primitive softness.            In this manner the first
indications appear of the vertebral bodies               and intervertebral liga
ments, the interior parts         of which    are formed by the chorda        itself
and the elastica interna.          The histological    changes going on during
this formation of the vertebral bodies, viz. the transformation of the
primitive plasm-cells of the sheath into cartilage-cells, and the deve
lopment of the homogeneous interstitial               substance    of the cartilage
out of the fibrous substance         of the sheath, speak strongly in favour
of the view that both kinds of cells and intervening substances are
closely allied, whatever may have been the development of the de
ments      of the primitive sheath.
    In the Leptocephali          the sheath of the chorda ossifies without
having been transformed into cartilage            ; and the same seems to hold
good for the other osseous fishes.
    2nd. Whilst this transformation of certain parts of the sheath of
the chorda into cartilaginous vertebral bodies is going on, there are
also formed in the interior       of each  of these bodies peculiar vertical dis

                                                      218
sepiments.             These dissepiments, developed by an interior growth                             of
the sheath of the chorda, whereby the chorda proper becomes con
stricted, occur in some cases in vertebrae without any or with very
slight       traces    of ossification,          as   in Hexanchus and the anterior ver
tebra of Heptanchus, whilst they may be almost wanting in others
 pretty well ossified (Leptocephalus,                         Helmichthys,     Centrophorus).
     3rd. The ossification of the cartilaginous vertebral bodies formed
out of the sheath                of the chorda never begins at the                    surface,       but
always in their interior, and also in their middle region, and is,                              as    far
as   I   know, without             exception, in the first instance a calcified fibro-
cartilage, or what           I     call a fibrous bone.
     4th. The first osseous parts have the form of thin rings (Hep-
tanchus, anterior vertebra), which afterwards assume that of hollow
and thin double cones (Heptanchus, posterior vertebra, Centrophorus)                                    .
     5th. The growth of these double cones, which are the real osseous
vertebral bodies, when once they have assumed                              their whole length,
takes       place especially at their outer side, through                          the addition of
calcified cartilage (chondriform                              Williamson
                                               ; Knorpel-Knochen
                                                      bone,
in German), which is formed from the outer chordal cartilage of the
vertebral body.            In addition to this, the             osseous double cone thickens
also     at the expense             of the cartilage inside of               it,   but in   a   much
smaller degree.
     6th.    In   some cases the outer growth                   is   everywhere the same, and
in this manner stronger double-coned vertebral bodies                                  of uniform
thickness are formed.                    In other      cases the growth        is   in some parts
more active than            in others,       and vertebral bodies then originate with
outer ridges and lamellae (Heptanchus,                          Raia, Carcharias, Mustelus,
Galeus).          In                              of the outer cartilage
                       one single instance the ossification
takes place in such away that the exterior parts of the vertebral bodies
are formed by alternating circles of chondriform bone and cartilage
(Squatina).
  7th. With regard                 to the extension           of this growth of the vertebral
bodies formed by the ossification of the sheath of the chorda,                              it   is   to
be remarked, that in some cases the whole, or nearly the whole sheath
of the chorda          ossifies,    as   in Squatina and the Raiidae.               In other    cases
greater or lesser parts of the primitive cartilage, inside and outside
the vertebral body, remain                  in   their primitive state (Squali).

                                         219
                                   2.    Skull.
     In some instances   even the sheath    of  the  cranial part of     the chorda
 ossifies in its hindermost part, and forms a true vertebral body
for the occipital vertebra, which entirely corresponds to those of
 the column.       This has    been     observed    by me as yet in Lepto-
 cephalus and several      Squalidae   ;  but it is extremely probable that
 the basilar occipital of all osseous          fishes,    viz. that part of this
 bone which resembles      a common vertebral body, is developed                quite
 in the same way.
 C. On     the manner in which the outer ossifying            layer is concerned
              in the formation   of  the bodies    of  the vertebra.
     1st.  In those cases where the outer ossifying layer, viz. that layer
 in which the cartilaginous      arches    are developed,      takes   part in the
 formation of the vertebral bodies, there are to be distinguished two
 different processes,  — one in which the crural cartilages themselves
 play a part in this formation, and a second, where only the periosteal
 layer between them is concerned.
     2nd. Where the crural cartilages take a part, they form, in the
 first place, by their coalescence       an outer cartilaginous       layer around
 the body of the vertebra, which took its origin from the chorda, and
 which    we shall henceforth call the chordal vertebral body.
     3rd. This outer cartilaginous layer         ossifies   in many cases     ;   and
 this ossification may take place in two        places only, viz. on the        right
 and left side of the vertebral body, as in Heptanchus,                 or in   four
 places,  in which   case a superior point     of ossification     at the floor     of
 the neural canal, and an inferior one at the roof of the haemal canal,
 are added to the two lateral ones (Acanthias,            Scymnus).
     4th. These external ossifications of chondriform            bone   may retain
  their primitive form of plates, and may then be called the lateral,
  superior, and inferior osseous plates      ; or they acquire by additional
  growth, at the expense of the outer cartilaginous layer, the form of
  wedge-shaped or cuneiform bodies,         and may be named the lateral,
  superior, and inferior wedges (Zapfen, Keile, Germ.).
     5th. In both cases these external ossifications comport themselves
  in two different ways with regard to the chordal vertebral body,
 inasmuch as in some cases both coalesce               at their ends (Scymnus,
  Acanthias),   whilst in others they remain separated (Heptanchus).

                                       220
    6th.   In  some peculiar   cases (Squali, possessing     a nictitating    eye
lid, viz. Mustelus,     Carcharias, Galeus, Sphyrna) the cartilaginous
arches    remain separated,     and then the intermediate periosteal layer
performs the part of an osteogenic         stratum.     The  osseous parts pro
duced in this way lie at the same places as the bony plates mentioned
under 4 and 5     ; they always possess the form of wedges, and coalesce
with the chordal vertebral body, in some cases only at their ends, in
others in their whole length.         Although     these ossifications are not
developed      from cartilage and have       a very peculiar structure — they
consist of a calcified fibro-cartilage with peculiar ossified strong fibres
running straight through        their whole thickness, — it is clear enough
that    they exactly correspond       to   the above-mentioned plates and
wedges     of other Plagiostomes formed out of the             coalesced   crural
cartilages.
   From certain     modes   of transformation of the sheath of the chorda,
combined with certain changes            of the outer ossifying layer, the
following types     in the composition of the vertebral bodies may be
established.
   Type I. — The vertebral       body takes    its origin entirely from     the
                        proper sheath     of the chorda.
                      A . Sheath of    the chorda thick.
    1st. Vertebral      bodies   soft   (fibro-cartilaginous),      incompletely
separated     from each other, and only distinguished by the interior
septa   of  the chorda.    Hexanchus.
    2nd. Vertebral     bodies partly cartilaginous,      with annular ossifica
tions of the form of short double       cones.     Ligamenta intervertebralia
very strong.       Heptanchus (anterior vertebra).
    3rd. Vertebral     bodies  wholly    cartilaginous,    with   thin   osseous
double cones of good length in the middle of the cartilaginous body.
Centrophorus.
    4th. Vertebral bodies well ossified, cylindrical and strong, formed
inside by strong osseous        double cones, and outside by alternating
layers of cartilage and bone.        Squatina.
                       B. Sheath of     the chorda thin.
    5th. Vertebral body a thin hollow osseous cylinder            ;  chorda pro
per in its whole length cylindrical.           Leptocephalus,      Helmichthys,
Ilyoprorus (last vertebra).

                                           221
    6th. Vertebral       bodies   slightly constricted osseous        double cones,
with external longitudinal ridges.             Chauliodus, Stomias.
Type      II. — The    vertebral body is formed partly from the sheath              of
           the chorda and partly from the outer ossifying layer.
    1st.    Chordal vertebral body partly cartilaginous, with             a  stronger
osseous double cone in its middle part.              External     part of the body
formed by a        thin layer of cartilage from the         coalesced   arches,  with
two lateral ossified plates.          Heptanchus ( posterior vertebrae).
    2nd. The same with four external ossifications, whose ends coalesce
with the internal double cone.             Acanthias,    Scymnus.
    3rd. Chordal vertebral body nearly totally ossified, of the form of
a  strong double cone, with strong external longitudinal ridges.                  Ex
 ternal    part of the body      a   strong layer of cartilage with superficial
ossifications continuous with those of the arches.                Raia, Torpedo.
    4th. Chordal vertebral body nearly wholly ossified, of the form of
 a thick double cone.         External part of the body formed by cartilage,
 with four strong wedge-shaped ossifications uniting with the ends of
 the inner double cone.          Scyllium.
    5th. Chordal vertebral body a strong osseous double cone, partly
 with external ridges.          External    part of the body formed by four
 strong, wedge-shaped ossifications, derived from the periosteal layer
 between       the   cartilaginous     arches,  which    in some     genera    totally
 coalesce with the inner double cone, whilst in others this happens
 only at the ends of the latter.               Mustelus,    Carcharias,     Sphyrna,
  Galeus.
   Type      III. — The    vertebral bodies are wholly developed from the
                              external ossifying layer.
     1st.   The vertebral     bodies    are developed     from four cartilaginous
 parts, viz. the superior        and inferior arches.        Anterior   vertebrae    of
 the Raiidae.
     2nd. The vertebral bodies are developed only from two cartila
 ginous or osseous parts.
        a. From the two neural arches, which in uniting do not enclose
                the chorda, which lies underneath them.              Cultripes pro
                vincial, J. Miiller, Rana paradoxa, Dugos.
        b.    From two lateral plates of ossified        connective tissue, which

              in uniting totally enclose the chorda.        Acaudate Batrachia,
              according to my own observations.
       c.  From two lateral cartilages which        enclose the chorda, and also
              develope the arches from themselves.          Higher Vertebrata.
    In terminating this Note,       I  take the liberty of adding that the only
 information heretofore existing on the subject to which it refers, is
 that contained in the very valuable memoirs                 by  J.  Midler* and
 Williamsonf. The part which each of these has contributed to the
 elucidation of this subject, will be stated in a paper which will
 appear in the next Number of the Wiirzburg Transactions,                  to which
 I refer those who take a more special interest in this matter, and

 VI. " Remarks         on the late Storms of October            25-26 and No
       vember      1, 1859."          By Rear-Admiral        FitzRoy, F.R.S.
       Received December           22, 1859.
   As many of our Society must doubtless be interested in the nature
                                                     '                   '
 and character of that storm in which the Royal Charter went to
pieces    on  Anglesea Island, and as abundant information                has been
obtained from        Lighthouses,      Observatories, and numerous           private
observers,    I would take this earliest opportunity of stating that the
combined results of observations prove the storm of October 25th
and 26th to have been a complete horizontal cyclone.
   Travelling    bodily northward, the area of its sweep being scarcely
300 miles in diameter, its influence affected          only the breadth of our
own Islands       (exclusive of the west       of Ireland)    and the      coast   of
France.
   While the central portion        was advancing northward, not uniformly
but at an average rate of about twenty miles an hour, the actual
velocity of the wind —circling           (as against watch-hands) around a
small central    " lull " —was from forty      to nearly eighty miles an hour.
   At places north-westward of its centre, the wind appeared to
"back" or "retrograde," shifting from east through north-east,
and north to north-west         ;  while at places     eastward of its central
passage,    the apparent change,         or veering, was from east, through
south-east,    south, south-west, and west.

                                          223
    Our Channel squadron, not far from the Eddystone, experienced
a  rapid, indeed almost a sudden shift of the wind from south-east to
north-west, being at the time in, or near, the central lull            ;  while, so
near as at Guernsey, the wind veered round by south, regularly,
without any lull.        This sudden shift off the Eddystone occurred            at
about three (or soon after), and at nearly half-past five it took place
near Reigate, westward of which the central lull passed.
    From this south-eastern part of England, the central portion of
the storm moved northward and eastward.                  Places on the east and
north   coasts     of Scotland had strong easterly or northerly gales a
day nearly later than the middle of England.                   When the ' Royal
          '
Charter was wrecked, Aberdeen and Banffshire were not disturbed
by wind     ;   but when it blew hardest, from east to north, on that
exposed coast, the storm had abated or almost ceased in the Channel
and on the south coast of Ireland.
    Further details would       be ill-timed    now, but they will be given in
a paper to the Royal          Society, as soon as additional          observations
from the Continent, and from ships at              sea, have been collected and
duly combined with other records.
    The storm of the 31st, and 1st of November,                   was    similar in
character     ;  but its central part passed just to the west of Ireland's
south-west coast, and thence north-eastward.
    Of both     these gales the barometer and thermometer, besides other
 things, gave ample warning        ; and telegraphic notice might have been
 given in sufficient time from the southern               ports to   those  of the
 eastern and northern coasts        of our Islands.
    As it is the north-west half of the cyclone (from north-east to
 south-west, true) which is influenced chiefly by the cold, dry, heavy,
and positively electrified polar atmospheric current, and the south
 west  half that shows       effects    of equatorial    streams   of air — warm,
moist, light, and negatively electrified         ; —places   over which one part
of   a cyclone passes are affected         differently from others which are
traversed by another part of the very same meteor, or atmospheric
eddy, the eddy itself being caused by the meeting of very extensive
bodies of air, moving in nearly, but not exactly opposite directions,
one   of which gradually overpowers, or combines with the other, after
the rotation.
    On the polar half of the cyclone, continually supplied from that

                                        224
 side, the visible effect is a drying up and clearing          of the air, with   a
 rising barometer and falling thermometer           ;   while on the equatorial
 side,  overpowering      quantities   of warm moist air —rushing            from
 comparatively     inexhaustible    tropical   supplies — push      towards    the
north-east as long as their impetus lasts (however originated), and
 are successively chilled, dried, and intermingled with the always
 resisting,  though     at first recoiling,     polar    current.    After such
 struggles these two currents unite in a varying intermediate state
 and direction, one or other prevailing gradually.
     Very plain and practical       conclusions are deducible from          these
 considerations  : —
     One, and the most important, is that in          a gale which seems likely
 to be near the central part of        a  storm, that should be (of course)
 avoided by    a    ship which    has    sea room : a seaman, facing the
 wind, knows that the centre is on his right hand in the northern
 hemisphere, on his left in the southern          ;   he therefore is informed
 how to steer.
     Another valuable result is that telegraphic communication can
 give notice of a storm's approach, to places then some hundred miles
 distant, and not otherwise forewarned.

       On the   Diatomic Ammonias. By A. W. Hofmann, LL.D.,
       F.R.S.     Received December          14, 1859.
    In continuing my inquiries into the nature of the organic              bases,
I  was led   in the commencement of the year 1858 to repeat some
experiments on the action of dibromide of ethylene upon ammonia,

                                              225
which M. Cloez* had published in 1853.                      The repetition of these      ex
periments compelled            me to contest not only the formulae            of M. Cloez,
but also the general interpretation which                he had given to his results.
     I have not hesitated         to communicate my conclusions to the Royal
Societyf.
     M.     Cloez  J  shortly      afterwards discussed          my    observations, and
pointed       out the arguments which                induced      him to maintain        his
 formulae and his interpretations.
     I   have not replied to these remarks.                M. Cloez having        stated  in
 the same note that he was still engaged with his experiments and
 that his inquiry        was nearly completed,            I   discontinued      my experi
  ments on the action of dibromide of ethylene upon ammonia, fully
  persuaded that the chemist, to whom we are indebted for the first
  observation of this reaction, in continuing                   his experiments would
  arrive at the same results which            I  had myself obtained.
     In discontinuing the discussion with M. Cloez,                      I   was  not freed
  from the obligation of proving the general thesis of my note, viz.
  the formation of diatomic bases by the action of diatomic bromides
  on ammonia.          I  have given the        proof in     several    communications §
  addressed      during     the last two years to the Royal                   Society, and
  especially in     a note  ||  describing some new derivatives of phenylamine
  and ethylamine         published      during last summer.             The formation of
  these bodies, their analysis and their transformations, have,                   I believe,
  settled the question at issue          in a  satisfactory manner.
      These researches         have been the subject of some remarks on the
  part of     M. Cloez          from which it appears that this chemist has
  interpreted my silence as           a tacit admission of defeat          ; he rejects the
  formulae     which   I  have    given for the diatomic derivatives of phenyl-
  amine      and ethylamine, and blames me for having continued my
  researches      on the diatomic bases without having previously replied
  to his observations.
      Under these circumstances             I have been compelled to resume              the
   investigation of the action of dibromide of ethylene upon ammonia,
   and to reply, after nearly two years have elapsed without                     M. Cloez's
   paper having been published, to the series of objections which this
  chemist has raised against the theory of the diatomic bases.

     Since this continuation       of my experiments throws considerable
 light upon this     new class  of compounds,     I  beg leave to submit them
 to the judgment of the Royal Society.
    In order to render more intelligible the line of argument which
 M. Cloez has brought forward against the diatomic notions, it will
 be useful to recapitulate in two words the subject         of our controversy.
    M. Cloez admits that in the action of dibromide of ethylene upon
 ammonia, the molecule of ethylene splits into radicals belonging to
 three distinct groups, viz. the formic, acetic,         and propionic   series ;
 these radicals acting upon one molecule         of ammonia, in which       each
 of them    replaces  one equivalent   of hydrogen, give     rise to the forma
 tion of three primary monamines,          viz. Formenamine, Acetenamine,
and Propenamine.
    According     to the view which     I defend,   the molecule of ethylene
remains intact in the reaction, acting upon two molecules of ammonia
in which     2, 4, or 6 equivalents   of hydrogen are replaced respectively
by    1, 2, or 3    diatomic molecules of ethylene ; the dibromide of
ethylene gives rise to the formation of three diamines belonging to
the same family, a primary, a secondary, and a tertiary diamine.
    Expressed in formulae the two views may thus be represented            : —

    It   was    by careful examination of the physical                          properties of the
bases under consideration, and more especially by the absence of
simple equations capable                  of explaining the formation of the first and
of the third terms of the series, that I had first been led to doubt the
correctness of M. Cloiiz's formulae ; but I would not have expressed
this doubt,        if,   on repeating the analysis of the first base, of formen-
amine, the slightest doubt on the subject had remained in my mind.
I   did not at the time investigate the two other bases, and                            I    limited
myself to stating that the constitution of these bodies would probably
be found analogous                 to that which       I    had experimentally established
for the first term of the series.
    Let   us now examine                  the objections which         M. Cloez        has brought
forward against my argument.                             "According     to the hypothesis         of
M. Hofmann,"                              " the   action                    on the chlorinated
                         says he,                           of   ammonia
and brominated hydrocarbons cannot give rise to the formation of
chloride or bromide of ammonium the reaction consists simply in a
                                                     ;
combination         of the two           substances,      without the separation         of a third
compound       :   it   isa    case      of  symmorphosis or addition,
                   (C4       H.)   CL.   +   2H, N=(C4 H,)H4          Na,   2   HC1.
Experiment         proves, however,                that    the reaction     involves the elimi
nation     of hydrochloric              the fixation of the elements of
                                          acid     and
amidogen       :   apomorphosis and symmorphosis are accomplished side
 by   side, as indicated             by   the   following equation —   :
           C4   H4 CL.    +   2II3    N=(C4 H3)H, N, HC1               +   H3   N, HC1."
    M. Cloez would             be perfectly         right   if   during the reaction no other
base were formed except                    the first one.          But he forgets altogether
that in the process                under        examination — exactly        as in the mutual
reaction between bromide of ethyl and ammonia — several other bases
of more advanced substitution are produced.   The equations which
I   give for the formation                of    these bodies likewise involve the elimi
nation of bromide of ammonium, and in fact of considerable quantities
of this compound.

quantity in the action of dibromide of ethylene upon ammonia, be-

  longs to the second and third portions of the reaction          ;  it has nothing
  whatever to do with the formation of the first base.               M. Cloez,     as  I
  have pointed out, does not admit the simple equation which                   I  have
  given for the formation of this body            ;  he denies  that it is simply
  formed by the union of the two compounds reacting upon each
  other.   According    to his opinion       it  is produced in a secondary re
 action, occasioned    by the intervention of heat.           My experiments do
 not confirm this opinion.         A mixture of dibromide of ethylene and
 alcoholic ammonia allowed to stand for some time at the ordinary
 temperature, deposited a quantity of crystals, from which                I  was en
 abled to extract, without       distillation,    simply by successive        crystal
 lizations, absolutely pure salt of ethylene-diamine, as proved by the
 analysis of the bromide, the chloride, and the platinum-salt.
    In discussing the numbers which          I  have obtained in analysing the
 hydrate and the hydrochlorate of the first base,            M. Cloez quotes the
 results on which he      founds his own formula.             A glance at these
 figures will show unmistakeably that they agree much better with
 my formula than with the one which he defends.                     The following
 are the analytical    details of our analyses, together with the theo
 retical values required by each formula           : —

    Every experimentalist      has    incontestably the first right of inter
preting his analytical results      ;  knowing, as he does, his methods, he
 will do it generally much better than any other person. In the                   case
before us, however,     I   believe    very few chemists would          have    inter
preted the results of analysis as M. Cloez has done.                    As far    as  I
am concerned,     I  would always prefer to admit having lost 0-2 per
cent. of hydrogen, to calculating a formula requiring 2"25 per cent.
of hydrogen    less than had been obtained by experiment.                   I  would
prefer this especially in analysing a substance           like ethylene-diamine,
attracting carbonic acid     with the utmost avidity — a trace of which
would very appreciably lower the experimental hydrogen — and con
taining so high    a percentage       of hydrogen, that the         presence     even
of   a  small quantity of water would produce               a somewhat        similar
effect.

    The results which M. Cloez               has obtained in the analysis           of the
hydrochlorate are not less in favour of my views.                     He finds   1 "28 per
cent. of hydrogen more than required by his formula, whilst ad
mitting     my theory, he          would not have          lost more than 0"13 per
cent.
    I  have since examined several other salts               of ethylene-diamine,      and
the results       fully confirm the conclusions drawn from my former
analyses.       It would   be useless to quote these additional experiments,
but    I  will mention the characteristic numbers furnished by the ana
lysis of the anhydrous base, since the diminution of the equivalent
exhibits in a more striking manner the differences between the
theoretical values of the two formulae.                Ethylene- diamine retains the
water with the greatest energy, and it is in fact only by protracted
 contact with metallic sodium that it is possible to obtain this body
 in the anhydrous condition.               I  give the numbers obtained by com
 bustion, side by side with the theoretical values of the two formulae                    :

 These numbers require no commentary.
     It is not, however, in the results of analysis that                M. Cloez finds
 the chief support of his views           ; he quotes     an observation which at the
 first glance appears fatal to the diatomic notions.
     " But there is," continues M. Cloez, "                    a  capital fact (un fait
 capital) which completely settles the question at issue                    :  this is the
  vapour-density      of the free base."
     This density     has been found by experiment to be 1-42.
     "                                                            formula, referred
         The theoretical       density calculated       for   my                         to
 4 volumes, is 1-315       ;   the modified      formula of M. Hofmann, likewise
 referred to 4 volumes, gives the theoretical density 0^2-699.
     " These results appear to me decisive, and do not hesitate to I
 maintain      the formula of         the    new   series   of   bases, of which     Ifirst
 pointed out the formation."
     I entirely agree with M. Cloiiz as to the importance of the deter
  mination of the vapour-densities, but                 I  certainly arrive at      a  very
  different interpretation of his result.
                                                                              r2

    In repeating the experiment of this         able chemist,    I  have arrived,
as  might have been expected,         at exactly the same number.        But this
number refers to the hydrated            base, and it is easily    seen that the
hydrated molecule,          when in the state of vapour, must occupy 8
volumes.         In calculating the theoretical density corresponding           to
 the diatomic formula when referred to 8 volumes, we arrive at the
number       1 -35, which coincides in fact with the number obtained by
experiment.
    It   is obvious that under the influence      of  heat the hydrated base
 splits into anhydrous base (4 volumes) and water (4 volumes),
                        C4H10NaOa      = C4HsN3+2HO,
and that, instead of taking the vapour-density of the intact hydrated
 molecule,      M. Cloez has determined the density of         a mixture    of an
hydrous       base and water, which on cooling          combined again, repro
ducing the hydrated compound.            And here   I must   recall the observa
tions of several        chemists, especially those     of M. Bineau,       of M.
 Kekul£, and of M. H. Saint-Claire Deville,            each  of whom     has had
the opportunity of explaining the anomalous vapour-densities in the
transitory decomposition of the compounds submitted to experiment ;
and    I   would quote particularly    a note by Professor    Kopp*, in which
this    distinguished     physicist  has  treated the question of anomalous
vapour- densities in a general manner.
   In the      case before us, there is a very simple experiment, calculated
to remove all hypothesis from the above explanation,          — the determina
tion of the vapour-density of the anhydrous base.
   The experiment         made  with  a substance    the purity of which had
previously been proved by analysis, led to the number 2-00, which
indeed absolutely         coincides   with the theoretical      density   of the
diatomic formula         C4 H8Na referred to 4 volumes. This theoretical
density is 2-07, whilst the formula of M. Cloez, likewise referred to
4 volumes,       requires the theoretical density of TOO.
   The molecule of ethylene-diamine (formenamine) then, like                those
of all other well-examined organic compounds, corresponds to 4
volumes of vapour ; and the vapour-density of the base, far from
militating      against the molecular value which        I assign to this body,
furnishes on the contrary an additional and incontestable argument
in its favour.

   The preceding remarks are,             I  hope,    sufficient to establish the
formulae    of the diatomic ammonias upon            a  solid basis.      I  will there
fore only briefly allude to some results which                 I  have     obtained in
studying     the products       of decomposition of ethylene-diamine, and
which are not less       characteristic.     Submitted to the action of nitrous
acid, this base is decomposed          with evolution of nitrogen         ; in the first
stage   of the reaction     an indifferent crystalline body is produced, and
the final result of the process is        a large quantity of pure oxalic acid.
The nitrogen      evolved    during the transformation is accompanied by a
very volatile liquid,      the odour of which is somewhat similar to that
of aldehyde.        At the time when I        made    these experiments         I really
believed   the liquid to be aldehyde, but since           I failed in   obtaining the
crystalline compound with ammonia and in transforming it into acetic
acid,  I  abstained    from mentioning this reaction in my note to the
Royal Society.        I  have now scarcely a doubt that the volatile              liquid
was the oxide      of ethylene, isomeric with aldehyde,             since discovered
by M. Wurtz.         The transformation would be
                 C4  H„ Na +    2 NOa  = 4 N + C4   H4 Oa + 4     HO.
   In preparing the ethylene-diamine for my experiments,                     I obtained
as a secondary product a small quantity              of the    second    base,    which
M. Cloez has      described    as acetenamine,     and for which      I  now propose
the term diethylene-diamine.            This    base has exactly the same per
centage    composition, whether viewed as a diamine or considered as
the monatomic acetenamine            of M. Cloez.        The analysis of the        base
itself, and of some of its salts, fully confirms the results obtained by
that chemist.        But this     base is no primary monamine            ;  it does not
contain the radical acetyl,         C4 H,,   as  supposed by M. Cloez           ; it is a
secondary diamine containing two molecules of ethylene.                         Aceten
amine, as conceived        by M. Cloez, should be formed by the action of
chloride, bromide, and iodide of vinyl (C4 H, CI, C4 H, Br, C4 H, 1) upon
ammonia.        These reactions do not furnish             a trace   of the     base in
question.      But there is        a more conclusive        proof of the diatomic
nature of this body, the evidence           of which will not be contested by
M. Cloez, — this      is the determination      of the vapour-density. Experi
ment gave the number         2" 7.   The diatomic formula, C„ Hi0 N,, referred
to 4 volumes of vapour, requires 2-9.              According     to the monatomic
view,   a vapour-density of 1-45 should have been found.

                                         232
        The preceding experiments, although             fixing   in    a    satisfactory
     manner the composition and the equivalents of the two diammonias,
     do not unveil their molecular constitution         — their   degree      of substi
     tution.
        I have endeavoured     to solve this problem by submitting them to
     the action of iodide of ethyl,    a process    which     I have     first used for
    similar purposes, and which has since become of general application.
    This    process,  moreover, could not fail to furnish           a   final decision
     between the two theories.
        In considering with M. Cloez the two bases         as primary monamines
    belonging respectively to the formic and to the acetic groups,
                          CaH]                   C4H3]In,

                            H    J                  H    J
    it is evident that  each of them must     be capable     of absorbing       success
    ively  1, 2,  or 3 equivalents of ethyl, and of yielding three ethylated
    bases, two volatile, and one fixed.      On the contrary,      if  the bases were
    products of the successive     substitution    of the   same molecule for the
    hydrogen of two equivalents of ammonia,           if they   were respectively a
    primary and a secondary diamine,
                                                  (C4H4)"
    the first of the two must likewise give rise to the formation of three
    bases, whilst the second one would produce only two.
       Experiment     has verified this   latter anticipation.        In submitting
    ethylene-diamine to the alternate action of iodide of ethyl and oxide
    of silver,  I have succeeded in obtaining two volatile ethylated bases,
    and a third one, which is fixed.      These compounds are well defined              ;
    their composition was established by the analysis of their iodides or
    their platinum-salts.    Represented as salts, these bases contain —

      On repeating the same experiments with diethylene-diamine, per
   fectly analogous phenomena were observed, but the reaction yielded
   only one volatile base, which was immediately converted into a fixed
   base.       Analysed in a similar manner, and represented                     as salts, these
   bases exhibit the following composition                    :—
Salt of diethylene-diammonium                                  [(C^H,)",                     H4Nj"Is.

      The      same result     is   accomplished, but in       a   shorter and more elegant
   manner,       by   substituting iodide of methyl for its ethylated homologue.
   Already, at an earlier period,             I     have shown that iodide of methyl has
  a   remarkable         tendency to yield the last product of substitution.
   Thus, on treating iodide of methyl with ammonia, the iodide of
   tetramethylammonium                   is   alone obtained, together with          a   very large
   proportion of iodide of ammonium.                        The action of iodide of methyl
   with the ethylenated bases                 is   perfectly analogous. The last product
   of substitution       is   formed at once in notable quantity, and may be
   purified by    a    simple crystallization.            I  have obtained in this manner,
   without being embarrassed                   by   the intermediate compounds, the iodide
   of hexmethylated             ethylene-diammonium                and of tetramethylated
   diethylene-diammonium                 .
      These results require no further explanation.
      In the present          state      of   science we rely upon      a   certain number of
   considerations which               guide us in the construction              of   a    chemical
   formula.       These       are, — the       study of the origin of     a   body   ;   analysis   ;
   observation of the physical properties, and especially of the boiling-
   point  the determination of the vapour-density
           ;                                         and lastly, the exa

  mination of its metamorphoses.                     I    have endeavoured to look at the
  question under discussion from these several points of view                            ;   experi
  ment has given invariably the same reply.
      It   follows from this controversy that the diatomic alcohols imitate
  the monatomic alcohols in their deportment with ammonia. Ethyl
  alcohol produces, as  well known, three ethylated ammonias, the
                                    is
  molecules of which occupy                   4    volumes of vapour.

   In   a   similar manner we find that glycol, the diatomic alcohol of
ethylene, the discovery of which we owe to the remarkable labours of
M. Wurtz,       gives   rise   to three     diatomic bases, corresponding to                2
molecules     of ammonia, and representing likewise                   4   volumes of vapour.

discovered     about six years ago, but the true nature of which he failed
to recognize.      To complete the          series,     it   remains only to examine
the third volatile base and the oxide of tetrethylene-diammonium.
  The observations which         I     have      the honour           of submitting to the
Royal Society coincide         in   every point        with the first note upon this
subject which     I     presented nearly two years ago.                     I    have simply
carried out somewhat more in detail the sketch traced in my former
communication.
  In conclusion   may state
                   I           fact which has also been observed
                                       a
by M. Cloez, viz. that the action of dibromide of ethylene upon
ammonia gives rise to the formation of bases not directly belonging
to the series which we have discussed.                  In searching for the method
of purifying the ethylene        bases, I      have been obliged to examine also
the terms of the other group           ;    but since these               substances do not
necessarily belong to this part of the inquiry,                   I   omit for the present
to enter more     fully into their examination.

                                                    (Abstract.)
     In this paper the writer pointed out the fact that                              we have at
present no satisfactory evidence in books of what are the immediate
causes         of the       great      currents of the air and of the ocean;               and he
maintained that the liberated heat of condensing vapour is the cause
of   these         currents.           He then      proceeded     to show that all the great
winds terminate in comparative vacua created in particular localities
where much vapour has been condensed                              ;   and contended that such
vacua         enable    and cause heavier air to press and flow towards the
parts which have been rendered light,                        — to re-establish the equilibrium
of atmospheric                pressure,    — thus making heat the disturbing power
in the          aerial ocean,           and leaving gravitation          to act to restore       an
equilibrium.                The great primary currents of                 the    ocean   were   also
described, and they were shown to be so situated as to be under the
influence of the principal                     winds, which, in their passage over the
waters,        press on them, and force them forward                      as currents.       These
currents were                maintained to be of a velocity, extent,                     and depth
proportioned            to the strength and continuity                   of the wind, showing
that the pressure of the air on the water, whilst moving over
                                                                                                it,
                                                                                                is
capable of producing the movement which takes place.                                 When, how
ever, water            is   put into motion,           it   may be obstructed by land, and
turned from its direct course,                        and in that way be made to form
secondary currents.                     But    it   was contended that heat        of vapour,    set
free in the atmosphere,                   is   the force which disturbs the equilibrium
of   pressure,         and either directly or indirectly                produces all the great
continuous movements                      that take place both in the atmosphere and
the ocean.

 VOL. X.                                                                             S

and clear mercury is placed upon a smooth non-metallic                    surface,  a
watch-glass for example,         and covered to    a small depth with a watery
electrolyte, sulphuric        acid in particular, and two terminal platinum
wires from a voltaic battery are dipped into the electrolyte, one on
each side     of the globule, the mercury makes            a  movement towards
the negative wire, and a rapid and continuous stream of the super
natant liquid flows from the negative to the positive electrode over
the surface of the mercury, and back again by the sides of the con
taining vessel.       Also that when      a small drop of   a watery electrolyte,
especially sulphuric acid, is placed upon the surface of pure and dry
mercury, the latter connected with the negative                pole of a battery,
and a platinum wire from the other pole momentarily                   immersed in
the electrolyte, the drop of liquid is suddenly repelled and spreads
over the surface       of the mercury.
    2. These phenomena have been examined by                  Herschel*, Erman,
H. Davy, Runge, Pfaff, and othersf,              and  some   of the results     have
been recorded       in the    1st volume    of 'Gmelin's Handbook of Che
mistry,' page 486 (published             by the Cavendish       Society)   ;  but no
definite cause      of the     movements     seems to    have    been   discovered.
Herschel has, however, shown that the continuous movement of the
supernatant liquid is unaffected by the approach of strong magnets,
and that it is influenced by the chemical nature of the electrolyte                  ;
also that its direction is notably influenced by the presence                of vari
ous metallic impurities in the mercury.
    3. Being desirous of ascertaining the conditions under which the
movements are produced, the relations of the phenomena to ordinary
and recognized actions, and the more immediate cause or causes of the
movements,      I have   undertaken the following experimental investigation.
    4.  In describing the experiments         I  shall have frequent occasion to
 speak   of the continuous flow of the electrolyte, and of the sudden re
pulsion of drops of liquid already mentioned, and shall therefore
 speak of the former as the continuous action or movement, and of the
 latter  as the sudden or momentary one. Also in speaking of the conti
 nuous motion, I shall call it positive flow or movement when the super-

 Magazine,   S. 3. vol. xxvi. p. 185.

                                         237
natant liquid proceeds from the positive wire towards the negative
one, and negative flow, &c. when it passes in the opposite direction.
   5.  The usual method of manipulation I have adopted has been to
take a watch-glass of about 2 inches diameter and place in it by means
of a  small gutta-percha spoon capable of containing from 20 to 50
grains of mercury,    a   globule of that metal of about 30 grains weight,
adding sufficient of the electrolyte to just cover or nearly cover the
globule of metal, and sifting a few particles of finely powdered char
coal or asphaltum upon the surface            of  the liquid, to facilitate obser
vation of the movements         ;   next, using a Smee's battery        of  22 pairs
of plates 4 inches deep       and    1\ inches wide with terminal platinum
wires, charged with one measure            of oil of vitriol and   15 measures    of
water,  I  place the end   of the negative wire in the liquid about           ^th of
an inch from the mercury, and then carefully immerse the end                  of the
positive wire in the liquid on the opposite side of the globule, at a
greater distance from the mercury than the negative wire in the case
of an alkaline solution, and at a less distance           in the case of an acid
one, in order to prevent the mercury from touching                  the electrodes
by its movement and thus vitiating             the first and purest result.        A
polished oval space     2  iuches long, fths of an inch wide, and ths of     f
an inch deep, with a curved bottom, formed in a thick plate of glass
and substituted for the watch-glass, did not admit            of such satisfactory
freedom    of motion.     In doubtful     cases  of  movement,   a small porcelain
boat, such as is used       in organic chemical analysis, was sometimes
employed instead of the watch-glass            ; and in certain special experi
ments    a  V-tube was employed.           In nearly all   cases the mercury gra
dually became impure, and therefore fresh mercury was taken for
each experiment.
                     A. Conditions of        the Movements.
   6.  Two substances      are always required in these experiments, with
one alone the movements         never occur.
   7.  To determine whether          both the substances      must be in a liquid
state: — 1st.   A  portion of mercury in           a watch-glass was connected
with the negative     pole   of   a  battery and covered      with   a flat piece  of
platinum foil   ; a drop of solution of sulphate of potash was placed
upon the foil and the end of the positive wire dipped into it. No move
ment, either sudden or continuous, of the solution or mercury took
place.     On substituting for       the foil a circular piece   of filtering paper
varnished all round its edge and covered               with several drops of the
                                                                   s 2

                                        238
solution of sulphate of potash, the sudden repulsions were produced
readily, but were much less powerful than when the liquid was placed
alone upon the mercury.           2nd. Two circular clean spaces, £ an inch
wide, were scraped with        a  knife upon a horizontal plate of zinc       ;  one
of them    was amalgamated with mercury and left covered with a very
shallow layer of that metal, the other was also amalgamated,                but the
excess   of mercury    was wiped     off ;  each    of the spots was now covered
with   a shallow layer    of   a  weak solution of sulphate of alumina, the
zinc plate connected with the negative              plate of the battery, and the
end   of the positive platinum wire dipped in succession into the super
natant portions of liquid ; the solution above the thin layer of liquid
mercury was powerfully          repelled on making the contact, whilst that
upon the other spot was unaffected.                 Similar results were obtained
with a solution of caustic potash, also with a plate of tin.                    3rd.
A portion of Newton's fusible alloy           was melted under a layer -J-th       of
an inch deep      of a  solution of chloride of zinc, and the ends of the
platinum wires from the battery immersed in the supernatant liquid
until the alloy    cooled and solidified       ;  the zinc solution flowed from
the negative towards the positive wire as long as the surface of the
alloy remained in the liquid state, and ceased to flow immediately the
surface of the metal solidified.           Also    a  drop of a strong solution of
caustic potash placed upon the melted fusible alloy, the latter con
nected with the negative         pole and the former with the positive pole,
exhibited the usual momentary repulsions as long as the surface of
the alloy remained fluid     .  I therefore conclude that      both the substances
must be in a liquid state.
    8. To ascertain whether both the substances               must be conductors
 of electricity : — 1st.   I formed melted       globules of phosphorus in warm
 oil of vitriol, also in  a hot mixture       of  one measure    of distilled water
 and two measures of oil of vitriol, and immersed the wires in the usual
 manner, but no motion of the liquid occurred.                2nd. No movements
 were obtained with a globule         of bromine under warm oil of vitriol        ; a
 large globule of bromine was placed in a porcelain boat, and dilute sul
 phuric acid added until the bromine was partly covered ; the wires
 were then applied, but no movements              took place. Also the addition
 of sulphur and of selenium to the bromine did not ensure a different
 effect.   3rd. With a large globule of selenium under fused chloride
 of zinc no motion was obtained. 4th. I made similar experiments
 with globules of chloroform, also of bisulphide of carbon in dilute sul

                                        239
phuric acid, but obtained no movements.                   5th. No movements         took
place with globules    of chloroform in        a solution of caustic potash or         of
sulphate of alumina.
   9.   To determine whether      one   of the    substances must be metallic        : —
1st.   A definite layer of oil of vitriol         was placed beneath a layer           of
distilled water weakly acidulated with sulphuric acid, and the terminal
wires immersed in the upper liquid              ; no movements         occurred at the
boundary line of the two liquids.             2nd.    A    dense solution   of cyanide
of potassium     was placed in a small glass              beaker,   a  few particles of
charcoal were sifted upon its surface, and            a  layer of aqueous ammonia
\  an inch deep carefully poured upon               it.    A vertical diaphragm of
thin sheet gutta percha was then fixed so               as  completely to divide the
upper liquid into two equal parts          ;  the vessel was placed in         a strong
light, and two horizontal platinum wire electrodes                  from 66 pairs of
freshly- charged Smee's batteries immersed               ^-th of an inch deep in the
liquid ammonia on each side of the diaphragm.                  A   copious current of
electricity circulated, but no movements of the liquids at their mutual
boundary line could be detected.            A   small globule of mercury placed
in the lower liquid at once produced evident signs of motion.                       One
of the   substances  must therefore be       a metallic conductor of electricity.
    10.   To ascertain whether the capability of producing these move
ments was a general property of metals and alloys when in the liquid
state : — 1st. Bismuth was fused beneath a layer of chloride of zinc ;
tin was also melted under a similar layer, and the terminal wires im
mersed in the supernatant       liquid   ;   a steady      negative   flow occurred in
each case.      2nd. Cadmium was similarly treated under fused cyanide
of potassium, and      a  positive flow obtained.             3rd. Cadmium,        lead,
Britannia-metal, and fusible metal were melted separately, small pieces
of cyanide of potassium placed upon them and melted, the metal                      con
nected with the negative platinum wire, and the positive wire dipped
into the melted cyanide       ; positive repulsions took place with each
metal on making contact.           I  conclude from these experiments that
the power of rotating under the influence of an electrolytic current is
a general property     of metals and alloys when in a             liquid  state.
    1 1.  That the  mass   or body of the metal is not essential                 to the
production of the movements,         is evident from the fact that the move
ments have been readily obtained with thin layers                   of mercury upon
 amalgamated     zinc (7) and copper plates.

                                               240
      12.    I  have   endeavoured        to obtain the movements                without      the
  presence      of  an electrolyte, by passing an electric current through a
  small globule of zinc fused upon the surface                     of bismuth,          but the
  ready mingling of the melted metals, and their rapid oxidation, pre
  vented a reliable experiment being made.
      13.    It has already been shown, in the instances              of fused     salts upon
  melted metals (10), that the presence                of water      is not a necessary
  condition of the phenomena.
     14.     The power of producing the movements                  is a general        property
  of electrolytes as well as of liquid metals ; I                  have    experimentally
  found it in the following            classes    of substances      :— organic and in
  organic acids      ; water  ; aqueous      solutions of caustic alkalies*          ;  alkaline
  carbonates,      bicarbonates, borates, hypophosphites,               phosphates, sul
 phides, hyposulphites,          sulphites, sulphates, bisulphates, iodides, bro
  mides,     chlorides, chlorates, nitrates, and silicates            ; salts     of alkaline
 earths and of alumina           ;  salts   of tungsten, molybdenum, chromium,
 uranium, manganese, arsenic,              and of the malleable heavy metals ; also
  with fused salts, aqueous          solutions of organic salts, and solutions of
 salts    in alcohol.      The     salts   of tungsten, molybdenum, chromium,
 uranium, and manganese,                generally gave        the weakest         and      most
 variable results       ;  whilst    sulphuric      acid and solutions of alkaline
 cyanides       yielded very strong and definite movements.                         In    feeble
 cases    of motion     the globule     of mercury should be placed in a narrow
 porcelain boat, and        a   strong solution of the substance added until
 the metal is only covered            at its sides with the liquid          ;    and for still
 greater sensitiveness,        the experiment of placing a drop of the liquid
 upon the surface of the mercury should be adopted.
     15.    The    mass or body      of the liquid is not        essential    to the move
 ments     ;   mere films    of solution      adhering to the under surface                 of  a
 circular disc of brass, brought into contact with mercury under the
 influence of a voltaic current, exhibited the phenomenon readily.
     16.   To ascertain whether the current of electricity must                    pass from
 the electrolyte into the metal, or vice versa           : — 1st. A layer of mercury
was placed in a narrow glass beaker, upon                  it  a  shallow layer of chlo-
    * Herschel found no movements with solutions of caustic alkalies Vide Gmelin's
                                                                               (
Handbook, vol. i. page 490) ; I have readily obtained them with pure mercury in
solutions of pure alkalies by using strong solutions and a powerful electric current,
and placing only a small quantity of the liquid above the mercury so as to pro
duce the maximum of effect. Alkaline solutions in general act much more feebly
han acids.

reform, and above this, m one instance                             a dilute solution          of sulphate
of alumina              ;   and    in the other instance,           asolution of caustic potash,
and the wires from the battery dipped into the upper liquid                                              ;    no
movements at either of the contiguous                                 surfaces      occurred.            2nd.
Similar experiments were made, substituting in one case a definite
layer of oil of vitriol with a very dilute solution of sulphuric acid
above        it,
         and in the other case     dense solution of chloride of zinc
                                                    a
with    a    very dilute solution of the same salt above                           it,   for the chloro
form and its supernatant liquid                    ;    in each case only feeble movements
in the usual direction at the surface                        of the mercury occurred   the           ;
weakness           of the          movements      was    probably   consequence of the in
                                                                      a
creased distance                  of the   electrodes    from the mercury.               3rd. The lower
part of       a    V-tube of half an inch bore was just filled with mercury,
and     a    small quantity of solution of cyanide of potassium poured into
each leg       ;    on dipping the polar wires, one into the solution                              of    each
leg, the saline liquid rapidly flowed from the positive to the negative
leg until          it   was         inch high in that limb.              From      these experiments
I   infer that the electric current must pass from the electrolyte into
the metal, or vice vend, and that the continuous movements                                         are not
results of any power radiating from the electrodes.
    1   7.   It    is       not essential that the electric current should pass both
into and out of the metallic globule by the electrolyte                                   ;   with   a       glo
bule of mercury in rather strong sulphuric                                acid and either of the
polar wires immersed in the acid, the other wire being in contact
with         mercury, the movements                     occurred     :   also    with     the negative
wire touching                a    globule of mercury in         a   solution either of cyanide of
potassium or strong caustic potash and the positive wire in the
liquid, movements                   were readily obtained.
    18.      To         ascertain     whether the electrodes                were    essential        to the
movements,              I      placed      a   large globule        of mercury in the middle
part of        a        slightly bent horizontal glass               tube, 20 inches long and
^   an inch diameter,                 then filled the tube with              a     strong solution of
cyanide of potassium, and immersed the polar wires                                            a   short di
stance        in        the liquid at each          end   ;    a    strong positive flow of the
solution over the surface of the mercury occurred, but no movements
took place at the surfaces                       of the       electrodes,       except such as were
produced            by       the evolution of gas.            The   electrodes      evidently operate
merely as conductors of the electricity, and are not,                                    in   an abstract
sense, at all connected with the movements.

                                            242
     19. Herschel has shown that the approach                 of strong    magnets   has
no effect on the        motions (vide Gmelin's         Handbook,      vol. i. p. 490),
and     I have also found that the movements are not electro-magnetic.
A watch-glass — containing in             one instance a solution         of cyanide of
potassium, in a second instance a solution of hydrochlorate of am
monia, and in a third instance oil of vitriol, — was placed upon one of
the poles of a vertical horse-shoe electro-magnet capable of sustaining
about        100   pounds,    and the      end    of   a large     soft-iron   armature
which rested upon the other pole brought near the glass.                      The polar
wires from the Smee's battery            of twenty-two pairs were now immersed
in   the electrolyte on each        side of the globule, and the magnet con
nected with a separate battery            of large  surface.    The direction of flow
 of the electrolyte       was instantly changed to a circular             one all round
 the glass, and was reversed by reversing the polarity of the magnet.
 In    each case the direction        of motion of the electrolyte corresponded
 with that of the electric current beneath it              ; i. e. with a south pole
 beneath, the liquid moved             in the same direction as the hands of a
 watch      ; — this circular motion     was evidently a case      of ordinary   electro
 magnetic action, as it occurred equally well without the presence of
 a    liquid   metal in the electrolyte.          No real connexion of the mag
 netism with the movements              under investigation was detected.
      20. To ascertain whether the movements varied with the quantity
  of the electric current,       I prepared     a single series of sixty-six pairs of
  Smee's batteries,       forty of which were charged with spring- water, and
  the remainder with a mixture             of  one measure      of sulphuric    acid and
  fifteen measures        of water.      The movements obtained on applying
  the current from the whole series to very dilute sulphuric acid con
  taining a globule of mercury, were much more feeble and the amount
  of electrolysis much        less than when the current from             the twenty-six
  strongly-charged pairs alone was applied.                  On substituting distilled
  water for the dilute acid, the movements                     were  stronger and the
   electrolysis greater with the whole series than with the twenty-six
   pairs.      In all   cases the movements appear to be dependent upon
   the quantity of electricity circulating.
        21 .  It is highly probable, from the experiments just described, that
   the movements are intimately dependent upon electro-chemical action
   occurring at the surface of the liquid metal, especially as the amount
   of motion       varies with the quantity       of electricity which       passes from
   the     electrolyte into the metal, or vice versd          ; and   it would be very

                                              243
desirable     to obtain   a negative     proof of this by an experiment with            a
globule of one liquid metal in           a  bath of some other liquid metal, as
already attempted (12).
    22. -With every liquid yet examined the movement of the liquid
has invariably been attended by a simultaneous                    movement of the
fluid metal     ; and the greater the movement of the liquid              the greater
was the movement          of the  metal,     from which     I infer that the move
ments      of the two   substances   are mutually dependent.
     23.   The results in      general     indicate that the sudden movements
are   of the   same general character as the continuous ones, the effect
in the former case being heightened by the concentration of the
electric force within        a small compass,         together with the additional
electric energy always displayed at the moment of making contact
with     a  battery.
     24.   The   movements      require for their production          two substances
 (6) ; both these substances must be in a liquid state (7), and be
conductors of electricity (8) ; one of them must be a metal or a
metallic alloy (9) ; any metal or alloy will do ( 1 0), and only a mere
film of it is essential (11) ; the other must be an electrolyte, and
need not contain water          (13)  :   any electrolyte will do (14), and only
a thin layer       of it is requisite (15)       :  the electric current must pass
 from the electrolyte into the metal, or vice versd (16), but need not
 pass both into and out         of it by     the electrolyte   (17) ;  the electrodes
 are not essential     (18)  ; the movements         are not electro-magnetic    (19),
 they are dependent        upon the quantity of the electric current (20),
 and are intimately connected           with electro-chemical action (21)         ;   the
 movements        of the metal and electrolyte are mutually dependent            (22),
 and the momentary movements                 are   of the  same nature as the con
  tinuous ones (23).
      25. The pure or abstract conditions of the production of the phe
  nomena are, — a liquid metal          (or alloy) in contact with a liquid elec
  trolyte, and a     quantity current of electricity passing between them.
             B. Conditions of the continuance of the Movements.
      26.   With regard to the continuance of the movements: —                        1st.
  In   some cases the metal becomes                covered  with an insoluble       film,
  produced by ordinary chemical action of the liquid, which prevents
  the continuance of the action          ;  this occurs particularly    with mercury
  in strong solutions of sulphides, iodides, bromides, and chlorides.

                                               244
2nd.     If   the positive wire is connected                   with the mercury and the
negative      wire with the liquid previous to placing both the wires in
the electrolyte, films are in nearly all cases instantly produced (but
not with strong sulphuric acid) and interfere with further action ;
films are also frequently produced by a similar cause upon the end
of the mercury         nearest to the negative             wire when both the wires are
in the solution, and in many such cases the mercury creeps in                               a pecu
liar serpent-like form            beneath       the film towards the negative                 wire.
3rd.     In many instances the metallic globule                         becomes     of      a pasty
consistence      by absorbing substances               deposited upon its surface                  by
electrolysis, and the motion declines                  ;   this takes place         particularly
with mercury           in solutions of salts
                                          of ammonia, baryta, strontia,
magnesia,      and lime, but most with those of magnesia and lime; and
it occurs very rapidly            if,   instead of placing both the polar wires in
the electrolyte,           the negative        wire   is   immersed in the globule                 of
mercury.         It   is   evident from these facts,             that   it
                                                                        is      essential    to the
continuance of the movements,                  that the particles composing the sur
face  of the metallic globule should retain                     a   sufficient degree of mo
bility to admit of free motion.
   27. The best method of obtaining                        a   continuous movement            is   to
place    a    globule of pure mercury in                   a   watch-glass, barely cover           it
with dilute sulphuric (or nitric) acid, connect  with the negative      it
platinum wire and the liquid with the positive platinum wire of                                     a
battery of sufficient power to produce                 a       moderate       flow without over
heating the liquid         :   ten small Smee's batteries are sufficient.                   By this
means   I     have obtained undiminished motion for upwards                        of six hours.
            C. Conditions of the direction of the Movements.
   28.    In speaking of the direction of the movements,                             I       always
mean those of the supernatant liquid, unless otherwise stated, because
the true movements   of the mercury are generally less easily detected
than those of the electrolyte   the movements of the liquid are best
                                           :
observed by means of charcoal or asphaltum (5), and those of the
mercury by the aid of             a     few parallel scratches          upon the under sur
faceof the watch-glass.
  29. The directions of flow of the  metal and liquid are intimately de
pendent upon each other, for in every instance the metal moves in an
opposite direction to the electrolyte (see also
                                                22) and in those cases    ;

                                         245
where two opposite flows of the liquid towards the centre of the vessel
occur (as with a solution of sulphate of potash), the globule of
mercury is elongated at both ends into a pointed shape, and its two
ends   point toward the two          electrodes,    its largest diameter being
directly under the point of meeting of the flows of the solution, and
its acutest apex under the strongest flow.             The relation  between the
metal and liquid is apparently        of  a dual or polar character, the move
ments   of the two      bodies    being always opposite and equal.           This
mutual dependence       of the motions explains the        necessity  of both the
substances    being in a liquid state (7).
   30. With regard to the direction of the flows, there are three
cases to be distinguished        : — 1st. The     movements    obtained by im
mersing the negative wire in the metal              and  the positive one in the
electrolyte.    2nd. Those obtained whilst the positive wire is in the
globule and the negative         one in the electrolyte.       3rd. Those pro
duced   by immersing       both the wires in the supernatant liquid with
the globule between them.
   31. Upwards of 150 different liquids, including              organic and in
organic acids, alkalies, salts of alkalies, earths and heavy metals, also
organic salts, were examined         by the first of these methods, and in
almost every instance the flow of the supernatant liquid was positive,
the clearest exception being with a solution of persulphate of iron.
With concentrated sulphuric acid the motion (if any) was very feeble,
but with diluted acid of various degrees of dilution it was strongly
positive.    The flow of the liquid declined quickly with solutions
which contained an alkali-metal, apparently in consequence of the
mercury    becoming less mobile (?) by absorption of that metal ;
but with dilute acids it continued a long time ; with very dilute nitric
acid, in one experiment the movement               was sustained with    scarcely
any diminution      during     2| hours    ;  and with dilute sulphuric      acid,
in  a second    experiment it continued           6\  hours, and did not then
appear to slacken     :  the battery employed in this experiment con
sisted of ten small Smee's elements.                 A globule of strong sul
phuric    acid was     placed upon        a   surface of mercury, the latter
connected     with  the    negative     pole,   and the end of the positive
wire dipped into the acid      ; much gas was evolved from the anode, and
the liquid was not repelled on making contact, but collected in                  a
heap   around the wire       ; —a    globule of solution of caustic potash

                                     246
  similarly   treated  exhibited   repulsion   on making      contact.      It  is
  evident from these uniform results that the direction of flow obtained
  by immersing the positive wire in the electrolyte and the negative
  one in the mercury is almost uniformly positive.
      32.  The  movements    obtained by this method are not produced by
  the act of deposited substances     dissolving in the mercury, for they
-
  occur equally well whether hydrogen gas is set free and escapes or
  alkali-metal is deposited and dissolves in the mercury, until in the
  latter case the diminished mobility of the globule interferes with the
  result.
       33. Considerable difficulty was experienced in examining liquids
  by the second method, in consequence       of the rapid and in many        cases
  instantaneous oxidation or filming      of the metallic globule     ; but by
  using very dilute liquids      and  immersing    the negative wire from
   seventy-two small Smee's elements during only a moment at              a  time,
  this difficulty was in most cases sufficiently overcome         to allow di
   stinct starts of the mercury to occur in the particular             direction
  beneath    its film, and thus to indicate an opposite motion of the
  supernatant liquid, although in nearly all cases the movement of the
   electrolyte itself could not be detected.       Upwards of 100 liquids,
   consisting of organic and inorganic compounds — acid, alkaline, and
   neutral — were examined, and in more than three-fourths of them di
   stinct movements of the metal were obtained, which were in every
   instance in a positive direction, thus indicating a negative flow of
   the electrolyte.    In  some liquids, viz. oil  of vitriol, moderately di
   lute nitric acid, strong solutions of sulphate of ammonia, iodide of
   ammonium, and sulphite of potash, very dilute solutions of bisul-
   phate    of potash, iodide of potassium, nitrate of cobalt, hydro
    cyanic acid, cyanide of potassium, and acetic acid, — visible move
    ments of the liquid itself in a negative direction were also ob
    tained.   The movements of the liquid     and  of the metal very quickly
    ceased.   These experiments show that the direction of flow ob
    tained by placing the positive wire in the metal and the negative
    wire in the electrolyte is always negative.
        34. The movements     obtained both by methods      1 and 2 appear to
    be produced by a mutual attraction     of the liquid and metal      ;   in the
    former case the mercury attracts an electro-positive element            of the
    liquid (hydrogen or an alkali-metal),     and produces     a positive flow     ;

                                            247
and in the latter case         it attracts an electro-negative element (generally
oxygen), and produces a negative flow.
   35. Herschel        found by the third method of operating, that with
pure mercury in acids and saline liquids the flow was negative,                          and
was weaker as the base was stronger, and more rapid as the acid was
stronger and more concentrated               ; and that in solutions            of nitrates
two opposite flows occurred, one from each wire (vide Gmelin's
Handbook, i. 490).                 I have found by an examination of pure
mercury in various liquids the results exhibited in the following Table.
The arrows indicate the direction of flow of the liquid,                     -t- being po
sitive and     -+  negative      ;  and the numbers affixed to them afford                  a
rough approximation of the velocity or magnitude of the movements.
The battery employed consisted of twenty-two small Smee's elements.
The substances were dissolved in water, and the solutions were of mode
rate strength unless otherwise stated.               Manifestly impure substances
were     rejected,    and fresh mercury was taken for each                     experiment.
The results obtained           were in many cases verified several times              : —

Numerous interesting phenomena of motion and of colour, especially
with solutions of salts of the earth-metals and with metallic iodides,
were observed     during the examination.
   36. On examining these numerous results we find                   : — 1st. That all
alkalies and some alkaline salts produce a positive flow only.                       2nd.
That    some alkaline and many neutral salts produce both positive and
negative    flows.     3rd. That        some    neutral      and many acid         salts,
and nearly all acids, both organic and inorganic, produce                   a negative
flow only.      The stronger influence of            acids,   compared to that of
alkalies (14, Note) in the production of these movements, is pro
bably the reason why various salts of alkaline reaction give a negative
as well as a positive flow, and why many neutral salts containing a
strong acid (chlorides, for example) give              a negative    flow only.       No
substance    of alkaline reaction        has been observed        to give a negative
flow only, nor any strongly acid substance                  to give only     a  positive
flow.     An alkaline or electro-positive            substance     as the electrolyte,
produces therefore by the 3rd method a positive flow, and an acid
or electro-negative substance          produces a negative flow.           Numerous
analogies   may be detected         in the behaviour of similar salts on ex
amining the Table.
   37. The movements            obtained by the 3rd method appear to be

                                          250
results of    a   similar mutual attraction of the mercury and the ele
ments     of the liquid       to those obtained by methods        1 and 2.       The
mercury moves towards the cathode in acids because its positive end
has acquired, by the aid         of the electric current, a stronger affinity for
the negative element of the liquid than its negative end has for the
positive element,        and moves towards the anode in alkalies because
its negative end has acquired           a stronger attraction for the positive
element    of the liquid than its positive end          has for the negative ele
ment.      I do not,      however, give either this or the previous explana
tion (34) as an ascertained fact, but merely as a temporary hypo
thesis to aid further investigation.
    38. The amount of positive flow produced by the 3rd method in
strong aqueous hydrocyanic acid, or strongest solution of ammonia, is
comparatively small, apparently on account of their inferior electric
conductivity      ; but  if the  smallest amount of ammonia is added to the
hydrocyanic acid, the positive flow obtained is very strong                ;  also, if
instead of ammonia          a  small quantity of caustic potash, soda, baryta,
 strontia, magnesia, lime, or even alumina is added to the acid, similar
effects are produced : a little strontia or lime causes the nearest part
of the mercury         to dart up the watch-glass more than           half   an inch
 towards the positive electrode,           if  the battery is sufficiently strong.
 Silica had no effect.           The addition of oxide of zinc, dioxide or
 protoxide of copper to the acid, reversed the direction of the flow,
 and dioxide        of mercury neutralized the positive movement and
 diminished the conduction.             The strongest positive flows obtained
 by the 3rd method were with strong solutions of alkaline cyanides,
 and the strongest negative flows with sulphuric acid.
     39. The behaviour of liquids             upon mercury in V-tubes by the
 three methods is not essentially different from their behaviour in                  a
 watch-glass    ;   the former, indeed, may be safely predicted from the
 latter.    Sufficient pure mercury was placed in            a V-tube of half an
 inch bore just to fill it at the bend, then a strong solution of sulphate
 of alumina poured upon it half            an inch deep    in each leg   ;   on con
  necting the platinum wires from twenty- two pairs of small Smee's
  batteries with the solutions in the two legs, the liquid at once flowed
  from the negative to the positive leg           ; but by lowering the negative
  wire into the mercury, it flowed from the positive to the negative leg              :
  no flow    of the liquid      was produced by placing the positive wire in

                                                        251
the mercury aud the negative one in the solution of the negative leg.
If the mercury was too deep to allow the liquid to pass, the solution
insinuated itself down the sides of the mercury in the positive leg
(the positive wire being in the solution, and the negative one in the
mercury)         ;    but by using a suitable depth of mercury, the whole                                  of
the liquid flowed from the positive into the negative leg.  This is
the usual behaviour of an acid liquid (or of one in which the nega
tive   flow of method 3 predominated)                               with a suitable quantity               of
mercury in            a    V-tube.            With     a strongly       alkaline liquid           the only
difference           of behaviour             is,   that when the two wires are in the solu
tions of the two legs, the liquid flows from the positive to the nega
tive limb (see 16),                 i.   e.   opposite to the direction of flow with an
acid.
     40. There            is   a   fixed relation between the direction of the electric
current and the direction of each of the classes of movements                                     ;    for in
every case where the former                            is   reversed,   the latter         also   becomes
reversed    ;    but this effect is, of course, not observable in those cases of
method      3    where two opposite and equal motions to the centre of the
metallic globule exist.
     41.  I     have examined the influence                      of the chemical nature of the
metallic globule upon the movements                              obtained       by   the 1st method, in
the following manner.    The globule of mercury was first connected
with the positive pole and the liquid with the negative pole for about
ten seconds,           and then the wires placed as in method                          1
                                                                                       ;   a    temporary
negative flow was produced for                         a    few moments         with certain liquids,
apparently in consequence       of the mercury absorbing minute portion               a
of   an    electro-negative constituent of the solution (?), and that sub

battery used was       a series       of 72 small Smee's elements.            It appears
from these experiments, that the direction of flow obtained by im
mersing the positive wire in the electrolyte and the negative one in
the globule is strongly influenced by the chemical composition of
the metallic globule.
     42. The chemical nature               of the globule exercises an equally
 powerful influence upon the direction of the movements obtained by
 the second method.             If the   mercury was first connected with the ne
 gative wire and the solution with the positive wire for a few seconds,
 and then the connexions reversed or made as in method 2,                   a temporary
 and strong positive           flow of the electrolyte for           a few moments was
 obtained, apparently            in consequence        of the mercury absorbing a
 little alkali-metal or other electro-positive constituent of the liquid,
 and that substance causing a positive flow of the solution until the
 whole of it was redissolved.                This positive flow did not occur while
 there was above a        certain quantity of the alkali-metal in the mercury.
 The reversions       were     obtained in the following liquids :— dilute and
 strong solutions of caustic potash               ; weak solutions of caustic soda,
  baryta, and lime        ;    carbonate of baryta         ;   chlorides of potassium,

 of the globule),       and calcium ; iodide and bromide of potassium ;

  of  soda  ; sulphate of lime         ; arsenic acid   ;  cyanide of potassium     ;  and
  oxalate of ammonia         ;   also in solutions of hypophosphite and diphos
  phate of soda     ; — but not in very dilute nitric acid, nitrates of                am
  monia, potash, soda, baryta, strontia, magnesia,                  lime, uranium, zinc,
  cobalt, nickel, copper, or dioxide of mercury                ;  sulphates of ammonia,
  potash, or alumina.            It  is worthy of notice that these two series are
  almost precisely the reverse of those                named with method          1 (41);
  t. e. those liquids     which have          the property of reversing the flow of
  one method have           not that property with the other method, except
  hypophosphite and diphosphate of soda.                    The explanation suggested
   (34), of the cause of the true movements                    of methods 1 and 2 does
  not appear applicable to these phenomena of reversion.
      43. Herschel      has      shown that with pure mercury in solutions of

                                             253
 alkalies or   of sulphate of soda (vide Gmelin's         '
                                                             Handbook, i. 490, 492),
 if  a little alkali-metal     be introduced       into the globule by connecting
 the latter for a few moments with the negative wire (the other wire
being in the solution), a positive flow occurs on placing both the
wires in the electrolyte with the mercury between                    them, and con
tinues until all the alkali-metal is redissolved            ; and that similar effects
are produced       by adding small quantities of an easily oxidizable metal
to the mercury       — for  example, potassium, sodium, barium, zinc, iron,
tin,   lead,   or antimony, in the order given              ;  but not by bismuth,
copper, silver, or gold.          I have     found that zinc added to mercury
under a solution of sulphate of potash changed the direction of flow
from positive and negative (obtained by method 3) to positive only                    ;
cadmium did the same, but more feebly, and tin still more feebly                      ;
bismuth had no apparent              effect,   but by using treble the electric
power its effect was also similar, antimony also the same               ;  gold had no
apparent effect even with         a current from 72 pairs of Smee's elements.
No positive flow        was obtained by connecting the mercury with the
negative wire and the solution with the positive wire for                 a short time
in a liquid consisting of acid and water,              and then placing both the
wires in the electrolyte.          Although there       are many liquids (most       of
those which contain an alkali-metal) in which a temporary positive
flow (or increase of positive flow) may be obtained by the 3rd me
thod by first placing the negative wire in the mercury for                     a short
time and then returning it to the electrolyte, there are but few
(among which are diphosphate of soda and arseniate                      of ammonia)
in which      a temporary       negative flow is produced by placing the
positive wire in the mercury and then returning it to the solution.
It  has been constantly observed           with the 3rd method, that purity of
the mercury is essential        to the production       of uniform results.      From
these various facts it appears that the chemical nature of the metallic
globule strongly influences the direction of the movements obtained
by method        3 ;   also  that    an   electro-positive      globule   produces   a
positive flow, and        an  electro-negative        substance    dissolved in the
mercury produces a negative           flow.
    44.   In some   instances   of the 3rd method — for example, with solu
tions of chloride of magnesium and nitrate of magnesia (35, Table),
even the degree      of dilution    appears     to determine the direction of the
motion.      No variation in      the direction     of the movement obtained by
                                                                      T 2

                                          254
either method was observed             on varying the strength of the electric
current, or on varying either the actual or relative distances                 of the
electrodes     from the metallic globule.
    45. The presence           of an electro-positive metal in one portion of
the surface of the mercury will (by generating a small electric
current) sometimes cause rotation of the electrolyte after the battery-
wires are removed, especially if the mercury is touched with a pla
tinum wire beneath             the surface of the liquid      ;  this is seen most
frequently       with mercury into which            some   alkali-metal     has   been
deposited    .
    46. The general phenomena of the movements                        may be briefly
redescribed thus        : —A. When       both   the wires are in the electrolyte,
and the mercury             between   them, several     cases occur     : 1.   With   a
strongly alkaline liquid,           a positive   flow of the solution from the
positive wire over the mercury to the negative wire occurs                 ;  2. With
 a  strongly acid liquid, a negative flow of the solution takes place                  ;
 and 3. With        a  solution of    a neutral or slightly alkaline       salt, espe
 cially of   a salt composed         of a  strong acid and      a   strong base, two
 flows occur,     a negative     one from the negative wire towards the centre
 of the mercury, and a positive one from the positive wire towards
 the centre of the mercury, — the negative one being generally the
 strongest.       If  in this 3rd case the mercury contains any impurity,
 or  if a substance       be caused by any means to dissolve in the mercury,
 the movements are notably affected               :  an electro-positive     substance
 (zinc, alkali-metal, &c.) increases          the positive flow so as partly or
 completely to overpower the negative movement                     ;  and an electro
 negative substance increases the negative flow, in               a few instances,   so
 as to overpower the positive movement.                 These influences are also
 frequently detectable when           liquidate     used  of alkaline or acid     reac
  tion, as in cases       1 and 2.
     B. When the negative wire is in the mercury and the positive
  one in the liquid, two cases occur : 1 . With pure mercury, the
  motion is positive in nearly all liquids, whether acid, alkaline, or
  neutral  ;    and   2.    With mercury containing a small amount of an
  electro-negative substance, imparted to it by reversing the connexions
   of the wires for a short time, a temporary negative flow is produced
  in certain liquids, chiefly nitrates, but not in certain other liquids.
      C. When the positive wire            is in the mercury         and the negative

                                      255
one in the liquid,      also  two cases occur    :    1.  With pure mercury,
the motion is negative in all liquids — acid, alkaline, or neutral;
and, 2. With      mercury containing     a small      quantity   of an electro
positive substance     imparted to it by reversing the connexions of the
wires for   a few    moments, a temporary and strong positive flow is
produced in certain liquids and not in certain others — and these
liquids are almost precisely the reverse of those named under B, 2.
    The general influence of electro-positive substances dissolved in
the globule is in all classes of cases to produce a positive flow, and
of electro-negative substances to produce            a negative   motion  ; and
the influence of electro-positive substances            dissolved in the liquid
is, in cases of    A only, to produce     a positive flow, and       of electro
 negative  substances    to produce  a negative    flow.
    47. The primary motions of the liquid and metal are, in all cases,
wholly at their surfaces       of mutual contact      ;  whilst the movements
 observed   are only secondary effects,     useful in enabling us to infer
 the direction    of the original    motions   :   the masses of liquid     and
 metal serve merely as conductors of the electricity, and as stores of
 material for supplying the acting surfaces.         The    movements  obtained
 are singularly symmetrical,      probably in consequence        of their essen
 tially dual or polar character.
    48. The essential      nature or principle of the movements appears
 to be electro-chemical motion, i. e. definite motion directly produced
 by electro-chemical action.
    49.    To illustrate the action,    I have     constructed    an apparatus
 consisting of two pairs of electrodes      of platinum foil and mercury,
 suspended at opposite ends of two copper wires upon a central pivot,
 and rotating in an annular channel filled with dilute sulphuric acid           ;
 but the power was too feeble to produce revolution of the necessary
 moveable parts    : it was not more than sufficient to produce a manifest
 tendency to motion.
     In conclusion, I   beg leave to suggest a trial     of the sudden starts of
 the mercury by momentary currents as signals in electro-telegraphic
 apparatus.

  Sir BENJAMIN C. BROD1E, Bart., President, in the Chair.
    The following communications           were read  : —
I. "Abstract         of  a series  of Papers and Notes concerning the
    Electric     Discharge through          Rarefied Gases and Vapours."
     By Professor PlCcker, of Bonn, For. Memb. R.S.                           Re
     ceived December        6, 1859.
I. Action of       the magnet     on electric currents transmitted       through
                                tubes   of any form.
     The action    exerted by a magnet on the luminous electric discharge,
passing through a tube or any vessel of glass which contains residual
traces    of any   gas or vapour, may be generally       explained, if we regard
 the discharge as a bundle of elementary currents, which, under the
 influence of the magnet, change their form, as well as their position
 within    the tube, according to the well-known           laws  of electro-mag
 netic action.
     The concentration of the discharge into          one free arch only takes
 place   if the arch be allowed to constitute a part       of a line of magnetic
force.       [According    to theory, there is no electro-magnetic action at
 all exerted on any element of        a linear electric current which proceeds
 along such      a line.]   This condition, for instance, is fulfilled in the
 case of an exhausted sphere of glass, through which the discharge is
 sent by means        of two small apertures, if the sphere be put on the
 iron pieces     of an electro-magnet in such a way that the two aper
  tures coincide with any two points of a line of magnetic force.
     There is another case of electro-magnetic equilibrium, which takes
                                                   " epibolic curve," i.
  place   if  the current proceed along an                                e. along
  a   curve, falling within the interior         surface of the vessel, whose
  elements,    regarded    as elements    of an electric current, are perpendi
  cular to the direction of the electro-magnetic force and impelled by
  this force towards the surface.         An exhausted cylindrical tube, when
  equatorially placed on the iron pieces of the electro-magnet, presents
  the simplest instance of this case.         All elementary currents are con
  centrated    by the magnet along one straight line, which, according to
 the direction of the discharge and to the magnetic polarity, occupies

                                         257
either the highest or the lowest position within the tube.                When the
axis   of the tube    makes      an angle    of 45° both with the axial            and
equatorial direction, the epibolic curve is found to be            a fine  spiral.
    If neither  of the two conditions mentioned            above can be fulfilled,
i. e. if the current cannot proceed either along a free magnetic or an
epibolic curve, no voltaic arch        will  be obtained    ;  the current    will   be
disturbed, and its light diffused. This, for instance, is the case when
the above-mentioned cylindrical tube is placed axially on the two
poles   of the magnet     :  there will be seen above each of these poles             a
luminous epibolic straight line, lying within               the horizontal      plane
which passes through          the axis  of the tube,     one on each side     of this
axis ;   but there exists neither a line of magnetic force nor an epi
bolic curve, joining the extremities of the two epibolic straight lines
between the poles     ; hence diffusion      of light.
    There are other classes of phenomena not at all indicated and ex
plained by the laws of electro-magnetism.              In many    cases the magnet
extinguishes the light       of  the current, icithout altering       its intensity.
 I sent the discharge      of Ruhmkorffs apparatus           at once through two
exhausted tubes, communicating by a copper wire.                    The first   tube,
about eight inches long and highly exhausted, was brought over the
iron pieces of the electro-magnet into an equatorial position, while
the second one was placed at some distance from the poles.                    Whilst
the magnet was not excited,            both tubes     became     luminous by the
transmitted current     ;   when it was excited, the light of the first tube
entirely disappeared, while the appearance                of the   second    did not
 undergo the least change.           Hence we conclude that the disappear
 ance  of the light  does not prove the extinction          of the current.
    Similar results are obtained when a tube having the shape of the
annexed    drawing is brought with its narrow middle part between the
 two iron pieces.     In this    case the light disappears     where the magnetic
 action is greatest, but not in the other parts of the apparatus.              Some
 times before the light disappears, its colour is entirely changed, while
 in other cases, the magnetic force being less strong, only the change
 of colour   takes  place.      The violet colour of sulphurous          acid and     of
 vapour of bromine is thus transformed into a fine green, and the blue
 of chloride of tin becomes a beautiful colour of pure gold.

                                      258
   If the magnet   be strong enough, a phenomenon           of the  same kind is
obtained when in the above-mentioned experiment the larger tube
is put equatorially on the iron pieces, and the current concentrated
in the lowest part of the tube.        Then, where      the magnetic action is
greatest,  the illuminated epibolic straight line is interrupted, termi
nating in two cusps, which in the case of sulphurous acid show             a green
colour.    Waving light goes from one cusp to the other.               In  a room
quite dark, highly diffused light is seen moving from one pole to the
other, along lines of magnetic force.
   When the    sphere   previously mentioned is placed on the iron pieces
so that the two opposite apertures fall within the equatorial plane,
the transmitted current will be concentrated along an epibolic curve,
which in this case is one of the two arcs of the great circle within
the equatorial plane, supplementary to each other, and joining the
two apertures.     If  it be the lower arc, turned towards the magnet,
the epibolic current starting from the positive wire terminates in a
cusp, where the action of the magnetic force, supposed generally to
be strong, is greatest,     while from the       opposite side waving light
enters the sphere.      In this  case there is only one cusp.
II.   The light   of the negative wire      bent   by the magnet into curvet
                              and surfaces.
    In order to render the     new class  of phenomena       most brilliant and
well defined, larger tubes of       a  cylindrical    shape,   into which long
wires enter at both ends, are to be selected.           The light surrounding
the negative wire must be as bright as possible,          and the well-known
dark    space  by which     it is bounded must          be very    broad.     The
magnet acts on this light in      a peculiar way, having no analogy with
phenomena hitherto observed.            I easily   discovered the law giving
in all cases the exact description of the phenomenon.
   The light emanating from any not isolated point of the                 negative
wire, and diverging in all directions towards the interior surface of the
surrounding tube, is bent by the action         of  the magnet into the mag
netic curve,  which passes through this point.           According to the law
already mentioned, such      a  curve is the only one along which an elec
tric current   can   move without     being disturbed by the magnet.             It
equally represents the form which a chain of infinitely                small iron
needles,   absolutely flexible    and not subjected         to   gravity,   would

                                                         259
assume,     if attached with            one     of its points in the point of the             negative
wire.     It    is well known           that         a   magnetic curve is completely deter
mined by         a         of its points. Therefore the whole light,
                     single one
starting from all the different points of the negative wire, toill be con
centrated within a surface generated by a variable magnetic curve.
The form of this "magnetic surface" varies according to the form
of the negative wire, and its position with regard to the poles of the
electro-magnet.   When the negative wire lies within the equatorial
plane, the magnetic surface assumes the shape of                              a   vault   ;   when the
wire lies within the axial plane, the whole surface is contained within
the same plane, and generally bounded by very well defined magnetic
curves.
  The     negative         light partly         depends upon the substance                of the wire.
Particles       of   it,
                 either pure or combined with the included gas, are
carried off to the interior surface of the tube, which, when platina
wires are used, consequently                    is   blackened.         If not acted    upon by the
magnet,        all the part of the surface surrounding                            the platina wire
becomes black         ;    if   acted upon, only that line along which the surface
of the tube      is   intersected          by   the magnetic surface          is   blackened.       In
this case, therefore, the particles separated from the wire move along
magnetic curves.
 I      think   it   most       probable that the luminous                   electric currents in
question are         double currents, — going from the wire                       to the glass, and
returning from the glass to the wire.
   The importance of the                use      of magnetic         curves, or lines     of magnetic
force, in experimental researches,                        has been shown by several philoso
phers, especially by Mr. Faraday.                               Hitherto only filings of iron
enabled us to give in peculiar cases an                        imperfect image of these curves.
We may         now trace through space such a curve in the most                                distinct
way and illuminate               it   with bright electric light.
III.    The light          of   the positive             wire and its spirals under the mag
                                                netic action.
   The origin of the current takes place at the positive wire.                                   If the
negative wire  not too far from the positive, most striking pheno
                      is
mena are obtained when the magnet     acting on the formation ofis
the electric current.              In   these experiments            I   made use principally        of
highly exhausted                spheres,      about two inches in diameter,                    through

                                             260
which two platina wires, either parallel or perpendicular                     to each
other, were conducted, whose               shortest distance was about 0-8 of an
inch.
      When, for instance,      the sphere with parallel wires is put on the
iron pieces of the electro-magnet so that both wires fall within the
equatorial plane and are vertical, the whole circular section of the
sphere     passing through        the negative wire is almost uniformly illu
minated by violet light,              while the light of the positive electrode
appears at one       of its extremities, whence it        moves, along an epibolic
curve, to the corresponding extremity of the negative wire.                    On   re
versing the polarity        of the magnet, the illuminated epibolic curve
passes from one        extremity of the positive wire to the other, while the
appearance        of the   negative     light,   after the reversion, is not at all
altered.
      When the positive wire terminates within the                 sphere,    we get,
according to the magnetic polarity, either an epibolic curve, or dif
fused light,       starting from the free extremity of the positive wire
towards the surface of the circle illuminated by the negative light.
      When the sphere with crossed wires is put on the iron                  pieces so
that the negative wire becomes vertical, the positive one horizontal
and equatorial, — the whole surface of the axial circle passing through
the vertical       wire is illuminated,          except the lower part, which is
bounded by the magnetic curve starting from the lower extremity                      of
this wire.       There is no light seen on the positive wire, which is in
tersected       by the magnetic circular surface.            On this      surface   the
shadow      of the positive wire is most distinctly traced.             [Shadows of
this description are, in the general case, produced by beams of light
starting from all points of the surface of the negative electrode, and
moving along the corresponding magnetic curves.                   Not   even the po
sitive wire deviates such beams of light from their curved paths.]
Nothing at all is changed by a change of magnetic polarity.
  When the sphere is turned round its vertical diameter till the
horizontal and positive wire passes from the equatorial direction into
the axial, the whole surface of the axial circle passing through the
negative       wire is filled with illuminated magnetic curves.         The positive
light starts from the middle of the horizontal wire, and moves round
it,   within    the equatorial plane,        towards the negative      wire without
interfering with the light emanating from this wire.                 It   constitutes

                                     261
a fine  spiral, separated by  a  dark space from the positive wire, taking
its origin in a cusp, and expanding more and more when it approaches
to the negative     wire.   In changing the polarity of          the  magnet,
instead of the single spiral starting from the middle of the wire, we
obtain two such spirals starting from the two extremities of the wire,
impelled against the glass of the tube and revolving in the opposite
sense.
    The phenomena just described and all the various phenomena of
the same class may be fully explained by the laws of electro-magnetic
action.    For this purpose,    we admit that the first element       of  each
elementary current starting from any point of the positive wire is
directed towards the negative wire.         This supposition follows from
the observed fact, that the positive wire,      if parallel to the negative,
becomes luminous along its whole length on that side which is turned
towards the negative wire.       When    acted upon by the magnet,       these
first elements,   bound to the positive wire, are allowed to move freely
along this wire.     The single point, or the    system   of points, where all
the first elements    meet before leaving the wire, may easily be deter
mined.     The following    elements,   subjected to the same force, are
entirely at liberty to obey it.     This action may generally       be defined
thus : — Imagine    an element  of the elementary electric current starting
 from any point of a magnetic curve, which connects both poles                ;
imagine also the molecular currents (as assumed by Ampere) within
 the magnet continued round this magnetic curve. Then, if the
 element   be perpendicular    to the magnetic curve, the full action of
 the magnet turns it round the curve in a direction opposite to the
 direction of Ampere's molecular currents.        If it be not perpendicular,
 this action is to be decomposed      along the normal to the magnetic
 curve within the osculating plane.
    I think it worthy of notice, that the      same electro-magnetic laws,
 applied to magnetic action on an already formed electric current,
 either bound to the       conducting    wire   or free to move in space,
 equally hold in determining the path of the current when acted upon
 by the magnet during its formation          between     the two electrodes.
 Thus   a moving electric particle, under magnetic action and tending
 towards the negative     electrode,   may be regarded        as describing   a
 curve, in an analogous way as     a projected material point does — acted
 upon by gravity.

                                          262
          IV. Electric         currents returning on their own path.
   When only one of the wires of RuhmkorfF s apparatus is in contact
with one of the electrodes of a long and large exhausted tube, while
the second wire is isolated, or, what is preferable, communicates with
the earth, an electric current is obtained entering the tube and re
turning on its own path.           The   existence    of the two currents        is most
evidently proved by the magnet, which,                acting differently on both,
divides the double current into two of the same intensity.                          This
intensity is much increased by touching the tube with the hand at
any distance from the electrode which communicates with Ruhm
korfF s apparatus.
  A double current of exactly the            same description is obtained in a
narrow tube,         which may be one foot long, communicating                    with   a
larger tube, both electrodes        of which    are connected        with the wires of
RuhmkorfF s apparatus.            When the extremity of             the narrow tube is
touched with the hand, a current starting from the principal                        tube
enters the narrow one, proceeds           to its extremity, and finally returns
to the principal tube      :   which is proved by the magnet.
   When, through a tube whose shape is represented                     by the drawing,
                          a                             n
the discharge was sent from           A to B, the current, passing from               the
narrow tube into the surrounding larger one, was, when it arrived at
the extremity of the narrow tube, partly branched off in an oppo
site direction towards         A, and then, changing        its course again, moved
towards B.
  There        is   another case where returning            currents     are    obtained.
When the discharge             on its way   through   highly exhausted tube
                                                        a
passes from a large space into a         narrow channel, a part of the current
is reflected,       and returns on its own path within              the larger space       :
which is again proved by the magnet.
   Mr. Gassiot first       observed   and described what he calls               "recipro
cating currents,"       and the separation      of such currents        by the magnet.
That   celebrated      philosopher had the kindness himself to show me his
experiment, and even enabled             me to repeat       it,   by obliging    me with
one   of his    fine Torricellian-vacuum     tubes.   I     do not exactly know his

                                           263
opinion on the nature of those currents             ;   for my part,    I think they
are induced currents returning on their own path.                   This opinion   was
supported by the subsequent             experiments.
    I got   a   hollow and highly exhausted sphere of glass about 2 inches
in diameter, into which no wire entered, and placed it on the iron
pieces     of the electro-magnet.           On touching the sphere with one
of the wires of RuhmkorfFs apparatus, diffused light was spread
through it. By the excited electro-magnet this diffused light was con
centrated      into  a  luminous stream, which moved along the magnetic
curve determined by the point touched, from this point to another one
in which the interior surface of the sphere is intersected a second time
by that curve, and evidently returned in the same curve from the second
point to the first.        When the point where the sphere is touched by
the wire falls within the equatorial plane, no part of the magnetic
curve in question, which in this case is          a tangent to the sphere, enters
it.    In this peculiar       case, the phenomenon is entirely changed, the
light of     the induced current constitutes          an ascending or descending
stream      proceeding along the epibolic curve within the equatorial
plane.        In reversing either the polarity             of the magnet or the
direction of the discharge, the ascending stream is transformed into
a   descending       one, or vice versd.        But   there   is no   change    of the
appearance       in the general case.
    When the        sphere   is simultaneously     touched by the two wires of
RuhmkorfFs apparatus in two different points,                  we get  within it two
independent luminous currents showing no reciprocal action on each
other   ;   and it is only when both points belong either to the same
magnetic curve or to the epibolic one, that there is but one luminous
 arch along that magnetic or the epibolic curve.
    All this      shows   that Gassiot's induced streams are subject to the
same laws as the direct currents are, formerly observed                 by myself.
    In all experiments mentioned in this                 section,  the discharge of
 RuhmkorfFs apparatus may be replaced by                   a spark taken from the
conductor of an electrical machine.
             V. Fluorescence produced          by the electric discharge.
    Glass shows in sunlight scarcely any kind of fluorescence.                 A  glass
 tube,    including     residual    traces  of  a  proper     gas,  becomes     highly
 fluorescent when the electric discharge is sent through it             : a fine green

                                                264
 colour appears         in the case of common German glass,                    a fine blue
 if the   glass contain lead.          Hitherto I      have tried in vain to get speci
 mens    of  a different and well-determined chemical composition, which,
 without doubt, would offer new and curious cases of fluorescence*.
 A beautiful        fluorescence       is obtained by surrounding             suitable ex
 hausted tubes, through which the discharge is passing, with                     a  solution
 of   aesculine,    of fraxine, of sulphate of quinine, &c. If the tubes
 include residual traces of hydrogen, scarcely any fluorescing light is
 seen  ;  if they   contain traces of nitrogen, on the other hand, the fluores
 cence is very intense.            All  depends     upon the nature and the density
 of the    gas.    In certain     cases, a very faint electric light, scarcely seen
 by the eye, produces a brilliant fluorescence,                   especially when the
 light,  if belonging       to the negative wire, is concentrated by the magnet.
 M. Geissler, in constructing his              tubes, first observed     (about eighteen
 months ago) the fluorescence               of gases, which even continue luminous
 some seconds after the interruption              of the current   :  further researches
 will explain this curious phenomenon.
      VI.    The spectra      of the electric current in rarefied          gases and
                                            vapours.
     The light of the electric discharge through large                   tubes    is rather
 too much diffused to give a distinct spectrum.                 I made   trial, therefore,
of sending the discharge through               a  capillary tube, and fully succeeded.
 I  got  a  brilliant luminous line within the tube, of which                  a  beautiful
spectrum was obtained by replacing the distant illuminated slit, which
Fraunhofer        used     in   his   observations,       by the self-luminous         line.
Afterwards        I   employed       Babinet's      goniometer.       The slit of this
instrument was illuminated               by the current within the capillary tube,
which was placed before              it at    a distance    of about 04 of        an inch.
The aperture of the slit could                   be changed ; but where          it is not
particularly mentioned, it was                   seen   under   a    constant    angle    of
3'.      After having interposed the prism of heavy flint glass, the
refracted image of the slit, in the general case, was found to be
divided into a less or greater number                  of differently coloured bands,
appearing each under the               just-mentioned constant angle of three
minutes.        Hence it follows that the analysed electric light is com-
   * From     the beautiful experiments        recently  made by E. Uecquerel,      we may
deduce a satisfactory     explanation    of these phenomena.

                                                   265
posed     of   a   certain number       of rays,         whose       refrangibility is                  a discon
tinuous one.            The refraction of          each ray is determined by the angle
between the middle lines               of the      image        of the slit,         seen directly, and
of the corresponding refracted band. This angle is independent of
the aperture of the slit, and remains the same if the slit be reduced
to a physical straight line.
     There cannot exist          a deflected       band smaller than 3'                       ;   i.   e. no such
band      appears under an angle less than the angle under which the
aperture is seen directly, without the interference of the prism.                                                This
law holds through           all my numerous observations of electric spectra.
[I find difficulty in applying it to the                          case      of the common solar
spectrum.]          There are, in many instances,                     bands observed which are
seen under an angle greater                  than 3'       ;   but generally such bands are
resolved into two or more bands                of single breadth.                    In   some instances
where      the angle in question does not reach the double of 3', there
appears in the middle part of the band a bright line                                      ;       larger bands
are generally divided by small, well-defined,                             dark lines.
     In order       to distinguish      the rays of different refrangibility                                 in the
different gases,        I denoted      such    a   ray by adding to the symbol belong
ing to the gas the Greek letters a,                      /3,   y, indicating          the succession               of
the corresponding bands in each spectrum.                              Accordingly, for instance,
the band Ny, appearing under an angle                             of      6',   is   divided by           a      dark
line into two       ;   the bands NS and NO, having each                             a   breadth of 10',
are divided by two dark lines into three                             single bands.                     The   bands
Hga and Sn Cl3y,            5'   broad, show        a    bright middle line.
     The     space between        two bright bands              is   either absolutely black, or
of   a   greyish tint, or     of   a   faint tint of that colour which                             is   indicated
 by   the position       of the    space within           the spectrum.                  With regard               to
these faint tints, the eye,            by   the effect of contrast,              is   commonly               a   very
bad judge          of colour, and      there may easily be                 a    deception, admitting
a    succession      of colours in the spectrum which in reality                                        does not
exist.
 I       cannot enter here into the details                          by   which      I    obtained exact
measures           of the minimum               of the different rays. All
                                             refraction
measures were           taken without deranging the adjustment of the gonio
meter    ;    for ascertaining its constancy, each spectrum was compared
with the spectrum of hydrogen.                       From            the angles           of refraction,          I
deduced the indices          of refraction, and            hence the corresponding lengths

                                                       266
of   waves expressed              in millionths of         a   millimetre in order to get abso
lute numbers immediately comparable with those of others.
   The discharge through a capillary tube containing residual traces
of pure hydrogen is of a deep red colour ; the spectrum obtained from
it consists of only three bright bands : — of a most splendid red one,
Ha ; of a bluish-green one, H/3, nearly as bright ; and of a fainter violet
one,   Hy. The following                   table contains the angle                of refraction       <f>,   the
index of refraction fi, and the length of the wave                                 X,   corresponding to
each   of the     three rays             Ha, H/3, Hy,                  of the dark lines of
                                                               as well as
Fraunhofer,       C,     F,      G, in order to        compare their reciprocal position —                :

                                                                 F C

From this table              it    results that H/3 exactly coincides with                        F,   while
Ha and Hy approach                      very near      C   and G.
     The spectrum of pure oxygen                        was only obtained after several                       un
successful   trials to procure proper tubes, the gas being in most cases
absorbed     by the electrode during the passage of the current.
   The spectrum of nitrogen    one of the richest in colours.
                                                  is            Its
less refrangible part of peculiar nature, having, from the exterior
                                   is     a
red to the limit of the yellow, seventeen equidistant small dark bands.
     Most characteristic   the spectra of carbonic acid (oxide of
                                        are
carbon), iodine, bromium, chlorine, chloride of silicium, chloride of
phosphorus, chloride of tin.             The spectrum of the last-mentioned
substance    is   one        of the most remarkable. The colour of the gas
within   the larger parts of the tube                           through       which        RuhmkorfFs

                                                 267
apparatus is discharged, is               a   dark blue, in the capillary part of the
same tube the finest gold-colour,                    while the light surrounding                      the
negative wire is of a fawn-colour.                 [The finest          appearance        is obtained
with    larger tube containing residual traces of the -vapour of this
        a
salt, put on the iron-pieces of a powerful electro-magnet ; within the
blue light of the discharge numerous golden flashes                                 are produced,
and variously directed by the magnetic force.]
  A piece of metallic sodium within an atmosphere of rarefied hy
drogen does not alter the spectrum of this gas when at the ordinary
temperature ; but when it is heated, a single brilliant yellow band is
added       to the three original bands of hydrogen.                          The middle of the
new     band exactly coincides with Fraunhofer's                              dark line D.           The
vapours of the metal are                  condensed        in the cooler parts of the
apparatus.
  Phosphorus, when treated in the same way, instead of adding new
bands to those of hydrogen, at a certain temperature even extin
guished the spectrum of the gas.
      In the   case of mercury, I gave to the tube the shape of
the annexed        drawing. The electrodes merely entered the
two flask-shaped ends of the tube, where they were covered
about half an inch with mercury.                        Peculiar bands were
obtained without          heating the mercury                 ;    when it was
heated, the spectrum became most brilliant.
      When     traces   of two       gases, not acting on each other,
are mixed        within   a spectrum -tube, the spectra                       of both
are simultaneously obtained.
      A result of       some     importance,            following        from     the
researches       of which        I    have      here    given      an        abstract,
is,   that in all such dioptrical               researches,       where Fraun
hofer's dark lines were used in order to get exact measures,                                 these dark
lines may with great advantage                   be replaced by the middle lines                    of the
new     brilliant     bands    of the         gas spectra.         To    these     bands the most
convenient breadth may               be   given   in   each particular case by regulating
the aperture of the apparatus.                         A   spectrum-tube            of hydrogen,
exhibiting       three well-defined bright bands,                       is   well suited for this
purpose.        During    a    whole year        I     made       use   of such     a    tube, which
remained absolutely unaltered.
      Every gas being characterized                by   its spectrum (even               by   one   of the
voL. X.                                                                                  u

                                          2G8
bands   of the spectrum, the position          of which is measured),         we get a
new   kind of chemical analysis. In this way only we may ascertain
the residual contents of the exhausted tubes, and the changes they
undergo, either suddenly by the discharge, or gradually afterwards.
Thus, for instance,       a  spectrum-tube in which traces               of vapour of
sulphuretted carbon were enclosed,             presented    most unexpectedly the
combined spectra of hydrogen and oxide of carbon.                     Hence we con
clude that there remained also within the tube some traces of vapour
of  water,  which was decomposed           as well as the sulphuretted carbon.
Traces of sulphur were deposited on the interior surface of the tube,
while oxide of carbon and hydrogen remained within it.
    Nearly all examined combinations of hydrogen with metals, with
chlorine,   &c,  were almost instantly decomposed.                  The spectrum of
hydrochloric    acid was found to be         the combined one of hydrogen and
chlorine.     Sulphur and       arsenic    were    deposited     from their combi
nations with hydrogen, the former constituting                    fine dendrites, the
latter well-defined large bands        :  the spectrum in both cases was that
of pure hydrogen.       Seleniated hydrogen showed within the capillary
tube a fine yellow tint, but this        tint  was converted during the passage
of  the discharge into a     brilliant red    one  ; the change of colour started
from one of the extremities of the capillary tube, and reached                      the
other one after     a few seconds.        The spectrum        observed     during this
change   of colour  was in the first moment a most distinct one, showing,
for instance,   between    H/3 and     Hy two similar      systems    of two brilliant
blue bands separated by a black one about double as large                   ;  but this
spectrum entirely disappeared,           as  in dissolving     views, being by and
by replaced by the spectrum of hydrogen.                 A   few minutes after the
discharge was stopped the red colour turned again into the primitive
yellow one, the gas decomposed              by the discharge having been re-
composed     again.    Thus the     same experiment could be repeated              any
number of times                      .
    [Similar chemical effects were ascertained in a different way in the
case of sulphurous acid, which, if included within a larger tube, shows
a  fine stratification   of narrow violet bands.              When the discharge
passes    during     several    minutes,      the    stratification     is  altogether
changed,    the narrow violet bands being transformed into the large

tion of the gas is restored by heating the electrodes                 ;   but in every

new experiment the phenomena became less distinct than they were
before.]
    I   think it     most       probable that, properly speaking, electric light
does not exist        ;   the   light which    we see belongs to the gas, rendered
incandescent by the thermal action                   of the current.           Accordingly,      in
our case, the colour of the appearing light depends upon the nature
of the gas and the concentration of the current. This opinion is
strongly supported by the observed fact, that the temperature of the
capillary tube increases considerably in some instances.                            Considering
that this increase of temperature has its source in the heat of the
residual gas, which is too small in amount to be indicated by the
balance,        this heat being produced by the electric current, and com
municated to the heavy substance                   of the tube     ;    we have scarcely         an
idea    of the     enormous temperature             of   the gaseous electrode           included
in the capillary channel*.

    The      late Professor Daniell, in his         Fifth Letter on Voltaic Combina
tions (Phil.Trans. 1839, part 1), describes some experiments made with
seventy series of his constant battery, and states (page 93)

arc of flame between              the electrodes         was found      to be attracted and
repelled by the poles of            a magnet,      according as one or the other pole
was held over             or below   it,   as was first ascertained           by   Sir H. Davy    ;

    In the Philosophical             Magazine of         July   1858,       Mr. Grove        has de
scribed an experiment made                   by    him with one of my vacuum-tubes,
2   feet    9   inches long, in which he ascertained             that the discharge of            a
Ruhmkorff's induction coil could                    be stopped         by   bringing     a   magnet
near the positive terminal wire, but that this effect was not obtained
when the magnet was made to approach the negative.                                 The mercurial
vacuum-tube in which Mr. Grove observed                           this phenomenon was

and myself have repeatedly endeavoured to obtain the same result in
similar and in other vacuum-tubes (and since that period I have ex
perimented with upwards of two hundred), all our efforts have been
hitherto unsuccessful.
    The experiments          I   am now about to describe                   were made        with two
carbonic acid vacuum-tubes, the vacua being obtained in the same
manner as described by me in the Philosophical Transactions, part                                       1,

    A, in    the annexed figure, represents             a glass tubular vessel              (No. 146),
24 inches long         and   6   inches diameter in its wide part                   ;   at one end,
attached to the platinum wire (a), is a concave copper plate 4 inches
diameter, at the other end is a brass wire attached to the platinum
wire (6). B represents a glass tube (196) 5 inches long (in its wide
part), in which two small balls of gas-retort coke are attached to the
platinum wires a' and             b',   and are placed about              3   inches apart, all the
platinum wires being hermetically                   sealed             in the glass.         In  B  the
                                                                                                    A

placed in the further part of the tube, beyond one of the wires.
    An electro-magnet            is   placed at   C,    and       is   constructed so as to allow
the two helices to be separated             ;     and    by   these means the larger vessel
can,    if   required, be placed between                 them, and any portion of the
luminous discharge may be thus exposed to any part of the magnetic
field.

    When the terminals of         an excited induction       coil are attached to
the wires of either of the above vacuum-tubes                 A or B, luminous
discharges     are    obtained,    the   negative wire      ball   or plate being
covered     with    a  luminous cloud-like      glow extending        towards the
positive  ;  but   the stratifications are not developed,          except by the
magnet,     and these become         more clearly defined as the magnet is
caused    to approach, or as the power is increased,           when they are de
flected according to the direction        of the discharge, or of the polarity
of the magnet.        But with the induction coil, no matter how                I  re
duced the intensity of the discharge, or varied that of the electro
 magnet,    in no instance could       I  produce in these, or in any of my
 vacuum-tubes, a similar result to that which            Mr. Grove obtained in
 the vacuum-tube so unfortunately broken            ;  the experiment evidently
 requires a certain balance of power between the electric discharge
 and that of the magnet,       and this    I had hitherto      been   unsuccessful
 in obtaining.
     I  next experimented with my water-battery              (Phil. Trans.     1844,
 and Proceedings, 26 May, 1859), which            I   have recently had carefully
 cleaned and recharged with rain-water           ;  the luminous discharge in
 both the vacua       A and B      was obtained with less than         1000    series,
 and this discharge, as well as that from the full series of the battery of
 3520 cells, was under certain conditions, hereafter described, entirely
 destroyed or interrupted by the power of the magnet.
     At first the interruption or break in the luminous discharge                  ap
  peared to be caused by the sudden action            of the  magnet,   as if it  were
 merely momentarily         blown out, for the discharge recovered               itself
  while it remained under the influence of the magnet              — the   luminous
  discharge under this condition gradually reappearing stratified and
  strongly deflected    ; but  I  subsequently ascertained       that, by carefully
  adjusting the intensity of the battery discharge, and the force or power
  of the electro-magnet, this recovery in the discharge could                 be en
  tirely prevented.
     On approaching the vacuum A towards the electro-magnet, the
  luminous discharge from the battery assumed              the same form as that
  from the induction coil       ; but when the vacuum was placed between
  the helices,   so as to permit       the armatures or poles of the magnet
  to touch one or each side of the glass vessel at about its centre, the
  discharge disappeared      ; as   soon  as the magnet       was removed,      or the

                                        272
vacuum-tube withdrawn           from its influence, the luminous discharge
was reproduced.
    To  test whether a complete disruption             of the electrical current
had taken place, two gold-leaf electroscopes           were attached, one to the
zinc and the other to the copper terminal of the water-battery                 ;  the
leaves diverged with considerable energy          ;  connection was then made
from the electroscopes       to the wires of the vacuum-tube      ;    the luminous
discharge became visible, and the leaves of both electroscopes                   par
tially collapsed   ;  the vacuum-tube was then placed as before, between
the armatures of the electro-magnet, and immediately the magnet
was excited, the luminous          discharge disappeared, and the leaves of
the electroscopes       diverged to their original maximum extent, thus
proving the disruption to be complete.
    If the  smaller tube B is placed across both poles of the magnet,
the luminous discharge at its centre assumes the appearance of being
nearly separated       into two parts, each part showing a tendency to
rotate round the pole of the magnet on which it is placed, the one
in an opposite direction to the other.             I  endeavoured       to obtain   a
 disruption of the battery discharge when in this state, and possibly
 with a more powerful electro-magnet this experiment would succeed                   ;
 but although    I   reduced the intensity of the battery discharge and
increased the power of my electro-magnet,             I could not in this manner
 obtain an actual discontinuity of the battery discharge           ;   but when the
 same vacuum-tube was placed in a longitudinal             or equatorial position
 between    the poles,     or even approached them within three or four
 inches in    that    direction,   an   immediate interruption          of the dis
 charge took place.
    When     both vacuum-tubes are placed in the battery circuit, the
 interruption   can    be shown in a very       striking manner      :   the general
 arrangement of the apparatus represented in the figure shows how
 this experiment is made.           A  is fixed   on a wooden     support.       One
 wire (6) is attached to the copper terminal of the battery, the other
 wire (a) being connected to one of the wires in B, which is held by
 the hand, the other wire (6') being connected with the zinc terminal
  of the battery, gold-leaf electroscopes being placed as before. In
 this manner all the apparatus is fixed except B, which being held by
  the hand, and the connecting wires being flexible, can be placed in
  any required position.

                                       273
    As long as the vacuums are at a sufficient distance from the
action of the magnet, the luminous discharge is visible in both, and
the leaves of the electroscopes partially collapse ; but immediately the
discharge in       B  is placed in   the position described in the previous
experiment, between the poles of the magnet, the discharges in both
vacua    instantly    disappear, and    the leaves of the electroscopes      di
verge to their original maximum.
    The actual position of what is termed the magnetical field, around
and between the poles of a magnet, has been generally delineated by
means     of iron filings placed   between the poles on a sheet       of paper.
Assuming       the lines in which these       particles arrange themselves    to
represent the direction of the power of the magnet, or the magnetic
field, they also explain the actual position through which the vacuum-
tube should       be placed to obtain      the preceding result, and in this
manner to show by experiment that a voltaic               discharge which has
sufficient intensity to pass through a space of upwards of          6  inches in
attenuated carbonic acid gas is not only interrupted,           but absolutely
 and entirely arrested by magnetic force.
     Postscript (received Jan. 19, I860). — In repeating the experiments
 with Dr. Tyndall in my laboratory, the disruption of the luminous
 discharge in vacuo from 400 cells of the nitric-acid battery was
 obtained    :  some most beautiful      and striking results were obtained
 from the same battery on the        1 6th  inst., on repeating the experiment
 in the Theatre        of the Royal     Institution, with its large electro
 magnet,    Dr. Faraday and Dr. Tyndall being present.
     The large      receiver  (146) was placed between the poles of the
 electro-magnet, the lines of force going through it ; electrodes
 equatorial.      The stratified discharge was extinguished. Subsequently,
 through the sinking of the battery, or some other cause, the stra
 tifications disappeared, and the luminous glow which filled the entire
 tube remained.         On now exciting the magnet with        a battery of ten
 cells, effulgent strata were drawn out from the positive pole, and
 passing along the upper or under surface of the receiver, according

                                       274
to the direction  of the current.       On making the circuit of the magnet,
and breaking it immediately, the luminous strata rushed from the
positive and then retreated,        cloud following cloud with a deliberate
motion, and appearing as        if swallowed by the positive electrode.
   The amount of electricity which           passed  appeared  materially in
creased   on exciting the magnet         ; once the discharge was so intense
as to fuse  half an inch    of the positive terminal.
    After this had occurred, the discharge no longer passed as before
when the terminals of the battery were connected with it ; but on
connecting the positive end of the battery with the gas-pipes of the
building, the discharge passed.
    The discharge could        also   be extinguished   by the magnet    ; and
 the time necessary to accomplish this, furnished       a beautiful indication
of the gradual      rise   and    reduction   in the power of the electro
 magnet.
 III.  " On Vacua       as  indicated by the Mercurial Siphon-Gauge
       and   the  Electrical      Discharge."      By J. P. Gassiot, Esq.,
       F.R.S.     Received January         19, 1860.
    That the varied condition of the stratified electrical discharge is due
 to the relative but always imperfect condition       of the vacuum through
 which it is passed, is exemplified by the changes which take place
 in the form of the striae while the potash is heated in a carbonic
 acid vacuum-tube.        In order, if possible, to    measure   the pressure
 of the vapour,    I   had a carefully prepared siphon mercurial gauge
 sealed  into a tube fifteen inches long, at an equal distance between
 the two wires A, B.
    This  tube was charged with carbonic acid in the manner described

                                          275
by me in a former communication.              When exhausted by the air-pump
and sealed, it showed a pressure indicated by about 0-5 inch difference
in the level of the mercury      ;   the potash was then heated     ;  the mercury
gradually fell, until it became perfectly level.
    Dr. Andrews       (Phil. Mag. February 1852) has shown, that with
a  concentrated solution of caustic potassa, he obtained with carbonic
acid a vacuum with the air-pump              so perfect as to exercise      no ap
preciable tension, as no difference in the level of the mercury in the
siphon-gauge could be detected.
    On trying the discharge in the vacuum-tube after the potash had
cooled,    I  found it gave the cloud-like stratifications, with a slight
reddish tinge     ; consequently not only was the vacuum not perfect,
as denoted     by the form of stratification, but in this tube the colour
 denotes that even a trace      of air remains, — probably that portion in the
narrow part of the siphon-gauge, which, from its position, was not
displaced by the carbonic acid.
    The potash      was    subsequently heated       until the discharge       was
reduced to     a wave-line, with very narrow striae       ; in this state moisture
 is seen adhering to the sides of the tube         ;  but even in this state the
 difference  in the level of the mercury in the gauge did not ever vary
 more than -05       inch.    As the potash cooled, the discharge altered
 through all the well-known phases of the striae, the mercury again
 becoming quite level.
     At first almost the slightest heat applied          to the potash alters the
 form of the stratifications       ;  as the heating is repeated,     longer appli
 cation is necessary    ; but it shows how sensibly the electrical discharge
  denotes the perfection     of  a vacuum, which cannot be detected         by the
 ordinary method of mercurial siphon-gauge.

 I. " On the alteration            of the Pitch        of Sound by conduction
         through different          Media."       By Sydney Ringer, Esq.,
         late Physicians' Assistant at University College Hospital.
         Communicated by Dr. Garrod.                    Received     November 25,
         1859.
     Having     observed     that the pitch of cardiac murmurs            underwent
 various alterations dependent on the constitution of the conducting
 body, the following experiments were devised                 to extend and render
 more certain the observations made on the human subject.                    In most
 of   these experiments a tuning-fork was used, and in all the alterations
 in pitch were tested by the ear.
     In making       these experiments, the note         of the vibrating fork    was
 first taken with the instrument            close   to the ear and without being
 in contact with any resounding body.              It was next placed on the body
 which was experimented on, and lastly listened to through the medium
 of the     same.     The alteration in pitch obtained by           these two latter
 methods gave always the same results in kind, but not in degree,
 the alteration being always greater when the note was heard through
 the medium       of the conducting body.
                                          Solids.
     A board     13    feet long was balanced on the back             of two chairs.
 The    note   of the fork      was   then taken, without its being in contact
with the board.          The fork in vibration being next placed          at one end
of the board, the        ear was placed on the other, and the note was then
found to be most appreciably lowered in pitch.
     As boards     composed     of various kinds of wood       were not obtainable,
tables were used.          Of all the woods thus          tested,  deal lowered the
pitch most     ;  indeed the lowering of the pitch was always in proportion
to the porosity of the wood           f .
     The pitch     was found to fall the greater the distance from the          fork.
     *Bone lowered it.
     Glass raised the pitch.
    Iron raised it.
    t Dr. Wylde, the Conductor of the Philharmonic Society, kindly examined and
fully corroborated, in those experiments marked with an asterisk, the conclusions
I had previously come to. All the experiments were confirmed by numerous
persons of acute ear.      In no case was their opinion at variance with my own.

                                       277
   The two last, in conducting the       note, greatly lessened the intensity,
much more so than the substances          described above.
   The muscular        substance   of the heart lowered the pitch.       Skin
and cellular tissue, on the contrary, raised it.
                                     Liquids.
   A     large foot-pan was filled with water, and the vibrating fork was
partly introduced       into this, but as no sound could be heard in this
manner without some resounding body, a small circular piece of wood
was used for this purpose        ; the fork placed on this was first listened
to  ;   the fork with the piece of wood was then placed under the water        ;
one ear was then immersed in the water, and the note so taken ; the
pitch     was then found to be most decidedly heightened.      Any objections
to this method       of performing the experiment were obviated by the
following extension of it. The eyes being firmly shut, any variation
in the position of the fork, that is to say, whether it was moved closer
to or further from the ear, was accurately determined by the alteration
in the pitch.
    Next, a glass tube      29 inches long, with a diameter     of fths of an
inch, was closed       at one end, with a diaphragm      of  gutta percha, oil-
silk, or bladder (the same diaphragm being used in each set of com
parative experiments).         The tube was then filled with the fluid to be
examined.        The   ear being applied to the diaphragm, the stem     of the
vibrating fork was introduced above into the fluid, care being taken
that neither the finger nor the fork was in contact with the glass.        Ex
periments conducted in the above manner gave the following results.
      * Water raised the pitch most appreciably.
      * Alcohol still higher.
      Ether higher.
      A solution of protocarbonate of       soda of the  same specific gravity
 as the blood, raised the pitch more than pure water.
      *  A saturated solution raised it still higher.
      * Sulphate of baryta, suspended in water, raised it higher than any
 other tried fluid.
      Prussian blue, suspended      in water, raised it more than water, but
 less than the sulphate      of baryta.
      From the above results it appears       that simple fluids heighten the
 pitch in proportion to their diminished specific gravity, and that the

                                     278
addition of any substance     (though   increasing the specific gravity),
whether in solution, or merely suspended       in the water, heightens it      ;
that particles in suspension, indeed, heighten it more than solutions.
    The fact of different fluids raising the pitch in variable degrees,
excludes the possibility of the rise being due to the glass, or any
other material used, unless the fluid varying in weight altered the
pitch, by affecting the tension of the diaphragm        ; but the fact of the
alteration in pitch bearing no relation to the specific gravity of the
fluid excludes this source of error.
    The following experiments      were  devised    to test the influence of
running water on the pitch.
    Into  an india-rubber   tube, 13 inches long, and fths of an inch
diameter,    a funnel was inserted ; immediately below this a small
opening was made, just large enough to admit the end of the fork.
Water was kept constantly running through this, and the stethoscope
(covered with a diaphragm) applied to different parts of the tube ;
by this method the pitch was found to be most appreciably raised the
further from the fork the stethoscope was applied to the tube.            The
elevation of pitch was easily recognized at         a  distance of 2^  inches
(the length of the pulmonary artery and adjoining part of the aorta).
    The stethoscope having been unfortunately left behind, Dr. Wylde
could only apply the ear directly to the tube, and therefore could not
speak    so decidedly as he did concerning the other experiments, but
he was    of opinion that the pitch   was raised as stated above.
    It was next attempted to be ascertained       whether the mere motion
of the water increased or diminished the         rise  of the pitch.    It  ap
 peared   that the pitch was very slightly raised       by the mere motion
 of the fluid, the    same point   of the tube being listened to.          The
 difference in intensity was most marked.
     The chief object of these experiments being to ascertain the in
 fluence  of the different constituents of the human body        on the pitch
 of cardiac and other murmurs, and in order that the experiments
 might, as closely as possible, simulate the actual phenomena in the
 body, an aorta was tied to the mouth of             a tap, and an artificial
 murmur produced by causing        a constriction of the vessel by a piece
 of twine tied round it.    The pitch of the murmur          so produced was
 decidedly raised the further it was heard along the vessel from the
 point where the sound was generated.

                                         279
    To   set the question quite at rest     of the possibility of the blood in
a vessel    raising the pitch, especially at so short a distance as               2^
inches, the following experiment was devised               : —A     tourniquet was
placed over a man's femoral artery, immediately below Poupart's
ligament, and an artificial         murmur thus produced         ;  this was found
to rise rapidly in pitch in passing down the                 course   of the vessel.
A   well-marked difference was noticed at a distance of only an inch,
and decidedly more at a distance of           2\  inches.
     The intensity        of the murmur       quickly diminished         in passing
to the right or left of the vessel, the pitch being at the same time
 rapidly raised, which was due to the interposition                of integuments ;
 but this interposition could not be the cause          of the rise of the pitch
 in the course of the vessel, as the murmur could be heard in that
 direction at      a distance of at least   6  inches, whilst it was completely
 lost at less distance than 2 inches to either side of the vessel             ; thus
 the murmur must have been conducted by the blood, whilst the same
 thickness      of integuments       was  over the artery at the lower           and
 the upper point listened to, for both points were above the place
 where the sartorius muscle crosses the vessel.
                                        Gases.
     If  a watch is pressed       close to the ear and then gradually moved
  away, the tick is heard to rise in pitch in proportion             to the distance
 the watch is withdrawn.
     •Or,    if  in place of the watch a tuning-fork        be used, the same can
  be  still more distinctly ascertained.        Then let the fork, either freely
  vibrating, or, still better, placed on a resounding board, be moved
  gradually      away   from the ear, the pitch will be found to rise the
  further the fork is carried away from the ear.
     An   echo    of a musical note is higher pitched than the original note.
  Again,    a loud     cardiac murmur      audible over the entire chest was
  examined      in the following manner: —
     The patient was directed first to exspire          to the utmost, and the
  pitch of the heart-sound was then ascertained           ;   he was then ordered
  to inspire to the      full ; the pitch was then found to be raised.             In
  this experiment, the only variation was an increased                amount of air
  between     the point where the murmur was generated,               and the ear of
  the observer.

                                          280
    The   substances     which     lowered the pitch        in the above        experi
ments    have one common property, namely, porosity, and, as far                      it
could be ascertained,      the depression     of pitch  was in proportion to this
condition.      Is it possible that the small vacuities included in the
substance,    acting as resounding cavities, and reflecting the vibrations
from their walls, may so direct them that they may somewhat interfere
with one another, and thereby be somewhat diminished in number                         ?
The following experiment tends in some degree to support this con
jecture.   It  is well known that     if the  vibrating fork be held obliquely,
resting on the table,
                          "  a  loud resonance is audible        ;  but if the tuning-
fork be moved parallel to itself along the surface of the table, the
resonance    of the table immediately          ceases from the interference          of
the planes of vibration with each           other ;" but      if   the fork is moved
so slowly, and so that         the resonance       is  not completely destroyed,
the pitch falls slightly.
    Again,  if the   fork be applied to the head, and listened to first with
the ear open, and afterwards with the ear closed, the pitch is found
to be slightly lowered.
   In all  those experiments in which            the pitch was elevated        by con
duction, it was found that there was diminished                     intensity  in pro
portion to the elevation of pitch       ;  thus it would appear that all bodies
raise the pitch in proportion to the difficulty with which they receive
and conduct vibrations.
   Dr. Scott Alison       has proved in some recent experiments, that the
conductivity of media, as regards rapidity, does not correspond with
that of intensity.       Of all tried     substances,    iron was the worst con
ductor as regards intensity, and this was found to raise the pitch
most.
   The   above explanation is rendered somewhat probable from the fact
that in all cases the elevation was greater with               a   weak note than a
strong one.       Dr. Wylde tells      me that      it has   long been noticed by
musicians that     a  weak note is somewhat higher pitched than               a strong
one, it being under these circumstances caught through                   the medium
of the air.      Those bodies which, on the contrary, lower the pitch,
do so to a greater extent with a weak note.
   These explanations are offered with the utmost diffidence, on ac
count of my very limited knowledge of acoustics.
   On looking into the literature of the subject, the only reference                 to

                                            281
alteration      of pitch    by   conduction       is that by Dr. Walshe*,                  who
ascribes it to transmission              of the vibrations             through      "varying"
media.
II. "On        the frequent      occurrence       of Phosphate of Lime, in the
        crystalline form, in Human Urine, and on its pathological
        importance."By Arthur Hill Hassall, M.D. Lond.
        Communicated by Dr. Sharpey, Sec. R.S. Received
        November 9, 1859.
   In    1854    I   submitted to the Royal               Society       a   paper    "On    the
frequent occurrence of Indigo in Human                        Urine."         This communi
                                                     '
cation, which was published                in the        Philosophical         Transactions,'
attracted considerable attention both at home and abroad.                                  The
singular fact of the frequent presence of indigo in the urine, first
announced by me, has since been amply confirmed by a variety of
observers.       I   have now to place        before      the Society some investiga
tions in relation to the not uncommon occurrence in human urine of
phosphate       of lime,   as a deposit, in a well-marked crystalline                 form.
   When the earthy phosphates                 are treated        of by writers, in         con
nexion with the urine, they are usually described collectively, and it
is seldom that each kind of phosphate is particularized, and yet there
are   several     which may occur either separately or together.                            The
phosphate of ammonia and magnesia,                   or triple phosphate, is indeed
often specified,      but rarely is phosphate of lime separately mentioned,
and phosphate of magnesia scarcely ever                   ;   and yet phosphate of lime
is very frequently present as a deposit in urine, much more so, indeed,
according to my experience,               than the triple phosphate, excluding
those casesof the occurrence of that ammoniacal phosphate, arising
from the decomposition of the urea of the urine subsequent to its
escape from the kidneys.           Even in those few cases in which phosphate
of lime is specially mentioned, it is               described      usually as mixed up
with the other phosphates, and always as occurring in the amorphous
or granular, and never in the crystalline state                    ;    further, no peculiar
importance is attached to          it,   as contrasted with the magnesian                  phos
phate.

                                         282
   Even one of the most recent writers on the urine gives the following
description of the physical characters of deposits of phosphate of
lime in urine      : — " Deposits of phosphate of lime,"            he states,    " as
usually occurring in the urine, and mixed with magnesia,                  are always
white and amorphous, under the microscope appearing in granules,
sometimes    of   a greenish tinge, which         exert  a refracting    action upon
light.   Crystallized deposits of this substance                have   not been    observed."
   I now propose to show, first, that there is a crystalline deposit,
the crystals composing which will be described hereafter, which does
really consist of phosphate of lime            ;   second,  that it is of frequent
occurrence in human urine          ;  and third, that it is of greater patho
logical importance than the deposits of triple phosphate.
   I would first remark that          I have for years been acquainted with
the fact of the occurrence of crystalline              phosphate of lime in the
urine, and    I  have referred to it in      'The Lancet' of        1853, and     also
elsewhere.      I    should now remark, however, that the statement              made
by me as to the composition of the crystals, has hitherto been based
upon their qualitative analysis only, and therefore was not so com
pletely  conclusive        and satisfactory       as  could   be   desired.      Until
recently   I had not made          any quantitative        analyses  ;  these  I have
since been enabled        to perform, and     I now furnish the results of the
chemical examination of four samples of the deposit.
   First Sample. — Filtered from the urine of twenty-four hours                        ;
mixed, as ascertained       in the first instance by means of the microscope,
with a very minute quantity of triple phosphate.

            Bibasic phosphate of lime.          . . .                1- 85
                                                                     2-00
   Second Sample. — Filtered from urine after the lapse of                   a day   or
two  ; mixed with       a  small quantity of triple phosphate.
            Bibasic phosphate of magnesia.                           047
            Bibasic phosphate of lime                                618
                                                                     6-65
   Third Sample. — From urine of twenty-four hours, after the lapse

                                     283
of  several  days.    Admixed    with much triple phosphate, as shown
first by the microscope, and afterwards by the chemical analysis.
            Bibasic phosphate of magnesia                    4-30
            Bibasic phosphate of lime                        5-41
                                                             9-71
    Fourth Sample        Separated from six ounces of fresh urine.           De
posit very pure.
            Bibasic phosphate of lime                        1 -96
No phosphate of      magnesia.
    Now the admixture of the phosphate of magnesia in the first three
samples    was   due  solely to the fact that the phosphate of lime,
deposited   at first in the pure state,    was allowed to remain in the
urine until decomposition had commenced,            and the phosphate of
magnesia    and ammonia had, in consequence,         become   formed.        De
posits of phosphate of lime are sometimes           contaminated from the
same cause    with carbonate and oxalate of lime.
    These analyses are therefore conclusive as to the composition of
 this earthy phosphate.        In order to show that no error         has been
 committed in them,      I  here append the process adopted.          That the
 deposit in question really consisted of a phosphate, was first repeatedly
 determined by the action of a solution          of nitrate of silver      ; the
 crystals when touched with this reagent         assumed   a  bright golden
yellow colour.      After having   been separated   and washed     in distilled
 water, the phosphate was ignited to free it from animal matter, urea,
 Sc., and weighed.         It was  then dissolved in    hydrochloric      acid  ;
ammonia was added until a permanent precipitate formed              ;  this was
 redissolved by the addition of acetic acid.      First the lime    was preci
 pitated from the solution by oxalate of ammonia, and afterwards the
 magnesia as follows   : chloride of ammonium was added, then ammonia
in slight excess, and lastly, phosphate of soda.        The  oxalate    of lime
formed was converted into carbonate of lime in the ordinary manner,
and the phosphate of ammonia and magnesia into the pyro-phosphate
 of  magnesia  ;  these were then weighed separately,      and the amounts
of the bibasic phosphate of lime were determined by the usual calcu
lations.    The results obtained corresponded very closely with the
 original weights of the ignited phosphates subjected to analysis.           The
     vol. x.                                                     x

                                      284
analyses, therefore, show that the crystallized phosphate of lime is          a
tribasic phosphate containing two atoms of lime, and most probably
one   of water.
                            Form of   the Crystals.
    The   size, form, and arrangement      of the crystals of phosphate of
lime, as they occur in human urine, vary greatly, but the peculiarities
are in all cases sufficiently characteristic    to allow   of the ready iden
tification   of this phosphate      by means   of the microscope.          The
crystals are either single or aggregated,        most frequently the latter,
forming glomeruli       or rosettes,  more or less perfect (figs.    1, 2,  3).
Sometimes they are small and needle-like, and then they frequently
form by their crossing and union at right angles, glomeruli or sphe
rules (fig. 3).   Sometimes the crystals are thin and flat, having oblique
                   Fig. 1.                            Fig. 2.
or pointed terminations       (fig. 2).   Very frequently, however, they
are thick, and more or less wedge-shaped,        and united by their narrow
extremities so as to form more or less complete portions of a circle
(fig. 1 ) ; the free larger ends of the crystals are usually somewhat
oblique, and the more perfect crystals present a six-sided facette.           I
have never yet met with these crystals having both ends perfect, owing,
I  believe, to the tendency which they have to crystallize from a centre

                                         285
in rosettes.      The principal     modifications which         I have met with in
the size, form, and arrangement of these crystals, are well shown in
the eleven drawings which accompany this communication*.                         When
these crystals are kept in the dry state             for a long time, they not
unfrequently break down and crumble into powder.
                                                              '
    The   late  Dr. Golding      Bird, in his work on           Urinary Deposits,'
has given a representation       of some crystals which he has denominated
 " penniform," describing them          as consisting    of  a variety    of the mag-
 nesian   phosphate     ; the crystals figured do, however,              undoubtedly
represent     a  modification of     those of phosphate of lime.             They are
 represented     in figure 4,    taken from Dr. Bird's original specimen.
 Although     I have  elsewhere   pointed out this error, most recent writers
 on the urine still persist in describing these crystals as a variety of
 the phosphate of ammonia and magnesia.
                    On the Frequency        of their Occurrence.
    I find, as already stated, that phosphate of lime in the form of
 crystals is of much more frequent occurrence in human urine than
 the triple phosphate, excluding           those cases of the presence           of the
 latter phosphate which are due to the decomposition of the urea of
 the urine subsequent to its emission.             I have met with deposits of
 crystallized phosphate of lime in some hundreds of urines, and in
 many different cases; it is therefore not a little remarkable, from
 the frequency of its occurrence and the peculiarities presented by the
 crystals, that it should have been so long overlooked.                   The micro
 scope therefore furnishes us        in most     cases with the ready means           of
 detecting the presence of deposits of phosphate of lime, as of so many
 other urinary deposits.
    Characters     of Urine depositing Crystallized Phosphate of Lime.
     The urine from which phosphate of lime is deposited is usually
 pale, but occasionally it is high-coloured ; the quantity passed is large,
 and the calls to void it frequent, more or less uneasiness and smart
 ing being occasioned      by its passage,      at the neck of the bladder and
 along the course of the urethra          :  its specific gravity varies greatly       ;
 taking the whole quantity passed            in twenty-four hours, it is usually
 below the average,        nevertheless the animal matter and urea are

 these drawings : all the objects are magnified   100 diameters.
                                                                      x 2

absolutely in excess.       It   is generally feebly acid, often decidedly so
when first voided, the greater part of the phosphate of lime becoming
deposited while    the urine still retains some            degree  of acidity  ; it
however speedily becomes           alkaline, owing probably to the excess        of
mucus contained in it.         Sometimes the crystals of phosphate of lime
are thrown down from the urine before its escape from the bladder                  ;
ordinarily, however, the urine is bright and clear when passed, and
the crystals are not formed until some time after it has been voided.
In collecting this phosphate for analysis, the object being to procure
it in as pure    a   state   as possible      and as free from phosphate of
ammonia and magnesia,          oxalate and carbonate of lime, it should be
separated   from the urine very soon after it has become                deposited,
and before decomposition has had time to set in.
     On the Pathological Importance            of Deposits of Phosphate of
                            Lime in Human Urine.
    Of the pathological importance of           excess  of phosphate of lime in
the urine not a doubt can be entertained, but certain reasons                  and
facts may be advanced to show that deposits              of that phosphate have
a deeper pathological significance than those of the phosphate of
ammonia and magnesia.              The proof of this is the more necessary,
since writers on the urine are in the habit           of describing,  as well as of
treating, deposits of the earthy phosphates collectively, and without
distinguishing between them           : this course was natural enough so long
as they were unacquainted with the fact that deposits             of phosphate of
lime in the state of crystals are of frequent occurrence, or so long as
 they mistook them for         a   variety of the ammonio-magnesian phos
 phate.    One reason     why we should be disposed to attach greater
 importance to the excess of the calcareous           than the magnesian     phos
 phate, is that most of the phosphoric             acid of this last phosphate,
 and all the magnesia,       is derived from without,         being contained in
 the various articles consumed as food            ;  while for the phosphate of
 lime, we have in the system        — in the teeth and     bones, and also in the
 nitrogenous tissues   — sources containing         some pounds weight      of this
 phosphate.
    That  the osseous system is subject to disintegration is certain, and
 that the extent    and    rapidity of this differ remarkably in different
 cases is equally   so.    This     is shown by the     simple fact alone of the

                                                     *
                                               287
early and rapid decay of the teeth in many persons.                                For this general
reason therefore only, we should, a priori,                           be disposed to attach
greater importance to the occurrence of deposits of phosphate of lime
than those of phosphate of magnesia.
  Other       facts   tending to confirm             this view         are,       first, that while
deposits of phosphate of lime are frequently                            met           with, those         of
phosphate of magnesia              (not the ammonio-magnesian phosphate) are
exceedingly rare          ;   and second, that the calcareous is of more difficult
solubility than the magnesian                  phosphate.            This     last     circumstance
explains probably why phosphate of lime falls as a deposit from
acid urine, while phosphate of magnesia remains in solution.
  The particular or special reasons for regarding deposits of phos
phate of lime as of more moment than those of the triple phosphate,
are derived from direct pathological                     observation.             I   have   observed
that when this deposit occurs, it is very apt to be persistent                                   ;   and
when it has disappeared, to return whenever the health is reduced
from any cause.               I   have also noticed that, when it is persistent,                     it   is
usually associated with marked impairment                            of the health, and this
often where organic disease does not exist.                     The prominent symptoms
in one case of calcareous               phosphatic deposit which              I   have had under
observation for some years,               were, — great disorder of the                 digestive     or
gans, frequent and distressing headaches, occasional vomiting, debility,
emaciation, great irritability of the nervous system, sexual                                   powers
weak, pulse slow and feeble, skin cold, urine in excess, of rather low
specific gravity, acid when passed, but soon becoming alkaline, mic
turition frequent, with irritation             at neck     of bladder         and in the course
of the urethra        :       teeth   much decayed.             It    should be stated that
there is in this case a very slight tendency to paralysis of the right
leg, as shown by an occasional sensation of coldness in the limb, and
                                                  This symptom                                            is,
slight deficiency of power in it at times only.
however, by no means    constant or necessary one in such cases.
                                    a
   If these    views of the pathology of phosphate of lime be correct, we
should expect to find an excess of that phosphate in the urine in great
and rapid waste of tissue, during the rapid decay of the teeth, and
in cases of mollities ostium. That there                   is   an excess         of the calcareous
phosphate in the urine in these cases,                   is   shown alike             by   observation
and analysis.
  It   is   obvious from this imperfect sketch that much remains to be

                                       288
effected   in regard to the pathology of phosphate of lime             ; but now
that the frequency of its occurrence in human urine as           a   crystallized
deposit is made known, its pathology, apart from that of the triple
phosphate, will no doubt be specially considered.
    It will  be apparent from the following         quotation, that the late
Dr. Golding Bird regarded deposits of phosphate of lime as of more
                                                           "
consequence than those of the triple phosphate : — The pathological
state of the system accompanying the appearance                 of deposits of
phosphate of lime is analogous to that occurring               with the triple
phosphate     ;  indeed, as has been already observed,      they often, and in
alkaline urine always, occur simultaneously.          So far as my own ex
perience    has extended,    when the deposit has consisted      chiefly of the
calcareous      salt, the patients have appeared to present more marked
evidence    of exhaustion, and of the previous       existence  of    some drain
on the nervous system, than when the triple salt alone existed, unless
its source is strictly local."
    It should be remembered that these remarks of Dr. Bird refer to
deposits of phosphate of lime in the granular state, and not to the
crystalline deposits, with the occurrence of which he was unacquainted.
I  have already stated that, according to my experience,            the granular
calcareous phosphatic deposits are much more rare than the crystalline.
    It follows from these observations and investigations         : —
    First. That deposits of crystallized phosphate of lime             are of fre
quent occurrence in human urine, much more so, indeed, than those
of the amorphous or granular form of that phosphate.
    Second. That the crystals present well-marked and highly charac
teristic forms, whereby the identification of this phosphate by means
of the microscope is rendered easy and certain.
    Third. That there is good reason to believe that deposits of phos
phate of lime are of greater pathological importance than those of
the phosphate        of ammonia and   magnesia.

     The following communications           were read   : —
  I. " On    the Saccharine        Function of the Liver."            By George
        Harley, M.D., F.C.S.,               Professor of Medical Jurispru
        dence    in University College, London. Communicated by
        Dr. Sharpey, Sec. R.S. Received December 19, 1859.
    Although it is nearly 200 years since our countryman, the cele
 brated Dr. Thomas Willis, made the important discovery of the
occasional presence         of sugar in the human urine, it was not, until
very recently, known that the formation of saccharine matter is con
stantly going on in the healthy animal body.
    Since Bernard, in 1848,         communicated to the French Academy
the discovery of the saccharine function               of the animal organism,
physiologists      in all countries have       more or less directed to it their
attention.      For    a  time various opinions were held by different ob
servers regarding the origin of the sugar found in the body               ; but at
 length it was generally admitted            that the liver had the power of
forming     a substance       to which Bernard gave the name Glucogen             ;
that this peculiar substance        was   transformed into sugar       ; and that
the sugar in its turn disappeared in the capillaries of the different
organs and tissues of the body.
    In  the summer of 1858, however, Dr. Pavy read a paper on the
"Alleged      Sugar- forming Function of the           Liver" before the Royal
Society, the object of which was to prove that the presence of sugar
in the animal economy is         " due to a post mortem       occurrence," — that
as long as life continues, glucogen only is to be found, and not              until
after death does the transformation of this substance into sugar begin.
    The question of the saccharine function of the liver being              a sub
ject to which     I  have more or less directed my attention since 1853,
when    I  communicated to the       Socie'te. de Biologie de Paris an account
of an experimental procedure whereby                diabetes   can  be produced
artificially in animals, the above-mentioned paper was to me one of
 peculiar interest.        The conclusions of the author       were so much op
posed to the results       of my own experiments,       as well as those  of other
 observers,   that   I  felt anxious to test them.

                                      290
   Accordingly,    having received the kind offer of Professor Sharpey's
cooperation,   I undertook   a series of experiments, the results of which
I  beg the honour of communicating to the Royal Society.
    As the experiments performed        were merely a repetition   of  some
of   those  made   by previous inquirers,     I shall not enter into detail
further than is necessary to explain the precautions adopted with the
view to avoid error.       And, looking at the object in view, it will
readily be understood why in the present instance the tests employed
for the detection of the sugar were limited to caustic potash with
and without     sulphate of copper.      The mode of proceeding was as
           —
follows : In testing the blood, a quantity of distilled water, equal
to about four times that of the blood used, was boiled in a capsule.
To the water, when boiling,      were   added a few drops of acetic acid,
and afterwards the blood was very gradually introduced.           In order
that the albumen might be thoroughly coagulated, a drop or two more
of  acetic acid was added,   care being taken to avoid an excess.    When
the albumen was completely coagulated, which            was known     by its
separating and floating in the clear liquid, the whole was thrown on
a filter.   The clear filtered liquid    was then tested.   The  same pro
cess was followed when operating on the liver.
   The first point to    be ascertained was whether, under favourable
circumstances as regarded diet, sugar could be found in the circula
tion.     The following experiment proved this.
   Exp. 1. From the carotid artery of a rough terrier           dog,  three
hours after being fed on bread, milk, and boiled liver, a portion         of
blood equal to about three-fourths          of an ounce   was withdrawn.
This, on being treated in the manner explained, gave distinct
evidence of the presence of sugar.        A second portion of blood, after
standing thirty-five minutes in a room of moderate temperature,
yielded a similar result.
   As in this instance   a few seconds    elapsed between the withdrawal
of the first portion of blood and its treatment with the boiling acidu
lated water, and as it was possible that in these few seconds the sugar
might have been formed from the glucogen present in the circulation,
we (Professor Sharpey and myself) thought         it advisable in our next
experiment to allow the blood to flow directly from the artery into the
boiling mixture, and thereby avoid the possibility of sugar being pro
duced by the transformation     of glucogen after the removal of the blood

                                                    291
from the body.              It   was further desired to operate                  on an animal in
what might be considered its natural condition as to food.                                  Accord
ingly     one that        had been       running           at    large was selected,    and the
following experiment performed                      :—
     Exp.    2.    Into the left carotid artery of a small cocker dog was
inserted     a    canula with a stopcock.   The animal was then placed so
as to allow           the blood to flow directly into the boiling acidulated
water.   The clear filtered liquid from this blood became of a yellow
tint on being boiled with soda, and gave a red precipitate with the
sulphate of copper and potash, thereby indicating the presence of
sugar.       Two       ounces    of blood from the                same animal were similarly
tested after the blood had stood twenty-four                                hours in a room of
moderate temperature,                  and the result obtained was the same as
with the first portion.
  The next experiment                  was made           on an animal under conditions,
as   regards food, unfavourable for the production of sugar.                           In order,
too, to avoid any chance of injuring the sympathetic nerve during
the operation, and thereby favouring                            the formation of sugar in the
body, the blood was withdrawn from the right femoral artery instead
of the carotid.            The following            are     the particulars       of the experi
ment : —
     Exp.    3.    A good-sized dog             was       fed    solely on flesh     during four
days.       Three hours after the last meal, which consisted                           of half       a
pound of boiled horseflesh,                   1-J   oz.   of blood       was   permitted to flow
from      the femoral artery directly                     into the boiling       mixture.      The
solution obtained from this blood, as in the other cases, contained
sugar.       Another       portion of blood, after standing three hours, was
tested in the same way, and, as far as could be judged                               by the eye,
contained        similar proportion of sugar.
                  a
     In   neither of the preceding cases was the amount of sugar in the
blood quantitatively             determined, as           I     had already done so on many
previous      occasions     ;    and
                                   I      knew that in healthy                  arterial blood   it
varied according to the state of the digestion, and the kind of food,
from an inappreciable quantity up to 0-24 percent.*
     Having       been now satisfied that sugar                    is   to be found in the blood
of healthy animals at the very moment of its withdrawal from the
 *    " On   the      Physiology of Saccharine            Urine," by Geo. Harley, M.D.,      British
and Foreign Med. Chir. Rev.            July   1857,   p.   191-204.

                                          292
  circulation,      even when    none has been     introduced     along with      the
  food, we next proceeded to test the grounds upon which it had been
  asserted      that glucogen is not transformed into sugar in the healthy
  liver during life.
      In the paper already referred to, Dr. Pavy         stated that the sudden
  abstraction of heat from the liver after its removal from the body,
  checks the transformation of the sugar-forming material, and thereby
  enables      us to operate on the hepatic substance while           in the same
 chemical condition as during          life.  The plan he recommends is to
 sacrifice a dog by pithing, and instantly to slice off a piece of liver,
 and throw it into a freezing mixture of ice and salt.              In which case
 he says the absence         of sugar is almost complete, and thence con
 cludes      that the presence of sugar in the liver can no longer be looked
 upon as a
                 " natural  ante mortem condition    ;
                                                       "  but  " is  in reality due
 to   a. post   mortem occurrence."
     In the following experiments, not only       was the plan recommended
 most scrupulously followed, but even the risk of the glucogen in the
 liver becoming transformed into sugar during the process of pre
paring the decoction, was avoided by cutting               the frozen liver into
thin      slices, and allowing    them, while still in that condition, to fall
directly into the boiling mixture of acetic acid and water.              The liver
was      in this way prevented from thawing until it entered a medium
as   capable of arresting the transformation of its glucogen into sugar
as   the cold. The decoction so obtained might therefore be presumed
to contain the soluble matters as nearly as possible in the same
chemical state as they were in the living organ.
     Exp. 4. A small, but full-grown dog was fed during fourteen
days solely on animal food.             Four hours after a meal of boiled
horseflesh he was killed by section of the medulla oblongata.                   The
abdomen was rapidly opened,             and  a  portion   of liver cut off and
instantly immersed in a freezing mixture of ice and salt.                A   second
portion       of liver  was as speedily as possible detached,         and quickly
washed in cold water.           The latter portion  was then, without        loss of
time, cut into fragments, which were allowed to fall directly into
boiling acidulated water.          On testing the clear filtrate, distinct evi
dence      of the   presence   of sugar was obtained. After half an hour,
the frozen portion of liver was taken, without being allowed to thaw,
and sliced directly into the boiling           water with acetic       acid.    The

                                                  293
clear liquid yielded in this case as distinct evidence of sugar as in the
other.    Forty minutes after the death of the animal, another portion
of liver, which till then had remained undisturbed in the abdomen,
was treated like the others.               This   gave evidence           of containing        a much
greater quantity of sugar, thus confirming Bernard's statement,                                   that
the transformation of glucogen goes on in the liver after its removal
from the body, or after the death of the animal.
     In order to       be perfectly certain that the sugar found in the liver
at the instant         of its removal from the body               was really formed where
it   was    found, and not carried there by the portal blood from the
food, the following experiment was performed                          :   —
     Exp.    5.   A dog was         fed during ten days on boiled tripe.                   Twenty-
two hours after the last meal the animal was pithed.                                 In    less than
twenty seconds         a   portion of the liver was in the freezing mixture of ice
and salt.         While       I   boiled directly another portion of liver, Professor
Sharpey put        a   ligature on the portal vein, and collected its blood.
He likewise collected               some   of the hepatic blood which flowed from
the cut liver.
     In the portal blood not               a trace   of sugar could           be detected.        The
hepatic blood, on the other                    hand,      gave     distinct     evidence        of its
presence.         Both bloods          were tested      exactly alike.         The clear liquids
obtained from the frozen liver and from the portion treated directly,
notwithstanding            that they were filtered while hot, and also tested
while still hot, both gave distinct evidence of sugar.                              On the follow
ing day a second portion of portal blood, which had been purposely
kept all night in order to ascertain                    if,   on standing some time, sugar
would form in           it,   still yielded the      same negative result.                Even after
treating     it   with saliva, which would have transformed its glucogen
into sugar, had         it    contained any, no evidence of the presence of sugar
was    obtained.           On the other hand, when saliva                     was    added      to the
decoctions of the liver above spoken of,                          a   great increase            in the
amount of sugar was observed.                      The quantity of sugar               so obtained
did not appear to be so great, however, as that yielded                               by   a   portion
of the liver which remained all night untouched in the                                abdomen       of
the animal.
     Professor Garrod,              F.R.S., who    was present,           not at the commence
ment of the experiment, but on the following day, when the different
decoctions were tested, agreed                 with Professor Sharpey and myself,

                                          '294
  that this experiment showed the truth of Bernard's statement,                  that
  the liver    might contain both sugar and glucogen when the portal
  blood contained neither.
     The stomach and intestines of this animal                 were  found void of
  food  ;  the large intestine only contained faecal matter.
     For the    sake  of still further  assurance   that the sugar found in the
 liver was neither due to some accidental cause, nor immediately de
  rived from food, we determined to deprive an animal of food for
 some days before         examining the liver.       The following experiment
 was accordingly performed : —
     Exp. 6. A very large and powerful            dog, in admirable condition,
 was subject to a rigid        fast for seventy-two hours — three full days.
 Immediately after death, by section of the medulla oblongata, a por
 tion of the liver was sliced off and immersed in ice and salt.               Blood
 was then collected from the following sources            : —
     1st.   From the portal      vein.
     2ndly.   From the liver (i.e. blood which             flowed from the liver
 when a portion of it was sliced off).
     3rdly. From the right side of the heart.
     4thly. From the aorta.
     othly. From the inferior        vena cava.
     Although     these   bloods were all treated in       a  similar manner,   and
 tested with the same quantities of copper and soda, yet none of them
gave unequivocal evidence          of the  presence  of sugar, except that from
the liver.      The blood from the right side of the heart gave doubtful
evidence.      At first sight it may appear strange that the blood from
the right side of the heart should contain scarcely an appreciable
quantity of sugar, while that of the liver showed its presence very obvi
ously    ; but this no doubt arose from the hepatic blood being in great
part prevented from reaching the heart            :  1st, on account    of  most   of
it escaping into the abdomen,          when the portion of liver was cut off        ;
and 2ndly, on account of its flow being in great measure arrested                 by
the ligature of the portal vessels.
     All the bloods,     except the hepatic, seemed to be free         of glucogeu
as well as sugar       ; for none of them, with that exception, gave any
evidence     of its  presence    after being treated with saliva in the usual
way.
    On examination of the frozen liver (after three hours), which, as

                                      295
in the other      cases, was not allowed to thaw before        being put into
boiling water, the decoction was found to reduce the copper readily.
   On opening the stomach, nothing was found in it except some
neutral mucus.        The intestines were equally destitute of food, and
in the rectum only a very small quantity of faeces was found ; so
there could be no doubt as to the animal being in a fasting con
dition.
   The only point now remaining, was to determine quantitatively
the increase in the amount of sugar in the liver after its removal
from the body, and for that purpose we preferred operating on an
animal fed on a mixed diet.
   Exp.   7.  A small      dog, which  had been previously fed on animal
diet, received a full meal of bread and milk.          Five hours afterwards
the animal was pithed, and         a portion of the liver rapidly sliced off
and immersed in       a  freezing mixture.   A ligature    was  placed on the
portal   vein,   and    its blood collected    before    the circulation     had
ceased.
   On examination, this blood was found to contain a small quantity
of sugar, derived no doubt from the food.            Bernard,    I believe,  has
erred in supposing that all the saccharine matter found in the animal
organism is formed out of the glucogen produced in the liver.               This,
no doubt, is the case in the carnivora when the diet is restricted to
food inconvertible into sugar in the alimentary canal, but cannot be
regarded as the natural state of things          either in the omnivora or
herbivora   ;  for the food of the latter not only contains sugar, but its
amylaceous elements          may be converted into that substance         in the
process   of digestion.      The sugar found in the     bodies  of animals    fed
 on a mixed diet ought therefore to be regarded partly as the direct
product of the food, and partly as derived from the glucogen formed
in the liver.
   Bernard's chief argument against this view is founded on the fact
that the livers of dogs fed on a mixed diet contain no more sugar
than those fed on purely animal food.             In my opinion, however,
this   fact is   not    sufficient  to decide the     question  ;  for,  as   the
liver does not store up sugar, the quantity it at any time contains is
no criterion of the amount produced in it.          Moreover, the sugar de-
rived from the food need not be expected           to be found in the liver.
 Had Bernard      gauged     the sugar present in the blood, instead of that

                                       296
in the liver, after each kind of diet, the result obtained would,         I  be
lieve, have led him to a different conclusion.         This being    a point  of
great practical importance in the treatment of diabetes,             I may   be
here permitted to mention that       I have occasionally found nearly twice
as much sugar in the blood        of an animal   on a mixed, than in that     of
one feeding on a purely flesh diet.
    To return to the last experiment.           About two hours after the
death of the animal, portions       of the frozen part of the liver, and of
that which had been kept warm in the body of the animal, were
carefully weighed, and the proportions           of sugar they respectively
contained estimated by volumetric analysis.
    The portion of frozen liver was found to contain 0*333 per cent.,
and that of the other, 1-55 per cent. of saccharine matter.               It is
thus seen that in two hours the sugar in the liver had augmented
nearly fivefold.       As Bernard     has shown, the simple washing out
of the liver by passing      a stream  of water through its vessels, would
remove all the sugar anteriorly formed.            On placing it again aside
for a short time, a fresh portion of sugar would form in it at the
expense     of glucogen.
    0-333 per cent. of sugar    seems a small quantity    ; but if we  suppose
a  liver weighing, as in man, not less than 50 oz., to contain 0-333 per
cent.,     above   70  grs.  of sugar would       be  present in it at the
moment       of death, —no   very insignificant   quantity, when it is recol
lected that sugar is removed        from the liver with every pulsation of
the heart, to be partly consumed, and that it is as continually sup
plied by the organ.
    The results of the experiments now related do not therefore in
any way countenance the notion           that sugar is not produced in the
healthy animal body.         On the contrary, such conclusions as they
afford are     altogether in favour of the generally received views upon
the subject.
    From the preceding experiments the following conclusions            may be
drawn     :—
     1st. Sugar is a normal      constituent of the blood of the general
circulation.
    2ndly.    Portal blood of an animal on mixed diet contains sugar.
    3rdly.    Portal blood of   a fasting animal, as well as    of  an animal
fed solely on flesh, is devoid     of sugar.

                                       297
   4thly.   The livers of  dogs contain sugar, whether the diet is animal
or vegetable.
   5thly.    Under favourable circumstances, saccharine matter may
be   found in the liver of an animal after three entire days of rigid
fasting.
   6thly. The sugar found in the bodies of animals fed on mixed
food is partly derived directly from the food, partly formed in the
liver.
    7thly. The livers of animals restricted to flesh diet possess the
power of forming glucogen, which glucogen is at least in part trans
formed into sugar in the liver      ;
                                      — an inference which does not exclude
the probability of glucogen (like starch in the vegetable          organism)
being transformed into other materials besides sugar.
    8thly.   As sugar is found in the liver at the moment of death, its
presence     cannot properly be ascribed to      a post mortem change, but
is to be regarded as the result of a natural condition.
 II. " Hereditary      Transmission        of an Epileptiform Affection
       accidentally produced."           By E. Brown-Sequard, M.D.
        Communicated by Dr. Sharpey,                 Sec.   R.S.    Received
        December 23, 1859.
    It  is well known that the number of facts which seem to prove
 that an accidentally produced affection may be transmitted by parents
 to their offspring is still small, and that serious objections have been
 raised against most,   if not  all, the facts  of this kind. The following
 observations seem to show peremptorily that, at least in one species of
 animals, this kind of transmission may occur.
    I have    shown that certain injuries to the spinal cord, in Guinea-
 pigs and other Mammals, are followed, after a few weeks, by            a con
 vulsive disease, very much like epilepsy.          For   several years it has
 been frequently observed      that the young of      a number of those epi
 leptic animals, which    I kept  in my laboratory, were at times attacked
 with    epileptiform  convulsions.       For many months       I have    made
 regular observations on this curious subject, and         I have ascertained,
 by careful watching, that six young guinea-pigs which had frequent
 attacks of convulsions, were the offspring of one male and two female

                                                  298
guinea-pigs rendered epileptic in consequence                               of an injury to the
spinal cord.
     This observation derives its importance chiefly from the fact that,
if epilepsy is       an affection which           naturally exists among guinea-pigs,
it must      be very rare, as         I have      never      seen it except in the progeny
of individuals          operated upon              and rendered              epileptic    ;   and yet
the number           of healthy guinea-pigs that                    I   have kept for months
is really immense.            It   seems therefore that we can                    conclude, from
these   observations, that epilepsy, or an affection which very much
resembles      it,   may be transmitted                 from parents to offspring,                  even
when    it   has been accidentally produced in one of the parents, — at
least in one species       of animals.

     The following communications                  were read        :   —
I.   "On      the Resin of the Ficus rubiginosa,                            and   a   new Homo-
        logue of Benzylic  Alcohol." By Warren De la Rue,
        Ph.D., F.R.S., and Hugo MOller, Ph.D., F.C.S. Com
        municated        by   Mr. De la Rue.
                                             (Abstract.)
  In this communication the authors give an account of                                a   new alcohol
homologous with benzylic alcohol                       (Cu   H8   0a) which they          have found
occurring in the state of            a   natural acetic ether in the exudation from
an Australian plant known as the Ficus rubiginosa.
     This   acetic ether, for which they propose the name                             of Acetate of
Sycoceryl, constitutes about                 14   per cent. of the crude resin                ;   the re
mainder consisting principally                    of   an amorphous            resin which          they
name Sycoretin.
     The different      of solubility of the various constituents in
                        degree
alcohol, afforded the means of the separation of the one from the
other   ;   none     of them       present    any remarkable                properties except the

                                     299
new ether    ;  so that the authors have devoted their attention mainly
to the working out of the chemical relations of this substance.
    Acetate of sycoceryl, having very characteristic properties, could
be readily     obtained in beautiful crystals    ; but some difficulty    oc
curred in obtaining it absolutely pure, on account of the presence
of a parasitical body which accompanied it constantly in solution, and
always crystallized upon it.      At last   means were found     of removing
the latter substance     by dissolving out the acetate of sycoceryl with
ether.    The per-centage composition of this parasitical body           was
found to be —
                     Carbon                         76-56
                     Hydrogen                       1230
                     Oxygen                         11- 24
but it  existed in too small a quantity to admit        of its true chemical
relations being made out.
    Acetate of sycoceryl gave on analysis the following per-centages       as
the mean result of two accordant analyses : —
                     Carbon                         79-09
                      Hydrogen                      10-28
                     Oxygen                         10- 63
These    numbers      agree  well with    those  required    by the formula
C40  HM 04 based upon experimental evidence.
    Acetate of sycoceryl, when acted upon by sodium-alcohol, yielded
acetic acid and a beautiful crystalline        body resembling caffeine    or
asbestos  ;   this proved to be   a new   member of the benzylic alcohol
series having the composition      C38 H30 0a, which requires the following
per-centage quantities : —

    The authors, by acting with chloride of benzoyl on sycocerylic
 alcohol, obtained the corresponding benzoate of sycoceryl ; and by
 employing chloride of othyl (acetyle), have prepared the acetate of
 sycoceryl which was identical with the original crystalline constituent
 of the resin.
    By treating sycocerylic alcohol with nitric acid,        an acid was pro
 cured which appears to be sycocerylic acid.

    The products of the action of chromic acid          on sycocerylic    alcohol,
were a white crystalline      neutral substance       and a body crystallizing
in large flat prisms.        The latter appears         to be     the sycocerylic
 aldehyde.

    Five specimens   of copper wire No.       22 gauge, out    of a large number
 which had been put into my hands by the Gutta Percha Company
 to be tested   for electric conductivity, were chosen           as having   their
 conductivities in proportion to the following widely different numbers,
42,   71 -3, 84-7, 8G-4, and 102      ; and were subjected to a most careful
chemical analysis by Professor Hofmann, who at my request kindly
undertook and carried out what proved to be a most troublesome
investigation.     The following report contains        a statement     of the    re

    " Sir, — I now beg to communicate          to you the results obtained in
the analysis of the several varieties of copper wire intended for the use
of the Transatlantic      Telegraph Company, which you forwarded to
me for examination.
    "I   have limited the inquiry to a minute qualitative              analysis    of
the wires, to   a very accurate determination of the amount of copper,
and an approximative determination           of the amount of oxygen.          The
qualitative analysis has been repeated several times with as consider
able quantities as the amount         of material   at my disposal permitted.
The quantitative     determinations of the copper have been made with
particular care, and after      a  lengthened scrupulous inquiry into the
limit of accuracy of which the method employed is                  capable,  I   am
convinced that the true per-centages of copper cannot               be more than
0- 1 per cent. either above or below the means          of the determinations,

       " Since it appeared        probable tbat the extraordinary difference in the
    conductivity of the several specimens                was due rather to non-metallic
    impurities      than to metallic          admixtures,        careful experiments were
    made in every         case for the detection            of sulphur.        In   none   of the
    specimens      was   it   possible   to discover the slightest trace             of sulphur.
    Qualitative experiments having established on the other hand the
    presence    of oxygen, probably in the form of suboxide of copper in
    every   one of the specimens,             an attempt was made to ascertain the
    quantities by determining the loss which the wire after rolling suffered
    when heated in an atmosphere of hydrogen, and by simultaneously
    estimating the quantity of water formed.
        " In  this experiment, the details of which are given in its Appendix,
    the following numbers were obtained                  : —

        " Unfortunately the          same reliance cannot be              placed upon these
    numbers as upon the preceding ones, since the method employed
    involves many sources of error, and want of material precluded the
    possibility of repeating the experiments.
        " From the preceding
                                        analysis, it is obvious that the amount of
    impurities      in the several        specimens       examined is small, varying as
    it does between         010 and       1-24 per cent.            The number of foreign

that the analytical results which           I  have   given do not exclude the
presence     of exceedingly minute quantities,       even   of other metals which
might have been detected          if  larger quantities of copper could have
been submitted to analysis.           Some years ago,        Max Duke of Leuch-
tenberg* examined        the black precipitate formed at the anode in the
electrotype process, during the decomposition of sulphate of copper
by the galvanic current.          In this precipitate, of which considerable
quantities accumulate by the gradual solution of large quantities of
copper passing through          the process, he found the following consti
tuents : —

      " Of  these constituents, the ten first metals were obviously derived
 from the copper, in which they could have been scarcely detected
 unless    by this accumulative process.         Of the remainder of the          con
 stituents, the tin in a great measure is derived from the solderings.
     " The results obtained in the analysis of the copper wires which you
 forwarded to me, appear to establish one fact in a satisfactory manner,
 viz. that the diminution of conductivity observed in certain specimens
 of copper is due to the presence in             these    specimens   of    a  certain
 amount of foreign matter, and not,             as  it has    been supposed,      to a
 peculiar change in the physical condition of the metal               ;  for in the
 specimens      analysed the conductive power rises in the same order as
 the total amount of impurities diminishes.

      It appears   therefore that in the case of these four specimens,              the
  electric conductivity     is in order of purity of the copper           ;   but yet
  that only extremely small admixtures of other substances                  are to be
  found even in those which            have   but half the conductivity of the
  best.

   Ou the other hand,          I have    found by experimenting on artificial
alloys, that comparatively large admixtures of lead, iron, silver, and
zinc seem to produce sometimes             improvement, sometimes       little or no
sensible influence, and sometimes           (as in the case   of zinc) an injurious
effect  on   the conductivity of specimens of pure electrotype copper
from which the alloys were made.                The   largeness  of the proportion
of other metal required to produce any considerable deterioration in
comparison with that of the whole amount of impurities which Pro
fessor Hofmann's         investigation      demonstrates    in specimens       of low
quality    as   to conductivity,       is worthy      of remark, and       seems     to
indicate    that this low quality must be due to other than metallic
impurities.
    The great difference between the conducting qualities of two                   spe
cimens of electrotype copper, from which two series of alloys                     were
separately prepared, seems also to indicate some as yet undiscovered
cause, as operative in general.             I  am assured     by Messrs. Matthcy
and Johnson,        by whom all the alloys were prepared, that similar
methods were followed and equal care bestowed to ensure                    purity in
the two cases.

     The alloys numbered                14    and 15 were     prepared     with   a    view
to testing the possible effect of               a suboxide of copper mixed or com
bined with the mass.                Although they      do not seem worse than others
of nearly the        same metallic composition,          it cannot  be considered that
they demonstrate that oxygen exercises no influence, as the portion of
oxide introduced may have been reduced in the melting                       ; and indeed
it  is quite possible that some accident in the melting may possibly give
rise to oxidation         to a greater or less degree, and may cause some                 of
the irregularities        and uncertainties which have been observed.                    On
this    I  may remark, that although               I have found that no mechanical
alteration by hammering, twisting,                   &c. produces any considerable

                                       306
effect  of the conductivity of      one piece   of solid copper,    I  have   not
yet found whether or not specimens          either good or bad retain their
specific qualities after melting.
   I  may add, that it will be of great importance to ascertain the laws
of variation of conductivity with temperature, of different           specimens
of nearly pure copper differing largely in conductivity.                 I  have
hitherto used standards of copper wire in all the relative determina
tions of conductivity which        I  have  made     for different commercial
specimens    and artificial   alloys of copper     ;  and before   I  found the
very large differences   of conductivity shown in this and in my pre
ceding communication        to the Royal Society (June 15, 1857), it
seemed natural to suppose        that the relation between       specimen    and
standard would remain constant, or nearly constant, when the tem
peratures of the two are varied to the same extent.             Now, however,
it seems scarcely probable that this can be the case, and a rigorous
experimental examination of the influence of temperature becomes
necessary.
   P.S.   April   11, 1860. —    I   append    the    following   extract from
evidence   which   I gave on examination before the Government Com
mittee on submarine telegraphs on the 17th December, 1859,                  as   it
bears directly on the subject        of the preceding article, and shows
what degree of weight may in my opinion               be attached to the syn
thetical attempts which have been described.
    (Chairman.) Question 2458. Soon after you became a Director
of the Atlantic Telegraph Company, was your attention directed to
the conductivity of copper      ? — Yes.
    2459. You instituted a series of experiments, did not you, to deter
mine the variation of this quality in different samples of copper             ? —
A number of samples of copper            were, at my request,     put into my
hands for the purpose of measuring their conductivity in consequence
of my having accidentally noticed differences greater than I expected
in the conducting power of one or two samples which I had had
previously.
    2460.  Will you    be good enough to state          the general results at
 which you ultimately arrived, and your modes of experimenting                ? —
 My    modes    of experimenting        did not differ materially from         the
methods which had been followed by certain other experimenters,

                                          307
especially    in Germany,       and were in reality all based on Professor
Wheatstone's       invention    of   a beautiful      method for comparing           re
sistances,   to which     I  have    frequently referred as Professor Wheat-
stone's electric balance.
    2461. What were the results at which you arrived?                    — That dif
ferent specimens chosen at random from the stock supplied                            for
manufacture differed immensely in conducting power.
    2462. Although nominally             the same      quality  of copper?    —Yes,
although nominally the same quality of copper.                 All  those specimens
of wire  were supposed to be         of the very     best quality, the only copper
supposed to be good being that which admitted of being drawn into
wire suitably for the purpose.              A good mechanical quality         was ne
cessary to prevent frequent fractures in the wire-drawing                ; and to un
derstand that,     I should say that hanks in unbroken lengths amount
ing to   a large mass were          always required, the worse metal being
found to break before it could be drawn into              a  hank of a certain size.
The mechanical qualities        seem to have been satisfactory, but no sus
picion whatever was entertained that there were also large differences
in electric conducting power.              W. Weber had many            years   before
pointed out considerable differences            in different specimens     of copper
wire which       he had tested.         I   found differences      much exceeding
those, and     I  did not, as     I  expected,     find any approximation         to   a
uniform average       among the different specimens              tested  ; some spe
cimens   I  found nearly double in their conducting power, compared
with others, reckoned according to the weight and length, allowing
for the variations of gauge.           Calling the best specimen which I had
in the summer of 1857, 100,             I  found many specimens          standing at
60 in specific conductivity,         many standing at 50, many standing at
80, a few above 90      ;  and so far as       I  can recollect, the average       of  a
large number of specimens that               I  then examined may have stood
 between   60 and 70, but      I   consider the statement of such an average
 to be of no value, it is     so much a matter          of  chance.     If I  had re
 ceived a dozen specimens         of  a low quality below the average, or           if I
 had chanced to receive       a dozen specimens          of a  higher    quality, the
 average would have been so much the lower or the higher.                     I  never
 had an opportunity         of measuring the conductivity of 200 or 300
 miles of submarine cable       ;  such alone would have given me exact in
 formation as to the average for that portion of cable.                  I may men

                                              308
tion that   a  month or two later, still in the summer of 1857,                            I   re
ceived   specimens       of wire which          were    in stock for submarine tele
graphs, — for    some    of  the Mediterranean telegraphs,              I believe, — which
stood as low as 43 on that scale              ;  and, lastly,     I may mention that             I
have since met with specimens                standing 2 or 3 per cent. above                  the
100; and an artificial alloy, which                I   had prepared, stood, so far as
I  can estimate,     as high as      1 1 1.
    2463. What was that alloy?              — The alloy consisted,          so far as      I can
recollect, of copper and -13 per cent. of lead.                     I  have made experi
ments upon a series         of alloys, in all about 43 or 44,                 and      have re
cently repeated the examination so                  as    to arrive at accuracy,         within
certain limits    ;  and  I expect,      immediately, to be able to communicate
to the Royal        Society, for publication,             the results.      A   few months
ago   I sent a provisional         list of the specimens,           showing the relative
conductivity of those alloys, but, possibly, requiring correction as to
the absolute conductivity            stated.       That list     was    communicated            to
Mr. Latimer Clarke,          and,    I   believe,   a copy    of it   was laid before the
Committee.
    2464. {Professor Wheatstone.)                   Were you quite certain that you
employed pure copper in your experiments ? — I could not be quite
certain.
    2465.     The copper might               be    alloyed with       other    things       than
metals  ; is it not very probable that it might contain some suboxide,
and that the mixing           of lead afterwards with it might have reduced
the suboxide, and        therefore have given it a higher conducting power
on that account       ? —That     is possible.          I  cannot say that        I   am at    all
satisfied that the experiments which                 I  have made point out distinctly
the relation between the ascertained chemical combination and con
ductivity.     I    may mention that one of my alloys was made with a
suboxide melted with the copper                  ;  but the uncertainty of the pro
cess  of melting      the suboxide and the uncertainty as to how much                           of
the oxidation may have disappeared                     in the melting, prevented me
from attributing much weight to the experiment.
    2466. (Chairman.) What was the result with that alloy ; was it
a low result, or a high result ? — A moderate result ; not a low result.
    2467. But not       a  high one? — A somewhat high result                   ;   but  I   may
mention that in one series the highest conductivity was found with
a  mixture of lead and iron            ;  fractions of       a per    cent.   of     lead,   and

                                           309
fractious of    a  per cent. of iron mixed with pure copper gave              a higher
conductivity than a nominally pure copper, with which the alloys
were prepared. I must mention further, that in two series the alloys,
both prepared by Messrs. Matthey and Johnson, and                      as I have been
assured with equal care, gave results presenting considerable discre
pancies    ; the conductivity of the pure copper in the first stood high,
nearly agreeing with the 100 of my first scale, the pure copper of
the second series fell considerably below that limit. On this account
it appears that       even pure copper, carefully prepared by the electro
 type   process,    does not always give us results which show perfectly in
point of conductivity       ; but to make such experiments in a satisfactory
 manner, it would be        necessary     to have a thorough         chemical investi
 gation, both synthetical and analytical, of the metals                 used  ; such a
 thorough investigation          I  have not been able to carry out, in conse
 quence of the large expense which it would entail.                   I  may mention
 that Mr. Matthiessen         has gone      through     a series   of experiments   on
 alloys, of which the chemical composition has been ascertained                   with
 all possible accuracy, and         has,  I  believe,  arrived at highly important
 results relative to electrical conductivity.             I   have been in communi
 cation with him, and have supplied him with a specimen                     of  one  of
  my standards.        He mentions       to me that he has obtained specimens
  conducting better to a considerable extent than the 100 of my first
  scale.    In that respect      he has confirmed what           I have myself ascer
  tained, having myself found specimens              as  high   as 111  on that scale.
  A   number of alloys of definite chemical composition, prepared with
  great care by Mr. Calvert of Manchester, and already tested by him
  for thermal conductivity and for mechanical properties, have been
  put into my hands, in order that I may measure their electric con
  ductivities.     I hope soon to be able to obtain and publish results for
  this series of alloys.

         ceived January 3, 1860.
     In a previous notice*      I have   pointed out the existence of a new class
                  * Proceedings    of the Royal Society, vol. ix. p. 594.

of nitrogenous acids which are generated by the action of nitrous
acid on the amidic acids of the benzoic group, the change consisting
in the substitution of one equivalent of nitrogen for three equivalents
of hydrogen in      two molecules    of the amidic acid.

                    acid.
   Under the influence of various agents              these   new acids undergo
remarkable changes, amongst which the transformation produced by
the mineral acids deserves to be particularly              noticed.      If the  acid
CM   Hn   N3 08 be gently heated with strong hydrochloric             acid, nitrogen
gas is evolved, the yellow colour      of  the original acid disappears, and a
red body separates, which may be separated by filtration and purified
by treatment with animal charcoal.              Both the physical properties
and the analysis of the substance         thus obtained, prove it to be pure
chlorobenzoic acid.         The hydrochloric mother-liquor on evaporation
deposits   crystals of the hydrochlorate of         benzamic    acid.

   To render intelligible       this transformation, the acid         Ca,HnN30,
may be viewed as a double acid corresponding                to two molecules of

the two equivalents of monatomic nitrogen are replaced by hydro
chloric acid, producing       C,,(H, C1)04, while the        second    simply com
bines with     hydrochloric     acid, producing     hydrochlorate of benzamic
acid.    It  deserves     to be mentioned that the acid Ca,          Hu  N3 Oa may
be derived also from two equivalents            of hydrated oxide of          ammo
nium, when its formula assumes the following shape                : —
   Further experiments        are necessary    to decide which of these two
formulae    deserves the preference.

                       Iodobemoic Acid, 014(1151)04.
    This substance      is produced by a process          similar to that which
furnishes the chlorobenzoic           acid,   viz. by the action of hydriodic
acid on the acid Ca,        Hn N, 0„, — beautiful white plates resembling
benzoic    acid, easily soluble in alcohol and in ether and difficultly
soluble in water.          lodobenzoic       acid is remarkable       for  its great
stability   ;  even fuming      nitric    acid fails   to expel   the iodine,    and
transforms the substance           simply into nitro-iodobenzoic         acid.   The
silver salt of iodobenzoic acid is a white amorphous precipitate con
taining   C14(H,IAg)04.
                         Iodotoluic Acid,       C16 (H7 1)04.
    This acid    is formed from the analogous nitrogenous               acid in the
toluic series, according to the equation
    C,, H15   N, 0„ + 2H I=C„ (H7I)              + Cie (H7 Ha  N) O4, H I + N,.
 It  crystallizes in white plates of       a  pearly lustre, which in their che
mical and physical properties are very similar to iodobenzoic acid.
                          Iodanisic Acid,       Ci0 (H7 1) 0„
is obtained by the action of hydriodic               acid upon the nitrogenous
 acid CMH15N,01a,

 Exceedingly small, nearly white needles, almost insoluble in boiling
 water, very soluble in alcohol and in ether.
     The  new method       of substitution, by which the        described   products
 were    obtained, although        less   direct than the ordinary         processes,
 promises nevertheless       to adapt   itself to several cases  of special interest.
 I  am at present engaged in pursuing these experiments, with the view
 of producing fluo- and cyano-benzoic               acids and their homologues,
 which have never been obtained.
     The experiments which          I have described were performed in Pro
  fessor Hofmann's      laboratory.

          mum and Minimum                   Mercurial Thermometer, invented by
          Mr. James Hicks."    By Balfour Stewart, Esq. Com
          municated by J. P. Gassiot, Esq. Received Feb. 7, 1860.
     About      a   fortnight since,     Mr. James Hicks,                the intelligent foreman
of Mr. L. P. Casella, Optician, called at Kew Observatory with an
instrument of the above description, for the purpose of having it
compared with the ordinary maximum and minimum thermometers.
This comparison proving very satisfactory, and the principle of the
instrument commending itself to Dr. Robinson, Mr. Gassiot, Pro
fessor Walker, and several other scientific men who examined                                             it,
Mr. Gassiot          requested      me to write           a   short description of             it,   whi;ih
he thought might be    of interest to the Royal Society. For many
particulars of this description,    am indebted to Mr. Casella and
                                                I
Mr. Hicks, who furnished me with details regarding the construction
of the instrument.
     Its chief       advantage      consists        in   its furnishing      us with       a   mercurial
minimum thermometer, no serviceable                            instrument of this description
having hitherto            been     made.           At the     same time     it   is   also capable      of
being used as         a   mercurial maximum thermometer.
     The principle of the instrument                     is   briefly as follows       :—
     It     cylindrical bulb nearly 3£ inches long and half an inch in
          has   a
diameter, filled with mercury. This gives a bore nearly ^th of an inch
wide, and       a    scale   on which          1°   Fahr. corresponds to about                  ^th of
an inch.            When     the graduation has reached                  150° Fahr. or so, both
the tube and the scale are made to assume    position at right angles
                                                                    a
to that which they occupied previously, so that the first portion of
the thermometer being vertical, the second will be horizontal.   The
numbers on the horizontal scale are not, however,                             in   continuation of
those on the vertical          ;    for in the instrument from which this account
is   taken, while 150°  the highest division on the vertical scale, the
                               is
first on the horizontal   — 10°, the next 0°, the 3rd 10°, and so on.
                                    is
The    reason       of this method of graduation will immediately appear.

                                                   313
     Above the mercury there is                a    small quantity of spirits of wine,
which extends some distance into the horizontal tube.                            The quantity
of this, and the graduation, correspond in                       such a manner, that the
extreme end of the spirit column denotes                         the same degree of tem
perature as the mercury.                The remainder of the horizontal tube is
filled with air.       There are two moveable indices in the spirit column,
one in the vertical tube, the other in the horizontal, each about                               half
an inch long.         The former, B, consists of            a fine steel magnet enclosed
in glass.     This forms the body of the index. At either extremity there
is   a head   of black glass, similar to that which occurs in the index
of   an ordinary minimum               thermometer.           A    fine hair is tied round
the neck of this index, between                the body and the upper head                  ;   and
it is   made to hang down by the side, so that by its elastic pressure
against the tube, the index may be kept in its place, notwithstand
ing its verticality.          The index in the horizontal tube A, is in all
respects      similar to that of an ordinary minimum thermometer.
     Let   us now suppose           the instrument fixed in its position, the first
part of the stem being vertical.
In order to adjust           it,   we must
first   bring      the vertical       index
into contact with the upper ex
tremity of the mercurial column.
To    do this, let us take two small
but strong horseshoe               magnets,
and lay the one above the other,
so that the poles         of the   one shall
overlap to     a   small extent the cor
responding poles of the other.
Bring the       magnets       up to the
index in such         a   manner, that,
while the poles        of the      one bear
against the side            of the     glass
tube, the overlapping poles shall
lie over the tube so as to be in front of the index                        :    the index will
now follow the motion of the magnets,                      and    it   may thus be brought
down to the surface of the mercury.                      In order to bring the horizontal
index to the extremity of the spirit column, all that                      is   necessary       is   to
incline the horizontal tube            a   little downwards        by   pressing on the end.

                                       314
      The indices being     now set and the instrument           in adjustment, let
   us suppose the temperature to rise ; the mercurial column              will push
   the vertical index up, but this index will remain in its place when
   the mercury again falls, and will therefore denote                the maximum
   temperature reached.        On the other hand, let us suppose the tem
  perature to fall.      The mercury in falling is followed by the spirit
  column propelled by the air behind it.           The spirit column, again, will,
  on its edge coming in contact with the end of the horizontal index,
  draw the index with it into a position, where it will remain when
  the mercury again        rises.    This index will therefore register the
  extreme minimum point which the spirit              column has reached      ;   but
  by the principle    of graduation, this will correspond with the mini
  mum point reached by the mercurial column.
     Let us now suppose       that a small portion of the spirit column has
  become   separated,    and lodged itself in the extremity of the tube.
  The principle of graduation will immediately enable us to discover
  this, by a want of correspondence being produced in the readings
  of the mercurial   and   of the spirit column.          If, for instance,  before
 the separation, the mercury read 50°, and the horizontal                extremity
 of the spirit   column     also  50°,  it is  clear  that,  after the abstraction
 of spirits has taken place, the horizontal column will read lower.
     We have thus a check upon this possible source of error, which
 we have not in the ordinary minimum thermometer.                   Indeed, it is to
 all intents a mercurial minimum thermometer that we are now de
 scribing, the spirits serving merely as          a vehicle for the indices.       It
 will be remarked, that were both columns capable of acting in a hori
 zontal position, there would be no necessity for the bend, and the
 instrument would be more portable           ; but in this position it is found
 that there is danger of the spirits becoming mixed with the mercury,
 and thus interfering with the action of the instrument.               Should this
 ever be brought about by travelling, or any other cause, a smart               jerk
 or two of the instrument will join the          separated   columns and put all
 right.
     The instrument    is thus constructed     : — The vertical tube, including
 the bulb, is first made and filled with mercury to the proper height,
 and the magnetic index is introduced ; then the horizontal tube is
joined, and the spirits of wine and the horizontal index are introduced.
The bulb is then placed in a freezing mixture, in order that the

                                        315
   mercury may retreat as far as possible,             followed     by the spirits
   of wine.     The tube is then    sealed, care being taken that the bore
   shall end in a small rounded chamber          ;  for  if pointed,   some    of the
   spirits would be apt to lodge there, whence          it would     be difficult  to
   remove it.      The object of cooling the bulb before sealing         off, is that
   we may have as much air in the tube as possible           ; for its pressure, as
   already mentioned, enables the spirits to follow the mercury when
   the latter falls.
      To graduate the instrument,       set it with the mercurial stem hori
  zontal in melting ice, then point off the extremity of the mercurial,
  and also   of the spirit column  as corresponding to 32° Fahr.            Perform
  a  similar operation in water at 42°, 52°, 62°,      &c, and    also in freezing
  mixtures down to zero, or lower      if necessary.
      In conclusion, if   used as a wet-bulb thermometer, this instrument
  will give  us the maximum and minimum temperatures                of evaporation
  obtained under precisely the same circumstances.
  II. " On     the Expansion of Metals and          Alloys." By F. Crace-
         Calvert, Esq., F.R.S., and 6. Cliff Lowe, Esq. Com
         municated    by   Mr. Calvert.       Received December           1, 1859.
                                   [Abstract.]
      One of us having been engaged         for    some time in investigating
  several  of the properties of pure metals, it was thought desirable to
  take advantage of having pure metals at our disposal, together with
 a series of definite alloys of those metals, to determine their rate of
 expansion.       And   we were   encouraged in pursuing          this course of
 investigation, by finding     that several of the authors who had pre
 viously published tables of the expansion of metals differed widely
 in their results.     These discrepancies, having reference to some of
 the metals most extensively used, might, we thought, be due either
 to the method employed, or to the fact that metals of different de
grees of purity had been experimented upon.               Therefore, being sure
of the purity of the metals that         we   intended to employ, we had
recourse    to   a  method the accuracy of which we trust will appear
satisfactory.
     Owing to the difficulty of obtaining the metals in           a  pure state in
large quantities, we found it necessary to employ square bars, having
     vol. x.                                                           z

therefore devised a process to determine with accuracy the expansion
of such short bars.                       This,     we believe, we have effected,                                 as   our appa
ratus will easily indicate an expansion amounting to the 50,000th of
an inch, or about the 2000th part                                of   a millimetre.
     Omitting the description of our apparatus and of the details of
our operations, which would be long for this abstract of our results,

    On comparing       these coefficients            with     those found by previous ex -
perimenters, we find that they agree very closely in those cases where
commercial metals have been employed.                             But when        we come to those
metals which we employed in                  a   pure state, such as lead, tin, zinc,
silver, copper, bismuth,           antimony,           cadmium, and gold, we find                         a
marked difference,         which we attribute to our experiments having
been made       with pure metals ; and we are confirmed in this view by
several     series of experiments made with impure or commercial
metals.
    We give in our paper           several       series       of experiments which prove
that, as for conductibility          of heat         by bodies,         their molecular condi

    The following communications             were read     : —
I.    "Measurement           of the     Electrostatic         Force produced        by   a
          Daniell's     Battery."       By Professor William Thomson,
          F.R.S.       Received    January 21, 1860.
    In    a paper    " On Transient Electric Currents," published in the
 Philosophical        Magazine for June 1853,           I  described a method          for
 measuring differences         of electric potential         in absolute electrostatic
 units, which seemed to me the best adapted                     for obtaining accurate
results.      The "absolute electrometer" which             I exhibited   to the  British
Association on the occasion of its meeting at Glasgow in 1855, was
constructed for the purpose of putting                 this method into practice,
and, as       I  then explained, was adapted to reduce the indications                  of
 an electroscopic * or of a torsion electrometer to absolute measure.
    The want of sufficiently constant and accurate instruments of the
latter class has long delayed           my carrying out         of the plans then      set
 forth.        Efforts   which   I   have   made     to produce electrometers to
 fulfil   certain   conditions of sensibility,       convenience,       and constancy,
 for various objects, especially the electrostatic measurement                    of gal
vanic forces, and of the differences            of potential required        to produce
sparks in air, under definite conditions, and the observation of natural
atmospheric electricity, have enabled me now to make a beginning of
absolute     determinations, which        I hope   to be able to carry out soon in
a much more accurate manner.               In  the meantime        I shall give a slight
description of the chief instruments and processes followed, and state
the approximate results already obtained,              as     these may be made the
     *  I  have used the expression    " electroscopic   electrometer,"   to designate an
electrometer     of which the indications are merely read off in each instance by a
single observation, without the necessity of applying any experimental process of
weighing, or of balancing by torsion, or of otherwise modifying the conditions
exhibited.

foundation of various                important        estimates    in several             departments
of electrical      science.
     The absolute electrometer alluded                      to above, consists               of   a plain
metallic disc, insulated in                a   horizontal     position, with a somewhat
smaller plane metallic disc hung centrally over                        it,   from one end of the
beam     of   a   balance.         A   metal    case protects the suspended                   disc from
currents of air, and from irregular electric influences, allowing                                  a   light
vertical rod, rigidly connected with the disc at its lower end, and sus
pended from the balance above, to move up and down freely, throngh
an aperture        just wide enough not               to touch it.           In the        side    of   the
case there        is   another aperture, through which projects an electrode
rigidly    connected         with the lower insulated disc.                      The upper disc           is
kept in metallic communication with the case.
     In using this instrument to                   reduce   the indications of an electro-
scopic or torsion electrometer to absolute electrostatic measure,                                       the
insulated part of the electrometer                   is   kept in metallic communication
with the insulated disc, while the cases enclosing the two instruments
are also kept          in metallic communication with             one another.               A    charge,
either positive or negative,              is   communicated to the insulated part of
the double apparatus.                  The indication of the           tested electrometer                is
read off, and at the same time the force required to keep the move
                                                                                       it,
able disc at      a    stated distance from the fixed disc below                       is         weighed
by    the balance.This part of the operation      as    anticipated,       is,       I
somewhat troublesome, in consequence of the instability of the equi
librium, but with  little care
                             a  may be managed with considerable
                                               it
accuracy.         The plan which           I     have hitherto         followed, has been to
limit the play of the arm of the balance                          to   a     very small arc,              by
means      of firm      stops suitably placed, thus allowing                     a   range   of motion
to the upper disc through but                  a   small part of its whole distance from
the lower.         A     certain weight         is   put into the opposite scale of the
balance,      and the indications of the second electrometer are observed
when the electric force             is   just sufficient    to draw down the upper disc
from resting in its upper position, and again when insufficient, to keep
it down with the beam pressed on its lower stop. This operation                                           is
repeated      at different distances,              and thus no considerable error de
pending on         a    want of parallelism            between     the discs could remain
undetected.            It   may be remarked that the upper disc                      is   carefully ba
lanced     by   means       of   small weights attached to         it,   so as to make            it   hang

                                            321
as nearly as possible parallel to the lower disc.            The   stem carrying it
is graduated to hundredths of an inch            ; and by watching     it through a
telescope at a short distance,       it  is easy to observe    ToVuth of an incu
of its vertical motion.
   1 have recently applied this method to reduce to absolute electro
static measure     the indications of an electrometer forming part of                 a
portable apparatus for the observation of atmospheric electricity.
In this instrument      a very   light bar of aluminium attached at right
angles to the middle     of a  fine platinum wire, which is firmly stretched
between the inside coatings        of two Leyden phials,         one occupying an
inverted position above         the other, experiences         and indicates       the
electrical   force which     is the subject of measurement, and which
consists   of repulsions in contrary directions on its two                ends,   pro
duced by two short bars of metal fixed on the two sides of the
top of a metal tube,       supported by the inside coating of the lower
phial.
   The amount of the electrical force (or rather            as it should be called
in  correct mechanical language, couple) is measured                  by the angle
through which the upper Leyden phial must be turned round an
axis coincident    with the line of the wire,         so as to bring the index to
a  marked position.       An independently insulated metal            case, bearing
an electrode    projecting outwards, to which the body to be tested                  is
applied, surrounds      the index and repelling            bars, but     leaves   free
apertures above and below, for the wire to pass through                    it without
touching it   ;  and by other apertures in its sides and top, it allows the
motions of the index to be observed,               and   the Leyden phials to be
charged or discharged at pleasure, by means of an electrode applied
to one of the fixed bars described           above.     When by     means     of such
an electrode    the inside coatings of the Leyden phials are kept con
nected   with the earth, this electrometer becomes               a plain repulsion
electrometer, on the      same,    principle    as Peltier's,  with the exception
that the index, supported by a platinum wire instead of on a pivot,
is directed by elasticity of torsion instead of by magnetism ; and the
electrical effect to be measured        is produced by applying the electrified
body to   a conductor connected          with   a  fixed metal case round the
index and repelling bars,        instead     of  with   these   conductors      them
selves.
   This electrometer;    being   of suitable sensibility for direct comparison
                                                                     2 a 2

with the absolute electrometer according to the              process   described
above,   is not sufficiently sensitive to measure         directly the electro
static effect of any galvanic battery of fewer than two hundred cells
with much accuracy.             Not having at the time arrangements for
working with a multiple battery of reliable character, I used a second
torsion electrometer of a higher degree of sensibility as a medium
for comparison, and determined the value of its indications by direct
reference   to a  Daniell's      battery of from six to twelve elements         in
good working order.          This electrometer, in which     a light aluminium
index, suspended     by means of a fine glass fibre, kept constantly elec
trified by means of      a  light platinum wire hanging down from it and
dipping into some     sulphuric acid in the bottom of a charged Leyden
jar, exhibits the   effects    of electric force due to a difference   of poten
tials between two halves of a metallic ring separately insulated in its
neighbourhood,      will   be   sufficiently described in another communi
cation to the Royal Society.          Slight descriptions of trial instruments
of this kind have already been published in the Transactions of the
Pontifical Academy of Rome*, and in the second edition of Nichol's
Cyclopaedia (article Electricity, Atmospheric), 1860.
    I hope soon to have another electrometer on the same general prin
ciple, but modified from those hitherto             made,   so as to    be more
convenient for accurate         measurement in terms of constant units.
In the meantime        I  find, that, by exercising sufficient care,       I  can
obtain good measurements             by means    of the divided ring electro
meter of the form described in Nichol's Cyclopaedia.
    In the ordinary use of the portable electrometer, a considerable
charge is communicated to the connected                inside coatings of the
Leyden phials, and the aluminium index is brought to an accurately
marked position by torsion, while the insulated metal case surround
ing it is kept connected          with the earth.     The   square   root of the
reading of the torsion-head thus obtained measures the potential, to
which the inside coatings of the phials have been electrified.                 If,
now, the metal case referred to is disconnected from the earth and
 put in connexion with a conductor whose potential is to be tested,
 the square root of the altered reading of the torsion-head required
 to bring the index to its marked position in the new circumstances
measures    similarly the difference between this last potential and that

of the inside coatings of the phials.                  Hence the excess of the latter
square root above             the former expresses            in degree and in quality
(positive      or negative) the required potential.                     This plan has not
only the merit of indicating the quality of the electricity to be tested,
which is of       great    importance in atmospheric observation, but it also
affords a much higher degree of sensibility than the instrument has
when used as a             plain     repulsion       electrometer   ;    and, on account
of this last-mentioned             advantage,    it was adopted in the comparisons
with the divided ring electrometer.                   On the other hand, the portable
electrometer was used in its least sensitive state, that is to say, with
its Leyden phials connected with the earth, when the comparisons
with the absolute electrometer              were made.
  The        general   result of the weighings hitherto made,                  is that when
the discs of the absolute electrometer were at a distance                              of twenty
hundredths of an inch, the number of degrees of torsion in the port
able    electrometer was 3-229 times the number of grains' weight
required to balance the attractive force ; and the number of degrees
of torsion       was   7.69      times the number of grains' weight found in
other series of experiments in which the distance between the discs
was    thirty hundredths.            According to the law of inverse squares of
the    distances to which the attraction between                    two parallel discs is
subject when a constant difference of potentials is maintained between
them *, the force           at a distance       of    ^   of an inch would         have been
TOT' according to the first         of the preceding results, or, according to
the second,               of the number of degrees of torsion. The mean of
these is           or 1-2   ;   and we may consider this number as represent
ing approximately               the value   in grains' weight           at   -jL   of an inch
distance      between the discs      of the absolute electrometer, correspond
ing to one degree          of torsion of the portable electrometer. By com
paring the indications  of the portable electrometer with those of
the divided ring electrometer, and by evaluating those of the latter
in terms of the electromotive force of    Daniell's battery charged
                                                          a
in the usual manner,            I   find that 284 times the square root                   of the
number of degrees of torsion in the portable electrometer                          is   approxi
mately the number of cells of               a   Daniell's     battery which would pro
duce an electromotive force (or, which                 is   the same thing,        a   difference

to give    a     force    of   14-9 grains, since the force                   of attraction       is   propor
tional to the square of the difference of potentials between the discs.

of   a   square foot, and therefore the amount of attraction per square

and      1000     cells' difference of potential,                  is   79-5       grains.       To     reduce
the statement            to consistent units founded on                       a    foot as the unit of
length,     we may suppose,                 instead     of              of    an        inch, the distance
between        the discs         to be           of   a   foot.          We conclude that, with
an electromotive force or difference                  of potentials produced      1000                 by
cells of DanitU's              battery, we       find for the force of attraction 55-3
grains per square              foot between discs separated                        to   a   distance of         -j-uu
of   a   foot.
     This result differs very much from                        an estimate              I     have made ac
cording      to my            theoretical    estimate          of 2,500,000                 British     electro
magnetic units for the electromotive force of                                      a     single element            of
Danicll's and Weber's comparison of electrostatic with electro-mag
netic units.          On the other hand,           it   agrees to             a   remarkable degree of
accuracy with direct observations made for me, during my absence
in Germany,         Mr. Macfarlane, in the months of June and July
                         by
1   856, on the force of attraction produced by the direct application
of   a   miniature Danicll's battery, of different numbers from 93 to 451
of   elements,        applied to the same absolute electrometer with its discs
at '079     of    an inch asunder.             These observations gave forces varying,
on the whole, very closely according to the square of the number of
cells used       ;    and the mean result reduced according to this law                                           to
1000      cells was 23'4             grains.       Reducing             this to the distance
of   a   foot, and dividing by -187, the area                      in    decimal of a square foot,
we find 54 -3 grains per square foot at                        a   distance of pj^ of             a    foot.
     Although the experiments leading                     to this result were executed with
great care         by    Mr. Macfarlane,       I   delayed         publishing            it   because    of     the
great      discrepance          it   presented     from the estimate                    I     deduced       from
Weber's measurement,                   which was published while my preparations

                                          325
were in progress.          I cannot doubt its general correctness now, when
it is  so decidedly confirmed by the electrometric experiments           I  have
just described, which        have been executed    chiefly by   Mr. John Smith
and    Mr. John Ferguson, working in my laboratory with much ability
 since   the month of November.             I am still  unable to explain the
 discrepance, but it may possibly be owing to some miscalculation                I
 have made in my deductions from Weber's result.
    Glasgow  College,   Jan. 18, 1860.
                            Postscript, April    12, 1860.
     I  have   since      found   that   I  had inadvertently    misinterpreted
 Weber's     statement in       the ratio of 2 to    1.    I had always,    as  it
 appears most natural to me to do, regarded the transference of nega
 tive electricity in one direction and of positive electricity in the other
 direction, as identical agencies, to which in our ignorance as to the
 real nature of electricity         we may apply     indiscriminately   the one
 expression or the other, or        a  combination of the two.     Hence  I  have
 always regarded a current of unit strength as a current in which the
  positive or vitreous electricity flows in one direction at the rate of a
  unit of electricity per unit of time; or the negative or resinous
  electricity in the other direction at the same rate         ; or (according to
  the infinitely      improbable      hypothesis  of two electric fluids)      the
  vitreous electricity flows in one direction at any rate less than a unit
  per second, and the resinous in the opposite direction at a rate equal
  to the remainder of the unit per second.                I have only recently
  remarked that Weber's           expressions are not only adapted to the
  hypothesis of two electric fluids, but that they also reckon as a cur
                                   I
  rent of unit strength, what should have called a current of strength 2,
  namely a flow of vitreous electricity in one direction at the rate of a
  unit of vitreous electricity per unit of time, and of the resinous
  electricity in the other direction simultaneously, at the rate of a unit
  of resinous electricity per unit of time.
      Weber's result as to the relation between electrostatic and electro
  magnetic units, when correctly interpreted,           I  now find would be in
  perfect accordance with my own results given above, if the electro
  motive force of a single element of the Daniell's battery used were
   2,140,000 British electro-magnetic units instead of 2,500,000, as

                                       32G
according to my thermo-dynamic estimate.              This is as good an agree
ment as could be expected when the difficulties of the investigations,
and the uncertainty which still exists as to the true measure of the
electromotive force of the Daniell's element are considered.             It must
indeed be remarked that the electromotive force of Daniell's battery
varies by two or three or more per cent. with variations of the solu
tions used ; that it varies also very sensibly with temperature ; and
that it seems also to be dependent,        to some extent, on circumstances
not hitherto      elucidated.    A   thorough    examination of the electro
motive force of Daniell's and other forms of galvanic battery, is an
object of high importance, which it is to be hoped will soon be at
tained.    Until this has been done, at least for Daniell's battery, the
results of the preceding paper may be regarded as having about as
much accuracy as is desirable.
    I may state therefore, in conclusion, that the average electromotive
force per cell of the Daniell's batteries which        I have used, produces a
difference of potentials* amounting to -0021 in British electrostatic
measure.     This statement is perfectly equivalent to the following in
more familiar terms      : —
    One thousand cells of Daniell's battery, with its two poles connected
by wires with two parallel plates of metal -f^th of a foot apart and
each a square foot in area, produces an electrical attraction equal to
the weight of 55 grains.

     The electrometers      used   in this investigation were the absolute
 electrometer and the portable electrometer described in my last
 communication to the Royal Society, and the operations were ex
 ecuted by the same gentlemen,         Mr. Smith and Mr. Ferguson.           The
 conductors between which the sparks passed were two unvarnished
 plates of   a condenser,     of which    one was moved by a micrometer
 screw, giving a motion       of ^s   of an inch per turn,       and having its

head    divided into 40 equal parts of circumference.           The readings
on the screw-head      could be readily taken to tenth parts of     a division,
that is to say, to           of  an inch on the distance to be measured.
The point from which the spark would          pass in successive  trials being
somewhat variable and often near the edges of the discs, a thin flat
piece   of metal,  made very    slightly convex on its upper surface    like an
extremely flat watch- glass, was laid on the lower plate.         It  was then
found that the spark always passed between            the crown of this con
vex piece    of  metal  and the flat upper plate.      The curvature of the
former was so small, that the physical circumstances of its own elec
trification near its crown, the opposite electrification of the opposed
flat surface in the parts near the crown of the convex, and the electric
pressure    on or tension in the air between         them could not, it was
supposed,     differ sensibly from those between       two plane conducting
 surfaces   at the same distance and maintained at the same difference
of potentials.
     The reading of the screw-head corresponding to the position of
 the moveable disc, was always determined electrically by making a
 succession   of sparks    pass,  and approaching the moveable        disc gra
 dually by the screw until all appearance        of sparks  ceased.    Contact
 was thus produced without any force          of  pressure  between    the two
 bodies capable     of sensibly distorting their supports.
     With  these   arrangements several series of experiments      were made,
 in which the differences      of potentials producing sparks    across differ
 ent thicknesses     of air were measured     first by the absolute electro
 meter,   and afterwards by the portable torsion electrometer.              The

   These numbers demonstrate an unexpected and a very remarkable
result, — that greater electromotive force per unit length of air is
required to produce a spark at short distances than at long.   When
it is considered that the absolute electrification of each of the op
posed surfaces                t
                           simply on the electromotive force per unit

length of the space between them, or, which is the same thing, the
resultant electrostatic force in the air occupying that space, it is
difficult even to conjecture an explanation.                           Without attempting to
explain        it,    we are forced to recognize the fact that                thin stratum of

    The    series  of experiments here tabulated stops at the distance
 18  thousandths of an inch, because it was found that the force in the
 electrometer corresponding to longer sparks than that, was too strong
 to be measured     with certainty by the portable electrometer, whether
from the elasticity of the platinum wire, or from the rigidity of its
connexion with the aluminium             index being liable to fail when more
than 85° or 90° of torsion were applied.               So far as it goes, it agrees
remarkably well with the other experiments exhibited in Table                       I.,
as is shown by the following            comparative Table, in which,            along
with results of actual observation extracted from Table                      II.,  are

   The    close  agreement     with one another of the numbers in Col. 4,
derived from series differing so much as those in Cols. 2 and 3,
and obtained by means of electrometers differing so much in con
struction, constitutes a very thorough confirmation of the remarkable
result inferred above from the experiments of the first series, and
shows that the law of variation of the electrostatic force in the air
required to produce sparks of the different lengths, must be repre
sented with some degree           of accuracy by the numbers shown in the
last column of either Table           I. or Table     III.

   In order that the-different expressions, " potential," " electromotive

tallic surface balanced by air,"                used in the preceding statement,                          may
be perfectly understood,              I   add the following explanations and defini
tions belonging to the ordinary elements of the mathematical theory
of electricity.
   1.   Measurement         of quantities of electricity. — The unit quantity
of electricity is such           a quantity,         that,     if   collected in         a   point, it will
repel an equal quantity collected in                      a   point at       a   unit distance with a
force equal to unity.
   [In British absolute              measurements             the unit distance is one foot                    ;
and the unit force is that force which, acting on a grain of matter
during   a second      of time,       generates       a   velocity of one foot per second.
The weight of a grain at Glasgow is 32-2 of these British units of
force. The weight of a grain in any part of the earth's surface may
be estimated with about as much accuracy as                                      it   can be without        a
special experiment to determine it for the particular                                   locality, by the
following expression         :   —
   In latitude    X average weight              of   a    grain
      =32-088 x(l+-005133X sina X) British absolute units.]
   2. Electric density. —This term was introduced by Coulomb to
designate the quantity of electricity per unit of area in any part of
the surface of    a   conductor.           He   showed how to measure                    it,   though not
in absolute measure, by his proof plane.
  3. Resultant electric force at any point in an insulating fluid. —
The resultant force at any point in air or other insulating fluid in
the neighbourhood of an electrified body,                           is   the force which          a   unit of
electricity concentrated at that point would experience                                 if   it   exercised
no influence on the electric distributions                          in   its neighbourhood.
  4. Relation between electric density on the surface      conductor,                   of   a
and electric fores at points in the air close to it. — According to                                        a
proposition of Coulomb's,                  requiring, however, correction,                        and first
correctly given        by   Laplace, the resultant force at any point in the
air close to the surface of            a   conductor          is   perpendicular to the surface
and equal to Avp,       if  p     denotes       the electric density of the surface in
the neighbourhood.
   5. Electric pressure from the surface of conductor balanced           a                                 by
air. — thin metallic shell or liquid film, as for instance
        A                                                  soap-bubble,                 a

                                       331
if  electrified, experiences    a real mechanical force in a direction per
 pendicular to the surface outwards, equal in amount per unit of area
 to  2rp%, p  denoting, as before, the electric density at the part        of the
 surface considered.      This force may     be called either a repulsion (as
 according to the views of the eighteenth century school) or an attrac
 tion effected by tension of air between the surface of the conductor
 and the conducting boundary of the air in which it is insulated,            as  it
 would probably be considered to be by Faraday           ;  but whatever may
be the explanation    of the  modus operandi by which it is produced,            it
is a real mechanical force, and may be reckoned as in             Col.  5  of the
preceding Table, in grains weight per square inch or per square foot.
In   the case of the soap-bubble, for instance, its effect will be to cause
a slight     enlargement of the bubble on electrification           with   either
vitreous or resinous electricity, and     a corresponding collapse on being
perfectly discharged.      In  every case we may regard it as constituting a
deduction from the amount of air-pressure which the body experiences
when unelectrified.       The amount of this deduction being different
in different parts according to the square of the electric deusity, its
resultant action on the whole body disturbs its equilibrium,                 and
constitutes in fact the resultant electric force experienced by the
body.
    6.  Collected formula of relation between electric density on the
surface of a conductor, electric diminution of air-pressure upon it,
and resultant force in the air close to the surface. — Let, as before,
p denote the first of these three elements,         let p denote the second
reckoned in units of force per unit of area, and let            It  denote    the
third.     Then   we have
                                R=4vp,
    7.  Electric potential. — The amount of work required to move a
unit of electricity against electric repulsion from any one position to
any other position, is equal to the excess of the electric potential            of
the first position above the electric potential of the second position.
    Cor.  1.  The electric potential   at all points close to the surface       of
an electrified metallic body has one value, since an electrified point,
possessing so small      a   quantity of electricity as not sensibly to in
fluence the electrification    of the metallic  surface,   would,  if held near
the surface in any locality, experience       a force  perpendicular      to the
surface in its neighbourhood.

  8. Interpretation                    of   measurement           by electrometer.

of electrometer consists of                   a    cage or case containing           a   moveable and              a
fixed conductor, of which one at least                           is   insulated and put in metallic
communication,                   by

the electric force experienced by the moveable part in                                   a   given position
cannot be electrically influenced except by changing the difference
of potentials between the principal electrode and the uninsulated
 conductor or conducting system in the electrometer.                                         Even the best
 of ordinary electrometers hitherto constructed                              do not       fulfil this         con
 dition, as the inner surface of the glass of which the whole or part
 of the enclosing case    generally made,
                                       is   liable to become electrified,
                                                                  is
 and inevitably does become so when any very                                 high electrification                  is
 designedly or accidentally introduced,                               even for   a   very short time                ;
 the consequence                 of which     is    that the moving body will generally not
 return to its zero position when the principal                              electrode         is   perfectly
 disinsulated.              Faraday long ago showed how to obviate this radical
 defect by coating the interior                       of the     glass    case with      a    fine network
 of tinfoil     ;   and     it   seems strange that even at the present day electro
 meters         for scientific research,               as for instance for the investigation
 of atmospheric electricity, should                         be constructed           with      so bad          and
 obvious        a   defect uncured             by   so simple and perfect            a   remedy.         When
it   is    desired to leave the interior                of the electrometer                  as much      light

as possible,    and to allow         it to   be clearly seen from        any external
position with      as     little embarrassment as possible,      a cage made         like a
bird's cage, with an extremely fine wire on a metal frame, inside the
glass shade used to protect the instrument from currents of air, &c,
may be substituted with advantage                for the tinfoil network lining of
the glass.      It   appears     therefore that a properly constructed electro
meter is an instrument for measuring, by means of the motions of                            a
moveable conductor, the difference            of potentials of two conducting
systems insulated from one            another, of one of which the case or cage
of the apparatus forms part.              It may    be remarked in passing, that it
is sometimes      convenient in special researches           to insulate the case or
cage     of the apparatus, and allow it to acquire             a potential differing
from that of the earth, and that then, as always, the subject of
measurement          is the difference of potentials between           the principal
electrode     and the case or cage, while in the ordinary use of the
instrument      the potential        of the latter is the      same as that         of the
earth.      Hence we may regard the electrometer merely as an instru
ment for measuring differences of potential between two conducting
systems      mutually insulated       ;   and the object to be aimed at in per
fecting any kind of electrometer (more or less sensitive as it may be,
according to the subjects of investigation for which it is to be used),
is,   that accurate evaluations in absolute measure,               of differences of
potential,     may   immediately derivable from its indications.

      9. Relation between electrostatic force and variation of electric
potential. —   §     7,    otherwise stated,   is   equivalent to this   : — The      ave
rage component electrostatic force in the straight line               of air      between
two points in the neighbourhood                of   an electrified body      is   equal to
their difference         of potentials divided by their distance. In other
words, the rate         of variation of electric potential per unit of length in
any direction,       is   equal to the component       of the electrostatic       force in
that direction.         Since the average electrostatic force in the line joining
two points at which the values of the potential are equal,                   is   nothing,
the direction of the resultant electrostatic force at any point must be
perpendicular        to the      equipotential      surface passing through           that
point   or the lines of force (which are generally curves) cut the
        ;
series of equipotential surfaces at right angles. The rate of varia
tion of potential per unit of length along             a   line of force   is   therefore
equal to the electrostatic force at any point.

or curved metallic surfaces maintained at different potentials. — Let a
denote the distance between the metallic surfaces on each side of the
 stratum of air at any part, and       V the difference of potentials.        It  is
 easily shown that the resultant electrostatic force is sensibly constant
 through the whole distance,      from the one surface to the other         ;  and
 being in a direction sensibly perpendicular to each, it must (§ 9)

 be equal to     .  Hence    (§ 4) the electric density         on each   of the
 opposed surfaces     is equal to   -V —.    This is Green's theory of the

 any part of either from any conductor differing from it in potential.
 The electric density will    be uniform over the whole of each of the

    These results, as well as those shown in the preceding Tables,
demonstrate a much less rapid variation with distance, of the electro
static force preceding       a spark, at the greater than at the smaller
distances.    It seems most probable that at still greater distances              the
electrostatic force will be found to be sensibly constant, as it was
certainly   expected      to be at all distances.         The limiting     value   to
which the results shown in the last Table seem to point must be
something not much less than 2800.              This corresponds to a pressure
of 9600 grains weight per        square   foot.    We may therefore conclude
that the ordinary        atmospheric pressure of 14,798,000 grains per
square foot, is electrically relieved by the subtraction           of 9600   on two
very slightly convex        metallic surfaces,    at  a distance    of r^jth   of  an
 inch or more, before the air between           them is cracked and a spark
passes.     By taking into account the result of my preceding                  com
 munication    to the Royal        Society, we may also          conclude that      a
 Daniell's battery of 5510 elements can produce a spark between two
slightly   convex metallic      surfaces    at  ^th of       an  inch  asunder in
ordinary atmospheric air.

III. " On       the Lines     of the Solar Spect rum."        By Sir David
         Brewster, K.H., D.C.L., F.R.S.,              and   Dr. J.   H. Glad
         stone, F.R.S.       Received January 26, 1860.
                                   (Abstract.)
    In   a paper in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh
for   1 833,  Sir David Brewster stated that he had examined the lines
of the solar spectrum, and          those produced by the intervention of
nitrous acid gas, and had delineated them on a scale four times greater,
and in some parts twelve times           greater than that employed in the
beautiful map of Fraunhofer.          None of these drawings, however, were
published at the time      ;  they were increased by frequent observations
continued through succeeding          years  ; and now having been collated,
arranged, and added to by Dr. Gladstone, they form the diagrams
accompanying this paper.
    The figures    consist  of —
     1st.  A map of the whole spectrum         58 inches long, and exhibiting
about 1000 lines and bands.           This map includes a great prolongation
of the spectrum at the least refrangible end, before A, with a series
of bands and lines not hitherto described.
     2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th.        Enlarged delineations of the portions of
the spectrum between          A  and B, and between       E and F, exhibiting
additional lines, with still more magnified views of the groups         a and b.
    6th.    A map  of the two extremities of the solar spectrum     as observed
 by   Dr. Gladstone about noon-day        at midsummer, consequently when
the sun was at its greatest altitude.       This  shows several bands between
A   and B, and a series      of lines in the lavender rays extending      as far
as   M. Becquerel's N, and corresponding evidently with the                maps
published by him and by Professor Stokes, with the addition of finer
lines.     Yet this  map   represents   the extreme    spaces of the spectrum
where there is no effect on the organ of vision, while that of M.
Becquerel represents the want of chemical action, and that of Pro
fessor Stokes the absence       of fluorescent power.

    7th.       map                                        compiled from the
independent observations of the two authors.            These lines and bands
are visible only when the sun is rising or setting, that is to say, when
his beams traverse a long stratum of our atmosphere.             In  some cases

                                        340
they are merely the deepening           of  bands    seen at any time,    in other
cases they are bands which appear for the first time when the sun
is close to the horizon.        Professor Piazzi Smyth has represented some
of  these lines in his delineations       of the spectrum      as observed     from
the Peak of Teneriffe, whence           he had the advantage        of  seeing   the
sun at an altitude of — 10,1.            The   most     remarkable of the atmo
spheric lines are situated in the orange            and yellow spaces, and one
band just beyond D is discernible in the diffused light of              a dull day
at any hour, though       it  covers what is about the brightest part        of the
prismatic image       obtained from direct sunshine.           The    western    sky
after sunset exhibits these phenomena in a striking manner, and with
some variations that do          not appear to depend         altogether on the
absence or presence       of moisture, although when the           sun looms red
through    a fog these lines also make their appearance.              They   are in
no respect due to the mere reduction in the quantity              of light.
    The dispersion and absorption of the more refrangible rays by                the
atmosphere, and by fogs, smoke, and such media as dilute milk                    and
water, is a quite independent phenomenon.
    8th and 9th. Enlarged views of          A  and B, when the light is acted
 upon by a long passage through the atmosphere.
    10th.   A map    of the spectrum, exhibiting on a large scale the dark
lines and bands     which were seen by Sir David Brewster when nitrous
acid gas is interposed between           the prism and the source         of light.
 Their position   is  identified by the insertion of the principal lines of
 the solar spectrum.       They differ considerably from a smaller drawing
 of the   same  by Professor W. A. Miller, who employed a deeper
 stratum of the red gas.
    The light of the moon, which is only that of the sun reflected from
 her surface, exhibits all the principal         lines from about    B to H, and
 no fresh ones ; and when the luminary was near the horizon, the more
 prominent atmospheric lines were detected.                The  green colour was
 observed   to extend    a  little beyond    F in   the spectrum of moonlight,
 and the space between G and           H  appeared     lavender or lavender-grey
 instead of violet.
    In respect to the origin     of these lines,  it is conceivable that the light
 when emitted from the photosphere itself is deficient in these rays,
 or that they are due to absorption by the atmosphere of the sun, or
 by that of the earth. The first of these suppositions scarcely admits

                                          341
of a positive proof.        If the  second be true,      it might  be expected that
the light from the edge         of the solar disk would exhibit more        of these
absorption bands than that from the centre, which must have traversed
a smaller amount of atmosphere ; but such was not found to be the
case.    The third supposition         is favoured by the fact that the atmo
sphere has unquestionably much to do              with the manifestation of many
of these lines, and by the analogy            of the  bands  produced by nitrous
acid gas, bromine vapour, and other absorbent, media.                    The experi-
mentum cruets     of observing      an artificial   light through   a  long space of
air was attempted by means of the revolving light on Beachy Head,
as seen from Worthing at a distance of twenty-seven miles.                   It gave
a negative   result   ;  but on account of the great difficulty of detecting
slight breaks in   a   faint thread of light, no great reliance is to be placed
on the experiment.          A   similar doubt rests on the authors' observa
tions of fixed stars, and on the non-recognition by Fraunhofer of the
ordinary lines in the light of Sirius and Castor, while on the other
hand he did detect D and            b in that of other stars.         The origin of
these lines is  still   an open question.
   The spectra of artificial flames sometimes exhibit bright lines
coincident with the dark spaces of the solar spectrum.                     Thus the
yellow band in the flames of soda,              and several    other substances,   is
 identical in refrangibility       with  D  ;  but the most remarkable case is
that of charcoal or sulphur burnt in nitre             ; the spectrum shows three
very prominent lines, two of which coincide with A and D,
                                                                             while a
faint red line appears at B, and a group between it and A.
   A map is also given of the bright lines, principally orange, that
make their appearance            when nitrate of strontia is placed on the
ignited wick of     a   spirit-lamp.
IV. " On      some New Volatile Alkaloids given off during Putre
       faction."      By F. Crace Calvert, Ph.D., F.R.S., &c. Re
       ceived February 23, 1860.
    Some eighteen months ago my friend Mr. J. A Ransome, surgeon
to the Royal Infirmary, Manchester, induced me to make some
researches with the view of ascertaining the nature of the products
                                                                    in the hope of
given off from putrid wounds, and more especially

                                           312
throwing some light upon the contagion known as hospital gangrene.
I fitted up   some apparatus to condense                the noxious products from
such wounds      ;  hut the quantity obtained was so small, that it was
necessary   for me to acquire         a more    general knowledge of the various
substances   produced during the putrefaction of animal matter, before
I  could determine the nature of the products from sloughing wounds.
I  therefore began a series       of experiments, the general results of which
I  now wish to lay before the Society.
    Into  each  of   a  number of small barrels twenty lbs. of meat and
fish were introduced, and to prevent the clotting together of the mass,
it  was mixed layer by layer with               pumice-stone.         The top of     each
barrel was perforated in two places, one hole being for the purpose
of admitting air, whilst through the other a tube was passed which
reached to the bottom of the barrel.                    This tube was put in con
nexion with two bottles containing chloride of platinum, and these
in their turn connected         with an aspirator.           By this arrangement air
was made to circulate through the casks, so as to become charged with
the products of putrefaction and to convey them to the platinum salt.
 A yellow amorphous precipitate             soon appeared,        which was collected,
 washed with water and alcohol, and dried.                 This precipitate     was found
 to contain C,     H,  and   N, but what is highly remarkable, sulphur and
 phosphorus enter       into its composition.           The presence of C, H, and
 N   was   ascertained      by elementary analysis            ;  for the sulphur       and
 phosphorus,     a  given weight of the platinum                salt, 0-547 grm., was
 oxidized with nitric acid, and gave 0'458 grm. of sulphate of baryta
 = 11 per cent. of sulphur, and 0-266 of pyrophosphate of magnesia
 = 6-01 per cent. of phosphorus. I also ascertained the presence of
 these two substances        by heating      a  certain quantity of the platinum
 salt with strong caustic ley, when            a  liquid, volatile and inflammable
 alkaloid was obtained, whilst the sulphur* and phosphorus remained
 combined with the alkali and were easily detected.                    I satisfied myself
 during these researches, which have lasted more than twelve months,
  that no sulphuretted nor phosphuretted hydrogen was given off                      ; and
  my researches,     as far as they have proceeded,             tend to prove that the
    * Some of the platinum      salt was treated with C Sa, which did not remove any
 free S, and the beautiful     orange-yellow     colour   of the precipitate   showed   the
 absence of sulphuret   of platinum.

                                       343
noxious vapours given off during putrefaction, contain the N, S, and
Ph of the animal      substance,   and that these elements are not liberated
in the simple form of ammonia, and sulphuretted and phosphuretted
hydrogen.      I also  remarked during this investigation, that,   as putre
faction proceeds,     different volatile bodies are given off.
    Before concluding,      I may add, that when the platinum salts are
heated    in small test-tubes,      they give off vapours, some acid and
some alkaline,      possessing    a most obnoxious and sickening      odour,
 very like the odours      of putrefaction   ; and that at the same time a
 white crystalline sublimate, which is not chloride of ammonium, is
 formed.
    As  I foresee  that these researches will occupy several years,   I have
 deemed    it my duty in the mean time to lay the above facts before
 the Society.

    The following communications      were read   : —
 1.  "On    the Electrical Phenomena which accompany Muscular
       Contraction."      By   Professor    C.   Matteucci.          Commu
       nicated by   Dr. Sharpey, Sec. R.S.             Received January 7,
       1860.
    Dr. Radcliffe has recently communicated to the Royal Society
some observations on the nature of the electrical phenomena accom
panying muscular contraction.       It  is known that       M. du Bois-Rey-
mond admits that the muscular current diminishes during contrac
tion, and that he attributes the phenomena indicated by the galva
nometer to the momentary predominance of currents due to the
polarization of the electrodes   of platinum   over the muscular current.
In my last memoir      on Electro-physiology,    which was communicated
to the Royal Society and appeared in the Philosophical           Transactions
for 1856,    I proved that these phenomena take place independently
of the  existence  of secondary currents of the      electrodes,  and  I hence
concluded, at least as regards the muscles      of frogs, that during     con
traction there is a current, or rather        an    instantaneous electrical
discharge, which takes a contrary direction to that of the relaxed
gastrocnemius, and in general to that of the current which is found
on applying    the extremities of the galvanometer to the extremities
of the limbs of   a frog.
    In order to avoid the influence of secondary polarity, M. du Bois-
Reymond,      and after him several   other German physiologists,         have

                                             345
thought         it expedient       to   contract and tetanize                   the gastrocnemius
before closing the circuit              of the galvanometer            ;    the deviation thus
obtained is feebler than that which is due to the current of a muscle
in repose,        but never       in a contrary direction                  to that due to this
current.
     I   have    already remarked*           that    this        result accords                  with    that
which is obtained by the ordinary experiment, in which the muscular
current is in circulation previously to the contraction of the muscle.
In   fact, we know that by continuing to keep the muscle                                     in contrac
tion, above all when the muscle remains tetanized, the electric phe
nomenon accompanying contraction (the effect of which is to pro
duce a deviation of the needle in a contrary direction to that of the
current of    relaxed muscle) becomes gradually less intense
                     a                                                                                  as the
contractions are more and more feeble.
     The method employed by Dr. Radcliffe                    is the same as that which                          I
followed in my latest experiments              ;   that    is,   he made use                of amalgam
ated plates of pure zinc as electrodes, immersed in neutral solution             a
of sulphate of zinc, and after having ascertained that there was no
thing to fear from the effects of secondary polarity, he says that he
finds that the needle              deviated by the muscular current descends,
during contraction, towards zero, but only more slowly than                                       it    would
have done had the circuit been opened.
     Dr. Radcliffe next          examines    another of my experiments, in which,
instead of placing           a   gastrocnemius in the circuit,              I          employ      a    thigh
cut transversely at the upper- extremity, so that the needle remains
deviated        in   a   contrary direction to that of the gastrocnemius.                                      In
this arrangement of the experiment, when contraction                                        is   produced,
the deviation of the needle increases, which                      is   perfectly in accordance
with the idea that during contraction               a     muscular current                  is   developed
in   a   contrary direction to the current of the relaxed gastrocnemius.
Dr. Radcliffe            attempts to explain this result by supposing                                    (if
                                                                                                           I
rightly understand his idea) that during contraction the contacts
with the electrodes are deranged so as to facilitate the passage of the
current of the relaxed muscle.
     Being unwilling to remain in doubt as to the nature of the elec
trical phenomena of muscular contraction,                        I         have        of   late repeated
and varied my experiments.
                         *   Nuovo Cimento, September 1858,                p.   238.

                                           316
    Aa to Dr. Radcliffe's         first remark,      I shall only observe    that in
the principal      experiment the needle           does not merely move       slowly
towards zero       during contraction,         but is seen,  during the first con
tractions, especially when the frog operated on is vivacious, to move
rapidly down to zero, to oscillate, to pass to the opposite side, and
sometimes      even to remain fixed, while thus deviated,         for a very short
interval of time.         This result, which is easily obtained and can            be
verified without       difficulty,   is the same, whether the electrodes         are
of platinum, like those employed by M. du Bois-Reymond,                        or of
zinc.
    It is easy to understand that, in order to succeed in these experi
ments, it is desirable that the needle should be as little deviated as
possible before the contractions           :  this object is best ensured in the
following way : — I prepare the frog by reducing it                to two thighs,
leaving a single lumbar nerve in order to obtain contractions in one
of the thighs.       Instead of saturated         solution of sulphate of zinc,     I
employed      a weak   solution of this salt, in order to avoid any alteration
of the   surface   of the  muscles    ;  and finally, in order to maintain exactly
the same points of contact between               the two electrodes    and the two
near points      of the middle portion of the thigh, I employ two fine
woollen cords or two thin strips of card-board fixed with sealing-wax
on a plate of glass and soaked in the same solution.                   The experi
ment is made by applying               the glass plate with a certain pressure
on the thigh, so that the two cords on one side touch the thigh, and
on the other are placed in contact with the cushions of flannel or
card-board which are immersed together with the electrodes,                 accord
ing to the method followed by             M. du Bois-Reymond.
    I  think it useful to        describe    in a few words a little     apparatus
which affords a good deal of facility for making these experiments.
 It  consists   in a small square block             of wood, with   a cavity deep
enough to receive         the electrodes       and the cushions.     It   is hardly
necessary     to say that this cavity is coated with a varnish           of sealing-
wax and divided in the middle by a glass plate.                 Another cavity in
the same block serves as a recipient for the two thighs               ; the sciatic
 nerve   extends beyond the block, and rests               on two platinum     wires
 which communicate with the pile or with the electro-magnetic ma
 chine.    The communication            between    the thigh and the electrodes is
established by means of the glass plate                in the manner above de

                                            347
scribed, that is,        I press this strip    of  glass slightly on the middle         of
the    thigh on one side, and at the same time the extremities of the
two woollen cords          come to rest on the cushions.         The    movements       of
the    needle are observed          through    a telescope   (lunette).     I  have re
peated this experiment thirty or forty times.                  Sometimes, and this
case is the most frequent, the first deviation produced by the muscle in
 repose is directed in the same sense as that of the current of the
gastrocnemius         ;  sometimes    the current is null, or almost null       ;  some
 times, and this case is the most rare, the deviation is in a contrary
 direction, and this occurs most frequently in operating on the hinder
 portion of the thigh.
     In all     these    experiments, the moment that the thigh begins                  to
 contract, the needle moves              in a constant direction     ;  the deviation
 which       intervenes is greater or less according to the force                 of the
  contraction,       and indicates       constantly    a descending discharge or
  current of extremely short duration, which traverses the thigh in the
  direction of the ramification of the nerves, and in           a  contrary direction
  to the current of the gastrocnemius.

  of some investigations by Dr. Rousseau of Vezy, which                  do away with
  certain very perplexing variations in the order of these               movements.
     The    movements      resulting from the action of a galvanic current upon
  nerve     are usually divided into the three periods          of double,    alternate,
  and single contraction which are set down in the following Table                    : —

      Professor Bernard proposes to place another period before                                                  the
 first    of these — a                period corresponding                 to the normal unexhausted
 and undisturbed state                     of    nerve,     and characterized by contraction at
 the beginning of the two currents, direct as well as inverse.
      The investigations of Dr. Rousseau show how it is that the order
 of   these contractions is altered by certain changes                                        in the arrange
 ment of the nerve acted upon by the current.                                           If   the nerve acted
upon be divided and lifted up at its end, so as to break the circuit of
the derived current*, the order of contraction is that which is put
down in the preceding Table                           ;    if   the nerve acted upon be raised in a
loop (either without dividing  or, after dividing    it,
                                                  by dropping down                  it,
the end), so as not to break the circuit of the derived current, the
order of contraction                     is    that which         is      represented        in the following

     Now Dr. Rousseau                   shows    that the order of contraction set down
in the second Table is due to the action of this derived current.                                                   He
shows, also, that by excluding              the derived current (which he does
by means                of an ingenious triple arrangement of poles called the
" rheophore              bifurque      "), the order of contraction                       becomes           one and
the same in the case where the nerve is divided and lifted up at its
end, and in the case where the nerve is arranged in a loop, the order
being that which is set down in the first Table.
     On inquiring into these matters experimentally, the author finds
reason to believe                 that Professor Bernard                 has wandered into some
degree        of error, and that the path of inquiry                                    opened       out by Dr.
Rousseau is not only a right path, so far as its discoverer has traced
it out, but that it                   leads    to the explanation of some very curious
alternating movements                    which have not hitherto been described.                                    He
has been led, also, to form certain conjectures respecting the modus
operandi of electricity in muscular motion which he trusts may serve
to simplify this very difficult and complex subject.
       1.   When          nerve    is in its normal, unexhausted, undivided state,
there        is,   as    Professor Bernard points out, contraction at the begin
ning of both currents, inverse as well as direct, and at the beginning
only,       ifa feeble current be used.                  This, for example, will be the result
of the application                    of the     feeble      current           produced             by     partially
moistening the small galvanic forceps of Bernard with saliva.                                                   But     it
is   also    a     fact, that     a    stronger current — the current for example                                  of   a
Pulvermacher's                 chain of ordinary length moistened with vinegar —
will produce contraction at the                       end as well as at the beginning                                   of
both currents (as in the period of double contraction),    applied                                    if
to nerve similarly circumstanced. Nay,
     a                                        fact, that the feeble    it     is    a
current of the forceps will give contraction at the beginning of both
arranged  in    loop across the poles
                    a                                PN    of   a   galvanic        apparatus   ;    the primitive
current, indicated by the black arrow,                    passes     by the         shortest    route       from    the
positive pole  to the negative pole
                    P                  the derived current, indicated by the dotted
                                                 N;
arrows, passes            by
                   the longest route between these poles, and as      also proceeds             it
from the positive pole  to the negative pole N,
                                  P                                           passes in the contrary direc
                                                                      4, it
tion to that of the primitive current.  In fig.                               the   sciatic    nerve       is   divided
between      P     and the thigh, as      is   meant where      the nerve           is   spoken      of    as   divided
and lifted up at its end and being divided, the only current passing
                                   ;                                    the primi                     is
tive current for the circuit of the derived current being broken, there can be no

                                        350
 currents, and at this time only, after the stronger current of the chain
 has produced contractions at the end as well as at the beginning
 of both currents, and that        we may produce alternately again and
 again the contraction       confined to the beginning,         and a contrac
 tion occurring at the end as well as at the beginning, of the cur
 rents, by applying      alternately the feeble         current of the forceps
and the stronger current      of the chain.        The author finds,   also, that
the feeble current of the forceps will produce contraction at its end
as well as at its beginning,     if  the nerve be raised and placed as            a
loop across the points of the forceps         ;   and not only so, but that the
same current    will produce contraction only at its beginning, if it be
applied after slipping away the points of the forceps, and so allowing
the nerve to fall back upon the muscles.                 Hence the single con
traction at the beginning of        a feeble    inverse or direct current, and
not at the end, instead of indicating, as Professor Bernard supposes,
the normal state of undisturbed and unexhausted irritability in the
nerve,  must only be looked upon as the result of the action of a
feeble current under particular        circumstances.       In a word, the fact
is one which     reflects the strength of the current rather than the
condition of the nerve.                                                        ,
    2. The curious alternating movements,             which do not appear        to
have been described      hitherto, and which may be explained by means
of the key which Dr. Rousseau             has put into our hands, are best
 seen when the current is made to act upon the lumbar nerves               of one
side, but they are also seen in the case where a loop           of sciatic  nerve
is acted upon.
    Take the back, loins, and hind limbs of a frog with the lumbar
nerves   properly exposed,     raise    the nerves on one side into a loop
without dividing      them, place them over the platinum             poles of     a
galvanic apparatus (a Pulvermacher's chain of ordinary length), and
pass the current.      On doing this, as might be expected, there is in
the first instance, contraction in the limb to which the nerves acted
upon belong, but this contraction          is slight and transient when      com
pared with    the contraction which is set up in the opposite limb, the
nerves  of which are not acted       upon.       In this opposite limb, indeed,
the contraction is sure to be     both strong and tetanic.         A little later
(and it is to the phenomena of this stage that the author wishes to
direct attention), and the results are as follows : — With the inverse

                                               351
primitive current there is contraction in the leg belonging                        to the same
side when the current begins to pass, and contraction                           in the leg be
longing to the opposite side when it ceases to pass                       ;    with the direct
primitive current           this       order of contraction         in        the two legs   is
reversed.
     In    bringing   about these           curious alternations,             the action of a
derived current is obviously concerned                  ;   for on excluding this current
by means of Dr. Rousseau's rheophore bifurque-,                           they come to an
end, and the movements                   resulting from the action of the current
are confined to the leg, the nerves of which are directly acted upon.
It   is evident, also, that a derived current is what is wanting to pro
duce the contraction in the limb belonging to the opposite side; for
after breaking the circuit                of the derived current by dividing the
lumbar nerves where they emerge from the spine, and separating the
divided ends,         and after then completing the circuit by dropping
down the end of the divided nerve, or by bridging                             over the gap by
a piece      of wet string or paper, by             a strip   of the animal's skin, by a
piece of wire, or by any other conductor,                      it matters not what, the
contractions occur alternately in the two legs just as they did before
the nerve was divided.                  Nay, it may     be argued from the following
experiment, that reflex nervous action has nothing to do in producing
these alternations.         Divide the lumbar nerves on one side, not where
they emerge from the spine,                  but where they pass into the thigh                 ;
raise the divided          end    of the     nerve, and place       it   across the poles    of
the galvanic apparatus.                  In this   case the circuit      of the derived cur
rent is broken, and the action of this current is therefore put out of
the question.         In   this case, the nerve acted upon by the current is
still in connexion with the spinal cord, and through the cord and the
nerves proceeding from this cord, with the limb on the opposite side ;
and hence it might be supposed                     that the current might irritate the
cord, and so provoke contraction in the limb on the opposite side.
But the simple fact              is,   that the current may be passed inversely or
directly without       producing          contraction       anywhere, except now and
then   a   few flickersin the muscular fibres in the lumbar region of the
side      corresponding to that of the nerve operated upon.  The simple
fact, indeed, appears            to show that reflex nervous action can have
nothing to do with the contractions in the limb belonging to the
opposite side, which contractions are produced by the action of the
     vol.    x.                                                                2   c

                                     352
galvanic current on one set of lumbar nerves            ; and, certainly,  with
the key furnished      by Dr. Rousseau, reflex nervous action is not
required to explain the phenomenon.
   The following diagram will give the           case in which      the lumbar
nerves on one side are acted upon by the inverse            primitive current,
a a being the lumbar       nerves, P N the      poles of the galvanic appa
ratus, the black arrow the primitive          current, the dotteoVarrows    the
derived current.      The results,   as seen in contraction        in the limb
belonging to the same side, or in that belonging to the opposite side,
are seen in the Table below the figure.          The  case is plain.
                                   Fig.  1.

       On the opposite side  .  .           0              Contraction.
   On the side acted upon by the inverse primitive current, the por
tion of nerve nearest     to the muscles       supplied   by the nerve     (the
muscles of the leg) is traversed,       not by the inverse primitive       cur
rent, but by  a direct derived current      ;  and hence we should expect
to find in the leg on this side (for        at the time     of these alternate
contractions the nerve is in the state in which the current produces
contraction alternately at the beginning of the direct current and at
the end of the inverse current) the effects of a direct current — con
traction at the beginning of the current.          We should expect to find
this ; for of two currents acting upon the same nerve, it is the one
nearest to the muscles supplied by the nerve which acts upon these
muscles.    In the limb   on the opposite side we should expect, on the
contrary, the effects of an inverse current
                                                 — contraction at the end of

                                          353
the current, for the lumbar nerves on this side are traversed by an
inverse derived current        ;  and   this, as the Table shows, is actually
the case.
   A similar diagram and         table  will show that the results of passing a
direct primitive current through a portion of the lumbar nerves on
one side are in accordance           with the same law.       In this  case, as in
the other, the acting current on both sides is the derived current.
On   the side acted    upon by the direct primitive          current, the acting
derived current (acting because nearest to the muscles supplied by
the nerve) is inverse ; and therefore the limb on this side ought to
contract at the end of the current. On the opposite side, the course
of the derived current is direct, and therefore the limb on that               side
 ought to contract when the current begins to pass             : and so it is.

    The   results of the action of a galvanic current upon a loop of
 sciatic nerve are, after a time, analogous to those which have just
 been mentioned.         At first, the contraction attending upon the
 beginning and ending of both currents affects the whole limb ; after
 a time, the leg and thigh contract alternately, in an order which
 changes with the direction of the current.
    Let the following diagram          and table represent the case in which a
 loop of sciatic nerve is acted upon by the direct primitive current,
 a being the nerve, P N the poles of the galvanic apparatus, the black
 arrow the primitive current, the dotted arrows the derived current ;
 and it will be seen that the portion of nerve between the negative
                                                                 2c   2

pole and the leg is acted upon by an inverse derived current, and
that the thigh is traversed by  a direct derived current.        Thus —
                                  Fig. 3.

                                          0            Contraction.
   Hence there ought to be, as there is in fact,         and as the Table
shows, contraction in the thigh when the current begins to pass, and
in the leg when the current   ceases to pass.
   A. similar diagram and table will give the case in which a loop of
sciatic nerve is acted upon by the inverse primitive current, and show
at a glance   that the leg ought to contract at the beginning of the
current, because the current, acting upon the portion of nerve nearest

show that the thigh ought to contract at the end of the current, for
the thigh is traversed by inverse derived current.                         In   fact, however,
the thigh does not contract either at the beginning or at the end of
the current ; and this perhaps is not to be wondered at ; for the
author finds that contraction attends upon the beginning of a direct
current of a given strength for some time after it has ceased to
attend upon the end of an inverse current of the same strength.
  3.   The       modus operandi         of galvanism upon       a   motor or mixed nerve
is a subject beset with difficulties              ;    but some of these difficulties do
not appear to be altogether insurmountable.
   (a) In looking at the movements belonging to the first period —
that of double contraction (vide Table I.) — it is not difficult to find
a reason    which will in some degree explain how it is that contraction
is confined to the beginning and end                    of the current.         It   is not diffi
cult to    see    that the beginning and ending of the galvanic current in
the nerve may involve certain changes in the strength of the nerve-
current, and that these                 changes       may in their turn             give rise      to
momentary induced currents in the nerve and in the neighbourhood                                    ;
for such momentary currents are induced, not only when a current
begins     to pass and when it ceases to pass, but also at the moments
when it undergoes any change of strength.                      It   is not difficult to see,
also, that the muscular fibres to which the nerve                      is distributed may
be the seat       of   some    of the   secondary      currents thus induced, and that
these fibres may be thrown into contraction by these currents.                                  Nor
is it difficult to        see   — if the contraction        be thus connected with the
induced currents — that there will be no contraction in the interval
between the beginning and ending                      of the inducing galvanic current              ;
for   if the     inducing current exhibits no variation in strength, there is
no secondary current induced in this interval.
   (6) It    perhaps, too much to expect at present full explana
                 is,                                                            a
tion of the second period of contraction —of that period, that      in                       is,
which the contraction alternates at the beginning of the direct and at
the end of the inverse             current    ;   but the author      is   disposed      to think
that   a   partial answer may be found in the collation of the three facts
which follow.
   The first fact       is    this — that the direction of the nerve-current in the
sciatic and lumbar nerves of              a   frog (except in those last moments of

                                           356
all iu which the action of the galvanic current upon the nerve gives
rise to the    " voltaic                                   In
                          alternatives") is inverse.          these last moments
the nerve-current in these nerves may be sometimes                  direct, some
times inverse, and this change of direction                 may take place    more
 than once   ;   but except in these last moments, the author finds the
direction of the nerve-current to be invariably inverse.
                                         Fig. 5.
   The   second fact is furnished by Professor du Bois-Reymond                in an
experiment in which          the two ends of a long portion of nerve are
placed upon the cushions of two galvanometers, and the middle of
the nerve is laid across the poles of          a  galvanic apparatus.      Looking
at the needles      of the galvanometers        before passing the galvanic cur
rent, they are seen to diverge under the action of the nerve-current               ;
and from the direction of the divergence,             it is evident that this cur
rent passes from the end to the side of the nerve.                Looking    at the
needles while the galvanic current is passing,             one needle is found to
move    still further from      zero,    the other is found to return towards
zero.    Let A B      be the nerve    ;   let the arrows a    a1 and  b b' be   the
nerve-currents included between              the cushions a a' and     b  V of  two
galvanometers      ;  and let the arrow        PN   be the current   between    the
poles  P N of     the galvanic apparatus         ; and under this arrangement
the needle of the galvanometer will recede, and show increase of cur-

rent ( + ) at the end B, where the nerve-current and galvanic current
coincide in their direction ; and at the end A, where the two currents,
natural and artificial, do not coincide in their direction, the needle
of the galvanometer will         go     back, and show decrease          of nerve-
current (  —
               ).
   The third      fact,  which has been recently furnished           by Professor

                                             357
  Eckardt,   is to be found in an experiment which                    may be illustrated
  by means of the two following               figures.        In this experiment, the
  nerve of a properly prepared frog's leg is placed, one portion (that
  nearest to the leg) across the poles I I' of an induction coil, another
  portion across the poles P N of           a  galvanic apparatus.         Having    done
  this, the leg is first thrown into        a state    of tetanus by passing a series
  of induced currents, and then (the tetanizing influence still con
  tinuing in operation) the continuous current of the galvanic apparatus
  is transmitted from        P  to  N.    This is the experiment.            The result
  is that the   tetanus      ceases when, as in fig. 7, the inverse current
                                          Fig.   7.
 passes, and continues when, as in fig. 8, the direct current passes.
 Nor is this result altered by inverting the order in which the con-
                                                          i

                                                         'IFH        (       rn
 tinuous and induced currents are made to act upon the nerve.                      Thus
the induced currents produce contraction                    if applied after the direct
continuous current, but not            if applied after the inverse         continuous
current.     Nay, it would even seem as               if  the direct current is actu
ally favourable to contraction          ; for   a   solution of salt, which of itself
is too weak     to produce tetanus when applied to a nerve, will have
this effect when a direct current is made to pass through another
portion of the same nerve.           In performing this experiment, Professor
Eckardt     proceeds      as   follows : — First of all he tetanizes a frog's
hinder limb by placing a portion of the nerve nearest to it in                  a strong
solution of salt     ;  after this he adds water until the strength of the
saline solution is no longer sufficient to keep up a state              of contraction
in the muscles     ;   then, all things      being as they were, he passes the
direct current through          a  portion of nerve which is not immersed in
the solution.     The result is that the tetanus immediately returns.

                                      358
   Now, on comparing this last fact with the two previous facts, we
may have, as it seems to the author, some insight             into the mode in
which the galvanic current acts upon nerve in the period of alternate
contraction.    On the one hand, it is seen that tetanus is prevented or
arrested  by the inverse 'current     ; that is to say, tetanus is prevented
or arrested when (as the first and second facts show) the galvanic
current coincides in direction with, and imparts power to, the nerve-
current.     On the other hand, it is     seen that tetanus is not prevented
or arrested by the direct current       ;  that is to say, tetanus is not pre
vented or arrested when (as the first and second facts still show) the
galvanic current differs in direction from, and diminishes the power
of, the nerve-current.      The   one result is in harmony with the other ;
for  if contraction is counteracted by imparting power to the nerve-
current, it is to be expected        that contraction will be favoured by
detracting    power from the nerve-current          ;  and certainly it is no
matter of wonder that contraction should be favoured by detract
ing power from the nerve-current, for it is an established fact that
rigor mortis is coincident with absolute extinction of            the nerve and
muscular currents, and that ordinary contraction is attended by un-
mistakeable weakening of these currents.              It is also an established
fact, that muscular contraction is produced by the discharge            of ordi
nary statical electricity, and not by the charging and charge.           Nay, it
is not improbable that the contractions at the beginning and ending
of the current, in the period of double contraction, which contractions
 have been referred by the author to the action            of induced currents,
may in reality be due to the withdrawal rather than to the commu
 nication of these currents    ; for these induced currents are of moment
 ary duration,     disappearing at the very instant of appearing, and
 exhibiting peculiarities in disappearing which connect the disappear
 ance with    the discharge of statical electricity, rather than with the
 more quiet cessation of current electricity.
    And   if this be so— if the inverse current antagonizes             and the
 direct current favours contraction — then        we may in some degree un
 derstand how it is that contraction occurs alternately at the beginning
 of the direct, and    at the end   of the inverse current.
    When the     inverse   current passes, there is no contraction at the
 beginning of the current, for the influence of this current upon the
 nerve-current is one which antagonizes        contraction    ; when the inverse

                                         359
current ceases to pass there          is contraction, for then the influence
which antagonized contraction            is removed.      When,     on the other
hand, the direct current passes, there is contraction at the beginning
of the current, for the influence of the current upon the nerve-current
is one which favours contraction           ; when the direct current ceases to
pass, there is no contraction, for then the influence is no longer one
which favours contraction.
    (c)  In the third period — that of single contraction — the muscular
movements       resulting from the action of          a galvanic current upon
nerve    are   at first  sight somewhat perplexing          ;   but with a little
thought,     it may    be seen     that the same key will apply            to then-
interpretation.
    If, as has    just   been   mentioned, contraction        attends upon the
beginning of the direct current because              this current is found to
 favour contraction, it is not difficult to find        a reason   which will ex
plain in some degree, not only why in the period               of double contrac
tion the strongest contraction            is at the beginning       of the direct
current, but also why in the first part of the period now under con
sideration — that of single contraction — contraction should continue
 to attend upon the direct        current after it has ceased to attend upon
the inverse current.          Nor  are the apparent irregularities in contrac
tion, the "voltaic alternatives,"         entirely inexplicable;     for it may be
 that these seeming       irregularities — this apparent shifting of contrac
 tion from the beginning of the direct to the beginning of the inverse
 current, and so backwards and forwards once and again — may be
 nothing more than the natural consequence              of the   changes which at
 this time have taken place, and are taking place, in the direction of
 the nerve-current.

     The following communications       were read : —
  I. " On   the Solar-diurnal Variation of the Magnetic Declination
       at   Pekin."      By Major-General       Edward      Sabine, R.A.,
       Treas. and    V.P.R.S.       Received February 2, 1860.
    When the first year of hourly observations of the declination,
 January 1 to December 31st, 1841, was received at Woolwich from
 the Magnetic Observatory at Hobarton, and when means had been
 taken of the readings of the collimator-scale at the several hours in
 each month, and these monthly means          had been collected into an
 nual means, it was found that the mean daily motion of the declina
tion magnet at Hobarton         presented, as one of its most conspicuous
and well-marked      features,  a double progression in the twenty-four
hours, moving twice from west to east, and twice from east to west           ;
the phases of this diurnal variation were, that the north end of the
magnet moved progressively from west to east in the hours of the
forenoon, and from east to west in the hours of the afternoon          ;  and
again from west to east during the early hours        of the night, return
ing from east to west during the later hours of the night         : the two
easterly extremes    were attained at nearly homonymous hours         of the
day and night, as were also the two westerly extremes         ;  the ampli
tudes  of the   arcs traversed during the hours      of the day were con
siderably greater than those traversed during the hours of the night.
    When, in like manner, the first year of hourly observations, July
1st, 1842, to   June 30th,     1843, was received   from the Toronto Ob
servatory, and the mean diurnal march of the declination magnet

                                           361
was examined,         it was found to exhibit phenomena in            striking corre
 spondence       with those at Hobarton.           At Toronto    also a double pro
gression presented itself, of which the easterly extremes were attained
 at nearly homonymous hours, as were also the westerly                   ; whilst the
hours of extreme elongation were nearly the same (solar) hours at
 the two stations, but with this distinction, that the hours at which
 the north end of the magnet reached its extreme easterly elongation
 at Hobarton       were the same, or nearly the same, as those at which              it
 reached      its extreme westerly elongation at Toronto, and vice versd.
 Pursuing, therefore, the ordinary mode of designating the direction
 of the declination by the north            end   of the magnet in the southern
 as well as in the northern           hemisphere, the diurnal motion of the
 magnet may be said to be iu opposite directions at Hobarton                       and
Toronto     ;   but   if (in  correspondence with our mode of speaking in
 regard to another magnetic element, the Inclination) the south end
 of the magnet is employed to designate the direction of the motion
in the southern hemisphere, and the north                    end in the northern
hemisphere, the apparent contrariety disappears, and the directions,
 as well as the times         of the turning        hours, are approximately the
same at both stations.
    The double progression in the diurnal variation, which                   was thus
so distinctly       and concurrently       marked at stations so distant from
each other, and at which           the observations had been conducted with
 an elaborate      care which would admit         of no doubt     as to the depend
 ence to be placed on their general results, was at that time in great
 measure       an unexpected and even a startling phenomenon.                   In the
well-known description given by             M. Arago (in the instructions drawn

mena    of the diurnal variation in different parts of the globe, as then
known, they are represented as consisting of a single progression
only, with but one easterly and one westerly extreme, both occurring
during the hours of the day            ;  and no reference      or allusion whatso
ever is made         to the existence of a double progression, or of            a noc
turnal interruption         to the continuous motion in the one direction
between      the two extremes*.           That the diurnal motion must            be a

consequence,      in some way or other, of the sun's action, could not
be doubted, from the fact that the period in which                    the variation
takes place is a solar day      ;  and whilst the progression was regarded
as a single one in the twenty-four hours,           it accorded    sufficiently well
with the prevailing notion, that the magnetic variations were pro
duced by variations of temperature, to meet the general view, not
withstanding      the grave     doubts and dissents which from time to
time had been expressed            by those who more closely examined the
phenomena of particular localities.             As the      existence    of  a well-
marked double progression at some               stations on the globe could,
however, no longer be disputed, the difficulty which now presented
itself   was to explain in what way this apparently double action                 of
the   s un was produced.
    On   a careful examination of the diurnal motion of the declination
magnet on different days of the years referred to at the commence
ment of this paper, it soon became obvious that, both at Hobarton
 and Toronto, many days occurred in which the diurnal march was                     a
 single progression, the nocturnal retrogression wholly disappearing;
and that there were many more days in which this was more or less
approximately the case.           It further appeared,      on subsequently com
 paring the observations of the same years at both stations, that the
 days most distinguished by a large and even sometimes                  an extrava
gant interruption       of the otherwise continuous single progression,
 were    generally the same days at both stations             ; and by extending
 the comparison to other though less complete series of observations
 in other parts of the globe, these          days were identified as those on
 which magnetic storms had prevailed             ;   viz. days which had been
 distinguished     by the  occurrence of perturbations, often of very           con
 siderable magnitude, affecting simultaneously the magnetic elements
 in all parts of the globe as far as observation extended, presenting a
 remarkable uniformity in the effects produced at contiguous stations,
 but (as shown by the simultaneous observations at Toronto and
 Hobarton) manifesting a great variety both in the character and the
 amount of disturbance in parts of the globe distant from each
 other.    To   separate   the observations affected         by these exceptional
 and casual influences from the ordinary and what might be deemed
 that this should  be the case, since the observations   at Greenwich  and Kew have
 shown that the progression  is double at those stations.

the normal position of the declination magnet, and to study the
laws of each taken separately, as well          as  in their combination,      be
came     therefore    a preliminary work to the right understanding             of
either.    That     some such mode      of examination would        be required,
had indeed been anticipated in the instructions             drawn up with so
much sagacity by the Committee of Physics of the Royal Society,
for the guidance of those who should engage in the direction of the
 Colonial   Magnetic Observatories        then   in   contemplation.      In the
preface to those instructions, it is expressly stated           that  " the pro
 gressive and periodical magnetic variations are so mixed up with the
 transitory changes, that it will      be impossible to separate them so as
 to obtain   a correct knowledge and analysis of the progressive and
periodical,    without taking express       account of and eliminating         the
 transitory or casual."        The difficulties which impeded, and which
 still impede   an entire compliance with this instruction, viz. the          per
fect elimination of the transitory and casual changes, were found to
 be very great.       The direction which the magnet assumes when it is
 under the influence of      a  perturbation of this nature, is not distin
 guishable from the direction assumed           under the ordinary magnetic
 influence, by any other criterion yet known than by the magnitude
 of its deflection from       the mean    or normal position       in the same
 month and at the same hour          ;  the magnitude of the abnormal de
 flection may be thus taken, to a certain extent, as         a means    of recog
 nizing the existence of      a perturbing force, and it is the only one we
 possess.    If we    employ this criterion of magnitude as manifesting          a
 disturbed observation, and separate          the observations so disturbed
 from the others, we must still be aware that there may exist, and
 that probably there do exist, amongst the body of observations from
 which the large disturbances have been separated,             some which may
 be affected   by the same disturbing        cause or causes     operating in    a
 minor degree     ;  and assuming      the disturbances      to have     different
 laws from the general body, the unseparated minor disturbances
 may still impede the perfect deduction of the laws of the other class
 with which they are so intermixed.
    But though the criterion of magnitude may not enable us to effect
 a complete separation of the two classes, it will suffice to accomplish
 an approximation to that end ; it will separate a sufficient body of
 disturbed    observations, — disturbed      beyond the limit of any other

                                      3G4
known influential cause,    — to permit the laws of the disturbing         action
to be investigated   ; and when these laws are known, we are furnished
with the means of making at least an approximate estimation of the
influence exercised     by the uneliminated minor disturbances on the
laws which      we may proceed      to deduce       for the class of observa
tions from which       we   have not been       able    to effect   their perfect
separation.
    Adopting this method of partially eliminating the influence of the
 magnetic storms in the observations at Hobarton and Toronto, and
 proceeding in the first instance with the caution suitable to             a  first
 experiment, an unnecessarily high value (as it subsequently proved)
 was taken as that which should distinguish a perturbed observation,
 and consequently but a small body of disturbed observations was
 separated.     On  a recalculation     of the diurnal variation after the
 elimination of these, and a comparison of the results with the diurnal
 variation obtained previously from the whole of the observations, the
 character of the influence of the magnetic storms was very manifest.
 By the elimination of the larger disturbances, the interruption to a
 continuous progression from the afternoon of the one day to the
 morning of the following, was considerably diminished both in con
 tinuance and amount.         A smaller separating       value was then taken,
 and    consequently    a  larger  body    of    disturbed     observations    was
 eliminated  ;  the effect produced was      a  still further reduction of      the
 nocturnal feature.      These first essays were sufficient to show that
 the mean effects of the magnetic storms on the declination magnet,
 both at Hobarton and at Toronto, attained            a maximum in the early
 hours of the night, and constituted at both stations a very con
 siderable part,   if  not the whole, of the nocturnal            portion  of   the
 double progression which         has   been   described.       By still further
  diminishing the separating value, but still keeping it well within the
 limits in which no complication of disturbing causes would be
 hazarded, so little was found to remain of the nocturnal interruption,
  that  I ventured, in the 1st volume of the 'Toronto Observations,'
  published in 1845,      to express   the opinion that       "if   the whole in
 fluence of   the magnetic storms could be eliminated            from the obser
  vations, the residual portion      of  the   diurnal variation would be a
  single progression with but one maximum              and one minimum      in the
   twenty-four hours."

    The peculiar character of the magnetic storms (or disturbances                  as
they are sometimes called), and the periodical laws exhibited in their
mean effects, have been the subject of frequent investigations since
 1845.     It  is not necessary to notice on this occasion the results
of   these   further than as they are connected with the explanation of
the phenomena of the diurnal variation, which forms the subject
 of this paper.         It has   been    shown, by abundant         evidence,    that
 though apparently casual in the times of their occurrence, the mag
 netic storms nevertheless        produce mean effects, which, when the ob
 servations   of more than      a very few days are combined, are seen to be
 of  a  highly systematic character in all parts of the globe where their
 effects have been examined         : — that the    mean deflections which they
 occasion    have    always   their particular     hours of extreme     elongation,
 with continuous intermediate progression             : — that these hours are    dif
 ferent in different parts of the globe, exhibiting               apparently every
 possible variety     : — that  the disturbance diurnal variation, as for di
 stinction's    sake    it may be called, constitutes everywhere           a sensible
 portion of the diurnal variation shown by the mean of the hourly
  observations    from which no elimination of disturbed observations has
 been made     : — that the diurnal variation       so obtained is in fact a result
  ant of two diurnal variations superposed,              both referable to the sun
  as their primary cause, but manifesting by the difference              in the cha
  racter of the effects produced,        a  distinction in the mode of operation
  to which they are severally due. The disturbance variation is caused
  by deflections     which are only of occasional           occurrence  ;  the more
  regular solar diurnal variation is distinguished, on the other hand,
  by the regularity of its daily occurrence            ; and its hours of extreme
  elongation, or (as they may be more familiarly termed) its turning
  hours are the same, or nearly the same hours of local solar time in all
  parts of the globe, whilst those of the disturbance variation show
  almost every possible variety. The relative magnitudes or proportions
  of the two components differ           also very greatly at different stations      ;
  and thus, by the operation of         causes which as yet are but very im
  perfectly known, at localities where the magnetic storms                   are   ex
   cessive, the disproportion      of the components        becomes excessive    also,
  and the phases         of the regular variation are rendered altogether
   subordinate to those of the disturbance variation.               Until therefore
   the extension of observations shall give rise to and establish some

                                       3GG
 general theory whereby the influence of the disturbances in different
 parts of the globe may be predicated, their particular            laws at every
 station must be sought by a special investigation            ;     arid  no con
 clusion in regard to either of the components of the diurnal variation
 is entitled to be viewed      as final which   has not been        preceded      by
 such an investigation.
    It has appeared    desirable to enter more at length into this pre
 liminary statement    than may at first sight be thought to be required
 by those who have followed the different stages of the inquiries re
 ferred to, because the interpretation, which was given so far back as
 1845,   of the diurnal variation  at Toronto and Hobarton,         has scarcely
 received   the consideration which might seem due to         a   laborious and
 apparently successful analysis of the phenomena ; and there             are some
 eminent physicists who have framed or adopted theories for the ex
 planation of the diurnal variation, in which theories the existence of
a double progression as a universal and necessary phase is essentially
implied.     Amongst these, the most prominent perhaps, and the one
which     has  obtained the widest circulation,      is the theory           of  the
R. P. A. Secchi, Director of the Observatory of the Collegio Romano,
                                                     '
published originally in Italian in 1854 in the         Correspondenza Sci-
entifica' in Rome, translated into English in the edition of 1857 of
the late Dr. Nichol's ' Cyclopaedia of the Physical            Sciences,'       and
more recently adopted in the third volume of        M.  de la Rive's       '
                                                                             Traite
d'Electricite.' In M. Secchi's memoir, the diurnal variation, with its
double movement in the day and night, is ascribed to the direct
action of the sun as    a distant and powerful magnet, influencing the
magnetic needle at different stations on the globe in           a   manner con
tingent upon the direction of the magnetic meridian at each place,
and producing extreme deflections to the East and to the -West twice
in the twenty-four hours, the turning         hours being about six hours
apart, and stated to be appropriately represented       by  a formula of two
terms,    one involving the sine    of the hour-angle, and the other the
sine of twice that angle    : the phenomena of the double progression
at Toronto and Hobarton        are thus viewed by him as       "    Types of all
that happens beyond the limits of the torrid zone."
    If I  have represented    M. Secchi's   views  correctly, and       I think I
have done so, the question between        the conformity to nature of his
views and mine would be tested         by the facts (when they should be

                                                     367
 known) of the diurnal variation at a station in the middle latitudes
 where the principal influence of the magnetic storms should take
 place, not in the hours of the night,                              but in those     of the day.
 According      to my interpretation                  of the phenomena at Toronto and
 Hobarton, such             a   station ought to exhibit a single progression                 ;   ac
cording to      M. Secchi's,             a double progression                with turning    hours
about six hours apart.                 Such      a   station would therefore furnish what
might be deemed a crucial experiment.                               In the   extension   of our   ex
perimental knowledge which might be expected to follow from the
adoption by Her Majesty's Government of the recommendations of
the Royal Society and of the British Association, which                                  have been
communicated to Lord Palmerston with so much earnestness of pur
pose, and with so               just   an appreciation          of their importance, by His
Royal Highness the Prince Consort, as                           President of the British As
sociation, it had been anticipated that it would not be long before
the evidence derivable from such                       a   station would be secured to us.
I   have found        it,               had expected, or had hoped
                            however, sooner than           I
for, in the three years and ten months of hourly observations of the
Declination      at     Pekin,         from January            1,   1852, to October 31, 1855,
made    under the superintendence of M. Scatchkoff, attached to the
Russian       Embassy            at Pekin,       and published           by our distinguished
foreign member,                 M. Kupffer, in the volumes of the Annates          '
                                                                                                  de
l'Observatoire        Physique Central de Russie.'                       The results of      these
observations,    as far as they bear on the questions                        of the general phe
nomena      of the diurnal variation, and on the mode in which these
may be     explained, form the subject of the present communication.
    The examination of             these observations was first undertaken by me
for the purpose of ascertaining, as far as possible their means, the         by
precise epoch of minimum in the so-called decennial period of the
magnetic storms.                 With this       view      a   separation was made of the
larger disturbances in the usual manner, and their laws at Pekin in
vestigated.     In this           process   it   was soon perceived that the hours                of
principal disturbance were those of the day, both in the easterly and
in the westerly disturbance deflections and on subsequently receiving
                                                           ;
from the computers the annual mean of the diurnal variation cor
responding to the whole period of observation (in which the omission
of disturbed observations during the hours of the night had                                  been
comparatively very inconsiderable),                   I    was not surprised to find that

     If we   examine these figures, we perceive          that the motion from west
 to east, commencing at the turning                hour     between      1  and    2  in the
 afternoon, though comparatively slow during the hours of the night,
is continuous and uninterrupted until the extreme                       easterly elonga
tion    is reached       between     8 or 9     in the     following morning,            and
that no other turning hours intervene between those of the extreme
easterly between         8 and 9 a.m. and the           extreme      westerly between
 1 and 2 p.m.
    The   phases     of the solar-diurnal variation,      as   they are shown by the
Pekin Observations, may          be stated    as follows   : — The north        end   of the
magnet is at its extreme             eastern   elongation about half-past 8 in
the morning        ; at this hour it begins to move to the west, and moves
rapidly in this part of its daily course, completing                   its whole move
ment in that direction in five hours, and reaching its extreme western
elongation at about half-past 1 p.m.                 From this hour it returns,
somewhat less rapidly than in its forenoon excursion, until about
6   p.m., when the rate of progression is considerably lessened,                         but
continues in the same direction through the hours of the night, until
about 5 a.m., when it again              accelerates    until the eastern extreme
is attained, as already stated,              about 8£ a.m.              There       is thus
a very unequal division            of time in the direction             of the motion,
which     takes five       hours   in the progress from            east to west,        and
nineteen      hours in returning        from west to east through                the same
arc.     We find       a   more equal      division    of time      if  we     regard the
greater or       less  rapidity of the motion          :   there are        about twelve
hours in which the motion is comparatively quick, and twelve hours

                                            369
 in which      it is comparatively slow        ; the quick hours being those of
 the day, the slow hours those of the night.
     Thus far the notice      we have      taken of the Pekin results has been
 limited to the diurnal variation which                we find when we take an
 average    of the whole     year, and which we may theoretically suppose
 would take place in every month of the year                 if  the sun were always
 in the plane of the equator.           But similar investigations had already
 made known to us          the existence of a semiannual inequality, having
 opposite phases        according as the sun has north or south declina
 tion ;   with turning epochs about the times of the solstices, and
 the phases passing into each other about the times of the equinoxes.
 I   have   already, on a former occasion (Proceedings of the Royal So
 ciety, May 18, 1854), submitted to the consideration of the Society
 the concurrent evidence from three stations, Toronto, Hobarton, and
 St. Helena, of the existence           of this inequality,        and of the almost
 uniform character of its phases at those              stations, from which         I  ven
 tured to infer the probability that an inequality having                 a similar cha
 racter would       be   found to be a general phenomenon.                     I am     now
 able to add to the evidence which was then adduced,                  a  representation
 of the semiannual inequality at three additional stations, viz. at the
 Cape of Good Hope, of which the particulars in detail will be found
                                  '
 in the 2nd volume of the           St. Helena Observations,'— at the Kew Ob
 servatory, taken from the hourly tabulations from the photographic
curves obtained by the self-recording declinometer at that station, —

 the comparison of tables,       I  have exhibited in a diagram the phases          of
 the semiannual inequality at the six stations, by which it will be seen
 that they add their confirmation to the inference which               I  had previ
 ously drawn.       With this additional      evidence   of its uniform character
 in different parts of the globe, it may         be  hoped that the claim of the
 semiannual inequality to be received             as a successful    generalization
 from a careful and comprehensive induction                may be admitted, and
 that as an accession    to our positive knowledge it may have          a recognized
 place amongst      the facts of the diurnal variation, which have to be ac
 counted for in the theories which may be hereafter adduced for their
 physical explanation.
    We now, therefore,        recognize    three classes of phenomena derived
from three different sources, which are superposed              in the diurnal va
riation obtained from the unreduced observations, and which for                     a
proper understanding of the whole, require to be separated from each
other by    a   proper analysis, so that the part due to each may be di
stinctly ascertained      : these are — 1st, the mean effects      of the magnetic
storms   ;  2nd, the semiannual inequality          of the regular solar-diurnal
variation   ;   and 3rd, the mean         solar-diurnal    variation of the year
into   which      the semiannual       differences     merge.     The distinctive
characteristics of the first, viz. the disturbance diurnal variation,
have    already been stated in the early part of this paper, together
with   the evidence      they supply of being due to some modification
of the solar action, — justifying their being            treated   as distinct and
separate      from the affections which          constitute    the more regular
variation.       There    are  also   distinctive    characters in     the pheno
mena    of  the    semiannual inequality, and in those of the mean va
riation, which appear to point out a difference in the mode in which
the primary cause operates           in producing the two classes of pheno
mena.      For the purpose of explaining this difference,             we may em
ploy, as more likely to be generally understood, the usual custom of
referring all deflections,      whether in the northern or the southern
hemisphere, to the north end of the magnet                ;  we say then that, in
the mean variation,' the directions of the deflection are uniform
throughout the year in the middle latitudes of the one hemisphere,
and (although opposite) are also uniform throughout the year in the
middle latitudes of the other hemisphere             ;  whilst in the semiannual
inequality, the directions of the deflection are uniform                 in the two

                                       372
 hemispheres,   but opposite in the two half years.        In    the one case
 the effects are hemispherical, in the other semiannual.          It  is this pe
 culiarity which   gives  to the   "April    to September"    branch of the
 semiannual inequality its analogy with the diurnal variation which
 prevails throughout the year in the middle latitudes of the northern
 hemisphere, and to the
                               " October to March " branch its analogy
 with the diurnal variation which prevails throughout the year in the
 middle latitudes of the southern hemisphere.          The  analogies     extend
 even to the small but apparently systematic difference which              exists
 between the turning     hours of the mean variation in the two hemi
 spheres,  and of the semiannual variation in the two half years.            The
 turning hours of the variation in the northern hemisphere, and of the
 " April  to September
                          " semiannual branch,
                                                    appear to occur system
atically about an hour earlier than those of the southern hemisphere,
and of the     " October to March " semiannual branch.               This is    a
connecting link which draws still nearer the analogies         of which the
broader features have been frequently noticed and commented upon                 ;
and is the more remarkable on account of the diversity which in other
respects   seems to distinguish    the mode of operation by which the
solar influence produces in the one case hemispherical difference with
annual agreement,     and in the other case semiannual difference with
hemispherical agreement.
   Thus   at Pekin, regarded as a station in the middle latitudes         of the
northern    hemisphere,    if  we view the semiannual mean           of the six
months from     April   to September, we see repeated       the general fea
tures of the annual mean, reinforced by the semiannual inequality              of
kindred character with itself;       the deflections of both having the
same direction at the same hours, the range          becomes enlarged,       but
its characteristics are unchanged    ;  the progression is still a single one,
as is the case in the annual mean, with           but one easterly and one
westerly extreme, the hours of which are slightly earlier than those
of the annual    mean, by reason    of   a particular feature   of the     semi
annual inequality spoken of above.           When, on the other hand, we
direct our attention to the semiannual mean from October to March,
we see the consequence       of the superposition upon the annual mean
of the opposite semiannual inequality belonging          to these      months   :
this is most particularly shown in the effect produced upon the semi
annual mean by the great semiannual loop which culminates about

                                     373
6 or 7 a.m.     This deflection, which       is opposite in direction     to that
appropriate to the hemisphere, prevails over it so far as to interrupt
the progression, which on the mean of the year is continuous, and to
produce   a secondary  maximum at about 7 a.m.                This opposite   de
flection to that which is normal in the hemisphere, taking place at
the hours when the semiannual inequality is greatest, is               a common
feature whenever,   in the    middle latitudes of either hemisphere, the
mean diurnal variation     of the  one hemisphere is combined with            the
semiannual inequality which has the opposite analogy.                  The hour
of principal discordance      between     them is always nearly the same,
being determined by that of the principal deflection on the semiannual
curve, which, as seen in the diagram, is nearly identical in solar time
in all parts of the globe.      In the semiannual mean from October to
March the principal turning hours           are a little  later than in the an
nual mean, just as we have seen above that, in the April to September
mean, the turning hours are a      little earlier than in the annual, and
for the same reason.       Finally, it is this combination of the hemi
spherical and semiannual effects which creates the differences we ob
serve in the amount and hours        of the solar- diurnal variation in the
different months in the middle latitudes of both hemispheres.
   There is one more feature         of   some   importance to the general
theory of the diurnal variation, which is illustrated by the Pekin obser
vations, and requires a   brief notice. A distinction        has been elsewhere
pointed out (Cosmos, English Translation,             Longman's Edition, vol-
iv. p. 504, Editor's Note) between the diurnal variation of the equa
torial zone and that of the middle latitudes, consisting in the circum
stance that in the equatorial zone the amount            of the semiannual    de
flection is greater than that of the hemispherical deflection at the
hours when they are opposed to each other, and by its preponderance
changes the character, instead of simply diminishing the amount,
of the hemispherical deflection.        The change in       the signs  of the de
flection at  6 and 7 a.m. in the semiannual mean from October to
March    at  Pekin is  an illustration       of this peculiarity, and ought
perhaps in strictness to cause       Pekin to be included in the magne
tically equatorial zone  ;  but being only just within the border, it has
been found more convenient to dwell on this occasion upon the fea
tures which it has in common with stations in the middle latitudes.
   The diurnal variation     at Pekin    reaches   its extreme     deflections at
the same hours of solar time, as is the case at the other stations iu

                                      374
the northern hemisphere where the phenomena have been examined
with equal care.     This fact is not in accord with the opinions of     those
physicists who regard the solar action as conditioned in its exercise
by the direction of the magnetic meridian at the particular station.
In the different stations in the northern hemisphere, where the             ex
treme deflections have been found to take place at the same hours            of
solar time, the differences    in the direction of the magnetic meridian
have not been less than 70°, equivalent to a difference         of solar  time
of  between four and five hours.
    I  ought not to close this paper without      adverting to the success
which has attended      Mr. ScatchkofPs employment of native Chinese
as his assistants   in the work of the Pekin Observatory,        holding out
as it does an encouraging example to Directors         of Observatories who
may be similarly circumstanced.          A very  close test of the  care and
fidelity with which observations have been made and recorded is fur
nished by the lunar-diurnal variation, deducible from them when they
have been re-arranged under the lunar hours to which they severally
belong.     Thus  tested, the   Pekin observations show no inferiority       to
those of other stations which have been similarly examined.
    It is understood that the observations, which were discontinued at
Pekin at the end of 1855, are about to be recommenced,or have been
so already.    It  is greatly to be desired    that hourly obervations      of
the Horizontal and Vertical       Forces should be combined with those
of the Declination    at this important station.     The self-recording ap
paratus of the three elements which has been        in action at Kew during
the last two years, has been found, by the reduction of its tabulated
values at hourly intervals,     to be in no respect   practically inferior to
the method of eye-observation, whilst it possesses many advantages
which are peculiarly its own.      The tabulation from the Photographic
Curves, as well as the reductions, might      be made,  if more  convenient,
at the central Physical    Observatory at St. Petersburgh.

     Besides     the well-known                 differences   of sight in       respect to farncss
and nearness, there are differences in respect to the power of the
eyes      of different     persons to bring the rays                of light   to one exact focus.
     From observations              and experiments in which               I have   for some time
been engaged,          I have           been led to suspect         that astigmatism or inca
pacity of the eye to collect all the rays of light which enter it to
one exact focus,            is,
                              if        not the rule of sight, at least of very common
occurrence.      I       do not here refer to the cases in which astigmatism                     is
of   so exaggerated         a     character as to be          a   positive defect ef sight.
     It   would be of great importance, both in                       a   scientific and practical
point of view, to possess some accurate                            data as to the frequency      of
the occurrence of astigmatism                     ;   but such can be obtained only            by   a
number of different persons                  — qualified      observers     — contributing     each
an analysis of his own sight.      have thought, therefore, that by
                                                  I
bringing under the notice of the Royal Society an analysis of my own
sight, some of the Fellows and others accustomed to exact observations
might,       perhaps, be induced                   to make similar contributions.              The
adjustment of the eyes for different distances                            being intimately con
nected with the question                  of stigmatism or astigmatism,         I   have included
it   in my analysis.
     If
      I      view    a     vertical and
horizontal line, both equally
strong and black,          I      see   them
with medium distinctness                   at
the       distance    of about             10
inches.
     At the distance of about
3^ inches,     I     see   the vertical
line with greater distinctness
and better          definition          — the
greatest distinctness and best
definition     my eyes             are    ca-
                                    *    Continued from page 3/4.

                                              382
    pable   of ; but the horizontal line I        see   indistinctly  — with much    less
   distinctness than that with which            I see   any part of    the figure at the
   distance of 10 inches.           At the distance of       12 inches,   I see the hori
   zontal line with the greatest distinctness and best definition my eyes
   are capable       of ; but the vertical line      I  see  indistinctly  — with much
   less distinctness than that with which             I  see any part of the figure at
   the distance of 10 inches.           It thus appears that my eyes collect to         a
  focus on the retina the rays which diverge horizontally at the distance
  of   85 inches ; and the rays which diverge vertically at the distance               of
   12 inches.       Whilst    seeing the vertical line with         perfect distinctness
   and definition at the distance of 8$ inches, I cannot alter the adjust
  ment of the eye so as to see the horizontal line more distinctly and
  the vertical one less distinctly          ;  and vice versd, whilst seeing         the
  horizontal line perfectly defined at the distance of                12  inches, I can
  not alter the adjustment of the eye so as to                   see  the vertical line
  more distinctly and the horizontal one less.
      In short,    I  find that   I have no power      of altering   the adjustment   of
  my eyes.       I   see  vertical lines with perfect distinctness and definition
  only at the distance of 8£ inches, and horizontal lines with perfect
 distinctness and definition only at the distance of 1 2 inches, and both
 vertical and horizontal lines simultaneously with medium distinctness
 only at the distance of 10 inches.
      At the distance of about       7 inches  I see  the vertical line with medium
 distinctness, but the horizontal line very indistinctly.
                                                      I
      At the distance of about 14 inches see the horizontal line with
 medium distinctness, but the vertical line very indistinctly.
     At   a nearer     distance than
 7  inches   I see   both lines indi
 stinctly, but the vertical less
 so than the horizontal.            At
a further       distance     than   14
inches,    on the other hand,        I
see     both lines indistinctly,
but the horizontal less so
than the vertical.
     If now I view two        oblique
lines,     both     of which       are
equally      strong      and   black,

                                                            383
I     see    both legs with medium distinctness at the distance of 10
inches.
      At the distance of about 8£ inches I                                           see       the two oblique
lines equally well, but not so distinctly                                     as   at     the distance of 10
iuches.
      At the        distance       of   12    inches    I   see   the two oblique lines with much
about the same distinctness as that with which                                             I       see   them at the
distance         of 8| inches.
      It thus       appears        that       I   cannot    see    either of the oblique lines with
perfect distinctness and definition                               at any distance              ;    but that        I   can
see      them both simultaneously distinctly enough at any distance from
8|    inches to 12.                At    a    nearer distance than                 8| inches, or              a   further
distance than             12    inches, the distinctness diminishes, and that equally
for the two lines.
     I    cannot by any adjustment of my eyes vary the distinctness with
which       I see     the oblique lines at              a    given distance.
  The preceding analysis of my sight shows that my eyes are not
monostigmatic, that                     is,
                       are not capable of collecting all the rays of
light which enter them to one exact focus.                                     It shows,           on the contrary,
that my eyes are distigmatic,                           that       is,   they have each two distinct
foci to which they bring the rays, viz. one focus for horizontal rays,
and one for vertical rays.
   The preceding analysis also shows that my                                       eyes do not possess any
intrinsic power of adjustment whereby they                                         can bring to foci rays
diverging from             a       nearer or further distance than the two distances
above specified            for horizontal and for vertical rays.
     It   is   true that   I       can see the different objects in                        a       room distinctly
enough without                 the aid of glasses,                and that in the street or open
country     I       can see objects distinctly enough for all practical purposes
with the aid of concave glasses Nos.                              2   and     3,   but, critically speaking,
the definition           is    far from being exact.
    Directing            my eye to an object                      2      or   3    feet    from me,          I     see   it
distinctly          enough whilst an object in the same field of view at the
distance of          10   or   12   feet      is   at the same moment seen very indistinctly.
If now,     I       direct my eye to the object at the distance of                                   1   0   or 12 feet,
I   see     it   distinctly enough, but the object at the distance of                                               2    or
3   feet now appears very indistinct.
    This       is   commonly considered an evidence of adjustment of the eye
Vol. X.                                                                                            2     E

                                                     384
to the two different distances.                         There    is,   however, no real intrinsic
adjustment in the case.                I      see    distinctly enough, either the nearer
or the more distant object, merely because                                by directing my eye to
it,   its image falls on the central and most sensitive part of the retina,
whilst the image of the other object falls on the circumferential and
least sensitive         part of the retina.
      It   is   to be observed that at neither the nearer nor the further
distance, do      I     see     the object exactly defined on directing my eye to
it.        On directing my             eye to the further               object, I     see      it,   of course,
less defined          than
                         I       do the nearer object when                I     direct my eye to           it;
but the difference              is   not at   a   glance very striking.
  This experiment must not                          be confounded with another adduced
by the late Professor Miiller as                    a   proof of the     existence        of   an adjusting
power in the eye.                   The experiment        I     refer to   is   as follows       :   —
      If   we regard with one eye only (the other being closed) the ends
of two pins placed               one before the other at different distances in the
line of the axis of the eye, one will be seen distinctly when the other
appears indistinct,             and vice versd.             Both       images lie     in the axis of the
eye, one over           the other       ;   and yet       it    depends     on    a   voluntary effort,
the exertion of which can be felt in the eye, whether the first or the
second pin shall be seen distinctly.                         " The       two images of the pins,"
says       Miiller,   " fall    upon the same point of the retina                 ;   one lies over the
other, and yet        I      see     the nearer through the cloud-like                      image formed
by the rays from the other more distant pin, and vice versd."
      If any person            is   able to see the phenomena here described, he                             is
undoubtedly endowed with an adjusting power in his eye.
 I         have never succeeded in seeing the phenomena myself.
      In viewing         objects       at different        distances,      the sight           is    no doubt
aided by the movements                  of the      eyebrows,      eyelids, eyeballs, and pupils              ;
but        in   this we have no example of adjustment properly so called,
viz. intrinsic adjustment.
      That the focal power of my                        eye may become slowly altered, for
 instance by prolonged examination of near and minute objects, and
 again slowly return to its former state, am satisfied but this, again,
                                                            I                         ;
is    no example         of adjustment properly                 so called.
      P.S.      It would       oblige me very much,              if    any one, into whose hands
 this paper may happen to fall, and who may take the trouble                                                 to

                                        385
 analyse   his sight in the manner herein described, would communi
 cate to me the results      of his observation on the following points       : —
    1.  The distance     at which the vertical line is seen with the greatest
 distinctness and best definition.
    2.  The distance at which the horizontal line      is seen with the greatest
 distinctness and best definition. — Or,
    3.  If there    be no difference   in the distance    at which the vertical
 and horizontal lines are seen with the greatest           distinctness and best
 definition. — And, lastly,
    4. Whether       or not the observer     can satisfy himself that he has
 the power of adjusting the eye, so as to be able to          see  the lines with
 perfect distinctness and definition at any other than one distance.
    N.B.   If spectacles    are worn, mention the   kind of glasses — whether
 convex or concave     — and their power.
    Note also   if there  be any difference in the sight      of the two  eyes.
II. " On     the   Light radiated by heated Bodies."               By Balfour
       Stewart, Esq., A.M.            Communicated by J. P. Gassiot,
       Esq.     Received February 7, 1860.
   In two    papers read before the     Royal Society of Edinburgh in the
years 1858     and 1859,      and published in their Transactions,         I have
described    some experiments on radiant          heat, which would seem to
involve an extension of Prevost's theory of radiation, known as the
theory of exchanges.
   As the paper which I have now the honour to submit                     to this
Society will detail analogous experiments on radiant light,                I may
be permitted briefly to refer to those         points in my previous papers
which are thus intimately connected with the present subject.
   In attempting to unfold the logical            consequences      of Prevost's
theory, certain properties of radiant heat present themselves to our
view, many of which are capable of experimental verification.
   The following       are some    of these ; and, for convenience-sake,         I
shall follow up the statement of each (before proceeding to the next)
with a description of the analogous property of radiant light, as in
this way the similarity which exists        between     heat and light will be
most readily perceived.
                                                              2 e 2

                                                        386
     In the first          place,    the hent radiated by                  a    thin plate of any sub
stance       at   a       given temperature, is proportional                        to the absorptive
capacity of that substance                      for the heat of that temperature                       ;   or, in
few words, its radiation is equal to its absorption.
     Rock-salt, for instance, has                   a    small absorptive capacity for heat of
212° F., and, in consequence,                      its radiation when heated to 212°F. is
comparatively small.                         In point of fact,         a plate      of this       substance,
0-18 inch thick, only gives out                                15   per cent. of the heat which
lamp-black            radiates      at the same temperature.                       Glass, on the other
hand, absorbing nearly all the heat of 2 1 2°                                   F. which falls upon it,
has at this               temperature a radiation comparatively great, and nearly
equal        to that of lamp-black.                      A similar law holds with regard to
radiant light.
      If a piece          of perfectly transparent                  glass be heated         in   an ordinary
fire, removed              to the dark, and there viewed,                      it will   be found to emit
scarcely any light             ;    if       the glass   slightly coloured, its radiation
                                                          be
will       be more         copious       ;    the amount of light given out, as far as I
have been able to make the comparison, invariably depending upon
the depth of colour or absorptive power of the glass for light, pro
vided its colour stands                        heating.        A    good       way of performing                this
experiment is to heat a dark glass by the side of                                   a    colourless one, by
means        of   a chemical tongs, in some                         uniform      field of heat.            When
viewed        in the dark together, the contrast is very striking between
the bright light of the one and the bare visibility of the other.
       A    stratum of heated gas may likewise be instanced as                                   a    substance
which neither absorbs nor emits light to a sensible extent                                        ;   and it has
 similar properties with respect to heat.
       Let us now            proceed               of Prevost's theory.
                                              to another consequence
 It    is   well known, from Melloni's experiments, that thin plates of
 various substances                 have the property                of sifting     the heat which falls
 upon them            ;    they stop certain rays, and allow others to pass                                 ;   the
 heat stopped being of one                              description,           and the heat passed of
 another.             Now, it may be shown to flow from the theory of ex
 changes, that the heat radiated -by a                              thin plate of any substance at a
 given temperature is precisely that description                                 of heat which the
 plate absorbs when heat of that temperature is allowed to fall upon
 it.        The   heat which                 it absorbs being that kind of heat which has
 a     difficulty in passing through                     it,
                                                           if       the heat which         it   radiates    be    of

this description also, it follows that the heat given out by a plate of
any substance      will  experience    difficulty in passing through a screen
of the   same substance.       This   we find to be the case         :  thus, a plate
of rock-salt   0 77 inch thick passes only 30 per cent.            of the heat from
a  thin plate of rock-salt heated to 212° F., whereas it will pass 75
per cent. of heat from lamp-black at that temperature.                      The same
thing holds with regard to glass.             A thin plate of crown          glass  will
only pass half as much heat from            heated crown glass as from heated
lamp-black.        But this peculiar quality of the radiating plate is de
stroyed if we coat the side of it furthest from the screen with lamp
black ; it then behaves precisely as lamp-black alone would do. The
reason    of this is that the rays of heat given out by the glass are the
equivalent of those which it absorbs from the lamp-black behind ;
so that both together give out the same heat in quantity and quality
as lamp-black would alone.
    We   have here also analogous properties            of light.      Let   us take a
 number of differently coloured glasses.            With     respect to the     light of
 an ordinary fire, these     may be divided into two groups               ;  viz. those
 which redden, and those which whiten the fire when we look through
 them.     The first group comprises red and          orange glasses     ;  the second
 group green and blue glasses.
     Glasses   of the former group absorb the whiter, glasses of the
 latter group, the redder descriptions of light. We should therefore
 expect red and orange       glasses to give out, when heated, a peculiarly
 white light,    and green and blue glasses a peculiarly red light.                    A
 number of red and orange           glasses   have been found which fulfil this
 expectation.      Among the       reds,   those coloured by gold, when re
 moved from the fire and held in the dark, give out a milky-white,
 or even greenish light        ;   and the orange        glasses    used    by photo
 graphers do the same.           Other   glasses,  of  a dingy red tint, give out,
  when heated,      light slightly whiter than the ordinary light of their
  temperature    ;  while there are others in which             I have not, by this
  somewhat rude method of experimenting,                   been    able   to detect     a
  sensible   peculiarity of tint    : yet this is not to be wondered at,            if it
  be remembered that the following              is the method in which the ex
  periment is made.        The    glass under examination is held in a tongs,
  along with another glass, opaque or nearly             so,  which gives out light
  of the ordinary description.          They    are heated     together in the same

                                             388
 field of heat, and then viewed              in the dark as they cool.           During
  this process     the tint of each changes,            becoming somewhat redder
 as the temperature falls.               A difference in the temperature of          the
 two glasses might therefore cloak or even reverse the peculiar differ
 ence   of tint which it is sought to establish, unless this is very
 marked. This difficulty would be got over if we could by any means
 compare glasses of different tints at precisely the same temperature
 in the dark together          ;  but  I have not yet succeeded        in contriving an
 apparatus for this purpose.
     With    respect to glasses that whiten the fire when used as screens,
 these    all, without    exception, as far as        I  have    tried, give out a red
 description of light      ;   and this is peculiarly remarkable in some light-
 green glasses.
     The following circumstance renders              some glasses unfit for experi
 ment.      They absorb nearly all the red light of low temperature,
 and it is only when the light rises to a white that a notable propor
 tion is allowed to pass.              Now if the law be true that the radiation
 is equal to the absorption, these glasses should, at a low red heat,
 give out nearly the whole light belonging to their temperature, the
 same as      if they were opaque. It is only therefore when we raise
 the temperature that we can expect any result in the way of pecu
 liarity of tint   ;  for it is only then that the glasses, as screens, allow
 a notable proportion            of light to    pass, and that      of a  peculiar cha
 racter  ;  but the glass has now assumed                 a   pasty condition, which
 renders    it unfit to work with.           Those glasses, therefore, are to be
 preferred that allow a considerable proportion                   of all the kinds of
light to    pass  :"for, just      as in heat the radiation is most peculiar in
rock-salt, which absorbs but little heat              ;  so in  light the   best results
are obtained by glasses             that absorb only      a  small proportion of the
light that falls upon them. As a proof of this, I may mention that
difference of tint is very noticeable in the process of spinning threads
of coloured       glass.       The    heated   red glass thread has, when being
spun, a pale green hue, while the green glass thread has, under the
same circumstances, a decidedly reddish appearance.                      These threads
do not absorb much            light, but what they       do absorb is     of a peculiar
kind.
    It has been mentioned that a screen               of  glass is peculiarly opaque
for heat from glass          ;   but  if the side of the radiating plate furthest

                                                            38y
from the screen be coated                          with        lamp-black,        its heat now passes
the glass         screen      as readily as ordinary                     heat of that temperature.
A similar fact is noticeable with regard to light.                                             A     red glass,
which, when heated and viewed                                 in the dark, gives out               a    greenish
light, while in the fire scarcely appears                                 to differ in tint from the
surrounding coals              ;    and the same fact holds for all coloured glasses.
Ultimately they all appear to lose their colour in the fire as they ap
proach in temperature the coals around them.                                            This may          be ex
plained thus         :   — the      red glass, for instance, still gives out its greenish
light   ;   but it passes red light from the coals behind                                      it,   in such       a
manner that the light which                            it   radiates precisely makes up for that
which       it   absorbs   ;       so that we have virtually                  a   coal radiation coming
partly from and partly through the glass.
  Let us now consider Prevost's theory with                                        regard to bodies of
indefinite        thickness.                 One of its consequences                was experimentally
discovered          by    Leslie       ;     viz. that metals which are good reflectors of
heat are very bad radiators.                            As    a   variety of this experiment,             I    have
endeavoured              to show that               a       powdered       diathermanous               body will
radiate less than bodies which are opaque for heat, powdered.                                                 Thus,
ifa   plate of table-salt have one side blackened, the white side will
radiate only 83 per cent. of that which the blackened side radiates
at the temperature of 212°                             F.     No such difference            is   observed in
sugar, which, though white for light,                               is   black for heat of 212°.
     We     have here also                 similar facts with regard to light.                       If   a   pot of
red-hot lead or tin be carried to the dark, and the dross scummed
aside       by   means     of      a    red-hot iron ladle, the liquid metal momentarily
disclosed will appear less luminous than the surrounding dross                                                ;   the
difference         being more observable                          in the case of tin, which has                    a
higher       reflecting power than lead.                              Also,   if   a   piece     of platinum,
partly polished and partly tarnished, be held above                                     a   flame in      a    dark
room, the tarnished portion will shine much more brilliantly than
the polished.              Again,          if    we take      a   china cup with       a   white and black
pattern, and heat                  it   to   a   white heat in the fire, while there we shall
not perceive             much difference                    between      the white and black of the
pattern     ;    but,    if   we bring            it   into   a   dark room, we shall perceive the
black to shine much more brilliantly than the white.                                           This       reversal
of the pattern            presents           a   very curious appearance.
     Finally,      it    is   a     consequence               of Prevost's theory and                an experi

                                          390
mental fact, that opaque bodies, generally speaking, radiate the same
description of heat at the same temperature.                 In like manner, the
light which they radiate is of the          same description at the same tem
perature    ;   one body is not red while a second         is yellow and a  third
white, but they are all either red or yellow, or white together.
    An analogy has thus been established between radiant heat and
light in certain of their properties.          Now two opinions have     been en
tertained with regard to light         :—
    1st.   Some have regarded it as differing from radiant heat only            in
wave length.
    2nd. Others have regarded the two as physically distinct, although
possessing      many properties in common.           It has even been thought
that some kinds of light have no heating effect on the bodies on
 which they fall.
    I  cannot but think          that the facts   just  stated   countenance the
 former opinion rather than the latter          : for Prevost's theory consists
 of the three following hypotheses : —
     1st. That if an enclosure of any kind          be kept at a uniform tem
 perature, any body placed within            the enclosure,   and surrounded by
 it on all sides,    will ultimately attain that temperature.
     2nd. That all bodies are constantly giving out radiant heat, at             a
 rate depending upon their substance and temperature,             but independent
 of the   substance     or temperature of the bodies that surround them.
     3rd. And, consequently, that when a body is kept at a uniform
 temperature, it receives back just as much heat as it gives out.
     From     these   three assumptions may be deduced all the facts that
 have been stated with regard to radiant heat            ;  but in the argument
 it is essential    that the rays under consideration shall have the pro
 perty of heating the bodies on which they fall, and by which they
 are   absorbed.        If  this be not granted the argument fails.          Now
 radiant light, or those rays only that affect the retina, have been
 found to possess properties analogous to those which radiant heat
 thus possesses in virtue of its departure lowering the temperature of
 the body which it leaves, and its absorption raising that of the body
 on which       it falls.    If, therefore,   we suppose     all kinds of radiant
 light   to have the property       of raising (however little) the temperature
 of the body by which they are absorbed, the facts that have been
  stated   in this paper regarding light may be shown to be              a natural

consequence           of Prevost's theory of                      exchanges          ;   but   if,   on the other
hand, we do not admit that all the kinds of radiant light given out
by heated bodies possess this property, then in that case those facts
cannot be explained by Prevost's theory, but they will require                                                    a   new
theory to account for them.
   This circumstance induces                      me to    think that all the descriptions of
light radiated by            heated         bodies     have the power of heating, more or
less, those bodies               by   which they are absorbed.                            Viewing the matter
in this light,      I     have constructed the following                                 Table, in which the
logical        consequences               of Prevost's            theory        are       stated      in the first

                                                                 more luminous           than the white.

                                       392
    In conclusion,    I may be permitted to remark regarding these laws
of light, that from their simple nature some of them may have                 been
observed before, but I think they are now for the first time                  con
nected with a theory        of radiation.
    Supplement (added March 7, 1860). — Since writing the above,
the law which asserts that the absorption of a thin plate or particle
is proportional      to its radiation for every description        of light,   has
received    a very beautiful confirmation.
    In the Philosophical        Magazine for this month, pages 194-196,
Professor Stokes has noticed some very interesting experiments of
M. Foucault, and       also  of Professor Kirchhoff.      M. Foucault finds     as
the result of his experiments,         " that the voltaic arc formed between
charcoal poles presents us with a medium which emits the ray D of
the solar spectrum on its own account, and which at the same time
absorbs   it when it   comes from another quarter."        Professor Kirchhoff,
again, finds as the result     of his experiments on the spectra of coloured
flames,    " that  coloured flames, in the spectra of which bright sharp
lines present themselves,       so weaken rays    of the colour of   these lines,
when such rays pass through the flames, that, in place of the bright
lines, dark ones appear as soon as there is brought behind the flame
a source    of light of sufficient intensity, in the spectrum of which       these
lines are otherwise wanting."
    We thus      see  that the same media which in          a heated   state emit
 rays of a certain refrangibility         in great abundance, have also the
 property of stopping these very rays when they fall upon them from
 another quarter, or, in other words, their absorption of such rays is
 proportional to their radiation of them.
     Supplement (added March 8, 1860)              The following fact noticed
 by Professor Kirchhoff is also in accordance with the theory brought
 forward in this paper.
     " The   spectrum of the Drummond light," he remarks,
                                                                      " contains,
 as a general rule, the two bright lines        D, if the luminous spot of the
 cylinder of lime has not long been exposed to the white heat             ; if the
 cylinder remains unmoved these lines become weaker, and finally vanish
 altogether.     If they have    vanished, or only faintly appear, an alcohol
 flame   into which salt has been put, and which is placed between

                                                    393
the cylinder of lime and the slit, causes two dark lines of remarkable
sharpness and fineness                  to show themselves               in their stead         ;   but the
Drummond light requires, in order that the lines D should come out
in it dark, a salt-flame of lower temperature.                               The    flame    of alcohol
containing water is fitted for this, but the flame of Bunsen's gas-lamp
is not.       With the latter the smallest mixture of common                                         salt, as
soon as      it   makes itself generally perceptible, causes the                          bright lines
of sodium to show themselves."
     Now, when we heat a piece of ruby glass in the fire, we have an
analogous         phenomenon.             As long        as the ruby glass               is of a lower
temperature than the coals behind                       it,   the light given out           is      of   a   red
description, because the ruby glass stops the green                               :   the green here
is   precisely analogous therefore to the line D, which                             is   stopped by an
alcohol flame into which salt has been put.                                Should, however, the
ruby glass be of
                                                                                                              it it,
                            a   much higher temperature than the coals behind
the greenish light which                  it    radiates overpowers the red which
transmits, so that the light which reaches the eye                             is   green more than
red.      This    is   precisely analogous to what                is   observed when        a   Bunsen's
gas-lamp with           a   little salt   is   placed before the Drummond light, when
the line D        is   no longer dark but bright.
     In   fact, the law,
                                " the   absorption of         a   particle   is   equal to its radia
tion, and that for every kind of light," only applies to the case where
the temperature of the particle                   is   equal to that of the source of the
light which passes through the particle. If the temperature of the
source of light be greater, one quality of light will predominate                                        ;    if,
on the other hand, the temperature of the particle be greater, another
quality of light will predominate.

          examined          in Carbonic Acid Vacua."                         By   J.     P. Gassiot,
          Esq., F.R.S.            Received February                 6,   1860.
     On the 24th of May,                1859 (Proceedings,               May   26, 1859),       I        com
municated to the Royal Society                    a   short notice of my having obtained
the stratified discharge from                    a    voltaic battery of 3520 elements
charged with rain-water             ;     and also with one of 400 elements charged
with nitric and sulphuric                  acids,      each cell       of both batteries being
insulated    :    —
                  I      stated    also        that with      the latter (as          I     had previ

                                           394
ously shown with the former) spark discharges passed between two
terminal copper plates through the air, before the completion of the
circuit.
    The well-known luminous arc in air,              as is  usually obtained from
an extended        series   of the nitric-acid battery, was very brilliant, but
from the small size         of the porous cells (3 inches long, ^ inch broad)
containing the nitric acid, it was only tried by a momentary action.
With the water-battery           I have never been able to obtain a continuous
discharge in air similar to the voltaic arc            ; whether from points or
plates, the discharges from this battery are invariably               in the form of
minute clearly defined, and separated sparks.
     Although the water-battery          consisted  of nearly nine times as many
 metallic elements as        the nitric-acid battery, it exhibited by the gold-
 leaf electroscope      very little increased    signs of tension.
     This is in   accordance     with the results obtained by me in       1 844,  when
 I  showed that the tension of         a single cell increased in force according
 to the chemical energy of the exciting liquid.                "In all    the experi
 ments    I made, the higher the chemical affinities          of the   elements used,
 the greaterwas the development of evidence of tension" (Philosophical
 Transactions,       1844, part 1. p. 52).
     Recently, through the kind introduction of Professor Wheatstone,
 I   have   had an opportunity           of experimenting with 512           series  of
 Daniell's constant battery, and my present object is to present to the
 Royal Society a short account of the results              I have obtained,     and to
 describe    the appearance         and character of the voltaic discharge of
 these several batteries when taken in vacua.
     The vacuum-tubes          I used  were prepared by means        of carbonic acid
  (Philosophical Transactions, 1859, part 1. p. 137). For the sake of
  reference I will denote these by the original numbers which I am
  accustomed       to attach as the vacua are completed          : — in the following
  experiments these were 146, 187, 190, 196, 202, and 219.
     No.   146 is 24 inches long and 18 inches in circumference, and has
  a copper disc 4 inches diameter at one terminal and a brass wire at
  the other   :   this vessel is figured in my last communication.            No.   187
  and 196       (see   fig.   1) are each about      6   inches long and         1 inch
  diameter,      with    gas-coke    balls  \  inch   diameter, attached to the
  hermetically sealed platinum wires, the wires being protected by glass
  tubing as far as the balls, placed inside the tube                 3 inches apart.

                                      395
                                     Fig. 1.
No.   1 90 has brass wires, and     No. 202 silver wires attached to the
platinum    : both these tubes are of the same dimensions as No. 187
and 196 (fig. 2).      No. 219    is 4 inches long, has gas-coke balls          of
                                     Fig. 2.
about    |th of  an inch    in diameter, and      1  inch apart:     the caustic
potash originally attached to this tube has been sealed off           ; the form
is shown in fig. 3.
                                      Fig.  3.
    With the inductive coil the discharge in        146 exhibits a large cloud
like luminosity on the plate, which in these experiments was always
made the negative     terminal.     On the positive wire, minute luminous
 spots were visible.    At intervals, apparently by      some sudden energetic
 action, flashes   of bright stratified light would dart through               the
 vacuum, but by carefully adjusting the contact breaker, the discharge
 could be made to pass, producing         a  white glow on the negative plate,
 without to the eye affording          any appearance       of  an   intermittent
 discharge.
    In   187 and 196 the stratifications were narrow from the positive
 terminal, the negative     ball being surrounded with         a narrow halo of
 light similar to that in fig.   1 A, but smaller.       In 190 there was a red
 tinge on the cloud-like discharge near the positive terminal            ;  on the
 approach of a magnet, two or three additional clouds were brought
 out, the negative wire being covered with a luminous glow extending
 to the sides    of the tube parallel to the         end  of the   negative  wire.

                                       390
202 exhibited     a  remarkably    well-defined      cloud-like   discharge, the
several   clouds being clearly and distinctly separated.             In 219, the
appearance    of the discharge in this tube      was  similar to that in fig. 3 A,
                                    Fig. 3 A.
with a particularly brilliant glow around the negative ball, but without
any stratifications from the positive.
    Having thus    described the appearances       of the induced discharge in
 these tubes,   I now proceed     to the description of experiments made
in the same vacua,    — 1st, with the water-battery of 3520 cells; 2ndly,
 with the 5 1 2 series of Daniell's constant battery      ;  and lastly, with 400
 series  of Grove's nitric acid battery.
    With the water-battery, as I have         stated in my previous commu
nication, the stratified discharge, similar in character to that of the
inductive coil, was obtained, not only in 146 and the other tubes,
but also through 146 and any one of the others at the same time.
     From the risk of fracture,      I  have not ventured again to heat the
 potash in 146, but    I  have invariably found that whenever the potash
 in any of the other tubes was heated,          the discharge from the water-
 battery, instead of increasing in distinctness and brilliancy, entirely
 ceased.
    The discharge from the water-battery through each of the tubes
 had the appearance        of being continuous, and the needle of the
 galvanometer, placed on the circuit,            showed     a  steady   deflection.
 To   test whether the discharge was continuous,         I  attached No.    2 1 9 to
 my rotating apparatus (Philosophical Transactions,                1859,   part   1.
 p. 158) ; the discharges were then clearly separated, so that even
 with this apparatus they were shown to be intermittent.
     As the water in the battery, after          a lapse    of  some   weeks,   had
 partially evaporated, the action was so reduced that it would no longer
  pass  through    any of the vacuum-tubes           except    219, in which       it
  assumed   the appearance    as in fig. 3   B.    In this  state it remained for
  three or four weeks, and whenever from change of temperature moisture
  was deposited on the surface    of the  glass tubes, the luminous discharge

                              +
disappeared       when the tubes were touched by the hand or by a wire,
reappearing as the hand or wire was withdrawn.                     A portion of the
discharge from this battery was evidently lost byinsufficient insulation,
reduced by accumulated dust and moisture.                    I have  not the requisite
facilities at command, but a thoroughly well-insulated battery of 3000
or 4000 series would produce effects well worthy of examination.
                           DanielVt Constant Battery.
    On the 27th of December, 1859, by the introduction of Professor
Wheatstone,        I had the opportunity        of experimenting with the large
battery belonging to the Telegraph Company at its Factory, Camden
Town     ;  Messrs. Wheatstone, Latimer Clarke, and Bartholomew were
present.       My object     was to ascertain whether a luminous              discharge
could be obtained through the vacuum-tubes from the battery, which
consists     of 512   series  of DanielPs      elements,    zinc and copper.       The
zinc plates are 2 by       3| inches, the copper        3 J  by  3^ inches  ;  the cells
are insulated in series      of  10 and 12, suspended on trays by gutta-percha
bands.      I experimented      with three of my vacuum-tubes, Nos. 187, 196,
and 219, with 187 and 196            ;  no sign of any luminous discharge could
be observed ; the electroscopes             (Peltier's and     a  gold-leaf),    by the
tension, showed that the current did not pass.
    With     2 1 9 the brilliant   glow around the negative ball, as is shown
in the     same tube by the induction coil, was visible with very trifling
luminosity on the positive.            I have  attempted to show this appearance
 in fig. 3    A.
    Various lengths, viz. 110 yards,            1, 2, 4, 8  and 16 miles of covered
 copper wire, the 110 yards covered with india-rubber, and the other
 lengths with gutta-percha, are kept immersed in a water-tank for the
 purpose of experiments at the factory             ; an opportunity     was therefore
 offered    of testing the action of the battery on these wires by means
 of vacuum-tubes. This immersed wire is designated the cable, acting
 in this respect in     a  manner analogous to submarine wires.

                                            398
    The general results obtained, and repeatedly verified, may be
briefly stated as follows : — From the 1 1 0 yards to the greatest length
of  16  miles, it took from half to one and one quarter of               a second   for
the cable to receive as much of the charge of the whole battery as
could pass through          the vacuum-tubes 219, the time being denoted
by the appearance of the luminosity in the negative ball (see fig. 3 A).
    With 110 yards the discharge of a charge previously given to the
cable was instantaneous          ;   it appeared   to be nearly momentary with
one mile, and the time then progressively increased according to the
length of the cable          previously charged, until with the           16  miles   it
took one and        a quarter to one and a half seconds before the luminous
glow on the ball in the vacuum-tube disappeared.
    It was   beautiful to    see   the regularity with which the glow appeared
and disappeared in these experiments, first at one terminal and then
at the other, according as the cable was charged or discharged.
    After the     cable had received       the discharge to the greatest intensity
that could be obtained through the tube 219, the full charge of the
battery was then completed by cutting off the tube from the circuit
by means of a wire.            On removing the wire, and substituting the
earth for the battery,        a  discharge took place     ; but  a  residuary charge
was always found, which               could not pass through       the vacuum.       If
this residuary was allowed to remain in the cable,                 and the battery
again    substituted for the earth, no additional           charge could be made
to pass from the battery through               the vacuum-tube;       but so soon as
this    residuary was        discharged,      the cable    again became       charged
through the tube as before*.
    We    were particularly         fortunate with these     experiments     ;  for on
Mr. Wheatstone testing the capability or power of the battery,                   he as
certained that on taking from it only 32 cells, thus reducing the num
ber to 480, the discharge could not pass through the vacuum-tube.
   *  If one   of the wires of the vacuum-tube No. 219 is connected with the inner
coating   of a  Lcyden jar, and the other with the prime conductor of an electrical
machine, when the machine is excited a luminous glow will be observed round
one of the balls, similar to that obtained during the charging of the cable by the
voltaic battery, and the jar will become gradually charged.        On the excitation of
the electrical machine being stopped, if a pointed wire is presented to the prime
conductor, the jar will be gradually discharged, and the luminous glow appears
on the other ball of the vacuum-tube ; if several similar tubes are arranged in
series, and the jar is discharged       through longer  carbonic-acid vacua, the stria;
can be obtained in the latter.

                                         399
                         Grove's   Nitric- Acid Battery.
   Each    set  of  elements   in the battery were inserted in a glass ves
sel with a stem 6 inches long        ;  the stems were carefully cleaned and
dried.    These precautions, with the high chemical affinity of the
elements,    raised   the tension of each terminal, as denoted          by gold
leaf electroscopes,     to nearly that of the larger series of the water-
battery.     A  succession    of spark-discharges could      be taken   between
the copper discs        of my micrometer-electrometer,          one  disc being
attached    to the zinc, and the other to the platinum              end   of  the
battery.
    In the following       experiments, the different vacuum-tubes were
introduced between one of the copper discs and the battery, as also
a  galvanometer.       By this arrangement the circuit could be gradually
completed without any risk of disarranging the apparatus, and the
spark discharged obtained before the copper discs of the micro
meter-electrometer came into contact.
    " In  146, on the completion         of the current, the discharge of the
battery passed with a display of magnificent strata of most dazzling
brightness.      On separating the discs by means of a micrometer
screw, the luminous        discharges presented       the same appearance      as
when taken from an induction coil, but brighter.                 On the copper
plate in the vessel there was          a white layer, and then a dark space
about one inch broad        ; then a bluish atmosphere, curved like the
plate, evidently three negative envelopes           on a great scale.      When
the plate was positive, the effect was comparatively feeble."                The
preceding is an extract from notes made by the Rev. Dr.              T. R. Ro
binson, when he first witnessed           the experiments in my laboratory,
on   the 5th of August,          1859.     With the     same   vacuum    I  have
always obtained similar results.
   In 187 and    196 (fig. 1, with carbon-balls in the tubes) the discharge
of the nitric-acid battery elicits intense heat, and probably changes
the condition of the vacuum.              On the 5th of August, 1859, "the
discharge in 187 presented        a stream   of light of intolerable brightness
[I   again quote from Dr. Robinson's           notes], in which, through the
plate of green glass, with which he observed the phenomena, strata
could be observed.         This   soon   changed to   a sphere  of light  on the
positive ball, which became         red-hot, the negative being surrounded
by magnificent        envelopes,    whilst with the horseshoe magnet          the
   vol. x.                                                       2 F

                                       400
 positive light was drawn out into strata.             The  needle   of a galvano
 meter in circuit was violently deflected,           and the polarity reversed,
settling at a deflection of 45°.           On heating the        potassa, the dis
charge again       bursts into a sun-like        flame, subsequently subsiding
into three or four large strata, of          a  cloud-like shape, but intensely
bright."
    On   a subsequent occasion     I found that the discharge did not pass
for about a minute after the circuit was completed, when a fine glow
appeared     on the negative    ball, fig.   1 A.     Around the positive ball
                                     Fig.  1 A.
there was a trifling glow, in a few seconds               a momentary brilliant
flash, and the discharge ceased.        The potash       was then again heated     ;
the large negative      glow reappeared,       followed almost instantly by a
remarkably brilliant stratified discharge, with intense chemical action
in the battery, denoted by the evolution of nitrous fumes                 ; at this
moment     I separated   the discs of the micrometer-electrometer, and thus
broke the circuit.
    I now arranged the apparatus by attaching gold-leaf electroscopes
to both terminals, and introduced the galvanometer, so as to enable
me to examine      more carefully the action that would take place when
the potassa was heated.          On heating the       potassa,   the fine negative
(fig.  1  A)   was again developed;       the leaves of the electroscope        did
not close    ;  but as the negative glow increased,            the needle of the
galvanometer was suddenly deflected, immediately (although the glow
continued) returning to zero ; as more heat was applied a small globe
of light appeared on the positive (fig. 1 B), was visible, and the
                                     Fig.  1  B.
needle    gradually   deflected   40° or 50°.       On withdrawing      the lamp,
as the potash cooled,       the positive glow disappeared, the needle of

                                       401
the galvanometer receded, the glow on the negative remaining more
or less brilliant  ;  this action and reaction alternating as the heat of the
lamp was applied or withdrawn from the potash.
    When the heating of       the potash was further increased,        four or five
cloud-like     and remarkably clear strata came out from the positive
(fig.  1
         C)  ;  and these were quickly followed by          a sudden     discharge
                                      Fig.  1 C.
 of the most dazzling brightness, which remained for several seconds.
 The stratifications, which were conical in shape, I have endeavoured,
 although very faintly, to depict in fig.         1  D.   The  needle   of the gal-
                                       Fig.  1 D.
 vanometerwas suddenly and violently deflected, striking with consider
 able force the two corks placed to protect             it on the   compass    card.
 At the instant this discharge took         place, and not before, the leaves      of
 the electroscopes collapsed.       This, with the intense chemical action       ob
  servable in the battery, proved that the entire current was passing.
     The preceding experiment         was repeated      with tube No.     1 96, with
  nearly the same results, the needle first deflecting 40° and then 80°.
  On further heating the       tube, the same sudden intense        stratified light
  appeared,    after which the discharge ceased.
     No.  187 was then replaced in the circuit, and the same phenomena,
  as already described, were obtained.
     I now again avail myself of Dr. Robinson's              notes  of the experi
  ments made on the 5th         of August.      Tube 190 is of the same dimen
  sions as 187 and 196;        but instead of the coke balls, it has brass
  wires attached to the platinum.              In  this tube (190) the luminous
  discharge did not appear until the caustic potassa was heated, when
  most dazzling      strata were observed.         Dr. Robinson    says, —"    I had
                                                                 2 f  2

                                                     402
to use a dark-green glass to examine the strata                                 ;   as   I   was observing,
the last strata rolled leisurely away, like                           a   globe of light, from the
others,       to the negative glow, in which                     it appeared to              dissolve.     As
the potassa cooled, the strata shrunk up and dissolved at the positive
wire, as did the glow              ;    and when the dark negative reached                                 the
point, all luminosity ceased."
   On     a subsequent occasion the first discharge in the tube (190)
exhibited a fine purple negative glow, with two tawny cloud-like stra
tifications at the positive.              This discharge exhibited the fluorescence
of the        glass   tube in a        remarkable manner.    The circuit was then
broken    ;     on    again completing                  it,
                                                          I       was     somewhat surprised                at
finding the luminous discharge was no longer perceptible.                                          I     then
slightly heated the tube with                   a   spirit-lamp       ;   the stratified discharge
reappeared;           the needle        of the galvanometer                  deflected          about 65°,
but the leaves of the electroscopes                              were     very slightly            affected.
On separating the plates of the micrometer- electrometer,                                            sparks
passed    ;   the stratifications in        1   90 became confused, intermingling                        with
each     other, and no longer presenting that clearness                                       of definition
which   I     have described.
  With tube           202, which       is   of the            same dimensions, with                silver in
lieu of brass terminal wires, there was not any discharge from the
battery until the potash was heated.                              At first      it   presented       a    fine
white glow on the negative wire, then one of                                a   tawny red colour on
the positive;         and on heat being applied, stratifications, as in 190,
were observed.
  The battery          was then connected                to the wires       of tube 219, the             same
with which the experiments with Daniell's battery were made. This
showed the luminous negative                    as   in fig.     3   A, but more brilliant than
with    the constant battery            ;       producing          bright scintillations at the
positive, as     if   particles of the carbon were fused and thrown off.
  By the preceding experiments,                      I        ascertained       that     a   disruptive or
spark-discharge could be obtained in air from the nitric-acid, as well
as from the water-battery;                   and that when these discharges were
passed    through the highly attenuated matter contained in carbonic
acid vacua, the same luminous and stratified appearance                                           was pro
duced     as by an inductive             coil,      a    proof that whatever may                    be the
cause    of the phenomena,             it   could not arise from any peculiar action
of that apparatus.

                                      403
     With the ordinary arrangement of the voltaic battery, in which
the insulation of the cells is disregarded, the luminous discharge is
usually obtained by completing the circuit, and then separating the
terminal wires or the charcoal points, the length of the arc being in
relation to the number of the elements of the battery.
     With the water-battery I have never been able to obtain the
slightest appearance of an arc-discharge ; for whether the terminals
of the battery were the plates of my micrometer-electrometer, me
tallic wires, or charcoal, the result was the same         ;  viz. clearly sepa
rated    and   distinct sparks, which    continued until the water in the
cells had nearly evaporated.         With four hundred        (each    cell being
insulated) of Grove's nitric-acid battery, similar spark-discharges were
obtained between the plates of my micrometer-electrometer, without
producing      the voltaic arc, although by     a momentary completion of
 the circuit it was obtained with great brilliancy.
     In carbonic acid vacuum-tubes, and particularly in           those in which
 carbon-balls were inserted, the disruptive, as well as the voltaic arc
 discharge (under the conditions described) was obtained from the
 nitric-acid battery ; and in both instances the stratified appearance
 was observed,      the difference being, that with the arc-discharge the
 stratifications were far more vivid and brilliant, and the discharge
 itself evidently more energetic.       With the disruptive discharge, the
 needle   of the galvanometer    was but slightly   deflected,      nor could any
 apparent chemical action be observed in the battery              ;  but instantly
 on the production       of the arc-discharge, the   needle     of the galvano
 meter was strongly deflected,       and in all the cells of the battery it
 was evident that intense chemical action had been produced.
     If carbon-balls   are attached to the wires  of a  carbonic acid vacuum-
 tube, the arc-discharge is obtained from a nitric-acid battery when
 ever the potash is heated.         This  process  facilitates the discharge,
 and assists the disintegration of the carbon particles         ;   and these in a
  minute state of division are subsequently found attached to the sides
  of the  glass.    It is these particles which produce the arc- discharge,
  with its intense vivid light so suddenly observed,         with far more bril
  liant effects than the usual stratified discharge.         During its    passage
  the conducting power of the vacuum-tube             is found to he greatly
  enhanced,    as shown by the galvanometer, the electroscope,             and the
  intense chemical action in the battery.

                                         404
    The   same explanation       that  I  ventured to offer in the Bakerian
 Lecture for     1 858, as to the cause    of the stratified discharge arising
from the impulses of        a force acting on highly attenuated but resist
 ing media, is also applicable to the discharge of the voltaic battery
 in vacua   ; while the fact of this discharge, even its full intensity
having been now ascertained to be also stratified, leads me to the
conclusion, that the ordinary discharge of the voltaic battery, under
every condition, is not continuous, but intermittent          ; that it consists
 of  a series  of pulsations or vibrations of greater or        lesser velocity,
according to the resistance         in the chemical or metallic elements of
the battery, or the conducting media through which the discharge
 passes.

I. "On      the Theory of Compound Colours, and the Relations                 of
       the Colours of the Spectrum."               By   J. Clerk    Maxwell,
       Esq., Professor of Natural           Philosophy, Marischal College
       and University,        Aberdeen.       Communicated by Professor
        Stokes, Sec. R.S.          Received December       27, 1859.
                                    (Abstract.)
    Newton (in his ' Optics,' Book I. part ii. prop. 6) has indicated a
method of exhibiting the relations of colour, and of calculating the
effects   of any mixture of colours.        He   conceives  the colours of the
spectrum arranged in the circumference of a circle, and the circle so
painted that every radius exhibits a gradation of colour, from some
pure colour of the spectrum at the circumference, to neutral tint at
the centre.       The resultant of any mixture of colours is         then found

                                     405
by placing     at  the points corresponding       to these colours, weights
proportional    to their intensities ; then the resultant colour         will be
found at the centre of gravity, and its intensity will be the sum of
the intensities of the components.
    From the mathematical development of the theory of Newton's
diagram, it appears that if the positions of any three colours be
assumed on the diagram, and certain intensities         of  these adopted as
units, then the position of every other colour may be laid down from
its observed    relation to these three.     Hence Newton's assumption
that the colours of the spectrum are disposed in a certain manner in
the circumference of a circle, unless confirmed by experiment, must
be regarded as merely a rough conjecture, intended as an illustration
of his method, but not     asserted as mathematically exact.         From the
results of the present investigation, it appears that the colours of the
spectrum, as laid down according to Newton's method from actual
observation, lie, not in the circumference of a circle, but in the
periphery of a triangle, showing that all the colours of the spectrum
may be chromatically      represented  by three, which form the angles of
this triangle.

      Scarlet              2328, about one-third from line C to D.,
      Green                1914, about one-quarter from       E  to  F.,
      Blue                 1717, about half-way from       F  to G.
   The theory of three primary colours has been often proposed as
an interpretation of the phenomena of compound colours, but the
relation of these colours to the colours of the spectrum does not
seem to have been distinctly understood       till Dr. Young (Lectures on
Natural Philosophy, Kelland's edition, p. 345) enunciated his theory
of three primary sensations of colour which are excited in different
proportions when different kinds of light enter the organ of vision.
According to this theory, the threefold character of colour, as perceived
by us, is due, not to a threefold composition of light,            but to the
constitution of the visual apparatus which renders it capable of being
affected in three different ways, the relative amount of each sensation
being determined by the nature of the incident light.             If we   could
exhibit three colours corresponding to the three primary sensations,
each colour exciting one and one only      of  these sensations,    then since
all other colours whatever must excite more than one primary sensa

                                       W)6
tion, they must find their places         in Newton's   diagram within       the
triangle of which the three primary colours are the angles.
    Hence   if Young's theory   is true, the complete diagram of all colour,
as perceived    by the human eye, will have the form of a triangle.
    The colours corresponding       to the pure rays  of the spectrum must
all lie within this triangle, and all colours in nature, being mixtures
of   these,   must lie within    the line formed     by the spectrum.         If
therefore any colours of the spectrum correspond to the three pure
primary sensations,     they will be found at the angles of the triangle,
and all the other colours will lie within the triangle.
    The other colours of the spectrum, though excited by uncom-
pounded light,      are compound colours       ; because   the light,   though
simple, has the power of exciting two or more colour-sensations in
different proportions, as, for instance,      a blue-green ray, though not
compounded of blue rays and green rays, produces a sensation com
pounded of those of blue and green.
    The three colours found by experiment to form the three angles
of the triangle formed by the spectrum on Newton's diagram, may
 correspond to the three primary sensations.
    A different geometrical representation of the relations of colour
 may be thus described.       Take any point not in the plane of Newton's
 diagram, draw a line from this point as origin through              the point
 representing a given colour on the plane, and produce them so that
 the length of the line may be to the part cut off by the plane as the
 intensity of the given colour is to that of the corresponding point on
 Newton's diagram.        In this way any colour may        be represented    by
 a line drawn from the origin whose direction indicates the quality of
 the colour,     and whose    length depends      upon   its intensity.     The
 resultant of two colours is represented      by the diagonal of the paral
 lelogram formed on the lines representing the colours (see Prof.
 Grassmann in Phil. Mag. April 1854).
     Taking three lines drawn from the origin through the points of
 the diagram corresponding to the three primaries as the axes of
 coordinates, we may express any colour as the resultant             of definite
  quantities of each of the three primaries, and the three elements of
  colour will then be represented      by the three dimensions    of  space.
     The  experiments,   the results of which are now before the Society,
  were   undertaken in order to ascertain        the exact    relations of the

                                       407
colours of the spectrum as seen by          a normal eye, and to lay down
these   relations on Newton's       diagram.       The method        consisted   in
selecting three colours from the spectrum, and mixing these in such
proportions as to be identical in colour and brightness with a constant
white light.     Having   assumed    three standard colours, and found the
quantity of each required to produce the given white, we then find
the quantities of two of these combined with a fourth colour which
will produce the     same white.     We thus obtain      a relation between the
three standards and the fourth colour, which enables us to lay down
its position in Newton's diagram with reference to the three standards.
   Any three sufficiently different colours may         be chosen as standards,
and any three points may be assumed                as their    positions on the
diagram.      The resulting diagram of relations of colour will differ
according to the way in which we begin         ;  but as every colour-diagram
is a perspective projection   of any other, it is    easy to compare diagrams
obtained   by two different methods.
   The instrument employed in         these experiments consisted       of  a dark
chamber about 5 feet long,         9  inches broad, and 4 deep, joined to
another 2 feet long at an angle of about          1 00°.    If light is admitted
at a narrow slit at the end      of  the  shorter chamber, it falls on a lens
and is refracted through       two prisms in succession,         so as to form a
pure spectrum at the end of the long chamber.                     Here    there is
placed an apparatus consisting of three moveable slits, which can be
altered in breadth and position, the position being read off on a
graduated scale,      and the breadth      ascertained     by inserting      a fine
graduated wedge into the slit till it touches both sides.
   When white light is admitted          at the shorter end,       light of three
different kinds is refracted to these three slits.         When white light is
admitted at the three slits, light of these three kinds in combination
is seen by an eye placed at the slit in the shorter arm of the instru
ment.     By altering the three slits, the colour of this compound light
may be changed at pleasure.
   The white light employed      was that   of  a sheet  of white paper, placed
on a board, and illuminated by the sun's           light in the   open air ; the
instrument      being in a room, and the light moderated where the
observer   sits.
   Another portion of the same white light goes down a separate
compartment of the instrument, and is reflected at a surface of

blackened    glass, so as to be seen by the observer in immediate contact
with the compound light which enters                       the slits and is refracted by
the prisms.
   Each experiment consists in altering the breadth of the slits                                till
the two lights seen by the observer agree both in colour and brightness,
the eye being allowed time to rest before making any final decision.
In this way the relative places of sixteen kinds of light were found by
two observers.          Both    agree in finding the positions               of   the colours to
lie very close to two sides of           a   triangle, the extreme colours of the
spectrum forming doubtful fragments of the third side.                              They differ,
however,     in the intensity with which                   certain colours affect them,
especially the greenish blue near the line F, which to one observer is
remarkably feeble, both when seen singly, and when part of a mixture;
while to the other, though                less     intense than the colours in the
neighbourhood, it is still sufficiently powerful to act its part in com
binations.      One result of this           is,   that   a   combination of this colour
with red may be made, which appears                        red to the first observer and
green to the second,       though both have normal eyes as far                      as   ordinary
colours are concerned       ;    and this blindness of the first has reference
only to rays of     a   definite refrangibility, other rays near them, though
similar in colour, not being deficient in intensity.                     For       an account      of
this peculiarity of the author's eye,                   see the    Report     of the British
Association for 1856, p. 12.
  By the operator attending to the proper illumination of the paper
by the sun, and the observer taking care of his eyes, and completing
an observation only when they are fresh, very good results can                                  be
obtained.       The compound colour                is    then seen in contact with the
white reflected light, and         is   not distinguishable from             it,   either in hue
or brilliancy   ;   and the average difference of the observed breadth of                          a
slit from the mean of the observations does not exceed                                ^    of the
breadth of the slit       if   the observer        is   careful.   It   is   found, however,
that the errors in the value of the sum of the three slits are greater
than they would have been by theory,                       if   the errors of each were
independent     ;   and   if   the sums and differences             of the breadth of two
slits be taken, the errors of the sums are always found greater than
those   of the differences.        This indicates that the human                         eye has   a
more accurate perception of differences                   of hue than of differences of
illumination.

     Having     ascertained  the chromatic relations between sixteen colours
selected from the spectrum, the next step is to ascertain the positions
 of  these colours with reference      to Fraunhofer's     lines.   This is  done
 by admitting light into the shorter arm of the instrument through
the slit which forms the eyehole in the former experiments.                A pure
 spectrum is then seen at the other end, and the position of the fixed
 lines read off on the graduated scale.        In order to determine the wave
 lengths of each kind of light, the incident light was first reflected
 from    a  stratum of air too thick to exhibit the colours of Newton's
 rings.      The spectrum then exhibited          a series    of dark   bands,  at
 intervals increasing from the red to the violet.              The wave-lengths
 corresponding to these form        a series  of submultiples of the retarda
 tion  ;  and by counting the bands      between two of the fixed lines, whose
wave-lengths have been determined by Fraunhofer, the wave-lengths
 corresponding to all the bands may be calculated              ;  and as there are
 a  great number of bands, the wave-lengths become known at a great
many different points.
    In this way the wave-lengths of the colours compared may                    be
 ascertained,      and the results      obtained by one       observer   rendered
 comparable with those obtained by another, with different apparatus.
A portable apparatus, similar to              one   exhibited     to the British
Association       in  1856,   is now being constructed in order to obtain
observations made          by eyes of different qualities, especially those
whose vision is dichromic.

         Fleeming        Jenkin,    Esq.     Communicated by Professor
         William       Thomson.       Received February 9, 1860.
                                     (Abstract.)
    The experiments described in this paper          were undertaken with the
view of determining          the resistance opposed by the gutta-percha
coating of submarine cables at various temperatures to the passage
of  an electric current.
    Tbe experiments were made at the works of R. S. Newall and Co.,
Birkenhead.          The relative resistance of the gutta percha at various
temperatures was determined by measuring the loss on short lengths

                                         410
immersed in water.         These experiments are described in the first
part of the paper.       The absolute      resistance    of gutta percha  has been
calculated from the loss on long submarine cables.                   These experi
ments     and calculations     are   described in the second          part of the
paper.
                                     Part I.
    The   loss  of electricity was measured          upon three different coils,
each one knot in length.         One was covered with pure gutta percha           ;
the two remaining coils were covered with gutta percha and Chat-
terton's compound.          The coils     were    kept at various temperatures
by being covered with water in a felted tub            ;  and the water was main
tained at    a constant temperature for twelve or fourteen hours before
each experiment.
     The   loss or current flowing from the           metal conductor to earth
through the gutta-percha          coating was measured          on a very delicate
 sine-galvanometer.       The   loss   from the connexions when the cable
 was disconnected, was measured           in a similar manner.        The electro
 motive force of the battery employed was on each occasion measured
 in the manner described by Pouillet.                Corrections due to varying
 electromotive force and loss on connexions were made on the result
 of  each experiment.
     A remarkable and regular         decrease     in the loss was observed for
 some minutes after the first application           of the battery to the cable    ;
 a phenomenon, which the author thinks may be due to the polariza
 tion of the molecules of gutta percha, or of the moisture contained
 in the pores of the gutta percha.            The   loss was therefore measured
 from minute to minute for five minutes, with                   each   pole of the
 battery.
     Nineteen tables    containing the results, with the reductions and
  curves representing the results, accompany the paper.              The following
  results were    obtained from the first coil         ;   this was  prepared with
  Chatterton's    patent compound.           With    a negative   current between
  the limits of 50° and 80° Fahrenheit, the decrease of resistance               is
  sensibly constant for equal increments of temperature ; and the
  increase of resistance due to continued electrification is also nearly
  constant.     At 60° the resistance      increases   about 20 per cent. in five
  minutes from this cause.         With      a  positive current, similar results

                                           411
appear between the temperatures of 50° and 60°                 ;  but the resistance
is somewhat greater than with                the negative    current.    The extra
resistance    due to continued electrification is unchanged by a change
in the sign of the current.              Above      the temperature of 63° great
irregularities   occur in the observations, which could not even be
included in regular curves.             The    difference  in the resistance   of the
gutta-percha coating when the copper is positively and negatively
electrified, may be caused by the contact between the resinous com
pound and the copper          :  no such difference was observed when pure
gutta percha was in contact with the copper.
    The curves resulting from the experiments                  on the second     coil,
which was covered with pure gutta percha, present an entirely                     dif
ferent character from those resulting from the first coil. The copper
and gutta percha were           of the  same size in these two coils.        The   re
sistance    of pure gutta percha           at low temperatures is greater than
that of the compound covering.                 At    65° the resistance  of  the two
coverings is equal     ;   at higher      temperatures the resistance       of pure
gutta percha diminishes extremely rapidly.                   The curves obtained
with positive and negative currents are identical up to about 75°                 ;  a
slight difference    occurs above this temperature, which may have been
accidental.     The extra     resistance    is less with pure gutta percha than
with the compound        ;  it  increases slightly at high       temperatures, and
is not affected by a change in the sign of the current.
    The curves derived from the experiments on the third coil, which
contained a smaller proportion of Chatterton's compound than the
first coil, appear in some respects intermediate between those derived
from the first and second coils.               The extra resistance due to con
tinued electrification was still greater in this coil than in the others.
40 per cent.      of the entire       resistance     is at 70° due to this cause.
This    increase   is believed      to be due to the greater mass of gutta
percha used in covering this coil, which was of larger dimensions
than the two others.
                                      Part II.
    Professor Thomson         has supplied an equation expressing the law
which connects the resistance of a cylindrical covering, such as that
of  a cable,  with the resistance of the unit of the material forming the
covering.

     of a  bar one foot long, and one

    resistance    of the cylindrical     cover of a length of cable      L ; let -s be
    the ratio of the external
                                     to the internal diameter of
                                                                      the covering ;

       The    resistance G was calculated
                                                 from cables of various lengths,
   lying   in  iron wells at the works
                                           of R. S. Newall and Co., Birkenhead.
   The cables were not wet ;
                                      but direct experiment
                                                               proved that cover
   ing a sound iron-covered

                                                                        on the loss.
   The details of this experiment
                                          are given in the paper.
       The resistance G was
                                    obtained in the following manner.
                                                                                  The
  copper conductor of the cable to

  as the continuity test.
                                 Deflections were then read on the

 caused by the loss was

 the same battery was
                              used. This deflection
                                                        was entered as the insu

the tangents of the

by a change of temperature.

   The equation (No. 2) R=r(l +0-00192*) gives the value of the
resistance R of the copper wire at any temperature t+a in function
of the    resistance   r at any temperature     a (Fahrenheit).    The length
and temperature of any coil being known,                the resistance of the
copper wire was thus at once obtained from the resistance of one
knot at 60°, which was very carefully determined.

   G having been thus obtained in any desired units, S, the specific
resistance    of the material, can be at once obtained by equation No. 1,
which appears        from several experiments to give constant values for
S when calculated from cables of different dimensions.             In extreme
cases, however, the influence         of extra resistance would render the
formula defective,       especially after continued application of the cur
rent  :  thus the resistance of     a  foot-cube would be very different to
that of an inch-cube.
   The values of G for the covering of the Red Sea cable, after con
tinued electrification for periods of one, two, three, four, and five
minutes, were calculated in Thomson's Absolute British Units, from
four sets of tests made specially for this purpose on four different
cables, each about 500 knots long.           Tables containing the results of
these calculations accompany the paper.
   A Table is      also given  of the   resistance   of the Red  Sea covering
after one minute's electrification, and after five minutes' electrification,
at each degree of temperature, from 50° to 75° Fahrenheit.                This
Table was formed by means of the temperature curves described in
the first part of the paper      : this Table is here annexed (No. 1 ).
   Similar Tables were given for the covering of the two experimental
coils mentioned in the first part of the paper.            The coil composed

                                        414
 of pure gutta percha, gave very regular and complete results. An
 abbreviation of the Table is annexed.
     It was remarked that in the tests of the cable in the iron tanks,
 the resistance      after   five   minutes'   electrification    was   invariably
 greater with zinc than with          copper to cable, whilst the reverse was
 the case with the single knot covered by water.               The length of the
 cable, and the condition        of immersion or non-immersion,         have pro
 bably some influence on the phenomenon of extra-resistance.                  This
 phenomenon appears to the author to be of much importance, and
 to demand further investigation.
    The values of G       were also calculated from the daily tests         of the
cables   during    manufacture at many temperatures.                These values
agreed with those given in the Tables above described.                The general
results of the experiments may be summed up as follows.
    The relative loss       at various    temperatures through         pure gutta
percha has been pretty accurately determined for all ordinary tem
peratures.      To  a less extent the same knowledge has been gained
concerning two other coatings containing Chatterton's                  compound.
The latter    appears superior at high, and inferior at low temperatures.
    Attention has been drawn to the considerably increased resistance
which follows the continued electrification of gutta percha and its
compounds.        Some     of the laws of this extra      resistance    have been
determined, and some            suggestions made      as to the cause      of the
phenomenon.
    The bounds      have been pointed out        within which      formulae   may
be used,    which     consider gutta percha as a conductor of the same
nature as metals.
    The  resistance    of gutta percha    has been obtained in units, such as
are employed to measure the resistance           of metals   ;  and by the use  of
Professor Thomson's formula, the specific resistance of a unit of the
material has been fixed with some accuracy.
   The    resistance    of other non-conductors,        such as glass and the
resins, may probably, by comparison with gutta percha, be obtained
in the same units.
    Incidentally,   the increase of resistance in copper with increased
temperature     has  been given from new experiments ; and it has been
shown that the insulation of a sound wire-covered cable is little, if at
all, affected by submersion.

   Finally,    tables and formulae               are given by which the resistance                       of,
or the loss through any new cable coated with gutta percha, may be
at least approximately estimated                   : —

varying the values of the coordinate scalars u, t,, P may be made
to assume any position whatever on the plane               of AOB.     The angle
AOB    may be taken at pleasure, but greater symmetry is secured by
choosing 01 and      OJ   as coordinate axes, where          IOJ is a right angle
described in the right-handed direction.            If any number    of lines OP,
OQ, OR, &c,      be thus represented,      the lengths of the lines PQ,       QR,
&c,  and the sines and cosines      of the  angles   IOP, POQ, QOR, &c, can
be immediately      furnished    in terms of the unit of length and the
coordinate scalars.                                   •
   If OP=x . 01 +y . OJ,        and any relation be assigned         between the
values  of  *  and y, such as      y=fx or i/.(x, y)=0, then the possible
positions of  P  are limited to those in which for any scalar value            of x
there exists a corresponding scalar value          of y.     The ensemble    of all
                                              '
such   positions of    P  constitutes the       loeus'   of the two equations,
viz. the 'concrete equation'        0P=* . 01-f y . OJ,        and the 'abstract
          '
equation    y=f . x.     The peculiarity of the present theory consists in
the recognition of these two equations to a curve, of which the
ordinary theory only furnishes the latter, and inefficiently replaces
the former by some convention            respecting the use of the letters,
whereby the coordinates themselves              are   not made    a part    of the
calculation.
   A variation in either of        these  two equations will occasion        a dif
ference either in the form or position        of their locus.     If the  abstract
equation be    y=ax+b, where a and b are any scalars, the concrete
                                J
equation OP = * . 01+ y . O becomes 0P= * . (01 + a . O J) + * • O J,
which shows that OP is the appense of a constant line, and a line in
a constant direction, and hence its extremity P must lie ou a line in
that direction drawn through           the extremity of the constant line.
Also, since the length of      OP    is  VC*a+ya) times the length of 01,
the locus of the two equations
                   OP=tf . OI + y . OJ       and a:a+ya=aa

                                        417
must be    a circle.    From these equations all the usual theory of the
straight line and circle may be readily deduced, and all ambiguity
respecting the representation of direction by the signs ( + ) and ( — )
may be removed.          Thus  if the  loci of
                   OP=a-.OI+y .OJ,              y=ax+b,
and                OP    W.OI+y'.OJ,             ay'+x'=0.
intersect in the point Q, and OQ, be the unit radius on the                J side
of 01 (produced both ways), determined by the equation
                       V(l+aa)     .OQ^-a.OI + OJ,
then    V (1+aa) • OQ will = 6 0Qr             And a line drawn from the
locus of P parallel to OQ to pass through the point X, where
QX=x1 . 01+ y,. OJ, will be represented in magnitude and direc
tion by
                              y      ax     b
                                vo+o
 From this result the usual theory of anharmonic ratios is immediately
                                    '              '
 deducible without any fresh          convention       respecting the signs ( + )
 and  (-).
    As  every locus has two equations, each equation requires separate
 consideration.      The investigations concerning the abstract equation
 remain nearly the same as in the usual theory.              When the abstract
 equation is given indirectly by the elimination of two constauts
 between three equations,      the result corresponds to the locus of the
 intersection    of two curves varying          according     to  a  known   law,
 '
   coordinates proper,' leading in its simplest forms, first, to Descartes'
 original conception of curves generated by the intersection of straight
 lines moving according to       a given law parallel to two given straight
 lines,  and secondly, to Pliicker's 'point coordinates.'              The true
 relation of Pliicker's 'line coordinates'           to the ordinary system     is
 immediately apparent on comparing the two sets of equations              :
          (1)        Concrete           0P=* . OI+y . OJ
                     Abstract          F (x, y) — 0,
          (2)        First abstract     y—ax+b
                     Second abstract     F (a, 6)=0.
 The   second set    of equations   determines   a curve by supposing a and b
 to vary, thenNeliminating a and        b,  and referring the ultimate abstract
                                                                 2 a 2

                                                418
equation  to the concrete equation ( 1 ). On comparing these two sets
of equations, we see that x and y in the first are involved in precisely
the same manner as a and b in the second, so that                              if   any equation
F(u, e)=0             were given,   it might determine             one or the other by pre
cisely the same algebra, according as x, y or a,                        b were       substituted
for u, v.             Whence      flow   Pliicker's          theories of       collineation    and
reciprocity.
  The investigations respecting the concrete equation, on the other
hand, are altogether new.     The most general form of the two
equations,       is
                      Concrete, OR=/,(#, y) . OA                        y) . OB
                      Abstract, <j>(x, y)=0,
which will clearly determine a curve as definitely as before.                                 If   in
lieu of the abstract equation             <p  (x, y)=0,          we were given the locus           of
the two equations
                           OM=ar.OA+y .OB,                      *(>,y)=0,
and from any point             M in this curve                  MN parallel to OB,
                                                             we drew
cutting OA produced in N, so that                         ON=#.OA, NM=y.OB, we
could find x and y from this curve, and consequently form
                      OL=/,(*, y) . OA,         and LR=/a(ar, y)           .   OB,
and by this means determine the point R, where                          OR=OL+LR, in
the locus of the general equations, corresponding                       to the point M in
the particular locus.            The general form is therefore the algebraical
expression        of   a   curve formed from another curve by means of ope
rations performed on the coordinates of the points in the latter, as
when an ellipse is formed from a circle by altering the ordinates in a
constant ratio.
   The algebraical treatment of this                    case consists in putting
                                  P =/a(*. y)l ?=/3(*. y),
and between            these   equations and           <p (x,   y)=0, eliminating x and y,
to find    \f/   (p, q)=0.        The locus     is     then reduced to that of
                           OR=p      .   01+   q   .   OJ,
                                                        i       (p, ?)=0,
which     is     the ordinary simple case.                   But the whole of this latter
locus does not in all cases correspond to the locus of the general
equations, because not only               x    and y, but also;? or f,(,x,           y), and   q   or

                                           419
fi(.x, y) must      be   all   scalar.    Thus, in the       case  of the parabola
 derived from a circle, by substituting for the ordinate of a point in
 the latter its distance from a known point in the circumference of
 the same, we know that it is impossible to derive                more  of the para
 bola than can be obtained by taking the diameter of the circle as
 the ordinate.      The algebraical      process gives first
          (1)   OR=.r.OI+ V(^+ya).OJ,                       yi + x' = 2ax;
 and then, putting      p=x, q= + ^(x'+ya),             we find
          (2)    OR=p        . OI+y . OJ,      qa=2ap.
 In this   case q is always positive and            = + nj(2ax).        But x, and
 therefore p, always lies between             the limits 0 and 2a, and hence q
 must lie between        the same limits.         Consequently the only part of
 the curve    (2)  represented      by the equations     (1) is the semi-parabola
 contained between the origin and the ordinate 2a               . OJ.
    This   general    form of the concrete         equation, therefore, furnishes
 an elementary method            of representing     curves    or parts of curves.

they would still represent definite lines (see abstract of Paper on
'

sequently the line       OP would still be perfectly determined, we see
that the limitation of x and y to scalar values in the previous inves
tigations was merely         a matter of convenience.                 We may therefore
give  x  any clinant value, and after determining the correspondent
clinant value of y from <p(x, y)=0 (which will always exist if the
equation is algebraical),          substitute        these     values   in  the concrete
equation, and thus          find OP, and consequently the locus of the
equations.       We may       observe,     however, that as a clinant involves
two scalars, we must have some relation given between them, directly
or indirectly,     in order that there may be only one real variable,

determine the values of p,                   q,    r,  t      from the four reduced curve equa
tions, and then assume any assignant equations compatible with these
solutions.           This      is   more readily done by determining                         X   and   Y   from

assignant       equations are            q   =   0      and «=0, and we have an ordinary
scalar case of intersection.                      But     if       this   is   not the case, and we find

       Clinant radical loci,' or curves which furnish                   a sensible geome
 trical picture of the relations of the corresponding clinants which
 satisfy any abstract equation, may be obtained thus.                        Let the given
equation be C         (X, Y) = 0.        This may      be regarded as two reduced
 curve equations,
                       C,(p,q,r,»)=0,            C1(p,q,r,s)=0.
The     values    of X   are assumed       by drawing radii vctorees           to points in
any curve, and the corresponding values of                       Y   have to be pictured.
We must therefore           have some equation         A=0, which in combination
with the other two will give the curve by which                    X  is thus determined.
Eliminating the         scalars,  p,  q, r, «,  two and two, between           these    three
equations,       we obtain the following          six, of which the first and last,
and one of the intermediate ones, are in general only required                        :
            /.(*?)=<1,         A(p,r) = 0, /3(P,»)=0, /4(?,r)=0,

    We now construct the           curves containing the points            X, S, Y,   as the
loci of the equations

    Set off    OP at pleasure on 01 (produced both ways), and draw the
ordinate      PXS,   cutting the two first curves in X and S. Through S
draw SY parallel to OI, cutting the third locus in Y : then if
OX=X . OI, and OY=Y . 01, X and Y are corresponding solutions

 abstract equations to the first and last curve become                                     </=0,      «=0,
 so that both      of   these   curves          coincide with 01 produced both ways,
 and the intermediate or connecting curve is the ordinary scalar radical
 locus.

equations and F=0, thus finding ip(xvyvz^)=0.          The locus of

variable parameters a, b, c are      introduced, we require in addition
three equations of condition,                   F,=0, Fa=0, F3=0,                    between x, y, z,

      Clinant Solid Geometry. — Some precaution                             is     now necessary        to
indicate the plane on which the quadrantal rotation symbolized by                                       i
is   to take place.      This   is   effected by introducing                   all three coordinate
axes into the concrete          equations.             Let the abstract equation                 be
                                      F(X,Y,Z) = 0.
Then, supposing
                        X=p     +    iq,       Y=r+i«, Z=«+ir,
this equation reduces           to   F,=0, Fa=0, where                      F,     and    Fa   are forma
tions of the six scalars p,          q,   r,   s,   u, v.   We now require two                  assignant
equations to determine the curves on which                             OX          and   OY     are to be
taken.        These may be given in the form of the single clinant equa

                                     426
tion   A (X, Y, Z)=0, which reduces to the two scalar equations
A,=0, A,=0. Now take OR=/, (X, Y, Z) . OI+/a (X, Y, Z) . OJ.
Then,    since  i.OI=OJ,      because  the assumption of the two axes
determines the rotation to be in the plane 10 J, we can reduce this to
OR= R, . 01 +      R^ . OJ, where R,, R, are formations of the six scalars.
    By virtue of the equations A,=0, Aa=0, F,=0, Fa=0, which
will give q, *, u, v in terms of p, r, the line OR is perfectly determined
by the assumption of p and r.         Next take
                           VW+RVO.OR^OR,
so that   OR, is  a unit radius in the direction  OR.    Put
                0P=/, (X, Y, Z) . 0R.+/, (X, Y, Z) . OK,
which reduces to OP=R,.OR, + P, .OK, where R,, P, are forma
tions of the six scalars, because i. OR,=OK on the plane R,OK.
The locus of P will now manifestly be a surface, the concrete equation
of which     becomes    of the usual form on putting for OR, its value.
 Determine P,, Pa by the equations
          P,.V(R1a+Kaa)=R1Rs.            Pa.V(R1a+R,a)=RsRs,
and we find
                      OP=P, . OI + P, . OJ + P„ . OK.
 Putting £=P,, y = Pa, *=Ps, and eliminating the six scalars between
these three equations and A^O, Aa=0, F, = 0, F„=0, the locus
 becomes that    of
              OP=*.OI+y.OJ+z.OK,                 f(*,y,*)=0,
which is limited by the conditions of scalarity.
    After illustrating this theory by    an example,  the theory of inter
section,   when the elimination gives clinant values to determine the
points, is discussed.      The general theory is further illustrated by the
determination of equations to loci, leading to very simple and ex
 tremely general modes of finding families of surfaces.       The problems
 of the transformation of coordinates and of radical loci      are shown to
 be  precisely analogous to those of plane curves.
    It will be evident that these investigations merely open out a new
 field for algebraical geometry, of which it is impossible to foresee the
 extent.

  This paper contains the full details of the authors' experiments
on the volumetric changes which occur in the formation of ozone.
From three distinct        series     of experiments, performed by different
methods, they show that when ozone is formed from pure oxygen by
the action of the electrical discharge, a condensation takes place, as
had already been announced in a former Note published in the
'              But the condensation is much greater than the earlier
    Proceedings.'
experiments of the authors on the expansion by heat of electrolytic
ozone had indicated.         It     is,   in fact, so great, that     if   the allotropic
view    of the constitution of      ozone be correct, the density             of that body,
as compared with         oxygen, would be represented                by   a   number cor
responding to the density of              a   solid or liquid rather than that of        a
gaseous     substance.     This conclusion follows                necessarily    from the
authors' experiments, unless           it   be assumed that when ozone               comes
into contact with such substances as iodine, or a solution of iodide of
potassium, one portion of         it   is   changed back into common oxygen,
while the remainder enters into combination, and that these portions
are so related to one another, that the expansion due to the one                         is
exactly equal to the contraction arising from the other.                           For the
details of the experiments and of the methods of investigation em
ployed, reference must be made to the original paper.
     The   second part   of the communication          is     devoted to the action of
the silent discharge and of the electrical                    spark on other gases.

                                              428
Hydrogen and nitrogen undergo no change of volume when exposed
to the action of either form of discharge.                   Cyanogen is readily de
composed       by the spark, but presents so great a resistance                     to the
passage      of electricity, that the action of the silent discharge can
scarcely     be observed.    Protoxide of nitrogen is readily attacked by
both forms of discharge, with increase                   of volume and formation of
nitrogen      and hyponitric acid.            Deutoxide of nitrogen exhibits the
remarkable example of           a gas    which, under the action either of the
silent discharge or of the spark, undergoes, like oxygen, a diminu
tion of volume.        It    also   is resolved into        nitrogen    and hyponitric
acid.       Carbonic oxide has given results of great interest                  ;   but the
nature of the reaction has been only partially investigated.                            The
silent discharge decomposes           this gas with production of a substance
of   a bronze colour on the positive wire.                The spark    acts differently,
destroying, as in the case of oxygen, the greater part of the con
traction produced by the silent discharge.                   The authors      are engaged
in the further prosecution of this inquiry.

Philosophical       Transactions for         1 763,    Waring gives, but without de

are known, for the particular case in which one                                        of the      coefficients          of

be (*3C»,             0n=0;             then, when the last coefficient                     or constant term
vanishes, the equation breaks up into »=0 and into an equation of
the degree    — 1), which

R. Harley.           It is    to be noticed that the best                    course is to apply the
method in the first instance to the forms (a,                        b, .
                                                                             ,^£p,    1)™=0, without
numerical coefficients               (or, as they may be termed, the denumerate
forms), and          to    pass   from the results so obtained to those                               which
belong to the forms (a,                b, ..l[v, 1 )"=(), or standard forms. The
equation of differences,               for (a — /3)a, &c, the coefficients of which
are    seminvariants, naturallyleads to the consideration of a more
                                 —
general equation for (a— /3)' (x yy)a (x—Sy)a, &c, the coefficients
of which are covariants ; and in fact, when, as for equations of the
orders two, three, and four, all the covariants are known, such co-
variant equation can be at once formed from the equation of dif
ferences   ;    for equations of the fifth order, however,                           where the cova
riants are not calculated beyond                      a   certain degree, only                a few   of the
coefficients     of the covariant equation                   are given.            At     the conclusion
of the memoir,            I   show how the equation             of differences for             an equation
of    the order n can be obtained by the elimination                                 of   a single quan
tity from two equations each of the order n —                                1;   and by applying to
these two equations the simplification which                             I have      made in Bezout's
abridged method of elimination,                       I   exhibit the equation of differences
for the given equation of the order n, in a compendious form by
means of a determinant ; the method just employed       however, that                   is,
which    isbest adapted for the actual development of the equation of
differences for the equation of   given order.    a

   The Croonian          Lecture       was then delivered by       James     Petti-
grew, Esq., " On the Arrangement of the Muscular Fibres of                       the
Ventricular portion of the Heart of the Mammal."
                                      (Abstract.)
   The Lecturer      began by referring to the descriptions         of the arrange
ment of the ventricular           fibres of the heart given by previous in
quirers, more especially Lower, Senac, Wolff, Gerdy, Duncan, and
Reid ; he then proceeded to give an account of the results of his
own     investigations, which had been conducted on the hearts of the
Sheep, Calf, Deer, Ox, Horse, &c. ; all            of which,  he observed,    bear a
perfect resemblance        to the human heart*.        In order,  as much as pos
sible, to overcome      the difficulties of the subject, he availed himself of
drawings, explanatory diagrams, and models illustrating                  the course
and relation     of the fibres.       To  these  last, however, he observed        he
attached no special importance, further than that they were useful
vehicles of communication           ; and it was to the dissections themselves,
some     of which   were before the Society, that he looked for a corro
boration of the statements          he advanced.
    Commencing with the left ventricle, which he believes                  to be the
typical one, the Lecturer stated that, by exercising a little care, he
had been enabled to unwind as it were its muscular substance,                    and
so to separate its walls into several         layers f,  each  of which   is charac
terized by a difference        in direction.     Seven    layers, at least,   can be
readily     shown by dissection         ;  but he believes     they are in reality
nine   ;  viz. four external, the fifth or central, and four internal.            He
explained how the external fibres are continuous with the internal
fibres at the apex, as was known to Lower                 J, Gerdy §, and others,
   * Mr. Pettigrew's researches include also the arrangement of the fibres in the
ventricles of the Bird, Reptile, and Fish.
   t  Senac (Traits rte la Structure du Cceur, &c. [Paris, 1749] , planche 8) figures
four layers; and Searle (Cyc. of Anat. and Phys., art. " Heart") speaks of three.

                                                                 2 H 2

                                             434
and how the fibres constituting the several                  external layers are con
tinuous with corresponding internal layers likewise at the base*, —
a    fact to which the Lecturer drew particular attention, as being con
trary to the generally received opinion, which is to the effect that the
fibres at the base are non-continuous, and arise from the auriculo-
ventricular tendinous rings — which, as he showed by numerous dis
sections,        is not the case.
          next to the question of the direction of the fibres, he
     Coming
showed how there is a gradational sequence in the direction of the
fibres constituting            the several   layers.      Thus the fibres of the first
layer are more vertical in direction than those of the second, the
second than those             of the third, the third than        those         of the fourth,
and the fourth than those  of the fifth, the fibres constituting which
layer are transverse, and run at nearly right angles to those of the
first layer.  Passing the fifth layer, which occupies the centre of
the ventricular wall and forms the boundary between                               the external
and internal layers, the order of things is reversed                      ;   and the remain
ing layers, viz. six, seven, eight, and nine, gradually return to the
vertical in an opposite direction, and in an inverse order.                           This   re
markable change in the direction of the external and internal fibres,
which had in part been figured by Senac, and imperfectly described
by Reid        f,   as well as other detached and important facts ascertained
by himself and others — such as the continuity of the fibres at the
apex and base, already adverted to — he suggested might be accounted
for by the law of the double conical spiral, which                               he proceeded
forthwith to explain.

the arrangement of the fibres in the ventricle,                           briefly the follow
ing.        By   a   simple process of involution        and evolution, the external
fibres become           internal    at the apex, and external again at the base               ;

     The late Dr. Duncan, Jun., of Edinburgh, was aware of the fibres forming
    *
loops at the base, but seems to have had no knowledge of the continuity being
occasioned       by the union of corresponding      external and internal layers, or that
these basal loops were prolongations         of like loops formed by similar correspond
ing external and internal layers at the apex —     a    point which the Lecturer believes
he   is   the first to establish.

within       outwards, they always return to points not wide apart from
those from whence they started.                    In order to illustrate the principle
of the double conical spiral in the                    above      sense, he took a sheet              of
net, through which              parallel threads of coloured wool, representing
the individual          fibres, were drawn at intervals               ;    and laying         it out on
the table before            him, with the threads placed horizontally, seized it
by the right-hand off corner, and rolled it in upon itself                         (i.   e.    towards
his own body) seven turns, so as to produce                       a       cone whose walls con
sisted      of nine layers*.          On gradually unwinding                   the walls of the
cone thus fashioned (which              is   tantamount to undoing the spirals), so
as to imitate the removal          of consecutive layers from the walls of the
ventricle, he         finds that the gradation in the direction of the several
layers just specified           is   distinctly marked        ;   and that these layers, as
was exhibited in various dissections, find                a   counterpart in the ventricle
itself.        Thus (the heart being supposed to                  be placed upright on its
apex) in the first external layer the threads are seen running from
base       to apex,     and from left to right          f,     almost vertically;               in   the
second         layer they are slightly oblique            ;   this obliquity increases                in
the third, and still more in the succeeding layer, till in the fifth or
central one the direction of the threads becomes transverse. After
passing the central layer, the direction of the threads (as of the
fibres)  reversed
            is      in the sixth layer they begin to turn from right
                            ;
to left, with       a   slight inclination upwards            ;   and in succeeding              layers
gradually become             more and more vertical, until the innermost, or
ninth,      is   reached,    in which     they become          as vertical as in the first,
but are curved in an opposite direction.
     As    a   necessary    consequence      of this arrangement of the fibres, the
Lecturer         showed      that when the layers are in apposition, as they
exist in the undissected ventricle, the first external layer and the last
internal cross each other with               a   slight deviation from the vertical, as
in   the letter    X  ;    while in the succeeding external and internal layers,

 A         sheet of paper with parallel lines drawn           upon    it   will answer the purpose
equally well, except that its non-transparency           precludes         our seeing the external
and internal spirals rolled the one within the other when the sheet                      is    fashioned
into   a   cone and held against the light, as the Lecturer recommends.                       The sheets
should be twice as long as they are broad          ;   and the lines or threads should run in
the direction of the length.
 t     That is, in the direction from the left hand to the right of the observer.

                                      436
until the fifth or central one, which is transverse,          is reached, they
cross at successively wider vertical angles,        as may be represented by
an   X  placed horizontally.
    Holding the     cone,  prepared as described, against the light,         the
Lecturer     then showed how, by the rolling process,          a double system
of conical spirals, similar      to those found      in the left ventricle, had
been    produced — the one       an   external    left-handed    down   system,
running from base to apex,          and corresponding        with the external
layers   ;  the other an internal right-handed up system, running from
apex to base, and corresponding with the internal fibres ; and how,
seeing the opposite systems       are the result   of different portions of the
same threads being rolled       in different directions (the     one within the
other), the spirals are consequently continuous at the apex.
    He in this manner explained the continuity of the external and
internal fibres at the apex.       By simply producing the threads form
ing the internal spirals, and turning them out at the base until they
met corresponding        external spirals, he next showed how the con
 tinuity of the fibres at the base might be accounted for. The con
 nexion of the fibres at the base, he remarked, is effected for the most
part   as  at the apex, by continuity of their proper muscular substance        ;
 but those of the papillary muscles          are continued    by the tendinous
 cords.     This continuity   observes   a certain order, so that certain ex
 ternal layers are continued at the apex into certain internal layers,
 and turn      outwards at the base into their original external position.
 Thus the first layer is continuous with the ninth, the second with
 the eighth, the third with the seventh, and the fourth with the
 sixth, while the fifth occupies, as already said, the middle place be
 tween the four external and four internal.            He thus   endeavoured   to
 prove that a strong analogy exists        between     the arrangement of the
 fibres at the apex and the base, and that the same principle which
  turns in the external fibres at the apex also turns out the internal
  at the base, — a view which, while        it  extends   rather than militates
  against that of older writers, was strongly supported by the arguments
  he adduced.      It would therefore seem that the fibres do not form
  simple loops pointing      towards the apex, as generally supposed, but
  twisted continuous loops pointing          alike to apex and base.       From
  this arrangement, it follows that the first and ninth layers embrace
  in their convolutions those immediately beneath them, while these in

                                         437
turn embrace        those   next in succession,    and so on until the central
layer is reached,      — an arrangement which may in part explain alike
the rolling movements and powerful action of the ventricles.
     The Lecturer       next drew attention to the manner in which            the
external fibres pass into the interior            of the ventricle to form the
musculi papillares.         He first remarked that when the external fibres
get into the interior they are necessarily confined to a smaller area,
and are therefore crowded into           a mass    of greater thickness, which
contributes to     form the papillary muscles.        He then showed that the
external fibres, entering at the apex and forming the            " vortex,"
                                                                            pass
inwards in two principal          parcels or bundles, one of which comes
chiefly from the posterior surface            of the ventricle, and winds for
wards to enter the apex anteriorly, whilst another comes from the
anterior surface, and winds backwards to enter the apex posteriorly,
a   fact which the Lecturer believes has been hitherto overlooked.            On
 entering the cavity, the anterior bundle crosses to the posterior wall,
and forms the posterior papillary muscle, whilst the posterior bundle
 forms the anterior papillary muscle.             The fact of this double     en
trance, and its relation to the papillary muscles, was shown in various
 preparations    ;  and it was remarked that, but for this double entrance,
 which applies to all the external layers, the apex of the ventricle
 would be like the barrel of           a  pen   cut slantingly, or, in fact, lop
 sided   ; whereas,    by the arrangement described, it is rendered bilate
 rally symmetrical.
     To bring this bilateral     entrance   and symmetry into harmony with
 the description       already given of the succession       of layers, and with
 the illustration of the conically rolled sheet, the Lecturer explained
 that we must regard the primary sheet as having split into two, or
 we must suppose        a second   one superadded, and rolled up along with
 the first.     In   fact,  if a second    sheet  of net with parallel threads
 be laid on the first, so       that the threads upon it intersect those of
 the first at an acute angle, and the two are then rolled up together
 in the way already described,         the result will be that the opening at
 the apex    will  have two symmetrical lips, as       it were, representing the
 two parcels of fibres forming the vortex in the natural heart.
     It is well known that the wall of the left ventricle is thickest at
 about a    third of its length from the        base, and that from this point
 it decreases in thickness towards the base, and still more towards the

                                                438
apex, which is its thinnest part.                This condition may            be explained by
a   certain modification of the preceding                    description, — by         supposing,
namely (what is really the fact), that the outermost and innermost
layers extend further towards the apex and towards the base than
those which       come     next, and these again further than those                             which
succeed, and so on with the rest                 ;    the central one being of least ex
tent, and confined indeed to about the middle third of the ventricle.
In this way the ventricular wall is thickest towards its middle, where
it is composed       of all the layers, but              becomes       thinner and thinner
towards the base and apex, where it consists of fewer and fewer
layers.
    Proceeding next to speak of the right ventricle, and especially                                  of
its relation to the left, the Lecturer observed that the simplest way to
view that ventricle is to regard it as                  a segment      of the left        one   ;   and
this view he considers to be most in accordance with what we know
of its structure and            mode     of development.             For   a   short time after
the heart appears              in the embryo, its ventricular                  compartment is
simple    ;   but a septum        soon begins to rise           up within        it,   which pro
ceeds from the right side of the apex and anterior wall of the cavity
in the direction of the base, and                is   completed about the eighth week
of intra-uterine life.            For   a   time, moreover, the new-formed ven
tricles have equally thick walls            ;   but as the full period          is   approached,
the left, which      is   destined after birth to perform               a    larger amount of
work, comes to predominate in thickness.                            Starting     now from the
left or       "typical" ventricle, constituted                 as    above      described, the
Lecturer showed that,             by   pushing in the anterior wall in imitation of
the constructive process in the embryo until                     it   reaches the posterior
wall, two ventricles are produced, with                  a   partition or septum between.
As, however, the septum in this case                    is   double and unattached pos
teriorly, he said    it    was necessary,            in order to complete the structure,
to suppose the fibres forming                   the posterior border of the septal
duplicature as coalescing or anastomosing with corresponding                                    fibres
of the posterior wall, whilst the fibres of the two                     halves       of   the dupli
cature itself are blended with each other.                          In this    way, as he ex
plained, there results           single septum connected posteriorly, and
                                 a
constituted in      a     manner which remarkably accords with the struc
ture discovered           by   dissecting the adult heart.                 Thus, when both
ventricles are dissected               at the same time, the               fibres forming the

                                         439
external layers posteriorly are found to be for the most part common
to   both  ;  in other words, the fibres on the back part of the left
ventricle cross over the posterior coronary tract, and pass on to the
right ventricle     ; whereas,   in front, with the exception of a large cross
band at the base, the fibres of the right and of the left ventricle
respectively dip inward at the anterior coronary tract, as         if altogether
independent of each other         :  an arrangement which induced        Winslow
to regard the heart as consisting         of two muscles enveloped    in a third.
When, moreover, the so-called common fibres, posteriorly,                  are dis
sected   layer by layer simultaneously with the independent anterior
fibres, it is found that both pass through the same changes of direc
tion  ; and the same rule holds good with the fibres of the septum.
    Another possible mode of explaining the septum, as the Lecturer
showed,     is to regard the layers entering into the formation of the
left ventricle as splitting       up posteriorly, the one half of each layer
winding round to form the right ventricle, and then dipping in front
to form the      right half of the septum, whilst the other half proceeds
immediately forwards to form the left half of the septum.
    Both ventricles thus appear to be formed on the same general plan,
but they differ materially in the structure of their apices            ;   and the
question arises— which is the primary or typical ventricle               ?    Now,
while the fibres of the left ventricle enter its apex in       a  spiral manner
by a species of involution          similar to that which would be produced
by rolling a sheet of muscle into a cone, those of the right ventricle
simply bend or double on themselves.           Moreover, as the Lecturer sug
gested, were we to split the septum into two, assigning to each ven
tricle its proper share, and then apply the cut ends of the common
fibres (which cross from the left to the right ventricle posteriorly) to
their corresponding fibres in the left half of the septum, we should find
that we had still      a perfect whole — in other words, a complete system
of external and internal spirals ; whereas the fibres of the right
ventricle and its half of the septum, treated in the same way, would
represent only       a part of  a   more complete system   — a portion nipped
off, as  it  were, from the side       of the perfect  cone.   Accordingly,       if
we would       dissect   the left ventricle, and especially its apex,         sym
metrically, we must detach the right ventricle as            if it   were     of no
account, and dissect         layer after layer of the septum        pari passu
with the layers of the left ventricular wall generally          ;  on the other

                                                440
hand, the right ventricle can be dissected only in connexion with the
left.
   For    these reasons    the Lecturer            is inclined to regard the left ven
tricle as the typical one, and the right as                   a mere     segment thereof;
and in further corroboration               of this opinion,    he referred to the shape
of the right and left ventricular cavities, as shown by casts of their
interior.  The left always yields a beautifully finished and perfect
right-handed        conical screw,         while the cast of the right ventricle,
although     it has the         same        twist,    represents only         an   incomplete
portion.     This    statement        was illustrated       by    a   wax-cast of the ven
tricles of the heart of     a deer.
   In conclusion, the Lecturer remarked that the arrangement of the
fibres    composing the ventricles of the mammalian heart, as he had
endeavoured     to expose       it,   is   characterized by comparative simplicity,
and harmonizes perfectly              with what       is   known of the heart's move
ments.

taken.
  Two            pieces       of thawing      ice,       if   put together, adhere and become
one    ;    at a place where liquefaction was proceeding, congelation sud
denly occurs.                  The   effect   will take place in air, or in                             water, or in
vacuo.               It will    occur at every point where the two pieces                                     of   ice
touch       ;    but not with ice below the freezing-point, i.                                    e.   with dry    ice,
or ice so cold as to be everywhere in the solid state.
  Three different views are taken of the nature of this phenomenon.
When first               observed        in 1850,        I     explained it by supposing that                         a
particle of water, which could retain the liquid                                         state whilst touching
ice only on one                  side, could     not retain the liquid state                              if it   were
touched by ice on both sides                         ;    but became                solid, the general tem
perature remaining                   the same*.                Professor            J.    Thomson,         who dis
covered that pressure lowered the freezing-point of waterf , attributed
the regelation to the fact that two pieces of ice could not be made
to bear on each other without pressure                               ;    and that the pressure, how

touched, accompanied by relief of the pressure and resolidification of
the water at the place of contact, in the manner that he has fully
explained in              a   recent communication to the Royal Society^.                                    Profes

      Though            some might          think that Professor Thomson, in his                                   last
communication, was trusting                          to changes of pressure and tempera
ture so inappreciably small as to be not merely imperceptible, but
also       ineffectual, still he carried his conditions with him into all the
cases           he    referred to, even though some of his assumed                                         pressures
were due to capillary attraction, or to the consequent                                             pressure of the

atmosphere,       only.        It    seemed        to me that experiment                     might be so
applied as to advance                the investigation                 of this beautiful point in
molecular philosophy to a further degree than has yet been done ;
even to the extent of exhausting the power of some of the principles
assumed     in   one or more      of the three views adopted, and so render
our knowledge        a    little more defined and exact than it is at present.
     In order to exclude all pressure of the particles of                                    ice    on each
other due to capillary attraction or the atmosphere,                                     I   prepared to
experiment altogether under water                         ;   and for this purpose arranged a
bath of that fluid at 32° F.                        A pail, surrounded by dry flannel,
was placed in a box             ;   a glass      jar,     10 inches deep and 7 inches wide,
was placed on a low tripod                      in the pail        ;   broken ice was packed be
tween the     jar and the pail              ;    the jar was filled with ice-cold water to
within an    inch of the top ;                  a glass dish filled with ice was employed
as a cover to       it,   and the whole enveloped with dry flannel.                                  In this
way the central jar, with its contents, could be retained at the un
changing temperature of 32°                      F. for   a   week or more         ;   for   a   small piece
of   ice floating   in    it   for that time was not entirely melted away.                              All
that was required to keep the arrangement at the fixed temperature,
was to renew the packing ice in the pail from time to time, and also
that in the basin cover.                  A     very slow thawing process was going on
in the jar the whole time, as was evident by the                                    state    of the indi
cating piece of ice there present.
     Pieces of good Wenham-lake ice were prepared, some being blocks
three inches square, and nearly an inch thick, others square prisms
four or five inches long              :    the blocks had each                a   hole made through
them with     a   hot wire near one corner                    ;   woollen thread passed through
these    holes formed loops, which being attached to pieces of lead,
enabled me to sink the ice entirely under the surface                                    of the ice-cold
water.      Each piece was thus moored to                              a   particular place, and, be
cause    of its buoyancy,            assumed        a   position of stability.               The threads
were  about 1£ inch long, so that        piece of ice, when depressed
                                                              a
sideways and then left to itself, rose in the water as far as   could,                             it
and into its stable position, with considerable force.                                   When, also,      a
piece was turned round                    on its loop as               a   vertical axis, the torsion
force tended to make                it   return in the reverse direction.
     Two similar blocks of ice                     were       placed in the water with their
opposed     faces about two                inches apart           ;    they could be moved into

                                      443
any desired position by the use of slender rods of wood, without
any change of temperature in the water.                 If   brought     near to each
other and then left unrestrained, they separated,                  returning to their
first position with considerable force.        If   brought into the slightest
contact, regelation ensued,       the blocks adhered, and remained ad
herent notwithstanding the force tending to pull them apart.                        They
would continue thus, even for twenty-four hours or more, until they
were   purposely separated,      and would
                                       appear (by many trials) to
have the adhesion increased at the points where they first touched,
though at other parts of the contiguous surfaces                    a feeble   thawing
and dissecting action went on.          In this     case, except        for the first
moment and in       a   very minute degree, there was no pressure either
from capillary     action or any other        cause.             On the contrary,       a
tensile force of considerable amount was tending all the time to
separate    the pieces of ice at their points of adhesion ; where still,                I
believe,    the adhesion went on increasing — a belief that will be fully
confirmed hereafter.
   Being desirous of knowing whether anything                     like soft adhesion
occurred, such     as   would allow slow change of position without sepa
ration during the action of the tensile force,               I    made the following
arrangements.       The blocks of     ice   being moored by the threads
fastened     to the lowest corners, stood in the water with one of the
diagonals of the large surfaces         vertical    ;    before      the faces      were
brought into contact, each block was rotated 45° about a horizontal
axis, in opposite directions, so that when put together, they made a
compound       block, with horizontal      upper edges, each half of which
tended to be twisted upon, and torn from the other.                   Yet by placing
indicators in holes previously made in the edges of the ice,                    I   could
not find that there was the slightest motion of the blocks in rela
tion to each other in the thirty-six hours during which the experi
ment was continued.         This result,    as far as it goes, is against the
necessity of pressure to regelation, or the existence of any condition
like that of softness or a shifting contact ; and yet I shall be able to
show that there is either soft adhesion or an equivalent for                    it,   and
from that state draw still further cause against the necessity of pres
sure to regelation.
  Torsion     force was    then employed as an antagonist to regelation.
The ice-blocks, being      separate, were adjusted       in   the water so as to be

                                                     444
parallel to each other, and about                           1-|   inch apart.         If   made       to ap
proach each other on one side, by revolution                                in opposite directions
on vertical axes,          a   piece   of paper being              between       to prevent ice con
tact, the torsion force set up caused                          them to separate when left to
themselves       ;   but   if   the paper were away and the ice pieces were
brought into contact, by however slight                             a    force, they became             one,
forming      a   rigid piece of ice, though the strength was, of course, very
small, the point of adhesion and solidification being simply the con
tact of two convex surfaces                      of small radius.             By giving            a   little
motion to the pail, or by moving either piece                                of ice gently            in   the
water with       a   slip of wood,         it   was easy to see that the two pieces were
rigidly attached        to each other            ;    and   it    was also found that, allowing
time, there was no more tendency to                         a     changing shape here than in
the case quoted above.                     If   now the slip of wood were introduced
between       the adhering pieces of ice, and applied so as to aid the
torsion force of one of the loops, !.                   e. to increase       the separating force,
but unequally as respects the two pieces, then the congelation at the
point of contact would give way, and the pieces of ice would move
in relation to each other.                      Yet they would not            separate      ;   the piece
unrestrained by the stick would not move off                                 by   the torsion of its
own thread, though,              if    the stick were withdrawn,                      it   would       move
back into its first attached position, pulling the second piece with                                       it
                                                                                                            ;
and the two would resume their first associated                              form, though all the
while the torsion of both loops was tending to make the pieces
separate.
  If   when the wood was applied to change the mutual position                                              of
the two pieces of ice, without separating them,                             it   were retained for          a
second       undisturbed, then the two pieces of ice became fixed rigidly
to each       other in their new                 position, and maintained                  it   when the
wood was removed, but under                       a    state      of restraint   ;    and when suffi
cient force was applied, by                 a    slight tap of the wood on the ice to
break up the rigidity, the two pieces of ice would rearrange them
selves under the torsion force                   of their      respective    threads, yet remain
united   ;   and, assuming             a   new position, would, in                a   second       or less,
again become rigid, and remain inflexibly                            conjoined as before.
  By managing the continuous motion of one piece of ice,                                         it    could
be kept associated             with the other by               a   flexible point of attachment
for any length of time, could                    be   placed       in   various angular positions

                                                      445
to    it,   could be made (by retaining             moment) to
                                                            it   quiescent for           a
assume and hold permanently any of these positions when the ex
ternal force was removed,                  could be changed from that position into
a    new one, and, within             certain limits, could be made to possess at
pleasure, and for any length of time, either                           a   flexible or    a   rigid attach
ment to its associated               block of ice.
     So, regelation includes               a   flexible adhesion of the particles of ice,
and also      a   rigid adhesion.              The transition          between        these     two states
takes place when there               is    no external force like pressure                     tending to
bring the particles of ice together, but, on the contrary,                                      a    force of
torsion      is   tending to separate               them    ;   and,   if    respect      be had to the
mere     point of contact           on the two rounded surfaces where the flexible
adhesion          is   exercised,    the force which tends to separate                         them may
be esteemed very great.                    The      act   of regelation cannot             be considered
as complete            until the junction has               become          rigid ;      and therefore      I
think that the necessity of pressure for       altogether excluded.  it    is
No external pressure can remain (under the circumstances) after the
first rigid contact  broken.  All the forces which remain tend to
                             is
separate       the pieces of ice          ;   yet the first flexible adhesions and all the
successive        rigid adhesions which               are made to occur, are as much effects
of regelation as those which occur under the greatest pressure.
   The phenomenon of flexible adhesion under tension looks very
much like sticking and tenacity    and   think    probable that Pro
                                                     ;          I            it
fessor       Forbes will       see    in      it    evidence     of the truth of his view.                  I
cannot, however, consider the fact as bearing such an interpretation                                            ;
because     I     think   it   impossible to keep               a   mixture of snow and water
for hours and days together without the temperature of the mixed
mass        becoming uniform           ;      which uniformity               would be fatal to the
explanation.             My idea of the flexible and rigid adhesion                             is   this   —
                                                                                                            :
Two         convex      surfaces     of    ice come together           ;     the particles of water
nearest to the place of contact, and therefore within the efficient sphere
of action of           those particles         of    ice which are on both sides                  of   them,
solidify     ;    if   the condition of things be left for                       a    moment, that the
heat evolved by the solidification                        may be conducted away and dis
persed, more particles will solidify, and ultimately enough to form
a                unction, which will remain until
     fixed and rigid      j                       force sufficiently                 a
great to break through        applied.  But
                                       it     the direction of the
                                               is                           if
force resorted to can be relieved by any hinge-like                                        motion at the

                                                 146
point of contact, then              I   think that the union is broken up among the
particles on the opening side of the angle, whilst the particles on the
closing side come within the effectual                   regelation distance        ;   regelation
ensues there and the adhesion is maintained, though in an apparently
flexible state.The flexibility appears to me to be due to a series of
ruptures on one side of the centre of contact, and of adhesion on the
other, — the regelation, which is dependent on the vicinity of the ice
surfaces,      being transferred as the place of efficient vicinity is changed.
That the        substance      we are considering is as brittle as ice, does not
make any difficulty to me in respect of tho flexible adhesion                             ;    for    if
we suppose           that the point of contact exists only at one particle, still
the angular motion at that point must bring                           a second    particle into
contact (to suffer regelation) before separation could occur at the
first ; or  as seems proved by the supervention of the rigid adhesion
               if,
upon the flexible state, many particles are concerned at once,                            it   is   not
possible that all these should be broken through
                                                                          by
                                                                          a       force applied
on one side of the place of adhesion, before particles on the opposite
side should have the opportunity                  of regelation, and        so   of continuing
the adhesion.
  It    is   not necessary for the observation of these phenomena that                               a
carefully-arranged water-vessel should be employed.                          The difference
between the flexible and rigid adhesion may be examined                            very well in
air.     For this purpose, two of the bars of ice                     before spoken of, may
be hung up horizontally                 by threads, which may be adjusted to give
by     torsion any separating force desired              ;   and when the ends of these
bars are brought together, the adhesion                      of the   ice, and the ability           of
placing        these    bars   at       any angle,     and causing them to preserve
that angle by the rigid adhesion due to regelation, will be rendered
evident and though the flexible adhesion of the ice cannot in this
          ;
way be examined           alone, because         of the capillary attraction            due to the
film of water on the ice, yet that                is   easily obviated      by    plunging the
pieces into      a    dish of water at common temperatures, so that they are
entirely under the surface, and repeating the observations there.                                   All
the important points regarding the flexible and rigid junction of                                   ice
due to regelation, can in this way be readily investigated.
  It    will   be understood that, in observing the flexible and rigid state
of union,       convex surfaces          of contact    are necessary, so that the contact
may be only at one point.                   If   there be several        places     of contact,

                                     447
apparent rigidity is given to the united mass, though each of the
places  of contact might    be in a flexible and, so to say, adhesive                  con
dition.   It  is not at all difficult to arrange        a convex surface so that,
bearing at two places       only on the sides of a depression, it should
form a flexible joint in one direction, and a rigid attachment in a
direction transverse to the former.
    It might seem at first sight as       if  the flexible adhesion           of the     ice
gave us a point to start from in the         further investigation of the prin
ciple of pressure.     If the application of pressure causes ice to freeze
together, the application of tension might be expected to produce the
contrary effect, and so cause liquidity and separation                 at the flexible
joint.   This, however,    does not necessarily        follow   ;  nor do   I  intend to
consider what might be supposed to take place whilst                     theoretically
contemplating that case.        I  think the       changes    of temperature            and
pressure  are too infinitesimal     to go for anything        ;    and in illustration
of this, will describe the following experiment. Wool is known to
adhere to ice in the manner, as I believe, of regelation.                 Some wool
len thread was boiled in distilled water, so as thoroughly to wet it.
 Some clean ice was broken up small and mixed with water, so as to
produce   a  soft mass, and, being put into           a glass     jar clothed      in flan
nel that it might keep for some hours, had a linear depression                        made
in the surface, so as to form     a little ice-ditch filled with water           ;  in this
depression some filaments of the wetted wool were placed, which,
sinking to the bottom, rested on the ice only with the weight which
they would have being immersed in water ; yet in the course of
two hours these filaments were frozen to the ice. In another case, a
 small loose    ball of the same boiled wool, about half an inch in
diameter,   was put on to a clean piece         of  ice ; that into a glass basin          ;
and the whole wrapped up in flannel and left for twelve                   hours.         At
the end of that time it was found that thawing had been going on,
and that the wool had melted         a  hole in the ice, by the heat conducted
through it to the ice from the air.             The hole was filled with the
water and wool, but at the bottom some fibres of the wool were
frozen to the ice.
   Is this remarkable property peculiar to water, or is it general to
all bodies ? In respect of water it certainly seems to offer us a glimpse
into the joint physical action of many particles, and into the nature
of cohesion in that body when it is changing between the solid and
   vol. x.                                                             2  I

                                                448
   liquid   state.     I  made some experiments on this point            .   Bismuth   was
   melted and kept at a temperature at which                      both solid and liquid
   metal could be present        ;  then rods of bismuth were introduced, but
   when they had acquired the temperature of the mixed mass, no adhe
   sion could be observed          between       them.     By stirring the metal with
   wood, it was easy to break up the solid part into                    small crystalline
   granules    ; but when these were pressed together by wood under the
   surface,   there was not the slightest tendency to cohere, as hail or
   snow would cohere in water.               The   same negative     result was obtained
   with the metals         tin and lead.         Melted nitre appeared at times to
  show traces of the power            ;  but, on the whole,     I   incline to think the
  effects observed       resulted from the circumstance that the solid rods
  experimented with had not acquired throughout the fusing tempera
  ture.    Nitre    is a body which,        like  water,  expands in solidifying    ; and
  it may    possess a certain degree          of this peculiar power.
      Glacial    acetic     acid is not merely without             regelating force, but
  actually presents a contrast to it.               A  bottle containing      five or six
 ounces,     which had remained liquid for many months, was at such a
 temperature that being stirred briskly with a glass rod crystals began
 to form in it      ; these    went on increasing in size and quantity for eight
 or ten hours.         Yet all that time there         was not the slightest trace      of
 adhesion amongst them, even when they were pressed together                        ; and
 as they came to the surface,            the liquid portion tended to withdraw
 from the faces of the crystals           ;  as if there  were a disinclination    of the
 liquid and solid parts to adhere together.
     Many salts      were tried (without much or any expectation),             — crystals
 of them being brought to            bear     against   each other by torsion force,
 in their saturated solutions at common temperatures.                       In this way
the following          bodies were                                 —
                                         experimented with : Nitrates of lead,
potassa, soda; sulphates         of soda,      magnesia,   copper, zinc; alum; borax;
chloride of ammonium ; ferro-prussiate of potassa; carbonate of soda;
acetate    of  lead  ; and tartrate of potassa and soda         ;  but the results with
all were negative.
     My present conclusion therefore is that the property is special for
water    ; and that the view        I   have taken     of its physical    cause does not
appear      to be less likely now than at the beginning of this short
investigation,       and therefore has not sunk in value among the three
explanations given.

                                          449
    Dr. Tyndall      added to one     of his papers*,    a note   of mine " On     ice
of irregular fusibility     "                         for the difference
                               indicating   a cause                          observed
in this respect in different parts of the same piece of ice.                 The view
there taken was strongly confirmed by the effects which occurred in
the jar of water at constant temperature described in the beginning
of the preceding       pages, where, though a thawing process was set up,
it was so slow as not to dissolve         a cubic inch of ice in six or seven
days.      The    blocks retained entirely under water for several               days,
became      so dissected     at the surfaces      as to develope     the mechanical
composition of the masses, and to show that they were composed                      of
parallel layers about the tenth of an inch thick, of greater and lesser
fusibility, which layers appear, from other modes of examination, to
have been horizontal in the ice whilst in the act            of formation.       They
had no relation to the position of the blocks in the water of my ex
periments, or to the direction of gravity, but had              a fixed   position in
relation to each piece of ice.
                       Addendum,         received    April 28.
   The following method of examining            the regelation phenomena above
described     may be acceptable.        Take    a rather large dish of water at
common temperatures.             Prepare some flat cakes or bars of ice, from
half  an inch to an inch thick       ; render the edges round, and the upper
surface of each piece convex,          by holding     it against the inside of a
warm saucepan cover, or in any other way.               When two of these pieces
are put into the water they will float, having perfect freedom of motion,
and yet only the central part of the upper surface will be above the
fluid ;  when, therefore, the pieces touch at their edges, the width of
the water-surface above the place of contact may be two, three, or
four inches, and thus the effect of capillary action be entirely removed.
By placing a plate of clean dry wax or spermaceti upon the top of a
plate of ice, the latter may be entirely submerged, and the tendency
to approximation from capillary action converted into a force of
separation.       When two or more of such floating                pieces   of ice are
brought together by contact at some point under the water, they
adhere    ;  first with an apparently flexible, and then with a rigid adhe
sion.    When five or       six pieces are grouped in a contorted shape, as

                                                                    2  i  2

an S, and one            end piece be moved carefully,                           all will move with it
rigidly     ;   or,   if the   force be enough to break through                           the joint, the
rupture will be with                a    crackling noise, but the pieces will still adhere,
and in an instant become rigid                          again.        As the adhesion is only by
points, the force applied should not be either too powerful or in the
manner of a blow.      I find a piece of paper, a small feather, or a
camel-hair brush applied under the water very convenient for the
purpose.          When the point of                 a   floating, wedge-shaped piece                     of ice is
brought under water against the corner or side                                      of another floating
piece,     it sticks to it like              a leech ;       if,   after   a   moment,   a   paper edge be
brought down upon the place,                        a   very sensible resistance to the rupture
at that place          is   felt.       If the ice       be replaced by like rounded pieces                    of
wood or glass, touching under water, nothing of this kind occurs, nor
any signs of an effect that could by possibility be referred to capillary
action     ;    and finally,        if   two floating pieces of ice have separating forces
attached to them, as                    by   threads connecting them and two light pen
dulums, pulled more or less in opposite directions, then                                     it   will   be seen
with what power the ice                      is   held together at the place                 of regelation,
when the contact there                    is   either in the flexible or rigid condition, by
the velocity and force with which the two pieces will separate when
the adhesion           is   properly and entirely overcome.

           Received         April 26, 1860.
   1   .   Recent experimental investigations, and the reasoning founded
upon them, have elevated the designation of an observed property of
ice to the character of principle in physics.
                                        a     The growth of crystals
of camphor and of iodide of cyanogen, by the deposition of solid
matter upon them from an atmosphere unable to deposit like solid
matter upon the surrounding glass, except at     lower temperature              a                               ;
and that of crystals in solution, the deposition of solid matter upon
                                                        by
them which            is    not deposited               elsewhere          in the solution, have been
adduced          by   Mr. Faraday to illustrate the extension of the principle

                                         451
of action which is manifested in regelation               ; and   " many such like
cases," he remarks,       " may     be produced."         In his reasoning on the
nature of that principle, he also rests on the fact, that ice has the
same property as camphor, sulphur, phosphorus, metals,                     &c, which
cause the deposition     of solid particles upon them from the surrounding
fluid, that would not have been so deposited without the presence of
the previous solid portions*.
     In reflecting   on these indications       of the universality of the       cause,
whatever it may intrinsically be, which is operative in the phenomena
alluded to, it occurred to me that the known fact of the incorpora
tion of two or more plates of glass into one block, presented                 a curious
parallel to the incorporation of two or more slabs or separate portions
of    ice into one mass ; and to determine in what manner these sub
jects were related to each other appeared to deserve careful investi
gation.       Towards this the following suggestions            are offered   : —
     Certain substances,      both elementary and compound,                  appear to
 present,    in what we term the solid state, phenomena corresponding
 to those which are presented          by others in the liquid and solid states
 and the transitions from one to the other collectively regarded, and
 indicating the existence of a condition of matter which may be termed
 arrested    liquidity, but yet    is not, in the most perfect sense, solidity.
 Of    these bodies glass is one.      The fact in question, which exemplifies
 in a striking manner the property here alluded to, appears                     to have
 been first     noticed as a subject of scientific importance by                  MM.
 Pouillet and Clement Desormesf.                 It is the incorporation, into one
 mass, of two or more plates of the kind of glass manufactured for
 mirrors, and called plate-glass, the polished surfaces of which have
 been placed, and have remained for some considerable time, at common
 temperatures, in close contact with each other, the entire area of one
 plate being in contact with the entire area of the contiguous one,
                                                                                  — ex
 tensive mutual surfaces        of contact being thus supplied. Under these
  circumstances, two, three, or four, or even a greater number of plates
  become converted into one block of glass, which it is impossible to

     t  As far as my reading extends, it was first recorded by Pouillet in his
                                                                                    '
  mens de Physique,' liv. vi. ch. ii. 2me e"dit. Paris, 1832, tome iii. p. 41 (Bruxelles,
  1836, p. 292).   In the fourth edition, Paris, 1844, it appears to be omitted, toge
  ther with other and established facts relating both to glass and to metals.

separate into the original plates,              and which may be worked, and even
cut with a diamond, as           if the   whole had originally been a single mass.
In   some specimens        which     I   have examined,            with the surface of         one
plate were incorporated portions of another, the surfaces                          of fracture of
which were alone exposed, its substance                    having been torn through in
the effort to separate the united plates by mechanical force*.                                The
same effect took place in some experiments by Clement Desormes.
     I   assume   it to   be   highly probable that the process by which the
two plates of glass            become one, is, in reality, analogous to that of
regelation in ice, and finally                 dependent on the same                  principles,
whatever their true character may be conceived                              or shall ultimately
be determined to be.               To this it         may be objected, however,               that
there is no evidence, in the case of the glass, of the previous lique
faction,      or even approach            to    liquefaction,       of the      surfaces    which
become united so as entirely to disappear (or, more properly speaking,
to be altogether obliterated),                 and    that the phenomenon is referable
simply to the homogeneous                attraction of the molecules of one plate for
those      of the contiguous        one, the evenness    of the two polished sur
faces allowing them to be                brought within a very minute distance of
one another.         But two remarkable               facts greatly diminish the weight
of this objection,        if,   indeed, they do not entirely remove it.                     First,
unpolished plates of glass have no tendency to unite                           ;   the hard and
compact siliceous film, to which Prof. Faraday, regarding glass
                                                                                               " as
a    solution of different substances                one in another," long ago referred
its power of resisting agents generally                 f,   and which previously bound
together the outer molecules of each plate, must be removed by
grinding and polishing, so as to render the actual surfaces of contact
those      of portions of the       glass      the    chemical nature and condition              of
which are such as          readily to admit of their rapid mutual action and
union into one mass.            Secondly, the polished plates sometimes have the
                                       of straw and other packing-
forms and configurations of the surfaces
materials impressed upon them (portions of straw, paper, &c. some
times adhering inseparably to the glass, after having been taken to

hot climates*),          in consequence                 of the soft nature of the          substance
exposed        by the polishing, or of its nature being such as readily to
soften by a temperature very much below that of the proper fusion,
or    even softening,         of the     glass in its integrity.             The   state   of the in
terior portions of plate of plate-glass appears, therefore, to be similar
                          a
to that of glass in general at certain temperatures much below its
fusing-point, when it presents such remarkable characters of plasticity,
tenacity, and ductility            +.
      Is it possible that      a   lowering of the melting-point of glass, or of the
exposed interior portions                of   it,   by pressure,      is   concerned in the union
of the two plates?                 The       effect     of the    mere     pressure of the atmo
sphere, ensuing upon the exclusion of the air from between the closely
apposed plates, would              of   course be insignificant in depressing the tem
perature of fusion of the glass                     ;   but the pressure occasioned           by the
cohesive force — exerted,               it   will   be remembered, through            a    very small
thickness only of the material, — which finally unites two or more plates
into one block, would probably be adequate                               to any conceivable     effect
of this nature which               can be required for the production                  of the    phe
nomenon observed.
     It   may appear at first sight, that the fact that glass belongs to
that class of bodies which contract on passing from the liquid to the
solid state, and the melting-point of which, therefore, would be ele
vated — not depressed              — by       pressure,     is    opposed to this possibility.
The objection would                be    a    valid one were we now concerned                    with
glass     in   a   crystalline state.           But      we are treating        of that    substance
in its familiar and ordinary condition, into which passes from liqui          it
dity by       continuous gradation of temperature, through equally
               a
continuous states of softness                   into the solid form, like melted phos
phorus and selenium.
 I      am now tempted to ask, in conclusion                          of this part of the        sub
ject, Are all cases of the union of two apparently solid surfaces of
  *    These particular facts were communicated                  to me by Mr. Titc, F.R.S.,who    had
himself observed them.
 t    We are reminded by these facts of the view taken by Person, and adopted by
Prof. Forbes, of the similarity of the liquefaction of ice to that of fatty bodies or
of the metals, " all which in melting pass through intermediate stages of softness
or viscosity;" and Sir          W. Herschcl (Art. " Meteorology," par. 119, Enc.
                               J.   F.
Brit, eighth edit.), when he terms regolation «       sort of welding," appears to
                                                                  a
concur in this view.

                                             454
the same       substance       by cohesive      attraction,        cases     of melting and
regelation, an infinitesimally thin film of liquid being momentarily
produced and as instantly solidified             ?    Will two          surfaces   of perfectly
dry ice, at temperatures much below 32°, but under favourable me
chanical circumstances, unite by mere apposition and pressure (which
ought to follow from Prof. James Thomson's theory), and thus prove
the identity     of the acting principle in the two                cases    of   ice and plate-
glass   ?
    The     negative    of the last question     does not appear to be proved by
the fact cited by Faraday and Tyndall, that dry, hard-frozen snow
has not the property of becoming compacted into a snow-ball.                                      The
cases seem not to be comparable, because the brittleness                            of the con
stituent crystals of snow when in this state, its porous nature as a
whole, and its being consequently pervaded                        by air, will prevent the
required apposition of surfaces.               Nor,    as   I   conceive,     is it proved by
Prof. Tyndall's most instructive experiment of crushing                            a ball    of   ice,
cooled      by carbonic acid and ether, into white and opake hard frag
ments;       for in this also the required apposition of surfaces                            would
be wanting.            Further, it may       be asked, whether this very experi
ment does not demonstrate the limitation                          of the lowering of the
melting- or freezing-point               by pressure   ?    and    if   so, there can be no
tendency to union at 100° below freezing.
    In discussing       the philosophy       of the union of            two surfaces   of    glass,
I   have alluded to the theory               of regelation enunciated by Prof.                     J.
Thomson   ; but         I
                  wish to be understood as not adopting, exclusively,
in these notes, any existing theory on the subject.   Admitting the
operation of cohesive attraction and consequent                          pressure in the first
instance, the phenomenon, with respect                      to glass, readily admits                of
explanation by the original view of                  Mr. Faraday, which                is,   " that
a film      of water must        possess    the property of freezing when placed
between two sets            of icy particles, though        it   will not    be affected by a
single set of particles."            If    we regard the two apposed                 surfaces       of
glass, each consisting          of   a   thin stratum of particles, taken together,
as representing the film             of water, then the other strata of particles
in contact with them respectively, and making up the entire thick
ness     of the plate        on each side,  will correspond to the two sets of
icy particles, the          action of which by freezing the film of water effects
the union of the two portions of ice, and the phenomenon may be

                                          455
 consistently     explained      in the terms of Mr. Faraday's theory.
 And here we seem           to  find points of coincidence between cohesive
 force, as ordinarily considered, the principle of regelation, and that
 particular    view of the former which has been announced by Mr.
 Faraday in accounting for the phenomena presented by and con
 nected   with the latter.
     2.  But  we are led by the preceding facts             and considerations to
 some further inferences,        if  not indeed to a definite hypothesis, upon
 the subject of the molecular constitution or physical nature of glass.
 Mr. Faraday's view of it has been cited already ;                he regards glass,
 it will be remembered, " as a solution of different              substances   one in
 another."      Professor Maskelyne         has suggested      to me, in conversa
 tion, that the physical          nature of glass     most probably nearly re
 sembles    that of a solution of a crystallizable           salt in water, imme
 diately before     crystallizing.       These views are evidently coherent,
and they harmonize with Prof. Graham's, who defines                      glass,   che
mically,    as  "a   mixture of silicates*."         But they all relate to the
varieties of glass in common use, while we are concerned,                 at present,
with the abstract vitreous condition of matter, such as it is repre
sented    by the phosphoric         and boracic acids, probably by the heavy
optical glass of Faraday, by the simple glasses of felspar and peri-
dote obtained by Charles Deville, by the glassy condition of silica,
natural and artificial, and still more perfectly, perhaps, by the glassy
form of sugar.
     Bearing in mind then the homogeneous,               or comparatively homo
geneous,     nature of these glasses,       and considering the uniformity of
texture which the acoustic as well as the optical characters of per
fect glass in general evince, especially when contrasted with that of
    * These views of Mr. Faraday,     Mr. Maskelyne, and Mr. Graham     are confirmed
by the experimental     evidence of the structure of glass obtained by Leydolt, to
whose researches Professor W. II. Miller of Cambridge            had the kindness to
direct me.     By etching the surface of glass, he found it to have a porphyritic
structure, consisting of crystals imbedded in an amorphous substance.         But the
peculiar characters of glass, especially its relations to sound and light, evince, as
indicated in the sequel, that it is not a congeries of ready-formed crystals, though
in all probability crystals will always be found on its surface.      The amorphous
substance recognized by Leydolt will answer, nearly, to what I shall call " simple
glass."   Other facts which he observed are perfectly in harmony with our pre
vious   knowledge   of the dependence of the texture of glass upon the rate of
cooling.   See Coniptcs Rcndus, tome xxxiv. (1852, April 12) p. 565.

                                          456
crystalline    plates in the acoustic researches            of Savart, and how
strongly distinguished that texture is from a crystalline                 texture or
structure, — a    nearer    analogy than that of a solution ready to cry
stallize,  I think, will   be found in the condition        of water   cooled below
the freezing-point      but    still  remaining liquid,       until by    a   tremor,
or the percussive contact of           a solid body, or the mere contact of           a
crystal of ice, its temperature rises to 32° and it becomes ice.                If  so,
glass   will be a substance      in which this state of arrested liquidity, or
potential solidity, is permanent.           And this inference will harmonize
with known facts.         Gregory Watt proved that heat is evolved when
mineral glasses crystallize or become (permanently and truly) solid *.
The preparation of sugar called barley-sugar is the vitreous condi
tion of that body, already taken as a type of simple glass ; while
granular sugar, and more perfectly sugar-candy, exhibit its crystal
line state.     Prof. Graham       has shown that, at a certain temperature,
by mechanical means the former may be converted into the latter,
the temperature quickly           rising 70° on the transition of the sugar
from the glassy to the crystalline state.             This and similar facts in
duced him to refer the peculiar constitution and properties of glass
in general to the permanent retention of            a certain quantity of heat in
a  latent state, which becomes sensible on its crystallization             ;  and this
will   take   place on its being preserved in             a  soft  state  at certain
temperatures.
    There are some remarkable and instructive parallels between the
phenomena of the crystallization             of water, and that of         glass   and
some other bodies.         It  follows from the experiments and inductions
of Gregory Watt already cited, that during the crystallization of
glass a higher temperature must be communicated                     to the interior
than that existing over its surface,           by the evolution of heat at the
points where the crystalline form is assumed, which will be gradually
conducted throughout          the mass.       So that, in the express words          of
Faraday, in relation to ice,
                                     " by   virtue of the solidifying        [crystal
lizing] power at points of contact, the same mass may be freezing and
thawing at the same moment ;" and the
                                                       " freezing   process    in the
inside may be     a thawing process on the outside," and thus contribute
to the slowness     of the cooling, and allow the crystallization therefore
to be the     more perfect.         We here seem to have the explanation
                         * Phil. Trans. 1801, pp. 285-290.

of the well-known                  fact, that in bodies which crystallize from a state
of igneous fusion, the most perfect crystalline                                      state      is produced
when the longest time intervenes between                                    the commencement of
solidification     using that term in its ordinary sense) and the

complete cooling of the melted mass.   The cases cited from Mr.
Faraday at the beginning of this paper, of the growth of crystals
(including those of ice in ice-cold water) in solutions, all have their
exact parallels in the accretion of crystals in cooling melted glass.
"    Crystals of ice,"             Mr. Faraday        observes,     " which could not                  be   colder
than the surrounding fluid, exhibited the phenomena of regelation
                                                                                                                  "
— that     of incorporation into one — " when purposely brought in
                is,
contact with each other."    The same thing happens with melted
glass      slowly cooling, in which                   crystalline      spherules, often forming
spontaneously and independently, continue to form and to increase,
even after the glass has become                        solid as such, by the operation of                         a
principle         in this view analogous to regelation, until the entire mass
has become crystalline*.
     3. No crystalline body has been longer or more extensively subject
to human observation, than crystallized                             water, or ice.               Its natural
history and properties, as science                          has advanced,            have      been investi
gated with increasing generality and precision                              ;   and they have finally
become objects       of that systematic and exact research which charac
terizes     the present era of physical inquiry, — as evinced by the dis-       is
    *   If we   should     prefer to adopt Mr. Maskelyne's suggestion                 in   a   formal      manner,
and     regard        glass as resembling     a     solution about      to      crystallize,     its    analogue,
agreeably       to the preceding        views, will be      a   saturated    solution of        a   salt    in hot
water, allowed           to cool             remaining fluid, until its cohesion
                                     undisturbed,     and                                                        is
affected, when its temperature rises, and the salt crystallizes. Specimens of glass
are common which have the aspect and distribution of parts of       crystallized salt      a
in the mother-liquor; opake crystallized spherules appearing in the midst of                                     a
transparent mass.   To these correspond, among natural glasses, pitchstone and
many examples of porphyritic obsidian, consisting of    vitreous base in which
                                                                             a
crystals have been formed and are imbedded.
   But at the same time the view have taken of the subject, and Mr. Maskelyne's,
                                            I
may be equally tenable    for the state of water remaining liquid at temperatures
                                 ;
below 32°, and that of saline solutions remaining uncrystallized at temperatures
below those of solidification, are evidently                closely analogous.
    Should   I    return to this subject,     I     shall refer to my friend Mr. Sorby's                observa
tions on the nature of glass, which             I     had    not read when these notes were com
municated        to the Royal Society, but which are in entire agreement with Ihc views
I   have suggested.— See Quart. Journ. of Gcol. Soc. vol. xiv. p. 405.

                                            458
cussion on regelation, to which these notes are intended to be sup
plementary.        A most remarkable deficiency, however, still remains,
apparently,      in our knowledge of this substance                : — Water in       the
vitreous condition        — Ice-glass — has        never    been observed.         While
we know the antithetical             vitreous state of so many different cry
stallized substances      — minerals      produced by heat, salts deposited from
aqueous      solution, neutral bodies of organic origin — and have great
reason     to believe    that that antithetical        condition to crystallization
is universal, we have no knowledge of it in relation to water or ice.
My own attention          has been       awake   to the subject, without         success,
for many years.          It  would seem to be scarcely within the bounds of
possibility that the glassy state of water,             if possessing    what we term
solidity, should not, ere now, either have been observed in nature, or
have occurred and been recognized in experimental research*.
     I now   venture to submit the inquiry, Does this apparent deficiency
in our knowledge exist because            — to  use language recently introduced
into physical science — the            homologue    of the glassy state of water is
                                              —
not what we ordinarily term solid because the state of water cooled
below 32° but still liquid is in fact the state which corresponds to
 the vitreous condition of other bodies, and to the physical nature of
 perfect ordinary glass       ?    Is the    one simply a case        of potential soli
 dity, and the other of the confluent or equivalent state of arrested
 liquidity   ?
     It  may be said that the homology which is here endeavoured to be
 established between liquid water below 32° and glass, is a forced one.
 That, in relation to        each other, these are extreme           cases is perfectly
 true   ; but intermediate terms of the series are not wanting, and some
 of them      are supplied by sulphur and phosphorus, and in a remark
 able manner by selenium.               All  these  bodies,   when melted, may be
     * The  crushed fragments of the ball of ice cooled in carbonic acid and ether,
 in Prof. Tyndall's experiment already mentioned, which " remained while and
 opake as those of crushed glass," were still, he informs me, perfectly crystalline,
 resembling fragments of quartz.
     The " points of analogy between the molecular structure of ice and glass "
  noticed by Mr. Drummond        (Phil. Mag., August  1859, S. 4. vol.xviii. pp. 102-103)
  do not involve   the physical    condition of those bodies, but relate merely to the
  resemblance   of one crystallized substance (ice) to another (Reaumur's porcelain),
  and of both to a third body (bottle- and window-glass), which, from its optical
  characters, is inferred— I think inconsequentially — to have assumed a state pre
  paratory  to crystallization.

cooled many degrees below their freezing-points and yet remain fluid.
Sulphur presents,           in its viscid form, an approach to the glassy con
dition    ; but it may be obtained in the crystalline form on passing from
a state     of fusion, and when            cooled  below freezing, instantaneously
crystallizes, like water, by mechanical disturbance.
    In phosphorus         also there is the viscid state       ; and when cooling after
fusion, it passes gradually, like glass, from the liquid to the solid con
dition without crystallizing, though crystals are deposited from some
of its solutions.            Selenium presents        a  state    resembling the viscid
state   of   the preceding substances          ; but when melted, and left to cool,
remains      fluid below its melting-point, and solidifies very gradually in
its amorphous state (in which it has some of the characteristic pro
perties     of glass), and      a thermometer immersed in              it during the cool
ing does not remain stationary at any point, or indicate any tempe

dition for a long time — as common glass does at higher, and as water
and     sulphur will at lower temperatures                ;  but when heated           again,
between a certain temperature and its melting-point                        it becomes cry

temperature, and by its maintenence                  is preserved       in   a soft state, it
does the same.

   The case of vanadic acid strongly resembles that of selenium, but extends this
series of concurrent       phenomena     to a range   of temperatures     nearly approaching
those which govern         the molecular   changes of glass.     It fuses at a red heat, and
crystallizes   on cooling, but remains      fluid below its freezing-point. At the mo
ment solidification commences,         it again becomes red-hot, and remains so as long
as  crystallization continues.
   The crystallization of glass, it has been seen, takes place at a high temperature,
from the ordinary state of solidity, heat being evolved.            So the glassy variety of
gadolinite (like glass, a silicate with a compound base), when its temperature is
elevated above redness, remains solid, but evolves heat (becoming              incandescent),
and crystallizes   ; while the crystalline variety merely fuses and intumesces when
similarly treated.

I. " On the relations between the Elastic Force of Aqueous Vapour,
       at ordinary temperatures, and its Motive Force in producing
       Currents of     Air in Vertical Tubes."        By W. D. Chowne,
       M.D., F.R.C.P.          Communicated by John Bishop, Esq.
       Received March 15, 1860.
                                  (Abstract.)
    In  1853    the author of this communication made a considerable
number of experiments which demonstrated that when a tube, open
at both ends, was placed vertically in the undisturbed atmosphere           of i
a closed   room, there was an upward movement of the air within the
tube of sufficient force to keep an anemometer          of light weight in a
state of constant revolution, though with a variable velocity.             An
                                                                       '
abstract of the results of these experiments was printed in the Pro
           '
ceedings     of the Society for June    1855.
   In order to further investigate the immediate          cause or nature   of
the force which set the machine in motion, the author instituted a
series  of fresh experiments.
   These experiments were made in the room described in the former
communication,       guarded   in   the same   manner against disturbing
causes, and with such extra precautions as     will  be hereafter explained.
The apparatus       used  was  a tube 96 inches long       and 6-75 inches
uniform diameter,      the material zinc.  The upper extremity     was open
to its full extent     ;  at the lower, the aperture was a lateral one
only, into which     a piece of zinc tube 3 inches in diameter, and bent
once at    right angles, was accurately fitted with the outer orifice
upward.       Within this orifice, which was about 5 inches above the
level of the floor, an anemometer, described in the former paper, and
weighing     7 grains, was placed in the horizontal position.         About
midway between the upper and the lower extremity of the tube, a
very delicate differential thermometer was firmly and permanently
fixed, with one bulb outside and the other inside, and the aperture
through which the latter was inserted completely closed.           The   scale
was on the stem      of the outer bulb.
   The results of     a long series  of observations  were recorded.      The
state  of the dry and the wet bulb of the hygrometer, as well as the
indications of the differential thermometer, was noted, in connexion
with the number of revolutions performed per minute by the ane

                                        402
 mometer.       While the differential thermometer indicated the            same
 relative differences    between    the heat of the atmosphere within and
 without the tube, the velocity of the revolutions was found to vary
 considerably.      This variation     was discovered to      be chiefly,  if  not
 wholly,    dependent on the elasticity of vapour, due to the hygro-
 metrical state of the atmosphere, as estimated from the dry- and the
 wet-bulb thermometers, and calculated from the tables of Regnault.
    240 observations were          recorded and afterwards separated          into
 groups, each group comprising those in which the differential ther
 mometer gave the same indication.
    If  in either of   these groups we separate into two classes the cases
 in which the elasticity      was highest, from the cases       in which it   was
 lowest,   and  multiply the mean of each with the corresponding mean
 of the number of the revolutions of the anemometer, their product
 is nearly a constant, thus showing that the velocity of ascent of the
 atmospheric vapour is inversely as its elasticity       ; and hence it follows
 that the velocity of the ascending current in the tube varies inversely
 as the density or elastic force      of the vapour    suspended   in the atmo
 sphere.     This  was rendered evident by the aid          of Tables  appended
 to the paper.
    When the mean elastic         force  of vapour calculated from the dry
 and the wet bulbs is multiplied          by the constant, 13-83, the result
 gives   the whole amount of water in a vertical column of the atmo
 sphere in inches     ;  it follows therefore that when the difference          of
 temperature between the external air and that in the tube, as shown
 by the differential      thermometer,      is constant,   the velocity of the
 current in the tube varies inversely as the weight of the vapour
suspended     in the atmosphere.
    In an Appendix the author         describes   some additional experiments,
made      with the view of ascertaining whether the readings of the
differential thermometer were mainly due to actual changes of tem
perature within the tube, or to extraneous causes acting on the
external bulb.       He found that when the external bulb          was   covered
with woollen cloth or protected by            a  zinc tube   of about  4 inches
diameter     and   6   inches long,     the temperature      of the bulb      was
increased    about 2° on the scale of the instrument,           and that jnrhen
they were removed the prior reading was restored, while the number
of revolutions of the       anemometer       per minute was not appreciably

                                        403
 affected   by the change.      This explains why the readings of the dif
 ferential thermometer varied from 33°-0 to 33°-5 as described                  in the
 paper, without producing a corresponding change in the velocity of
 the anemometer.
     For the purpose of obtaining            a more correct estimate           of the
 influence of a given increase of         heat   within  the tube, the author
 introduced into the tube at its lowest extremity,            a   phial containing
 eight ounces of water at the temperature of 100° Fahr., corked so
 that no vapour could escape.           The result showed that in thirteen
 observations a quantity of heat equal to an increase of one-tenth of
 a degree on the scale of the differential thermometer, was equivalent
 to a mean velocity of the anemometer           of 3-6 revolutions per minute,
 the greatest number being 3-8, the least 3-3 per minute.
    These observations render it still more evident, that               if  a  higher
 temperature within the tube had been the main cause of the revolu
 tions of the anemometer,       the variations in their velocity would not
 have been in such exact       relation to the elastic force          of the atmo
 spheric vapour, as has been shown to be the case.                  They    also lead
 to the inference, that the apparent excess of heat within                  the tube
 alluded to by the author in his Paper read before                  the Society in
  1855 did not really exist, and to the conclusion that,             if such excess
 had been present, the anemometer          would not have been brought to            a
 state  of  rest by depriving    the air of the room of         a   portion    of the
 moisture ordinarily suspended        in it.
 II.   " On   the Relation between Boiling-point          and Composition in
        Organic Compounds."             By Hermann Kopp, Esq. Com
        municated by Dr. Hofmann.                Received March 20, 1860.
                                    (Abstract.)
    The author   was the first to observe   (in 184 1) that, on comparing pairs
of analogous organic compounds, the           same difference      in boiling-point
corresponds frequently to the same difference in composition.                     This
relation between boiling-point and composition, when first pointed
out, was repeatedly denied, but is now generally admitted.                 The con
tinued     experiments of the author, as well as of numerous other
inquirers, have since fixed many boiling-points            which had hitherto
     vol. x.                                                        2 k

                                       464
remained      undetermined,     and  corrected such as had been             inaccu
rately observed.       In the  present paper the author         has collected his
experimental determinations, and has given             a  survey of all the facts
satisfactorily    established up to the present moment regarding the
relations between boiling-point      and composition.
    The    several   propositions   previously announced          by the author
were    :—
     1.  An alcohol, C„H„+s02, differing in composition from ethylic
alcohol (C4H6Oa, boiling at 78° C.) by x CaHa, more or less, boils
x x 19° higher or lower than ethylic alcohol.
    2.   The boiling-point of    an acid,  C„H„04, is 40° higher than that
of the corresponding alcohol, C„H„+2OS.
    3. The boiling-point of a compound ether is 82° higher than the
boiling-point of the isomeric acid, C„H„O<.
    These propositions supply the means of calculating the boiling-
points of all alcohols, C„H„+2 0S        ; of all  acids,  C„H„04     ; of all com
 pound ethers, C„H„04.           The author contrasts the         values  thus cal
 culated for these substances with the available results of direct obser
 vation.     The Table    embraces   eight alcohols, C„H„+SOS, nine acids,
 C„HnC>4, and twenty-three compound ethers,              C„H„04; the calculated
 boiling-points    agree, as a general rule, with those obtained by experi
 ment, as well as two boiling-points         of   one and the same substance
 determined by different observers.         We    are thus justified in assuming
 that the calculated boiling-point of other alcohols, acids,             and ethers
 belonging to this series will also be found to coincide with the results
 of observation.
     The boiling-points of other monatomic alcohols, C„HmO3, other
  monatomic acids,      C„Hm04,     and other compound ethers,            CMHm04,
  are closely allied with the series     previously discussed.          A substance
  containing xC     more or less than the analogous term           of the previous
  class, in which the same number         of oxygen and of hydrogen equiva
  lents is present, boils x X 14°-5 higher or lower         ; or, what amounts to
  the same thing, a difference      of  xll  more or less of hydrogen lowers
  or raises the boiling-point by      ;rx5°.      Thus benzoic acid, CuH0O4,
  boils 8 X 14°.5 higher than propionic acid, CeH,04, or 8 X 5° higher
  than cenanthylic acid, C](H1404 ; cinnamate of ethyl, CaaH1;i04, boils
   10 X 14°-5 higher than butyrate of ethyl, C1aHla0„ or 10 X 5° higher
  than pelargonate of ethyl, C ,.JHaa04.

                                              4G5
   The author compares the boiling-points thus calculated for five
alcohols, C„Hm04; for six acids, C«Hm04; and for sixteen compound
ethers,   C„Hm04, with the results of observation.                     In almost all          cases
the concordance is sufficient.
    The author        demonstrates         in the next place that in many series of
compounds other than those hitherto                      considered, the elementary
difference,    *CaHa, likewise involves          a   difference of x X 19° in the boil
ing-point.  He further shows that on comparing the boiling-points
of the corresponding terms in the several series of homologous sub
stances hitherto considered, many other constant differences in boiling-
point are found to correspond to certain differences                         in composition.
Thus      a   monobasic acid is found to boil 44° higher than its ethyl
compound, and 63° higher than its methyl compound                              ;   and this con
stant relation holds good even for acids other than those previously
examined,       e.   g. for the substitution-products           of   acetic acid.           Also in
substances      which        are not acids, the substitution            of C4H5 or CaH,
for   H, occasionally involves              a depression    of the boiling-points                  re
spectively of 44° and 63°              ;   the relation, however, is by no means
generally observed.
    The author, in addition            to the examples previously quoted, shows
that compounds containing benzoyl (CuH50a) and benzyl (CUH,)
boil 78° (=4 X 14°-5+4 X 5°) higher than the corresponding terms
containing valeryl (C10H„Oa)and amyl (C10Hn), a relation, however,
which is likewise not generally met with. He discusses, moreover,
other coincidences and differences       of boiling-points of compounds
differing in a        like manner in composition. Not in all homologous
series does the elementary difference                 *CaH, involve           a    difference of
XX    19° in boiling-point.            The author       shows    that this difference is
greater for the hydrocarbons,               CH„-8      and C„HB+2        ;   for the acetones
and aldehydes, C„H„02              ;   for the so-called simple and mixed ethers,
C„HB+202         ;   for the chlorides, bromides, and iodides of the alcohol
radicals, CB HB+        1,   and for several other groups        ;   that it       is,   on the con
trary, smaller for the anhydrides of monobasic acids, C„HB-206                                 ;   for
the ethers,      C„HB-208 (which may be formed either by the action of
one molecule       of dibasic acid, C„HB-208, upon two molecules of
                        a                                                                           a
monatomic alcohol, C„HB+202,                   or by the action of two molecules of
a   monobasic acid, C„HB04, upon one molecule of                       a     diatomic alcohol,
C„HB+204),           and several other series.
                                                                           2       k2

                                           166
   The author thinks that          the unequal differences        in boiling-points
corresponding in different homologous series to the elementary differ
ence xCall4t are probably regulated by a more general law, which                 will
be found when the boiling-points            of many    substances   shall have been
determined under pressures           differing from those of the atmosphere.
    " From the observations           at   present   at our   disposal it may be
affirmed as     a   general rule, that in homologous compounds belonging
to the same series, the differences           in boiling-points    are proportional
to the differences        in the formulae.      Exceptions    obtain only in cases
when     terms of a particular       group are rather difficult to prepare,        or
when     the substances       boil at a very high temperature, at which the
observations now at our command are for the most part uncertain.
Again,     it may       be affirmed    that the difference in boiling-points,
corresponding to the elementary difference CaHa, is in                 a great  many
series  =19°      ;  in some series greater, in some series less."
   The author         proceeds to discuss the boiling-points       of isomeric  com
pounds.        He    shows that in a great many cases isomeric compounds
belonging to the same type, and exhibiting the same chemical cha
racter, boil at the same temperature, and that there is no reason why,
for the class of bodies mentioned, this coincidence should not obtain
generally.        On the other hand, different boiling-points           are observed
in isomeric compounds possessing                a different    chemical character,
although belonging to the same type (e. g. acids and compound ethers,
CnIlnOt      ; alcohols and ethers,         CBHB+202),      and in isomeric com
pounds belonging to different types {e.g. allylic alcohol and acetone).
    The author shows that the determination of the boiling-point of a
substance,       together with      an   inquiry into the compounds serially
allied with it by their boiling-points,          constitutes a valuable means      of
fixing the character of the substance,             the type to which it belongs,
and    the series of homologous bodies of which it is a term.                     He
quotes     as   an illustration    eugenic acid.        The boiling-point     of this
acid,   CMHu0,,        is 150°;  and on comparing this boiling-point        with the
boiling-points of benzoic acid,           CuH,0,     (boiling-point    253°), and  of
hydride of salicyl, C,4H604 (boiling-point               196°), it is obvious that
eugenic acid cannot be homologous to benzoic acid, whilst, on the
other hand, it becomes          extremely probable that it is homologous to

    The author, in conclusion, calls attention        to   the importance      of
 considering the chemical character in comparing the boiling-points
of the volatile organic    bases, and shows the necessity      of distinguish
 ing between the primary, secondary, and tertiary monamines in order
 to exhibit  constant differences    of boiling-point for this class of sub
 stances.    He   discusses   the boiling-points of the several bases,
 CRHB-jN and CnHB+3N, and points out how in many                     cases the
 particular class to which     a base  belongs may be ascertained         by the
determination of the boiling-point.
    The comprehensive recognition of definite relations          between com
position and boiling-point is for the present chiefly limited to organic
compounds.       But for the majority of      these compounds, and indeed
 for the most important       ones, this relation   assumes     the form    of  a
 simple   law, which,    more especially for the monatomic             alcohols,
 C„HmO2, for the monobasic acids, C„H,„04, and for the compound
ethers generated     by the union of the two previous classes, is proved
in the   most general manner     ; so much so, indeed,     that in many cases
 the determination of the boiling-point      furnishes most material assist
ance in fixing the true position and character       of  a  compound.
    The author points out more especially that the simplest and             most
 comprehensive relations have been recognized for those              classes   of
organic compounds which have been longest known and most accu
rately investigated, and that even for those classes the generality and
 simplicity of the relation, on account of numerous boiling-points in
correctly observed at an earlier date, appeared in the commencement
doubtful, and could be more fully acknowledged only after a consi
 derable number    of new determinations.        Thus   he considers himself
justified in hoping that also in other classes of compounds, in which
simple and comprehensive relations have not hitherto              been   traced,
 these relations  will become    perceptible as soon as the verification of
the boiling-points    of terms already known, and the examination of
new terms, shall have laid a broader foundation for our conclusions.

not hail, but irregular-shaped pieces of solid ice, of different dimen
sions, up to the size                of half    a   brick.      The squall       was     so heavy that
the topsails were let go.

   The object of these researches is to determine by direct experiment
the law of the density and expansion of steam at all temperatures.
Dumas determined the density of steam at 212° Fahr., but at this
temperature only.      Gay-Lussac and other physicists have deduced
the density at other temperatures by        a theoretical formula true for  a
perfect gas

On the expansion of superheated          steam,   the only experiments are
those of Mr. Siemens, which give       a rate  of expansion extremely high,
and physicists have in this case also        generally assumed the rate of
expansion of a perfect gas.         Experimentalists    have  for some time
questioned the truth of these gaseous formulae in the case of conden
sable  vapours, and have proposed new formulae            derived from the
dynamic theory of heat     ;  but up to the present time no reliable direct

                                      470
experiments have beeu made        tor  determine either of the points -at
issue.   The authors    have sought to supply the want             of data on these
questions by researches on the density of steam upon                a new  and ori
ginal method.
    The general features of this method consist in vaporizing a known
weight of water in a globe of about 70 cubic inches capacity, and
devoid of air, and observing by means of           a
                                                      " saturation gauge " the
exact temperature at which the whole          of the water       is converted into
steam.     The saturation  gauge,   in which the novelty of the experi
ment consists, is essentially a double mercury column balanced upon
one side by the pressure     of the     steam    produced from the weighed
portion of water, and on the other by constantly saturated steam                   of
the same temperature.        Hence when heat is applied the mercury
columns remain at the same level up to the point at which the
weighed portion of water is wholly vaporized              ;  from this point the
columns indicate, by a difference       of level, that the steam in the globe
is superheating   ; for superheated steam increases in pressure at             a far
lower rate than saturated steam for equal increments of temperature.
By continuing the process, and carefully measuring the difference of
level of the columns, data are obtained for estimating the rate of
 expansion of superheated steam.
    The apparatus for experiments        at pressures       of from   15 to 70 lbs.
per square inch, consisted chiefly of       a glass globe      for the reception  of
the weighed portion of water, drawn out into             a  tube about 32 inches
long.    The globe   was enclosed     in a copper boiler, forming a steam-
 bath by which it could be uniformly            heated.        The copper    steam-
 bath was prolonged downwards by a glass tube enclosing the globe
 stem.    To heat this tube uniformly with the steam-bath, an outer
 oil-bath of blown glass was employed, heated like the copper bath by
gas jets.   The temperatures    were observed         by thermometers exposed
 naked in the steam, but corrected for pressure.                The two mercury
 columns forming the saturation gauge were formed in the globe stem,
 and between this and the outer glass tube          ;  so long as the steam        in
 the glass globe continued in a state of saturation, the inner column
in   the globe stem remained stationary, at nearly the same level                 as
 that in the outer tube.     But when, in raising the temperature,               the
 whole of the water in the globe had been evaporated and the steam
 had become     superheated, the pressure         no longer balanced        that in

                                     471
the outer steam-bath, and, in consequence,          the column in the globe
stem    rose, and that   in the outer tube fell, the difference of level
forming a measure of the expansion of the steam.                Observations of
the levels of the columns were made by means of              a  cathetometer at
different temperatures, up to     1 0° or 20° above the saturation point           ;
and the maximum temperature of saturation was, for reasons                   deve
loped by the experiments, deduced from            a point at which the steam
was decidedly superheated.
    The results of the experiments, which in the paper are given in
 detail, show that the density of saturated steam at all temperatures,
 above as well as below 212°, is invariably         greater than that derived
from the gaseous laws.
    The apparatus for the experiments        at pressures below that        of the
atmosphere was considerably modified         ;  and the condition of the steam
was determined by comparing the column              which it supported with
that of a barometer.       The results of      these experiments, reduced        in
 the same way, are extremely consistent.
     As the authors propose to extend their experiments to             steam  of  a
very high pressure,     and to institute a distinct       series  on the law of
 expansion of superheated steam, they have not at present given any
elaborate    generalizations of their results.       The following       formulae,
however, represent the relations of specific volume and pressure                 of
saturated steam,      as determined in their        experiments, with much
exactness.
     Let V  be the specific volume    of saturated   steam, at the pressure      P,
 measured    by a column    of mercury in inches      ; then
                           v"2S'62+ffI
                                                                              <3->
     In regard  to the rate  of expansion of      superheated     steam, the ex
 periments distinctly     show that, for temperatures within            about ten
 degrees   of the saturation point, the    rate  of expansion    greatly exceeds
 that of air, whereas    at   higher temperatures the rate of expansion
 approaches very near that of air.        Thus in experiment          6, in which
 the maximum temperature of saturation is 1740,92, the coefficient of
 expansion between     l74°-92 and 180° is T^-j, or three times that of
 air  ; whereas  between   180° and 200° the coefficient is very nearly the

                                                                       472
                                                                                                                                cases.

from     a                  point several degrees above that of saturation,                                is   -^g, whereas

 heated, the coefficient         of expansion approaches that of               a  perfect gas.
The authors hope that              these experiments may be continued, and that
 the results obtained             at   greatly increased       pressures will prove as
 important as those already arrived at.

I. " On      a new    Method of Approximation             applicable to Elliptic
       and    Ultra-elliptic Functions."        By C. W.     Merrifield, Esq.
       Communicated by the Rev.            H. Moseley, F.R.S.              Received
       March 26, 1860.
                                    (Abstract.)
    I found my method on the known principle,                 that the geometric
mean between        two quantities is also a geometric mean            between     the
arithmetic and harmonic means of those quantities.
    We may therefore approximate to the geometric mean of two quan
tities in this way : —Take their arithmetic and harmonic means ; then
take the arithmetic and harmonic means of those means               ; then of these
last means again, and so on, as far as we please.              If the ratio    of the
original quantities lies within the ratio of          1 : 2, the approximation
proceeds     with extraordinary rapidity,      so that, in obtaining      a fraction
nearly equal to      V 2 by this method,      we obtain a result true to eleven
places   of decimals     at the fourth mean.      I  name this merely to show
the rate of approximation.          The  real application     of the method is to
the integration of functions embracing a radical of the square root.
    Suppose we wish to approximate to the integral of a function                    of
the form     X V Y. The function is a geometrical mean between X and
XY.     If, therefore, we obtain arithmetic and harmonic means to X and
XY, and again to these means, and            so on, it is clear that our function
X V Y will always lie between each           pair of means     of the    series,  the
arithmetic mean being always in excess, and the harmonic always in
defect.      I  now observe,   —
    (1) That if the functions X and XY both increase or both decrease
regularly with the independent variable, the integral of their geometric
mean     will always be intermediate to their integrals, and also to each
pair of the integrals of the derived means.
    (2) That the derived series of arithmetic and harmonic means
contain no radicals, and are therefore integrable by resolution into
partial fractions, and that their integrals involve only logarithms                 or
inverse tangents.
    The last remark indicates that the method has no useful applica
tion to functions of      a simpler class than elliptic functions.       It applies,
however,      to all elliptic and ultra- elliptic functions, and to transcend

                                                   475
ental     functions under a radical.                 The radical must,             however,        not be
higher than the square root                  ;   for, although it be true that               if we   take
the case of inserting two means between two quantities, the geometric
will still lie     between         the arithmetic             and harmonic means,                we have
nothing        to show what the second step of approximation is to be.
     The third arithmetic               mean       is,    in the case of elliptic               integrals,
sufficiently near for working with seven figures.              The resulting for
mula, in the case          of the elliptic integral of the third kind,   far from           is
being simple       ;    but   it  is   practicable, and         it   requires none but the ordi
nary trigonometric             and logarithmicThis complexity      in
                                                              tables.                                is
reality due to the extremely complex character of the function itself,
as   iswell known to every one conversant with its transformations.
My method           becomes         sufficiently simple when applied to complete
elliptic functions of the first kind.
     My own opinion           is   that this method affords as easy an approxi
mation as the nature of the elliptic                           and      ultra-elliptic     integrals, at
least in their general form, admits, — that                          it is   simpler than the use of
Jacobi's functions            6    or Y, and that except in isolated cases, there                         is
no advantage           to be derived from the computation                         of   tables    of such
auxiliary functions, so far             as   the mere computation of elliptic functions
is   concerned.
II. "     On the Lunar Diurnal Variation of Magnetic Declination
          at the       Magnetic          Equator."              By      John Allan Broun,
          F.R.S., Director of the Trevandrum Observatory.                                             Re
          ceived March 28, 1860.
     This variation, first obtained                      by   M. Kreil, next by myself,               and
afterwards         by   General Sabine,            presents several anomalies                  which re
quire careful consideration, and especially                             a    careful examination of
the methods employed to obtain the results.                                 The law obtained       seems
to vary from place to place even in the same hemisphere and in the
same latitude, and this to such an extent, that, for example, when the
moon      is   on the inferior meridian at Toronto                        it   produces    a   minimum
of westerly declination while for the moon on the inferior meridian
                                    ;
of Prague and Makerstoun in Scotland      produces    maximum of  it                   a
westerly declination.                  No two      places have as yet given exactly the

                                                 476
same result        ;    though the result for each place has been confirmed by
the discussion of different periods.
  In order to obtain the lunar diurnal action, it                                   has been usual to
consider the magnetic declination at any time as depending on the
sun's and moon's hour-angles and on irregular                                      causes.        Thus,      if
at conjunction,              H0 be the variation due to the sun on the meridian,
and   A0   be that due to the moon on the meridian,                                     H, the variation
for the sun at lh, A, for the moon on the meridian of lb, and so on                                           ;
it is supposed               that we may represent the variations for                          a series      of
days by the following               expressions, where the nearest values of h to
the whole hour-angles are given                  :   —

     It will          be observed that in these summations there are two assump
 tions      ;    one, that the lunar             diurnal law                 is   constant throughout               the
 lunation, or series of lunations, for which the means are obtained                                                ;   or
 that the quantity              d   in the expressions                       (B)   is    constant.        If    this be
 not exact, then the quantity                       — will              contain the variation due to this
                                                       n
 cause, and depend in part on the lunar hour-angle                                           ;   so that the mean
 (H)        which        is   employed      in   taking the differences                      will eliminate part
 of the lunar action                and partially distort the law.                           The other assump
 tion       is   that the mean solar diurnal variation, represented                                      by   (H0),(n,)
.   . . .   ,    is   nearly constant throughout the period                              ;   for,   if   not, the dif
 ferences due to such changes                           might be sufficient to mask any lunar
 law, the latter having                 a   small range compared with the former.
      Also       it   should be remarked that the means                             ha,   kv &c. are combined
  with the irregular effect                                 .       This     effect, as far as           it

disturbance, we know obeys                     a   solar diurnal law        ;   and       if   independent
of lunar action,                                     of observations might suffice
                            a sufficiently large series
to eliminate          it,   as    combining with and forming part of the regular
solar diurnal variation.                  If, however, the        series    is   not very large             and
the irregular          disturbance considerable compared with the variation
sought,     it   may be desirable to omit or modify the marked irregu
larities.
     As regards the first assumption referred to                                 above,         the results
obtained hitherto seem to show the error to be small, and the only
way to determine its amount will be to consider                                 it       zero in the first
instance, and thereafter                 a   more accurate calculus may be employed.
For the        second       assumption,        it   is   certain that the solar diurnal law
varies considerably in some cases                        within   a   lunation.                At the   mag
netic equator, for example, the law                of magnetic declination inverted             is
within     a   few weeks near            the equinoxes. The attempt to correct the
error due to considerable change                          in the solar diurnal variation                         by
taking the means, as has been done,                           from shorter periods than                          a
lunation,      is    liable to the serious objection that the resulting hourly
means are affected                unequally        by   the lunar action, so that the sums
(A)jtake the form,
where the second                  term in each           expression    is   a       variable.          In    the
discussion to which              I   am about to allude, the following plan has been
followed.            The hourly         means for the following series                    of    weeks were
taken,      namely —
               m4    from 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th weeks of the year.
               ota    „      2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th                   ,,             „
               m,      „     3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th                   „              „
     The    means      of    m,    and   ma   were then taken as normals for the 3rd
or middle week, of                 ma   and m, as normals for the 4th week, and so
on :   these means               were    then employed for the differences from the
corresponding              hourly       observations       of the      weeks         .   to    which    they
belonged.
     With    reference           to the irregular effect,      it
                                                               is      evidently desirable that
we should know in the first instance whether                          it   may not be           a   function
of the lunar,          as well as         of the solar, hour-angle              ;    for this end           it   is

                                                    479
essential    in the first instance                 to obtain the result including                       all the
supposed irregular actions,               and afterwards to eliminate these in the
best manner possible.
   In the discussion of the Makerstoun Observations                                           I   had substi
tuted for certain observations, which gave differences                                   from the mean
beyond      a   fixed limit,     values            derived                by interpolation        from pre
ceding and succeeding observations.                             General Sabine in his discussions
has rejected wholly the observations which exceeded the                                        limit    chosen
by him.   The omission of observations accidentally or intentionally,
and the taking of means without any attempt to supply the omitted
observations by approximate values, require consideration.
  Let     m be the true hourly mean                         for an hour h, derived from the
complete series of n observations                       ;   let m' be the mean derived from
n—   1   observations, one observation                      o   being accidentally lost             ;   then
                             m       nt                             ...
   If,   however, we supply the omitted observation by an interpolation
between the preceding and succeeding observations, and                                        if   the inter
polated value be o+x, we have
                                              ,.        nm+x
                                                                x
                                          m=m           a
                                                                    .

  The comparative errors of                m' and m" are therefore
                                              —m                 x

We may for any         given class    of observation determine the                            mean values
of these errors.
  Example: — At Hobarton,                      in       July            1846,   the mean          barometer
for 3h (Hobarton mean time) was 29 848 in., and the mean differ
ence of an observation at that hour from the mean for the hour was
0-403 in.   ;   if   an observation had been omitted with such                                a   difference,
or for which o— m=0-403 in., we should have an error in the resulting
mean     of ?~=0'016 ;n., an(j the error might                                    have    been twice as
great had the observation            with the               greatest         difference been rejected.
If we now seek        the error of m", where the observation                             is   interpolated,
  vol. x.                                                                                2    L

                                                         -180
we shall find for the same month that the mean value                                             of ras 0-005 in.
                                            r       0-005
nearly     ;   whence    the error          -=•      -hs— =0-0002 in. only, and the error
would never exceed 0-001 in.                          A     similar though less advantageous
result will he found in all classes of hourly ohservations.
     In the      case where ohservntions are rejected which                                      differ from the
mean  for the corresponding hour more than a given quantity, let
                                                         — 1 out of
us suppose, to simplify the question, that the sums of n
n observations for each                    of two         successive             hours are each equal                M,
and that the observations for the same hours of the nth day are
respectively          m'+l and m'+l+x, where                                                      I   is the      limit
beyond which observations are rejected, and x is the excess of the
observation to be omitted. The means retaining all the observations

It    is assumed        that      hi' — m.'=0 (any other hypothesis of variation
would give the same final result), and therefore the error of the
change from the first hour to the second, when all the observations
are retained, is         -   ;   but   if the       observation be rejected,                     the change is

This error, therefore, will                 be greater than the other                          if I   >-x   ; so     that
the error in the resulting change from one hour to the next will be
less by retaining an observation than by rejecting                                         it, if     the difference
from the preceding observation be not greater than the difference
from the hourly mean  that this will most frequently be the case
                                       ;
will     be obvious from the following                        fact   :—At             Makerstoun,           in   1   844,
at   1   A.m. the number of observations which exceeded                                               the monthly
means by         3'   and less than double that, or 6', was 99, while the whole
number which exceeded                      by   more than            6'      was only 16.
     It   will   be evident also that the difference                          /      of   an observation from
the corresponding hourly mean may not be due                                              to irregular           causes,

                                         481
or to causes which affect the changes from one hour to the next in a
perceptible manner, but to gradual and regular daily change.                       If we
examine the daily means most free from irregular or intermittent
disturbance, we shall find that they vary plus or minus of the monthly
mean     ; if the   difference    amounts to       I in  any  case, then    the whole
observations of the day may be rejected though they follow the nor
mal law.        By taking    a  proper value of     I this case may not happen fre-
quently.but cases       like the following will. At Hobarton the daily means
of magnetic declination differ in         some months from the monthly means
by 2'-0 nearly ; as the        limit chosen by General Sabine            is 2,-4,    any
observation in such days differing                by 0'-4 from the normal mean
would be rejected.          The 25th and 26th            days  of March      1844    had
been chosen by me as days free from magnetic disturbance, and fol
lowing the normal law at Makerstoun                    (Mak. Obs.     1844, p. 339),
yet the means of horizontal force for these days differed 0*00064 and
0-00075       from the monthly means            ;  had the former quantity been
the limit, all the observations on these days might have been rejected.
    Altogether it appears to me that the method of rejecting observa
tions beyond certain limits             should     not be employed at all, or           if
employed, only when interpolated observations are substituted                     ;  and
that this interpolation should constitute a second part of the discus
sion, the first including all the observations*.
     These considerations may appear somewhat elementary, but it is
essential     that results which         present such anomalies as the lunar
diurnal variation of magnetic declination should be obtained in a
manner the most free from objection, even though the objections
should touch on quantities of            a second      order compared with those
obtained.
     The discussion of which             I   now proceed to note          the results,
includes all the hourly observations without                exception, made      in the
Trevandrum Observatory (within a degree and a half of the magnetic
equator) during the five years 1854 to 1858 ; the second part of the
 discussion, in which days of great magnetic irregularity have been
    *  I should note here my belief that a peculiarity noticed by General Sabine in
 his discussions   as requiring explanation,  namely, that the excursions of the decli
 nation needle     east and west in the lunar diurnal variation have       very different
 magnitudes,    is due to the rejection  of observations,  while the means by which the
 differences   were obtained   included the rejected quantities.
                                                                       2   l2

                                             482
wholly rejected, not being completed,                I shall reserve the details for     a
more formal         communication         to    the Royal Society.        The     results
obtained are as       follows : —
     1st. At the magnetic equator              the lunar    diurnal  law of magnetic
declination varies with the moon's declination and with the sun's
declination.
    2nd. This variation is so considerable that the attempt to combine
all the observations to form the mean law for the year gives results
that are not true for any period.               Hence evidently the impossibility
of relating the laws at different          places.      The so-called  mean law for
the year at Trevandrum obtained for the moou furthest north, on the
equator going south, furthest south, and on the equator going north,
consists of three maxima and three minima, — a result wholly false,
excepting as an arithmetical operation due to combination                        of   very
different laws.
    3rd. The lunar diurnal lawvaries chiefly with the position of the sun,
the variation being comparatively small with the position of the moon.
    4th.   At the magnetic equator           the range    of the variations is mark
edly greatest      in the months of January, February,                November         and
December, or about perihelion.
    The following results       are derived after grouping the means for differ
ent positions     of the moon in periods of six months, October to March,
and    April to September         ; they are therefore, for the reason given in
the 2nd conclusion, not quite accurate             ; but the change of the law from
month to month will be followed when the details are presented to the
Society.      The following will give a general            idea of the  changes     : —
    5th. When the moon is furthest north.
    a.  About perihelion.           The lunar diurnal law of magnetic declina
tion consists of two maxima* when the moon is near the upper and
lower meridians, the maximum for the latter being much the great
est  ; of the two minima         at intermediate epochs,        that for the setting
moon is the most marked.
    b.  About aphelion.          The law     consists   of two nearly  equal minima
near the upper and lower transits             :  of the two intermediate maxima,
that near the moonset is the most marked.
    c.  Thus the law about the winter solstice is inverted about the
   * The declination    is easterly at Trevandrum, and the maxima       indicate  greater
catterly declination.

                                         483
summer solstice, and the one law passes into the other at the epochs
of  the equinoxes,    exactly as for the solar diurnal variation.
    6th.  For   the moon on the equator going south.
   a. About perihelion.           The lunar     diurnal    law consists      of two
nearly equal maxima near the superior and inferior                transits :  of the
two intermediate minima, the moonset minimum                   is by far the most
marked.
   b. About aphelion.          The law   consists   of two nearly equal minima
near    the superior     and inferior     transits : of the two intermediate
 maxima, that near moonrise is by far the most marked.
   c.  In this   case also the laws for the solstices         are the opposite     of
each other, and the one law passes into the other near the epochs                  of
the equinoxes.
   7th.   For the    moon   furthest south.
   a.   About perihelion.        The lunar diurnal law consists of maxima
near the upper and lower transits, that at the upper transit being by
far the most marked       :  of the intermediate minima, that          near moon-
set is the greater.
   b. About     aphelion.      The law consists of two minima, the most
marked at the inferior transit, the other about three hours before the
superior transit    ; and of two equal       maxima, one near moonrise, the
other near the superior transit, but varying little till 3 hours before
the inferior passage.
   c.  In this instance the inversion is not        so complete as in the other
cases  ; this, it is believed,    will be found to be due to the fact that the
change from one law to the other takes              place after the vernal and
before the autumnal equinox          ; so that in the means for six months,
from which the above conclusions are drawn, the lunations following
the law a are combined with those belonging to b.
   8th. The moon on the equator going north.
   a.  About perihelion.         The lunar diurnal law      consists of two nearly
equal maxima when the moon is near the superior and inferior meri
dians  ;  of the two intermediate minima, that           near moonrise is by far
the most marked.
   b.  About aphelion.         The law   consists   of two minima      at the infe
rior and superior transits      ;  and of two maxima, the greatest at moon-
set, the other between        the meridians   of  1 6h and 21h; between these
points there is an inflexion constituting         a slight minimum,.

                                          484
    c.  In this    case also the opposition      of the laws      is sufficiently   well
marked     ;  the only divergence from opposition being that due to the
minor     minimum        about the meridian of 19h, due, it is believed,               as
noted 7th c, to the partial             combination       of opposite laws in        the
aphelion half-year.
    9th.   It will   be observed    that the variations of the law with refer
ence to the moon's declination          for  any given period        of the year,   con
sists chiefly   in the difference of the relative         values   of the maxima and
minima, the differences of epochs being small .                Thus for perihelion,
the moon furthest north, the principal maximum occurs at the infe
rior   passage   ;  the moon on the equator going south, the two maxima
are    nearly equal    ;   the moon     furthest    south, the maximum          at the
superior passage is by far the greatest           :   on the equator going north,
the two maxima are again nearly equal               ;  and so on for other epochs.
    10th. The moon's action is chiefly,               if not wholly, dependent        on
the position of the sun, or (which is the same thing) on the position
of the earth relatively to the sun ; and the law of the lunar action at
the magnetic equator resembles              in  some      points that for the solar
action at the same epochs.            Thus about aphelion         there is a minimum
of easterly (maximum of westerly) declination produced by the                     lunar
action,   as  well as by the solar action, for these two bodies near                 the
superior meridian         ;  whereas   about perihelion        both actions for the
sun and moon near the superior meridian produce maxima of easterly
declination.        A like analogy holds for             near   the epochs     of   sun
rise and moonrise.

                                      " On   Compound Colours, and on                the
        Relations of the Colours of the Spectrum."                      By  J. Clerk
        Maxwell, Esq.               Communicated by Professor Stokes,
        Sec.   R.S.      Received May 8, 1860.
                                       (Abstract.)
Account      of Experiments      on the Spectrum as seen by the Colour-blind.
    The instrument          used  in  these   observations was similar to that
already described.           By reflecting the light back through the           prisms
by means of         a concave     mirror,   the instrument         is rendered much
shorter and more portable, while the definition                  of the   spectrum     is

                                      485
 rather improved.       The experiments    were  made by two colour-blind
  observers,   one   of whom, however, did not obtain sunlight at the
 time of observation.       The other obtained results, both with cloud-
 light and sun-light, in the way already described.         It  appears   from
 these  observations —
    I. That    any two colours of the spectrum, on opposite sides of the
 line " F," may     be combined in such proportions as to form white.
    II.  That all the colours ou the more refrangible side of F appear
 to the colour-blind    " blue," and all those on the less refrangible side
appear to them of another colour, which they generally speak of as
 "yellow," though the green at E appears to them as good              a repre
sentative    of that colour as any other part of the spectrum.
    III.  That the parts of the spectrum from A to E differ only in
intensity, and not in colour    ; the light being too faint for good experi
ments between       A and D, but not distinguishable in colour from E
reduced to the same intensity.          The  maximum    is about    § from D
towards    E.
    IV.  Between     E and F the colour appears to vary from the pure
"yellow" of E to a "neutral tint" near F, which cannot be distin
guished from white when looked at steadily.
    V. At    F  the blue and the  " yellow "  element of colour are in equi
librium, and at this part of the spectrum the same blindness of the
central spot of the eye is found in the colour-blind           that has been
already observed in the normal eye, so that the brightness of the
spectrum appears decidedly less at       F than on either   side of that line ;
and when      a large portion of the retina is illuminated with the light
of this part of the spectrum, the limbus luteus appears as a dark
spot, moving with the movements of the eye.           The observer has not
yet been able to distinguish Haidinger's
                                               " brushes "   while observing
polarized light of this colour, in which they are very conspicuous to
the author.
    VI.  Between    F and a point  ^
                                     from  F towards G,   the colour appears
to vary from the neutral tint to pure blue, while the brightness in
creases,   and reaches    a  maximum at    f from  F towards G, and then
diminishes towards the more refrangible end of the spectrum, the
purity of the colour being apparently the same throughout.
    VII.  The theory of colour-blind vision being "dichromic," is con
firmed by these experiments, the results of which agree with those

                                                         •186
 obtained           already by normal or
                                                        " triehromic"           eyes, if we suppose the
 "   red
            "    element     of colour eliminated,                  and the     " green " and " blue "
 elements           left as they were, so that the                    " red-making rays,"          though
 dimly visible to the dichromic eye, excite the sensation not                                       of red
 but of green, or as they call  " yellow."        it,
     VIII.  The extreme red ray of the spectrum appears to be suf                                   a
 ficiently good representative of the defective element in the colour
 blind.    When the ordinary eye receives this ray,     experiences the               it
 sensation of which the dichromic eye                           is    incapable    ;     and when the di
 chromic eye receives             it,   the luminous effect                is   probably of the same
 kind as that observed                  by   Helmholtz              in the ultra-violet part of the
 spectrum —           a   sensibility to light, without much appreciation of colour.
     A     set   of observations of coloured                    papers     by the same dichromic
observer was then compared with                           a     set   of observations of         the same
papers           by   the author, and        it   was found —
     1
     .     That the colour-blind observations                        were consistent among them
selves, on the hypothesis                of two          elements      of colour.
     2.    That the colour-blind                  observations were consistent with the
author's observations, on the hypothesis that the two elements                                          of
colour in dichromic vision are identical with two of the three elements
of colour in normal vision.
     3. That the element of colour, by which                                the two types        of vision
differ,    is   a   red, whose relations to vermilion, ultramarine, and emerald-
green are expressed              by   the equation
                             D=l-198V + 0-078U-0-276G,
where      D     is   the defective     element,          and V,       U   and    G     the three colours
named above.

   The region examined                  in
                            this expedition, embraces,   its widest                         in

      The earthquake,     the greatest that has occurred in          Italy  since that
   of  1 783, was felt over nearly the whole          of the Peninsula south of
  Terracina     and Gargano.          Its   area   of greatest    destruction      (the
  meizoseismal    area), within which nearly all the towns were wholly
  demolished, was an oval whose major axis was in a direction                    N.W.
  and S.E. nearly, and ahout 25 geog.               miles in length by        10 geog.
  miles in width.      The first   isoseismal    area beyond this, within which
  buildings were everywhere more or less prostrated and people killed,
  is within    an  oval   of about      60   geog.   miles by 35 geog.          miles   ;
  the second isoseismal       is also   an oval    within which buildings were
  everywhere fissured, but few prostrated and few or no lives lost.
  The third    isoseismal   embraces     a greatly enlarged area, within which
 the earthquake was everywhere perceived by the unassisted                      senses,
 but did not produce injury.               A fourth     isoseismal     was   partially
 traced, within which the shock was capable                 of being perceived by
 instrumental     means,    and which probably reached            beyond Rome to
 the northward.
     The author divides his Report into three parts.                 In the first    he
 has developed the methods of investigation which                   he pursued for
 the purpose of finding the directions of movement of the wave of
 shock at various points, and thence             to determine — 1st.      The point
 upon the earth's surface vertically over the centre             of effort or     focal
point,     whence the earthquake impulse was                 delivered;    2nd,     the
depth below the surface (or rather sea-level) of the focal point itself.
The line passing through both these points he calls the seismic
vertical.     The author points out, that of the three elements of the
earthquake-wave, viz. the velocity of transit, the velocity of the
wave-particle (or wave itself), and the direction of motion at each
point of the seismic         area,   the first alone     in   other   instances    has
hitherto been attempted         to be determined, the velocity          of  the wave
and that of its transit being apparently confounded, and any attempt
at direction confined to the apparent path on the surface.                   He then
shows that every displaced object is in fact            a seismometer,       and that
the displacement of regular bodies, such as buildings or their parts,
may be made, by examination of their conditions after the shock,
and the application       of the principles of dynamics,            to give    precise
information as to the true directions in azimuth and angles of emer
gence at various points       of the   wave, and its velocity at those points.

     The   effects produced, which are mainly available for such                  deter
 minations, he shows are divisible into four great classes                : — 1st. Fis
 sures or fractures produced in buildings,            from whose direction,         &c.
 that of the wave-path at the point may be discovered                   :    under this
 head the author has minutely described and figured the forms and
 peculiarities of fractures produced in all classes of buildings in the
 region examined.         The principles      deduced      being universally appli
 cable, he has shown the choice and precautions, &c. as to those best
 fitted for seismic    observation, and given formulas for the deduction
 of the wave-paths, i.     e.  the direction in which the wave movement at
 the point emerges.        Velocity may also       be   determined from fissures         ;
 but this is more accurately ascertained               from, 2nd, the overthrow
 of  bodies, such as columns, piers, walls,         &c, either fractured at their
 bases   or simply overturned.          3rd. Fractures at the base without
 sensible movement,      or with oscillation within an observed arc short of
 overthrow.       4th. The displacement of bodies by throw or projection,
 such as vases, finials, balustrades, bells, coping-stones, tiling, &c. from
 elevated    points, in which, where the vertical height fallen, and the
 horizontal    range are observed,     the velocity can be determined or the
 direction of the wave-path and the angle of emergence of the wave                      ;
— in    certain cases all of these classes of displacement may occur
 variously combined.          All  these   resolve    themselves    into fracturing
forces,   the movements       of compound pendulums,             and  those     of pro
jectiles  ; and in arranging the formulae           for application,        the author
acknowledges the important assistance rendered                him by his friend the
Rev. S. Haughton, Professor of Geology in the University of Dublin.
    The author      concludes    the first part by       a description of the cha
racteristics of the towns and cities,            buildings,     &c. in the region
examined, of the physical features,          the orographic and surface con
figuration, and the geological structure of the south of Italy as em
braced in his investigation.
    The   second     part embraces     the application       of  these methods       of
investigation, and the complete detail of the observations made by
the author in his journey from point to point, — the working out at
many separate points of the directions of the wave-paths and angles
of  emergence     and wave-velocities,    — the explications of the numerous
and frequently singular and at first apparently perplexing circum
stances,    producing    abrupt changes in the local intensity of seismic

                                       489
effects   observed, — the description generally of the          places     examined
and phenomena observed,          embracing many examples             of   fissures in
earth or rock, falls of rock, landslips, changes of water-courses,                &c,
and the explanation         of their    conditions, — the observations con
tinually    made to correct the magnetic declination             for the observa
tions of wave-path by compass,        — the hypsometric determinations by
the barometer of many points of elevation, — geological sections
over    certain parts of the country examined, — the time observations
obtained for determination of transit velocity.             The descriptions       are
illustrated by numerous sketches made by the author on the spot, by
diagrams and topical maps, and by         a large series of photographs, made
under the author's instructions,        by a photographer who followed in
his track.
    In the appendices to this part the author            has given translations
of all the notices that                            '                    '
                                          in the Giornale Reale (the only
                              appeared
 Neapolitan newspaper), of the events of the shock, with tables of
the meteorology of Naples, from those of the Royal                  Marine Obser
vatory, for certain periods before, during and after the shock                  ; also
 returns of the population,        area,   damage,    deaths     and number         of
 wounded persons in the shaken provinces.
    In the third and concluding part the author colligates all his facts,
 classifies  them, and draws his conclusions and generalizations under
 the following heads    : —
    a.   The superficial    position   of the   seismic   vertical.        This, the
author shows from the independent and concurrent evidence of above
 70 separate wave-paths, was close to the village             of Caggiano,        near
 the   E. extremity of the valley of the Salaris          ;  the evidence        being
 of  a   highly cumulative character,       as the intersection       of two     wave-
 paths only is sufficient to determine this point.
    b.   The depth of the focal point below the             sea-level.      This,  the
 author shows, was about 5 J geographical miles, i. e. the mean focal
 depth.
    c.   The forms and       areas   of the    meizoseismal       and   the several
 isoseismal curves.     These have been laid down by the author upon
 three large maps,        protracted    from    Zannoni's     great map         of the
 kingdom of the Two Sicilies, upon          a scale  of more than half         an inch
 to the geographical mile.
     Of   these, the map      A  shows    the   wave-paths as determined in

                                           4iJ0
 azimuth, and their           close  concurrence at the seismic vertical,        the
 position of all the points of observation, and the axial lines              of the
 great     mountain ranges.         The map B     gives  the physical features of
 the country, and the four first isoseistnal          curves ; distinguishing   the
 injuries     done    to the numerous cities and towns,          &c. by separate
 colours.       Upon both maps the probable horizontal form of the focal
 cavity is marked, which coordinates with the existing lines of dis
 location of the country in         a remarkable manner.        The map C gives
 the whole of the isoseismals         for this earthquake, and compares       them
 with the corresponding seismal curves (so far as these can be obtained
 from the narratives), for a number of the greatest earthquakes on
 record which have occurred in the Italian Peninsula, including that
of    1 783.
    d. The effects of the physical configuration              of the  surface  and
formations beneath,           on the progress of the wave of shock, are dis
cussed,      and the peculiar oval forms and the directions of the major
axes accounted         for.
    e.   The    effects   are pointed out,    of the form and position of the
focal cavity in modifying the distance of transmission of the wave of
given effort in different directions.
   /.    Applies     the results to showing the actual conformity           of the
isoseismal      curves to the principles enunciated.
    g. Under this head the author explains the nature of the separate
system      of wave-paths for Naples City, and the surrounding district,
which only received the shock by transmission of refracted and trans
versal waves passed          through    the Monte St. Angelo range of moun
tains, with entire change of direction.
    A. Colligates the facts ascertained         as to the sounds heard with the
shock at various points round the seismic vertical, and points out the
remarkable relations that the prolongation of the sound more or less
at different points bears         to the direction in length and in depth        of
the focal cavity, and generally the causes of the diversity of sounds
heard at various points around earthquake centres.
    t.   Discusses and points out the nature and correspondence               with
the dynamic laws of wave motions, of the tremors that preceded and
followed the great shock, and generally the causes inducing such in
all earthquakes.
    *. Refers       to the ascertained     phenomena of reiterated or double

                                           491
shock at certain places,             and points out the combinations, having
reference       to surface       configuration    chiefly,        producing     such from     a
single central impulse.
  Under         the section I, the whole of the preceding information                        is
combined, to deduce the dimensions, form and subterraneous position
of the focal cavity, which the author shows to have been a curved
lamellar cavity or fissure of about 3 geographical miles in depth by
9 geographical miles in length, with an inclined vertical section,                          and
a mean focal depth (or depth              of its central point of surface) of 5f
geographical miles below the sea.
     In   section m are discussed,       upon the data of hypogeal increment of
temperature (as supposed to be ascertained from deep mines and arte
sian wells), the necessary temperature of the focal cavity, and the in
tensity of the force that acted within it to produce impulse, assuming
that to have been due to steam at high tension, either suddenly
developed        or suddenly admitted into           a    fissure rapidly enlarged by
rending.
     n.   Deduces the amplitude of the wave and the work stored up in
it on reaching the         surface, and compares         the former with the observed
amplitudes.
     o. Deduces the velocity                        of shock upon the
                                       of transit of the      wave
surface,       from the most trustworthy of the observations of time at
various localities.          These are found to correspond with considerable
exactness,       and give    a    transit rate of between              700   and 800 feet per
second, as that at which             the wave form was propagated from point
to point, differing with change of formation by amounts stated.
     p. Deduces the velocity of the wave itself, i.                     e.   that of the wave
particle, which is shown to have been in round numbers between                               13
and       14   feet per second        (in the direction of the wave-path).                    A
remarkable relation is pointed out between                         this velocity and that
recorded for the earthquake of Riobamba, the greatest whose effects
have been observed.               The height     due to the velocity           of this   wave is
to the altitude of Vesuvius as that due to the velocity recorded of
the Riobamba wave is to the mean height                           of   the volcanic shafts    of
the Andes, and more especially to the height of the volcanic vents
nearest to Riobamba.            The author points out that the direct altitude
of   a volcano        is the true measure of the volcanic and seismic energy
beneath        it,   and not its volume, which           is   a   measure      both of energy
and time combined.

                                         41)2
    Under section      q, he discusses   the facts ascertained by him,          as to
the decay      of the    wave   of shock in relation to superficial distance
from the seismic vertical.           The amplitude of the wave slowly and
slightly increases, and its velocity decreases.            The observations are
not sufficient to admit of certain deduction as to what function of
the distance the law of decay follows.            The lowest velocity       at nearly
30 miles from the seismic vertical was still about           1 l\ feet per second.
    Under r, the author         has discussed systematically the facts ascer
tained as to the local disturbing causes producing              abrupt perturba
tions of the wave of shock, and shown that they are              : —
     1st. Retardation by great fissures        or faults, or deep valleys      of dis
location   ;  the effects of these, at about Muro and Bella, amounting
 almost to sudden extinction of the wave.
    2nd. Alternate        cutting   off and partial      extinction     by parallel
chains of mountains, and the effects of multiplied                  anti- and syn
 clinal-.
    3rd. Increment         and reduplication,      with   or without     change of
 wave-path, by local reflection from mountain masses.
    4th.   Effects    of free-lying     surfaces   (flanks and extremities of
 mountain ranges) and nodal points, and production of intersecting
 secondary     shocks, and sudden reductions of energy by entrance of
 the wave to greatly increased         masses.
    5th. Effects of formation          (geological),    of  change    from     one to
 another, &c.
    6th. Effects of position of towns and cities on plain and hill, rock
 or loose material.
    Towns on steep rock eminences,            such as Saponara, are shown to
 have suffered from an extreme          conjoint velocity, viz. that of the wave
 itself, and that of the hill-top, oscillating as an elastic pendulum.
    Of all   these modifying conditions, external contour           of surface,   and
 more especially the forms and directions, &c. of mountain masses
 and deep fissures,      are shown to be the most        efficient.    The   value is
 shown of contoured maps, models, or other such means of directing
 the mind to the true figure of the country, in seismic researches.
     In the section       *, the author arranges and discusses             the   facts
 observed    by him, as to secondary effects produced by the earthquakes,
 under the heads of —
     I . Earth   fissures and landslips.     These are in directions generally
 more or less transverse         to the wave-paths,     but conform to and are

                                                    493
determined by the dip or slope of the subjacent beds of rock.                            Earth
fissures    are never produced by the direct passsage                       of   the wave      of
shock.       They     are a mere          secondary result, and are no more than
incipient landslips.
     Rock shattering and falls.
     2.
  3. Alterations of water-courses, muddying of springs, &c, all of
which are shown to be due to the secondary effects of landslips into
their     beds, falls     of partially        loose rock therein producing ponding up
and subsequent debacle.
     The total modifying            effects on the earth's surface are shown to be
insignificant.
     No    great sea-wave accompanied this shock                 ;   nor was such possible,
the focal point being inland.                   The author examined with           care more
than 150 miles of sea-coast, as well as river-courses, for evidence                            of
any permanent elevation of land having taken place concurrently
with this earthquake, but found none.                        Earthquakes cannot produce
elevations,     although the latter have been known to have taken place
about the same time as earthquakes and in the same region.
     t.   Discusses       the meteorological phenomena, both during the earth
quake or directly               after   it,    and for   a   prolonged period before           it.
Some remarkable relations are pointed out between the disturbance
of   the annual rainfall previously and the occurrence                    of shocks.
     The physical           conditions         concerned in widely        alleged unusual
meteoric light, diffused over the central portion of the shaken region
at the night         of   the shock, and         of the occurrence of oppressive            heat,
 &c,      are discussed     ;   and under u, the premonitory and other effects on
lower animals, of nausea in men,                   &c,    are considered.
     v. Points     out that the method of investigation pursued, enables
deductions even now to be drawn from ancient fissures,                           &c,   as to the
focal centres of earthquakes occurring at very remote                            periods.      In
map D, the lines of loci of the focal points for the whole of the
Italian peninsula            are,   as far as practicable,           laid down, and their
general       connexion with the seismic bands of the Mediterranean
Basin (as deduced from the British Association Earthquake Cata
logue, and its accompanying Seismological Map of the World)                                     is
pointed out      ;    and some general relations both of the unequal distri
bution of the points of greatest                    energy along these seismic bands,
 and of the unequal evolution of energy at the same points, in long

                                   494
 periods of time, to the common origin of volcanic and seismic          force,
and its nature, are pointed out.
    Some observations    of a practical engineering character are added,
as to the proper construction    of  houses,  &c. in earthquake    countries,
 by which the author is satisfied that the disastrous loss of           life at
intervals recurring might be avoided.          In conclusion, the      author
returns thanks to various individuals for co-operation in the          objects
of his expedition, and most      especially to his friends Dr. Robinson,
 Prof. Haughton, General Sabine, Sir Roderick Murchison,             and Sir
 Charles Lyell.

          Action of Nitrous Acid upon Nitrophenylenediamine.                  By
         A. W. HorMANN, LL.D., F.R.S.              Received   April 5, 1860.
     The experiments of Gottlieb have shown that dinitrophenylamine,
 when boiled with sulphide of ammonium, is converted into a remark
 able base, crystallizing in crimson needles,      generally known as nitra-
 zophenylamine, and for which, in accordance          with the views    I  enter
 tain regarding its constitution,     I  now propose the name Nitrophe
 nylenediamine.      I  owe to the kindness     of Dr. Vincent Hall       a con
 siderable quantity of this substance,      which is not quite easily pro
cured.
     I  have made a few experiments with this compound         in the hope of
obtaining some insight into its molecular constitution.            If, bearing
in mind the numerous analogies between               the radicals ethyl and
phenyl, we assume       that the latter, by the loss of hydrogen, may be
converted into a diatomic molecule, phenylene C„ H4, corresponding
to ethylene, the existence     of  a group   of bases corresponding      to the
ethylene-bases    cannot be doubted.

   With the last-named body        agrees   in composition the compound
known as semibenzidam, or azophenylamine, which Zinin obtained
by exhausting      the action   of sulphide of ammonium on dinitro-
benzol.
   Those chemists, however, who have had an opportunity                   of  be
coming acquainted with the well-defined properties of ethylenedia-
mine, will not be easily persuaded       to consider the uncouth       dinitro-
benzol-product — sometimes appearing in brown          flakes, sometimes     as a
yellow resin, rapidly turning green in contact with the air — as stand
ing to smooth phenylamine in      a relation similar to that which obtains
between    ethylenediamine and ethylamine;          we much      more    readily
admit a relation of this description between         phenylamine and Gott
lieb's crimson-coloured base, in which the clearly pronounced cha
racter of the former is still distinctly visible, although        of necessity
modified by the further substitution         which has taken place in the
radical.

    Does the latter formula really represent the molecular constitution
 of the crimson    needles 1   The   degree    of substitution of this body
 might have been determined by the frequently adopted process                  of
 ethylation.   But   even a simpler and a shorter method appeared to
 present itself in the beautiful mode of substituting nitrogen in the
 place of hydrogen, lately   discovered    by  P. Griess.     The red crystals
 undergo, indeed, the transformation, which he has         already proved for
 so many derivatives    of ammonia, with the      greatest facility.
    On passing   a   current of nitrous acid into      a  moderately concen
 trated solution of the nitrate of the base, the liquid becomes slightly
 warm, and deposits on cooling a considerable quantity of brilliant
 white needles,   the purification  of which    presents   no difficulty   : spa

ringly soluble in cold, readily soluble in boiling water, the new com
pound requires only to be once or twice recrystallized.                 Thus puri
fied,  this substance      forms long prismatic crystals, frequently inter
laced,   white as long as they are in the solution, but assuming a
slightly yellowish tint when dried, and especially when                   exposed  to
 100°  : they are readily soluble both in alcohol        and in ether.           The
new body exhibits a distinctly acid reaction ;       it  dissolves       on applica
tion of a gentle heat in potassa and in ammonia, without, however,
neutralizing the alkaline character of these liquids          ;   it  also dissolves
in the alkaline carbonates,      but without expelling their carbonic acid.
The    new acid fuses at 21 1°     C,   and sublimes at    a   somewhat higher
temperature, with partial decomposition.           The sublimate consists of
 small prismatic crystals.
    Analysis proves this substance to contain
                                   C,H4N40a,
 a formula which is confirmed by the analysis of         a   silver-compound,
                                C8(H3Ag)N4Oa,
 and  of a  potassium-salt,
                                 C8(H3K)N4Oa.
    The   analysis  of the   new compound shows that, under the influence
 of nitrous   acid, nitrophenylenediamine     exchanges      three molecules of
 hydrogen for one molecule of nitrogen, three molecules of water
 being eliminated.

    I do not propose a name for the new compound, which can claim
 but a passing interest, as throwing,       by its formation, some light on
 the constitution     of nitrophenylenediamine.
    The composition of the new acid, and of its      salts, shows that in the
crimson-red base four hydrogen molecules are still capable of re
placement     ; in other words, that this body contains four extra-radical
molecules of hydrogen.          The result of these experiments appears to
confirm the view which, in the commencement of this Note,                     I have
taken of the constitution         of this body  ; at all events, the mutual
relation of the several        bodies is satisfactorily    illustrated        by the
formulae   —

    If the  admissibility of this interpretation        be confirmed by    further
experiments, the reaction discovered by Griess furnishes a new and
valuable method of recognizing the degree of substitution                   in the
derivatives of ammonia.
    The    new acid differs      in many   respects  from the substances      pro
duced from other nitrogenous compounds.                  As  a class,  these sub
stances are remarkable          for the facility with which they are changed
under the influence of acids, and more especially of bases.              The   new
acid exhibits      remarkable       stability; it may    be boiled    with   either
potassa or hydrochloric         acid without undergoing the slightest change.
Even a current of nitrous acid passed into the aqueous or alcoholic
solution is without the least effect.           The latter experiment    appeared
of   some interest   ;  for  if the  action of nitrous acid, in a second phase
of the    process, had assumed the form so frequently observed by Piria
and others, it might have led to the formation of the diatomic nitro-
 phenylene-alcohol, according to the equation
 (C„   [H, (NO,)])''                                          (C6  [H, (N0a)])"1     Q

     It  deserves   to be noticed that nitrophenylenediamine,            although
 derived from two molecules of ammonia, is nevertheless a decidedly
 monacid base.         Gottlieb's analyses of the chloride, nitrate, and sul
 phate left scarcely      a doubt on this point.       However, as some      of  the
 natural bases, quinine for instance, are capable of combining with
 either one or two molecules of acid, I thought it of sufficient interest
 to confirm Gottlieb's        observations by some additional         experiments.
  The crystals deposited        on cooling from a solution     of nitrophenylene
  diamine .in concentrated hydrochloric            acid, were washed      with the
  same liquid and dried in vacuo over lime.

   The dilute solution of this chloride is not precipitated by dichlo-
ride of platinum, nor can the double salt of the two chlorides be
obtained by evaporating the mixed solutions, which, just as Gott

     These experiments prove that, even under the most favourable cir
cumstances,     nitrophenylenediamine             combines only with          1    equiv. of
acid, while the ethylene-derivatives are decidedly diacid.                        The dimi
nution of saturating power in nitrophenylenediamine,                          at the first
glance,   seems somewhat anomalous, but the anomaly disappears                               if
the constitution of the body be more accurately examined.                             It   can
not be doubted that the diminution                of the saturating power          is   due to
the substitution which has taken place in the radical of the diamine.
I    have pointed out at an earlier period          *,   that the basic character of
phenylamine     is   considerably modified by successive                    chauges intro
duced     into the phenyl-radical         by substitution.           Chlorphenylamine,
though less basic than the normal compound, still forms well-defined
salts with the acids      ;    the salts of dichlorphenylamine,              on the other
hand, are so feeble, that, under the influence of boiling water, they
are split into their      constituents    ;   in trichlorphenylamine,              lastly, all
basic characters have entirely disappeared.                    Again, on examining the
nitro-substitutes of phenylamine, we find that even nitrophenylamine
is   an exceedingly weak base, whilst             dinitrophenylamine          is   perfectly
indifferent.    What wonder, then, that             a   molecular system, to which
in the normal condition           we attribute      a   diacid character, should, by
the insertion of special radicals, be reduced to monoacidity                        ?      The
normal phenylenediamine, which remains to be discovered, will doubt-

                                   (Abstract.)
    In the Philosophical Transactions for        the year 1807,    Dr. Brinkley
has investigated an expression         of the general term of the       series  of
Lagrange and Laplace for the finite differences and integrals of any
function u in terms of its differential coefficients         and common inte
grals of successive orders ad infinitum, which is in effect equivalent
to the development of the functions (el— 1 )" and (e' — 1 )-" in powers
of t.    The demonstration of the formulas arrived          at, as there stated,
is circuitous and extremely difficult to follow       ; so much so as to ren
der a simpler and easier one a desideratum in analysis, as there are
probably few who have had the patience to follow it out to its con
clusion.
   More recently (Philosophical      Transactions, 1816), the author of the
present    paper arrived at a general      and extremely simple expression

as /(e*), m which are included, as particular cases, the two functions
treated in Dr. Brinkley's paper.                     In the       case    of   («*— 1)", n being
positive, the development so obtained agreed                               in form with             that
arrived at by Brinkley, and before him by Professor Ivory                                  ;   but in
that of (e*—                 it differs from Brinkley's totally in point of form
(though          affording,    of    course,      the same        numerical results), being
much simpler in expression and far more                              easily reduced to num
bers.       Neither was it at all apparent by what mode of transforma
tion it was possible to pass from one form to the other                            ;   and this has
ever since remained a difficulty.
  The       essential difference between the two forms                     is,   that in the gene
ral coefficient, as expressed              by Brinkley, the progression of terms of
which       it   consists   are multiplied        respectively       by   the successive differ
ences   of    zero,
                             A0*+1,        AS0*+2,        A30'+s,      &c,
which run out in              a    diverging progression to infinity               ;   so that the
number of terms of which the coefficient consists                            is   limited, not by
this progression coming to an end per                      se,   but by relations of another
kind    ;   whereas in the coefficient resulting                  from the other mode of
treatment, the differences              of   zero involved form the progression
                                    AO1,     A30*,               AV,
which terminates per se at its arth term.                         A      theorem subsequently
demonstrated            by   the author of this paper, however, in his                    " Collec
tion of Examples in the Calculus of Finite Differences," affords the
means        of expressing any term in the former progression by                               a   series
of terms belonging                to the latter.        By substituting, then, the             values
so obtained           for   each    of those which occur in Brinkley's                   series, the
transformation in question                 is   accomplished     ;   and the process,          which
has the appearance             of considerable complexity,                is   singularly simpli
fied by the self-annihilation                of all its   most unmanageable             terms.

     In our paper published in the Philosophical Transactions for           185-1,
 we explained the object         of our experiments to ascertain the differ
 ence    of temperature    between     the high- and low-pressure sides       of a
 porous plug through which elastic fluids were forced.             Our experi
 ments were then limited to air and carbonic acid.            With   new appa
 ratus, obtained by an allotment from the Government grant, we have
 been able     to determine the thermal effect with various other elastic
 fluids.     The following is   a brief summary of our principal results at
 a  low temperature (about 7° Cent.)       .

    Further experiments      are being made at high temperatures, which
show, in the gases in which a cooling effect is found, a decrease of
this effect, and an increase of the heating effect in hydrogen.             The
results at present arrived at indicate invariably that a mixture of gases
gives a smaller cooling effect than that deduced from the average              of
the effects of the pure gases.

 IV. " On      the Nature of the       Light emitted by heated Tourma
        line."    By Balfour Stewart,           Esq.,  M.A.      Communicated
        by  J.  P. Gassiot, Esq.        Received     May 22, 1860.
    Some months ago       I  had the honour       of submitting to the Royal
 Society   a paper on the light radiated by heated bodies, in which it
 was endeavoured      to explain the facts recorded by an extension of
 the theory of exchanges.
    Having mentioned the difficulty which          I  had in maintaining        the
 various transparent     substances     at  a  nearly steady     red heat     for a
 sufficient length    of time in experiments demanding             a dark back
 ground, Professor Stokes suggested         an apparatus by means         of which
 this difficulty might be overcome       ; and it is owing to his kindness in
 doing so that     I have   been enabled      to lay these results before       the
 Society.
    The apparatus consists of a thick, spherical, cast-iron bomb, about
5  inches in external and 3 inches in internal diameter — the thickness
 of the shell being therefore      1  inch.    It  has  a cover removeable        at
 pleasure.     There is a small stand in the inside, upon which the sub
stance    under examination is placed, and when so placed it is pre
cisely at the centre of the bomb.           Two small round       holes, opposite
to one another, viz. at the two extremities of a diameter, are bored in
the substance of the shell.       If, therefore, the   substance     placed upon
the stand be transparent, and have parallel surfaces, by placing these
surfaces   so as to front the holes, we are enabled         to see through the
substance,    and consequently through the bomb.             Let the bomb with
the substance     on the stand be heated to       a  good red heat, and then
withdrawn from the fire and allowed to cool.             It  is evident that the
cooling of the substance on the stand will proceed very slowly, as it
is almost completely surrounded with a red-hot enclosure.                It is also
evident that, by placing the bomb in a dark room, we may view the
transparent substance       against a dark background.          By this method
of experimenting, therefore, the difficulty        above   alluded to is over
come.
    Before describing the experiment performed on tourmaline, it may
be well to state what result the theory        of exchanges would       lead us to
expect when this mineral is heated,        and we shall perceive at the same

                                                504
time the importance of the experiment with tourmaline                                        as a test of
the theory.         When     a suitable piece         of tourmaline, with its                   faces cut
parallel to the axis, is used to transmit ordinary light, the light which
it transmits is nearly completely polarized, the plane of polarization
depending on the position of the axis.                     The      reason           of this    is,   that   if
we resolve the incident          light into two portions,                   one      of which    consists
of light polarized in        a   plane perpendicular to the axis                        of the crystal,
and the other of light polarized in                  a   plane parallel to the same axis,
nearly all the latter         is    absorbed, while        a   notable proportion                     of    the
former   is   allowed to pass.
  Suppose now that such                 a   piece   of tourmaline           is   placed in      a   red-hot
enclosure     ;   the theory of exchanges,            when fully carried out, demands
that the light transmitted by the tourmaline, say in                                  a   direction per
pendicular to its surface,              plus the light radiated by the tourmaline
in that direction, plus the small quantity of light reflected by the
surface of the tourmaline in that direction, shall together equal in
quantity and quality that which would have proceeded                                        in the     same
direction from the wall of the enclosure alone, supposing the tour
maline to have been removed.                    Let   us neglect            the small quantity of
light which        is   reflected       from the surface of the tourmaline, and,
standing in front of          it,   analyse with our polariscope the                        light which
proceeds            This light consists of two portions, the trans
              from it.
mitted and the radiated, both of which together ought to be equal
in quality and intensity to that which would reach our polariscope
from the enclosure alone were the tourmaline taken away.                                         But        the
light which would fall on our polariscope from the enclosure alone
would not be polarized              ;   hence the whole body                    of light which             falls
upon    it    from the tourmaline, and which                   is   similar in quality to the
former, ought not to be polarized.                     Now part of this light, or that
which    is   transmitted        by     the tourmaline,        is    polarized          ;   hence     it   fol
lows, in order that the whole be without polarization, that the light
which    is   radiated should be partially polarized in                         a    direction at right
angles to that which          is    transmitted.
  Another way of stating this conclusion                       is    this.           The light which
the tourmaline          radiates     is     equal   to that which               it   absorbs,   and this
equality holds separately for light polarized                                plane parallel to the
                                                                    in in
                                                                        a
axis of the crystal, and for light polarized                                a   plane perpendicular
to the same.

                                      505
   The experiment      was    made    with   a piece   of brown tourmaline
having a few opake streaks, procured from           Mr. Darker of Lambeth.
It  was placed   in a graphite frame between         two circular holes made
as above described in opposite sides of the bomb, the diameter of the
holes being about -l%ths of an inch.         On looking in at one of these
holes you could thus      see  through the tourmaline and the opposite
hole, or, in other words, see'quite through the bomb.             An arrange
ment was also made by which part of the tourmaline might be viewed
with the graphite behind it.
   The apparatus thus prepared was heated to a red or yellow heat
in the fire, placed on a brick in a dark room, and the tourmaline
viewed    by a polariscope which       Mr. Gassiot kindly lent       me.    The
following was the appearance       of  the experiment    :—
    Without the polariscope the transparent parts of the tourmaline
were slightly less radiant than the field around them.               When the
polariscope was used, the light from the transparent portions            of the
tourmaline    was found to vary in intensity as the instrument was
turned round.       No change of intensity could be observed in the
light radiated by the opake streaks of the tourmaline, or by the
graphite.
   The light from the transparent portions was therefore partially
polarized.    The polariscope was then brought to its darkest position,
and a light from behind allowed to pass through               the tourmaline.
The light   was distinctly visible  in this position, but by turning round
the polariscope about 90°       it became eclipsed.         The mean of four
sets  of experiments  made the difference between         the position of dark
ness for the two cases 88^°.          It  appears,  therefore, that the light
radiated by the tourmaline was partially polarized in a plane at right
angles to that which was transmitted         by it.   It  was also ascertained
that the light from the tourmaline which had the graphite behind it
gave no trace   of polarization.

 V. " Researches on the Foraminifera." — Fourth and concluding
        Series.    By W. B. Carpenter, M.D., F.R.S., F.G.S.,
        F.L.S. &c. Received June 14, 1860.
                                  (Abstract.)
    The author in this communication brings to             a conclusion    that
 series  of inquiries into the structural and physiological characters of
 typical forms of Foraminifera, which he had been induced to work
 out for the sake of turning to the account of Zoological science the
 valuable collections made by       Mr. Jukes in the Australian      Seas and
 by  Mr. Cuming in the Philippine.
    The first   genus  now treated of is Polystomella,       the smaller and
 simpler forms of which have long been known, and of which the
 structure, so far as it can be elucidated by the examination         of  such
 specimens,    has been already described with great care and accuracy
 by Professor W. C. Williamson.          But in the comparatively gigantic
 and  highly   developed   Polystomella of the Australian and Philippine
 series, a feature exists    which is scarcely discernible in the humbler
 forms previously     examined   — that feature being the extraordinary
 development of the canal-system.            A spiral canal runs along the
 inner margin of either surface of every whorl; from this canal a
 series  of arches is given off,  of which   one passes down between every
 two adjacent segments, uniting it with the other spiral canal         ; whilst
another set of straight branches passes directly towards the surface
of the shell, through the thick calcareous deposit which covers in the
depressed centre of the spire, and which extends as far as the last-
formed spire.     From the connecting arches, successive pairs of diverg
ing branches proceed at frequent intervals        ; these, in the last whorl,
make their way to the surface         of the shell, and (when the shell is
newly formed) open close       on  either side of the septal band ; though,
as the shell increases in thickness by subsequent deposit, the increased
divergence of the branches separates their mouths from each other              ;
and it very commonly happens that the two contiguous branches
diverging from different arches meet and open by            a  single external
pore half-way between the septal bands.          When    one whorl, however,
has been surrounded by another, this radiating canal-system of the
inner whorl does not usually continue itself directly into that of the
outer (though      such  a  continuation    is not unfrequently    seen),  but

                                            507
  the diverging canals         for the most part terminate in the stolons of
  communication          between    the segments     of  sarcode    that occupy the
  chambers of the outer whorl.
     The   evidence      afforded    by the distribution    of the    canal-system    in
  Polystomella      is decidedly confirmatory       of the   view expressed     by the
  author on     a  former occasion,       that this peculiar set of inosculating
  passages    is related to the formation          and nutrition       of those solid
 calcareous     layers which strengthen and connect the proper walls of
  the chambers,       and to which he has given the designation of the
  " intermediate      skeleton."
     This view    derives strong confirmation from the still more extensive
 distribution and greater importance of the canal-system of Calcarina,
 a genus     of which Mr. Cuming's Philippine collection affords a most
 remarkable series of illustrations.            This type may be considered as
 closely allied to Polystomella          in the disposition and mode of com
 munication of its chambers, save that the spire is generally more or
 less inequilateral.        Its "intermediate      skeleton"    is, however,     much
 more developed        ;  and it extends itself into    a variable number of pro
 longations, sometimes           simply club-shaped, sometimes          more or less
 ramifying, which radiate in different directions from the central body,
giving     it somewhat the appearance             of  a   spur-rowel,     whence its
generic designation.           (An approach to this configuration         is occasion
 ally   presented     by the common Polystomella               crispa,   as   also  by
 some other species         of Polystomella.)      Now the independence of the
 intermediate skeleton and of the spiral system of chambers is curi
 ously shown by the disproportionate development which they respect
ively exhibit the one to the other, and by their occasional                  complete
 disconnexion, — the spire altogether departing from its usual course,
and (as it were) running wild, whilst the intermediate skeleton
with its prolongations still present their ordinary configuration.                 The
nutrition of the intermediate skeleton            seems to be provided for by a
system     of large      canals,  freely inosculating     with each other, which
originate on the sides of the chambers, and are continued through
the whole thickness of the intermediate skeleton, some of them pass
ing directly to its nearest surface, whilst others are continued to the
terminations      of its radiating prolongations.
    It is not a little remarkable that        a Foraminiferous organism should
present itself so extremely resembling the preceding as to be easily

                                                    508
mistaken for         it,   and yet essentially differing from                       it     in its plan        of
structure.       This         is   the case with      a    type of which some remarkable
specimens       occur in            Mr. Cuming's collection, and of which some
smaller examples              have       been   kindly put into the author's hands                          by
Dr.    J. E.   Gray.          As   it   seems to be identical with the body described
by Montfort under the designation Tinoporus                                    baculatus,       it   may be
right to retain that name, although                        it      had been abandoned under
the impression that                it    was    a   mere      synonym of Calearina.                       The
structure of this body will be better understood after the description
of a simpler form, which seems to be generally diffused through the
seas of warmer latitudes, but of which the most remarkable examples
present themselves in Mr. Jukes's Australian dredgings.    Its shape
is   extremely variable, being sometimes                        an almost perfect sphere,                   in
other cases resembling the lower half                         of   a   sugar-loaf, whilst in other
cases again     it   is   a   very irregular depressed cone.                       It seems     originally
to have grown attached to zoophytes, corals,                                 &c,   since   it   frequently
presents       indications of such former attachment, though                                 it   is   rarely
to be met with otherwise than free.                             It     is,   moreover, very closely
allied in structure to the body which has been termed Polytrema
miniaceum,       under the belief that               it   was   a    Polyzoan Coral, but whose
Foraminiferous            affinities have been already perceived by Dr. Gray,
who has proposed for                it   the generic name of Pustulipora.
     In the commencement of its growth, this organism                                      seems closely
to resemble Planorbulina, being formed of an assemblage                                          of    cham
bers arranged on one plane, spirally towards the centre, but irregularly
clustered      towards the circumference                  ;   each chamber communicating
 by   single large septal orifices with the two contiguous chambers of
the same row, whilst its walls are perforated with numerous large
pseudopodian foramina.                     This first-formed            plane, however,           is   after
wards covered-in above and below by numerous successive                                           layers of
similar cells, which are piled one upon another in very regular rows                                        ;
the original spiral type                of growth being altogether lost in                   these super
posed layers.          In this          mode the organism comes to present                            a   near
relationship to the fossil genus Orbitoides*                           ;     the principal difference
being that the superposed                  layers are not so completely differentiated
from the original median layer in Tinoporus as they are in Orbitoides.
 *     See the author's        account     of the structure of that genus in the Quarterly
Journal of the Geological            Society, vol. vi. 1850, p. 32.

Now in Tinoporus baculatus            we often   find columns of solid shell-
substance    interposed between       the angular partitions          of the piles of
superposed      cells, just as they are in Orbitoides,         their summits being
visible on the surface        as projecting    tubercles     ;  these    columns are
perforated with pseudopodian canals, which are extensions                 of the  pores
in the walls of the chambers         over which they lie.          And the peculiar
stellate projections which give to this species so              much the aspect of
a Calcarina      are for the most part formed         of   a   similar growth      ; for
though the chambered structure is continued for a short distance as a
conical protuberance into the base of each, yet this cone is invested
and extended by a sheath         of solid shell-substance, which         is perforated
by pseudopodian tubes extending through it from the chambers.
    The last type of Foraminiferous          structure described in this com
 munication is one which appears          to furnish a    highly interesting link
 of connexion     between   Foraminifera and Sponges.              Its nature was at
 first entirely misunderstood      ;  the specimens     in   Mr. Cuming's collec
 tion having been supposed, not only by         Mr. Cuming, but by other con-
 chologists, to be shells of a sessile Cirripede.           Their external       resem
 blance might readily       justify such   an inference      ;  since they are irre
 gular cones, apparently composed           of distinct     valves,    attached by a
 spreading base to the surface        of shells or corals, and having           a single
 orifice at their apex.      A careful examination of the interior structure,
 however,    makes it evident that the shell is multilocular,              and that it
 is formed upon the type         of the Helicostigue Foraminifera, closely
 resembling Globigerina         in the commencement of its growth ; the
              ' valves '                    of the outer whorl, the chambers
  supposed               being the walls
  of which   are very large, and are partially subdivided by incomplete
  septa.    All the principal chambers communicate by orifices of their
  own with    a  sort of central funnel which leads to the external orifice              ;
  and thus their relation to it is very much that of the separate orifices
  of the chambers of Globigerina to its umbilicus.                The   cavities  of the
  chambers are occupied by          a  spongeous    tissue,     which contains sili
  ceous spicules     ; and although     the possibility that this spongy sub
  stance  may be parasitic       must not be lost sight of, yet reasons               are
  given which seem to render it almost certain that this is the proper
  body of the organism, on which Dr. Gray, who first discerned its
  true affinities, has conferred the generic name of Carpenteria.
     The author concludes with          some general       observations upon the

                                            510
   mutual affinities of the    " typical    forms
                                                   " of Foraminifera whose struc
  ture he has now elucidated        ;   and he sums up the evidence which his
  examination of them has furnished in regard to the very wide range
  of variation which        seems   especially to characterize this group,         —
  avowing his conviction that the only classification of it which can
  approach to     a really natural arrangement, will be one founded upon
  the idea of "descent with modification" as the means by which an
  almost infinite variety of special forms has been evolved from a few
  fundamental types.

     In  accordance     with notice     given at the last Meeting,         the Right
 Honourable       George Augustus,         Earl of Sheffield,     was proposed for

    The following communications             were read  : —
 I. "Experimental         Researches        on various     questions    concerning
        Sensibility."      By E. Brown-Sequard, M.D. Communi
        cated by Dr. Sharpey, Sec. R.S.               Received May 24, 1860.
    The first question      I propose to examine          relates  to the duration
of sensibility in parts of the body completely deprived of the circu
lation of blood.
    This question     has hitherto received but      little attention from phy
siologists.  It  is true that many experiments have been made to ascer
tain how long sensibility remains           in animals in which circulation is
stopped by the application of         a  ligature round the large blood-vessels
of the heart    ;  but  I  do not know        of any special    research   upon the
duration of sensibility in      a nerve      in which there is     a suspension   of

                                       511
circulation.    No doubt it   has been occasionally observed, in experiments
made with the view       of ascertaining what  effects are due to the ligature
of the   aorta, that sensibility persists in the nerves      of the lower limbs
much longer than irritability in the muscles,         but no precise determi
nation has been made of the exact duration of sensibility in such cases,
except,   to  a certain extent, in some experiments of my own and those
of Stannius.       My   researches,  although    giving an indication of. the
duration of sensibility in the lower limbs, had not been made with
the special     view   of elucidating this question, their object being to
decide   whether the vital properties of muscles and nerves could be
restored after having completely disappeared.             The experiments of
Stannius were made with the same view as mine.                 It  may therefore
be said that the subject       of the present  paper is almost entirely new,
at least as regards warm-blooded animals.
    A ligature round the aorta        does not stop circulation        completely
enough to allow any positive conclusion regarding the duration of
sensibility in nerves deprived of circulation of blood.
    Desirous of avoiding the causes of error which exist when the aorta
is tied,  I have proceeded in the following manner         : — I apply    ligatures
on the femoral artery, and after having divided this vessel between
the ligatures,     1 amputate the thigh completely, excepting, however,
that   I leave the two large nerves     of the limb undivided and           as  little
injured as possible.
    In experimenting in this      way,  I find —
    1st.  That the duration of sensibility in the      toes,  in Rabbits,      varies
between twenty and twenty-three minutes.
    2nd. That, in Guinea-pigs, the duration varies between               forty and
fifty minutes.       I have seen sensibility lasting a little       more than an
hour in one case.
    3rd. That, in Dogs, the duration of sensibility               varies   between
thirty and thirty-five minutes.
    It is a very remarkable fact that the duration of sensibility varies
so much in animals so nearly related to each other as Rabbits and
Guinea-pigs.
    The   second question     I propose to examine relates to the influence
of temperature on the duration of sensibility in parts deprived of the
circulation of blood.       It has been erroneously assumed that vital pro
perties last longer in parts submitted to      a  temperature similar to that
    vol. x.                                                        2 N

                                                 512
of the body, than in parts of which the temperature is very much
lowered.         I   have      experimented        on almost completely           amputated
limbs of Guinea-pigs, as in the preceding instances.                        The limbs       were
placed in a vessel dipped into water at different temperatures.                             The
results have been as follows                :—
     1st. Water         at    104°   Fahr.       Duration      of sensibility,    in average
forty-one minutes.
     2nd. Water at 80° Fahr.                  Duration      of sensibility forty-nine mi
nutes.
     3rd. Water at 50° Fahr.                  Duration      of sensibility fifty-three mi
nutes.
     4th. Water at 35° Fahr.                  Duration      of sensibility fifty-eight       mi
nutes.
     These results, which will not surprise persons who know the laws
of the influence of            heat and cold on the vital properties             of the spinal
cord, of motor nerves                 and muscles, clearly             show that the lower
the temperature, the longer sensibility persists in parts deprived of
circulation.
     The third question          I   have tried to solve, is whether an augmentation
in the vital properties of the spinal cord is able to influence the
duration of sensibility in a limb deprived of the circulation of blood.
It   is known that when              a transverse      section is made upon the poste
rior         of the spinal cord in a mammal, and especially in a
          surface
rabbit, all the parts of the body which are behind the section
become much more sensitive                    than they were previous to the opera
tion.       I   have made two series             of experiments to find out        if,   in cases
of this kind, the duration of sensibility in parts deprived of circulation
 would be increased.
     In    one series        of experiments   I    first divide the posterior columns of
 the spinal cord and then amputate all the parts of                         a   hind limb ex
 cept the nerves, while in another series                  I   divide the spinal cord after
 having made the amputation.                      In both     series
                                                                   I     find that sensibility
 lasts notably longer than in animals                  in   which the posterior columns
 have      not been divided.            For    instance,    in rabbits, instead of twenty
 or twenty-two minutes, sensibility lasts thirty or thirty-five minutes                           ;
 and in one case            I   have seen     it   still persisting, though very           weak,
 after thirty-eight minutes             ;I       did not in this instance ascertain          how
                        .
 long     it   lasted

                                                 513
  A very remarkable fact               is that in a rabbit in              which the spinal
cord is in a normal condition,                   and in which the toes, after partial
amputation as in the preceding experiments, are about losing the
last appearance  of sensibility, I find that there is a rapid and
very notable return of this vital property if I divide the posterior
columns of the spinal cord in the dorsal region. These experiments
show that when sensibility seems to be lost in a part deprived of
circulation      ,   it is not completely        so, but that the transmitted excita
tion which causes sensation is too slight to produce                          it,   and that       if    in
its way to the sensorium this excitation meets with                      a   cause      of   increase,
then sensation can be produced by it.
II. " On         Quaternary Cubics."         By the Rev. George Salmon.
          Communicated           by   Arthur Cayley, Esq. Received June
          14, 1860.
                                           (Abstract.)
   In this paper quaternary cubics                   are discussed       under the canonical
form first given by Professor Sylvester,
                              ax, + by, + cz,      +   du,    +   ev,,
where                         x+y+e+u            + v   = 0.
     The writer shows how, when quantics                          are thus expressed              with   a
supernumerary variable,               it   is   possible to form contravariants                      also
expressed with          a   supernumerary variable, and such that for the vari
ables, either         in covariant or contravariant,                we may substitute differ
entials with regard to the variables of the other.      By the help of
this principle, covariants, contravariants, and invariants of the cubic
are formed with great facility.    It proved that quaternary cubic
                                                     is                   a
has five fundamental invariants                  of the   degrees respectively               8,   16, 24,
32, 40, as well as an invariant of                   the degree 100, whose square                    can
be expressed          in terms of the five fundamental invariants.                      The discri
minant      is   also expressed    in terms of the four first of these invariants.
It   is   remarked that in the same manner as the theory of ternary
cubics     is    analogous to the theory of binary quartics, so there are
many analogies between the theory of quaternary cubics and that of
binary quintics.
     Four covariants         are noticed        of the first      degree in the variables, by
the aid of which expressions                for the cubic can be obtained analogous
                                                                              2     n   2

 to  what    M. Hermite       has   called  the     "four types" of binary
 quintics.
    Other covariants of the cubic are discussed,            and   in particular    a
 general expression   is given for that covariant of the 9th order which
 geometrically represents      a surface passing through the twenty-seven
 right lines on the surface    of the third order     represented   by the cubic.
 III. " On the Construction         of  a new  Calorimeter for determining
       the Radiating Powers of Surfaces, and its application to the
       Surfaces of various     Mineral Substances." By W. Hopkins,
       Esq., M.A., F.R.S., &c.            Received June 1, 1860.
                                   (Abstract.)
    When the author's Memoir            on the Conductivity      of various   sub
stances was presented      to the Society, it was intimated to him on the
part of the Council of the Society, that it might be advisable to               de
termine absolute     instead of relative conductivities,         the latter only
having been attempted in his previous experiments.                   It  is partly
in consequence of this intimation, and partly from the desire to make
his former investigations more complete, that the author has given
his attention to the construction of a calorimeter which might serve
for this purpose.     His present memoir contains          a description    of this
instrument,    with the results obtained from its application               to the
surfaces   of various substances.
    The apparatus    used by Messrs. Dulong          and Petit was more deli
cate and complete than the simpler instrument devised by the author
of this paper, but it was calculated only to determine the radiating
powers of substances of which the bulb of a thermometer could be
constructed, or with which it could be delicately coated.               The only
substances    to which, in fact,     it  was applied, were     glass  and silver,
the radiation taking place, in the first case, from the naked bulb of
the thermometer, and, in the second,            from the same bulb coated
with silver paper.      In   these cases, too,    it was the whole heat radi
ating in a given time from the instrument, and not that which radiated
from a given area, that was determined.             For this latter purpose the
apparatus was not well calculated, on account            of the difficulty of ob
taining with accuracy the area of the surface from which radiation
took place.     The instrument      here described     can be easily applied to

                                     515
any plane radiating surface, while the area of that surface can be easily
determined to any required degree of accuracy.             The quantity of
heat radiating under given conditions, from     a   unit of surface in a unit
of time, can thus be easily ascertained.   The paper contains       a detailed
description of the instrument, and of the experiments made with it.
   The following     are experimental results thus obtained, — the        unit
of  heat being that quantity     of heat which would      raise 1000 grs.    of
distilled water  1°  Centigrade.    The formula is that of Dulong and
Petit, where
   6 = temperature of the surrounding medium (the air in             these ex
periments), expressed in Centigrade degrees       ;
   t=   the excess of the temperature of the radiating         surface   above
that of the surrounding medium, in Centigrade degrees           ;
   p=    pressure of the surrounding medium (the atmosphere in these
experiments), expressed by the height of the barometer in metres ;
   a= 1-0077,    a numerical quantity which is always the same for          all
radiating surfaces and surrounding media.
   Then    if Q  denote   the quantity of heat, expressed        numerically,
which radiates    from a unit of surface (a square foot) in a unit of
time (one minute), we have the following results for the substances
specified  : —

    This paper contains the results of the investigation of the               two prin
 cipal hydrocarbons        produced by destructive           distillation of     caout

    This   substance     is an exceedingly volatile          hydrocarbon,       boiling
between 37° and 38°        C.   ;   after repeated    cohobations over sodium, it
was distilled and analysed.             The numbers obtained         as the mean of

    Three of the specimens          were from caoutchouc and two from gutta
percha. The vapour-density was found to be at 58° C. 2- 40. Theory
requires, for C10H8=4 volumes, 2-35.                   The density of the liquid
was 0-6823 at 20°-C.
              Action of Atmospheric Oxygen              upon Isoprene.
    Isoprene, exposed to the air for some months, thickens and acquires
powerful bleaching properties owing to the absorption of ozone.                      On
distilling  the ozonized liquid, a violent reaction takes place between
the ozone and the hydrocarbon.              All the unaltered hydrocarbon        distils
away, and the contents            of the retort suddenly solidify to           a pure,
white, amorphous mass, yielding the annexed result on combustion : —

    We now for the first time        see the relation between the two hydro
 carbons.    It is  the same as between amylene and paramylene.                    The
 author discusses      the boiling-point     of these  bodies,    and shows that
 they form most decided exceptions to Kopp's empirical law.
     Action of Bromine        on Caoutchine and its isomer         Turpentine.
    Caoutchine and turpentine act on bromine in precisely the same
 manner.    One equivalent of the hydrocarbon             decolorizes      four equi
valents of bromine.          To determine this point quantitatively, eight
experiments were made, four with turpentine and four with caout
chine. The quantity of bromine-water employed was 20 cub. cents.

        Conversion      of Turpentine and Caoutchine into Cymole.
   By the alternate action of bromine and sodium on caoutchine or
turpentine, two equivalents of hydrogen are removed, the final result
being cymole, having exactly the odour hitherto considered charac
teristic of the hydrocarbon obtained from oil of cumin, and quite
distinct from that of camphogene.             The liquid   was identified by the
annexed   analyses.       No.   I.  was from turpentine,      II.  and     III.  from

    At the    same time that cymole is formed, there is a production                     of
an oil having the same composition, but boiling about 300°                      C.    The
author has provisionally named it paracymole.
                    Action of Sulphuric Acid            on Caout chine.
    Sulphuric acid acts on caoutchine, converting it almost entirely into
a  viscid fluid like     he.ve.ene,   at the same time a very small quantity           of a
conjugate acid is formed, having the formula
                                        CMH16SaO";
the composition was determined from that of the lime salt, which on
ignition,    &c,    gave a quantity          of sulphate of lime equal to         8-3 per
cent.    of calcium    ;   Cao H"     Ca S' O0 requires 8-5.
     The author considers the action of heat               on caoutchouc to be merely
the disruption of         a  polymeric body into substances            having a simple
relation to the parent hydrocarbon.                  He    deduces  this view from the
similarity     in composition          between     pure caoutchouc,       isoprene,    and
caoutchine.

most valuable means        of saving time   ; the author has therefore appended

     An abstract of     a great part   of  the present   paper has appeared    in
 the 'Proceedings,' vol. viii. p. 556.         To the experiments then adduced
 a  large number have since been added, which have been made by
 whirling thermometers and thermo-electric junctions in the air.            The
 result shows that at high velocities the thermal effect is proportional
 to the square      of the velocity, the rise of temperature of the whirled
 body being evidently that due to the communication of the velocity
 to a constantly renewed film of air. With very small velocities of
 bodies of large surface, the thermal effect was very greatly increased
 by that kind of fluid friction the effect of which on the motion of
 pendulums has been investigated by Professor Stokes.
 VI. " On        the Distribution      of Nerves to the Elementary Fibres
         of Striped Muscle."           By Lionel S. Beale, M.B., F.R.S.,
         Professor of Physiology and of General and Morbid Ana
         tomy in King's College, London, and Physician to King's
         College Hospital.         Received     June 19, 1860.
                                      (Abstract.)
     After alluding to the      general   opinions entertained with respect     to

                                       520
the termination of nerve-fibres in voluntary muscle, and to Kuhne's
recent observations, the author proceeds to state that his researches
have led him to the conclusion that every elementary fibre is abun
dantly supplied with nerves, which form         a network and lie upon the
surface     of the sarcolemma.       They   do not penetrate     through   this
membrane.         The  nerves  never  terminate in points, neither can any
elementary fibres, or any part of       a muscle, be found to which nerves
are not freely distributed.
    The    nerves  run for the most part with the smaller arteries, and
come into very close        relation with the capillary vessels.      The  ele
mentary fibres     of the tongue and diaphragm of the white         mouse are
nearly covered       with  nerve-fibres and capillaries.      Generally,    the
muscular fibres of mammalia and birds receive           a much larger supply
than those of reptiles and fishes.         The muscular fibres of     some   in
sects appear to receive a most abundant supply.
    As the nerve-trunks approach their distribution            the individual
fibres divide and subdivide, as was demonstrated long ago by Wagner.
The fibres resulting from the subdivision often pursue             a very long
 and complicated course by running parallel with other fibres derived
 from different trunks, until, after being traced for some distance,           it
 is not possible to follow them.       Fine trunks composed of from three
 to seven or eight fibres can often be seen traversing the muscle.
 The fibres pursue different directions      ; some dip down between        the
 elementary muscular fibres, some pass and form with others from                a
 different source small compound trunks, while others may be traced
 onwards for some distance         ; the individual   fibres which gradually
  separate from each other being distributed to different parts, in suc
  cession,   of  several  elementary muscular     fibres.   When the     finest
  nerve-fibres can be seen passing round the elementary muscular fibre,
  they clearly consist of very delicate flattened bands.
     Of   the oval bodies or nuclei. — Connected     with all nerves in every
  part of the body, sensitive, motor, vascular, and probably             in all
  animals, are little oval bodies or nuclei, which are the organs by
  which the nerves are brought into the closest relation with other
  textures.     The  nerves   multiply at their distribution by the division
  of  these little  bodies, and upon them their nutrition       and the mani
  festation of the nervous phenomena depend.               A great number is
  associated   with perfection of nervous actions, and vice versd.        They
  are found very freely connected       with the vascular nerves,    are abun

dant on those nerves                  near      the ganglia from which                they proceed,
and in the ganglia themselves.                          These bodies,          with the nuclei of
capillary vessels and those of fat vesicles, and probably other struc
tures with peculiar cells, which alone deserve                              the name,      have been
included under the term                    " areolar     tissue
                                                                              " (Bindegewebe-

korperchen).              As   specimens         are usually prepared, it is quite impos
sible to distinguish             these       structures from each other.                   It    is pro
bable that the gelatinous fibres, or fibres                        of Remak,        are after all real
nerve-fibres, and not             a    peculiar modification               of fibrous    tissue,    as is
now generally believed.
   The    nerves and vessels, and with them,                        of    course,   the oval bodies,
may be stripped off from the elementary muscular fibre.                                        They   are
in close contact with the sarcolemma; and the author has been led to
conclude from some appearances                         he has observed,           that this structure
is really composed              of capillaries and nerve-fibres, with intervening
tissue.
   Of the      manner in which nerves terminate. — The fibres connecting
the oval bodies            or nuclei form with them                   a   network, the branches
of which      are    of   course continuous with the subdivisions                       of the nerve-
fibres. The arrangement of the network, and especially the number
and proximity of the nuclei to each other, differ materially in dif
ferent localities.             On sentient surfaces the                   meshes     are very small
and the nuclei close together                     ;    but from the complexity and great
number of the fibres, from the fact that many fibres which appear
to be single can be resolved into three or four individual                                fibres, and
from the circumstance of the network being imbedded, in most cases,
in the midst of fibrous               tissue,     it   is very difficult to describe           its exact
relations and disposition.                      However,      from the connexions of this
network with the nerve-fibres, it would seem to follow that an im
pression made upon a given portion of a sentient surface might be
transmitted to the nervous centre by contiguous fibres, as well as by
the one which would form, so to say, the shortest route                                    ;   and it is
possible that impulses to motion may be conveyed to muscular fibres
by a more or less circuitous path, as well as by a direct one.
   Of the      so-called tubular membrane.                   — This        is a transparent struc
ture in which the nerve-fibres are imbedded.                                 It   cannot strictly be
called    a   membrane, because                   in many         cases several       fibres    are im
bedded    in   it,   and often        it   is   much thicker than the fibres             it    contains.

                                     522
By examination with high powers (700 diameters), many fibres which
appear to be single when seen by lower powers can be resolved into
three or more, all enclosed    in the same transparent tissue.              As the
nerve-fibres approach their distribution,         this transparent structure
becomes     much spread out.      It  is intimately connected         with nerve-
fibres and capillaries, and with them forms a delicate expansion over
the muscular fibres and in other parts        ;  delicate   fibres also, in con
nexion with the nerves and capillaries, may be observed                in it.   In
some cases this expansion seems to be incorporated with the sarco-
lemma,    and it is probable that in certain instances it is really the
structure which has received that name.
   Axis cylinder and white     substance.   —The     author has been led to
conclude that, in consequence      of the  free division   of the axis cylinder
and white substance near the point of distribution of the nerve, a
single fibre in the trunk of a nerve may carry impressions to or from
a  much larger extent of surface        than is generally supposed.           The
white substance    which surrounds the axis cylinder gradually dimi
nishes, until, in the finer ramifications, it is impossible to say that            a
fibre consists of an axis cylinder and white substance          ;  for its general
appearance    and refractive power are the same in every part, except
where the nuclei are situated.       The author considers that the            defi
nite characters of the axis cylinder and white substance           in the trunks
of the  nerve, may be due to the gradual growth and altered relations
of the fibres which occur during the development of the entire or
ganism.     In the ultimate ramifications the whole fibre          seems to con
sist of a very transparent and perhaps delicately granular substance,
but no tubular membrane, medullary sheath, or axis cylinder can                 be
demonstrated as distinct structures.
    Of  the formation of   new fibres.   — In connexion with the terminal
ramifications,  new   fibres are being continually          developed      by the
division of the nuclei, and old ones undergo removal.               The   remains
of the latter may, however,   be seen in the form       of very   delicate fibres,
in connexion with active nerve-fibres.        The author regards much of
the so-called connective tissue between            the elementary fibres of
muscle and in some other situations, as      of this nature, — as the     remains
of structures   whose    period of functional        activity   was    past,   and
which have been removed,        all but this small quantity of insoluble
material.

    The method of preparing the        specimens    is then briefly described.
Observations were conducted principally           on white mice, which were
injected with     the author's    prussian blue fluid immediately              after
death *.     The paper concludes with         the following     summary of the
most important facts elucidated in the inquiry          : —
    1. That nerve-fibres in muscle and in many other                tissues,  if not
in all, may be traced into, and are directly continuous with, a net
work formed of oval nuclei and intermediate fibres.
    2.  That the organs by which          nerves   are brought       into relation
with other textures, and the agents concerned in the development
of nerves and the formation of        new fibres, are the     little oval bodies
or nuclei which are present in considerable number in the terminal
ramifications of all nerves.      A  great number      of  these bodies is asso
ciated   with exalted nervous action, while, when they               are sparingly
found, we may infer that the nervous phenomena are only imperfectly
manifested.
    3. That every elementary fibre of striped muscle               is abundantly
supplied with nerves, and that the fibres of some muscles receive a
much larger supply than others.
    4. That the nerves lie, with the capillaries, external to, but in close
contact with, the sarcolemma.          They often    cross   the muscular fibre
 at right angles, so that one nerve-fibre may influence a great number
of elementary muscular fibres. There is no             evidence    of their   pene
trating into the interior of the fibre.
    The paper    is illustrated  with drawings, most of them magnified
 700 diameters.

    The influence of cold upon animal life        has been studied chiefly (as
for example in reference      to the phenomena        of hybernation)       at such
 degrees   of temperature only as are insufficient to         freeze the tissues.
 In cases of actual freezing, attention seems for the         most part to have

been directed to the organism as a whole, with a view                                     of determining
the question whether an animal apparently frozen to death                                                could
be revived.           The older writers* often allude to the revival of frozen
insects as a familiar fact.                 Rudolphif         states that frozen Filariae are
brought to life upon thawing.                    Franklin found frozen                         fishes revive
on thawing        ;    yet John Hunter           J    never        succeeded         in restoring the
animals he had frozen.
   One element of uncertainty in such experiments (in those on ver
tebrate animals at least) is the difficulty of making sure that the
heart itself is frozen, without                 interfering          with the expected                  result.
In the experiments of                a later observer,        Dumeril§, it            seems clear that
the    hearts of the frogs he froze and recovered,                                   were          not frozen,
though the intestines were.
  Spallanzani          ||   seems to have been the only one among the older
writers who studied the freezing of muscles                             removed           from the influ
enceof the general blood-current, and that only in                                    an indirect way.
He revived irritability in the muscles of frogs,                                     toads,          and sala
manders,     which, after immersion for several                          hours in snow, had                be
come rigid,           " presque      gelees," and gave no contraction upon being
stimulated.            But    he states that muscles                 frozen by            a    more intense
cold lost their irritability for ever.                       His    means       of stimulation            were
chiefly mechanical.               There seems fair reason                     to suspect that the
muscles     which recovered             their irritability were but partially frozen,
had but partially lost their irritability, and would have exhibited                                      a de
cided contraction when treated by those modifications of the galvanic
stimulus which the modern physiologist has at his command.                                               Spal
lanzani    *J,   in another work, states that frozen snails died.
  Among later writers, the only authority                           I    can find             is   Schiff, who
states**,        "A     sufficiently intense degree of cold will render muscles
rigid, and yet so that they can be revived.                               It    is   not clearly made
out though whether this                is   accompanied by any contraction."                              And

degree    of  heat    which resembles        frost in depriving them of irrita
bility."
     Having myself made some experiments on this subject,               I venture to
lay them before the Society.
     Two methods        were   adopted to freeze the muscles.           In  most  in
stances   I  securely enclosed        them in little bags of thin gutta percha,
and so buried them in a mixture of salt and snow,                   or pounded ice.
At other times I       suspended     them in pure olive oil, contained in a small
vessel surrounded         by the freezing mixture       ;  having previously ascer
tained that immersion for two hours at least in the same oil, at an
ordinary temperature, had no injurious               effect upon muscular     irrita
 bility.
     The results    I  came to were as follows      : —
     1.  Completely      frozen muscles       are not irritable    to the strongest
 stimulus we possess.
     2. Muscles which have been frozen for a short time only (five or
 ten minutes at the longest)             may regain their irritability on being
 thawed.
     3.  Muscles which have been frozen for more than ten minutes
 never regain their       irritability.
     The   loss   of irritability    seems to be due more to the occurrence
 of freezing than to any           mere    fall of temperature.        For although
 the irritability does         diminish    with   the fall of temperature, and
 markedly       so when the freezing-point          of water is     neared,  yet the
 great loss and final extinction takes place only when the tissue itself
  is frozen.
      I know of no method of treating a muscle so as to lower the free
  zing-point of the water contained in its tissue, without so injuring it
  as to render such a procedure useless for the present purpose.
      In order that the irritability of any muscle should wholly disap
  pear, the muscle must be wholly frozen.                 A muscle may be in great
  part frozen, and yet capable           of producing     a  movement when stimu
  lated, by the contraction of the unfrozen part.
      The  passage     into the frozen state is accompanied by no contrac
  tion.    Frogs' limbs freeze exactly in the same position which they
  were previously maintaining ; and when the individual muscles were
   frozen singly,    I  was unable to satisfy myself        of the occurrence of any
   contraction.      Nor could     I  assure  myself of the advent of any physio

                                         526
logical rigidity distinguishable       from the physical frozen state.        The
reaction of frozen muscle, as indicated by litmus paper, is neutral or
faintly alkaline, thus differing from recently dead muscles.
     It  is not the mere rigidity of the frozen muscle which mechanically,
so to speak, prevents contraction, for        irritability does not at once and
fully return upon thawing.           An interval of time may with care be
detected in most cases, during which the muscle is already thawed,
but yet not irritable ; and irritability returns gradually.
    There is no exact relation between the duration of the frozen state
and the duration and amount of the revived irritability.                 It is not
the case that a muscle frozen three minutes regains twice as much
irritability, or remains afterwards irritable twice as long as a muscle
frozen for six minutes.         The frost does not progressively exhaust as
it  were a given store, leaving, according as the operation is shorter or
 longer, more or less residue to be manifested when the muscle is
 thawed.
     The amount of revived irritability will depend in great             measure
 on the treatment the muscles experience when first thawed.                   The
 receipt then of     a slight shock, which afterwards it will bear with im
 punity,     if  not with advantage,     may be sufficient to throw it back
 altogether into death.
     Nor is the present      a case  of mere stoppage     of the wheels of life,
 which,      when once set in motion again,          go  on as well as before.
 Muscles once frozen, however kindly treated, eventually die sooner
 than those left untouched.           There has been in the act of freezing
 a  partial exhaustion of their vital forces.
      I ascertained,   by section,  that muscles which afterwards regained
 their irritability were frozen throughout.            Hence the revival of irri
 tability cannot be supposed to depend upon any part having been left
  unfrozen.       Nor, in  muscles   partially frozen, did the unfrozen parts
  seem to have any influence over the life         of the frozen parts.
      In  muscles which have been well frozen, the fibres are more readily
  separable     from each other, and divisible into fibrillae,     than in those
  which die an ordinary death.          Under the microscope, the fibres are
  clouded and more opake than usual, the transverse              striae generally
  invisible, and in some cases the whole sarcous tissue seems to be con
  verted into     a confused amorphous mass, lying loose in       a  sarcolemma,
  which is more strongly defined than usual.

                                           527
    But   these    histological    appearances     have but little to do        with the
physiological phenomena.             A muscle may        be frozen so as to lose all
irritability, and yet      preserve    its natural appearance.          Two muscles
may be frozen so that both shall scarcely have a fibre that is not
more opake than natural and that has not lost its striae, —both, in short,
shall be affected anatomically, as far           as we can at present        tell, to the
same degree, and yet one          will live and the other is       dead.
    In  muscles     which never regained their irritability, the act of thaw
ing was accompanied by the onset of a peculiar rigor, which differed
from the     " rigor   mortis," and resembled         the  " rigor caloris " in being
an active contraction,       i. e.  in producing      a movement.        The hind leg
of  a frog, when rigor mortis comes on, retains the position it pre
viously had, whether of flexion or extension.                   Powerful       excitation
of the spinal cord or ischial plexus produces                    extreme       extension.
 Plunging into boiling        water   brings the flexed leg to extreme exten
 sion.    If the leg be killed      by frost in   a flexed   condition, it will when
thawed assume gradually the position of extreme extension : so muscles,
 frozen singly, shorten when thawed.                This contraction      is never seen
 in muscles destined to regain their irritability.              I  have seen      it  come
 on in a muscle which         had been frozen for three hours            :   it is   a sure
 sign of death.         This contraction continues after the production of
 the movement         as a peculiar rigidity, which vanishes only when the
 softening from decomposition becomes apparent.
    The   effect   of low temperature on the frog's heart is very peculiar.
 There is    a great    diminution in the rate of rhythm, and very marked
 increase   in the duration of each systole, so that sometimes                  the heart
 is frozen in    a   tetanic beat, as it were.          I have   never    seen a frozen
 heart resume its beat when thawed             ;   but I have     often seen one part
 of the ventricle still beating while another part                  was    frozen quite
 hard.
     Similar results were obtained by freezing the muscles of leeches
 and snails.       Frozen for   a  short time they recovered         their irritability,
 for  a longer time they died.
    In the latter animals, not only         was mere      irritability  recovered,      but
 I have seen snails, which         I had every reason, by examining the state
 of snails of the      same size frozen under exactly the same conditions,
 to believe had been frozen throughout, regain voluntary motion, and
 crawl about with extended           horns  as  if  nothing had happened.             Their

slowly altered blood does not seem to lose its virtues by having               passed
into  a state of  ice.
    In the frog, the return of irritability is favoured by connexion             with
the general circulation.       A frog was secured with its hind legs              in   a
freezing mixture, the brain and spinal cord having been removed.                     In
a few minutes the legs were frozen stiff, and had lost              all irritability.
After being    frozen    half an hour they were thawed.             Irritability     re
turned.
    Nerves, too, like muscles, lose their excitability when frozen,               and,
like them, may regain it on being thawed if they have not                         been
frozen too long.       I have always found a greater       difficulty in     recover
ing nerves than muscles.
    One very curious thing is this,          that, as Eckard        states*,     when
nerves    are frozen, the muscles        to which they are distributed              are
thrown into contractions        ; and yet when muscles           themselves         are
frozen, there is not only no tetanic spasm,          but not necessarily          even
the smallest quivering.
VIII. " On      the alleged Sugar-forming Function               of the Liver."
       By Frederick W. Pavy, M.D. Communicated by Dr.
       Sharpey, Sec. R.S. Received June 21, 1860.

    This communication is         an abridgement      of  a paper       bearing     the
 same title presented      by the author to the Royal Society in                1858,
 with some additional matter, since disclosed by his experimental in
 vestigations.
     He first shows,     by analyses,     that although     the blood collected
 from the right side of the heart after death, as was formerly                  done,
 affords an abundant indication of the presence of sugar, yet that when
 it is removed from the same part by catheterism during life, it is
 found to contain but a trace of the saccharine principle.               Inferences,
 therefore, that have been drawn of the ante-mortem state from post
 mortem examinations must be abandoned as erroneous.
     The heart    excised   instantaneously after sudden killing, contains
 blood as free from sugar as it is during life.

   Very slight       causes are sufficient to determine the presence                             of   a
considerable amount of sugar in the circulation                            during life.           By
simply interfering         with the breathing,           a   strongly diabetic state               of
the urine may be induced in an hour.                         To obtain         a    fair specimen
of blood in its natural condition from the right                           side          of the heart
during      life, the animal must remain in                  a   perfectly tranquil             state
during the performance of catheterism.
   From some recent experiments, it would appear that the blood in
the right side of the heart is not appreciably more saccharine                                  than
the blood in the portal vein.
   As in the      of the blood, the hitherto adopted mode of exami
                  case
nation of the liver has, in the author's opinion, led to a fallacious
inference of its physiological          state.      It   contains      a   material which is
exceedingly susceptible of undergoing transformation into sugar by                                    a
process     of the character of fermentation.                    Acids, alkalies, extreme
cold, and        a heat   sufficient to coagulate            and destroy the ferment,
check this transformation.          And by       it may be shown,
                                                    these agencies
that if the liver contain any sugar at the moment of death, it is
only to the extent of the merest trace. The saccharine state of the
liver, which has been hitherto looked upon as belonging to life, is the
result of a post-mortem change which takes place with an astonishing
rapidity.
   The particular part played by the liver in                       reference            to the point
under consideration, is to form a material which was originally called
the glucogenic substance.           As it is not             considered        by the author
that this material is really        a   sugar-forming substance under physio
logical conditions, he has styled it hepatine, as belonging to the liver.
This    substance    is doubtless intended for a special and important pur
pose in the economy, but what this purpose precisely                               is,   must be left
for the present as an open question.                 As      one   of its properties,           it   is
most susceptible of undergoing transformation into sugar.                                  Although
in contact with      a    ferment, yet   it   resists, under natural circumstances
during      life, this kind of transformation.                     Immediately,             however,
that life   is   destroyed, the ordinary laws of chemistry come into opera
tion, and    a   change     into sugar    is   effected.         Abnormal            states   of the
circulation, and probably of the blood, also lead to                       a   similar produc
tion.     Certain altered states of the nervous system likewise occasion
an extensive       formation of sugar in the system.

   After division of the spinal cord just below the phrenics, the tem
perature falls, and the transformation of hepatine into sugar after death
is so slow, that the process is easily recognized under its true        light.
    In the livers of animals naturally of low temperature, such as the
frog, the oyster, and the mussel, it is a matter of the greatest facility
to show that the organ is free from sugar during life, or at the period
of death.
   The ingestion of starchy and saccharine substances leads to a great
accumulation of hepatine in the liver.         The liver itself becomes also
greatly increased in size.
   The   average weight    of  the liver in eleven dogs fed upon an animal
diet was   ^th that of the animal.        An analysis of   seven  of the livers
gave an average per-centage       of hepatine amounting     to 7. 19.
    Five dogs upon     a vegetable    diet gave an average weight of liver
equal to -j^th that   of the animal.       An analysis of three of the livers
gave an average per-centage       of hepatine amounting     to 1 7.23.
    Four  dogs upon a diet      of animal food with    a large admixture      of
sugar, gave an average weight of liver equal to jgjth of that of the
animal.     An analysis of the four livers gave a per-centage of hepa
tine precipitate amounting to 14. 5.
   Experiments made upon the rabbit confirm these results obtained
upon the dog, showing that saccharine          and amylaceous    materials re
ceived as food are converted by the liver into hepatine.          The author
looks upon this as a strong fact in opposition to the glucogenic
theory.     He  conceives   it to be in the highest degree improbable that
sugar should be transformed into hepatine by the liver for the pur
pose   of coming back    again into sugar in the same organ.
    In the transformation of hepatine into sugar in the liver             after
death,   the average of four analyses gives     a loss of one part and a   half
of hepatine for the production of one part of sugar.
    Hepatine stands in direct opposition to sugar in regard         to its pro
perty of diffusibility.    Its power of diffusion the author has found
to be so low, that it    does not pass at an ordinary pressure        through
animal membranes.         Sugar and hepatine being mixed together and
placed on one side    of  a piece  of bladder in   an endosmotic apparatus,
the sugar diffuses itself and leaves the hepatine behind.           This phy
sical property of hepatine harmonizes with its retention in the hepatic
cells under a natural state     of the circulation.

  Ligature  of the portal vein causes the liver to become strongly
saccharine. The blood also in the system gives a strong reaction of
sugar ; and in one experiment the urine yielded just a traceable indi
cation with the copper solution.  The fact that the blood thus be
comes    saccharine on interrupting                  the flow of blood through           the
portal vein, stands directly             in opposition to the result that might
have been expected             under the glucogenic theory.
  In    a communication presented               to the Royal Society in 1859, it
was shown that            injury to certain parts of the sympathetic                 system
produces most rapidly             a   strongly diabetic state.        It   has since been
found that the introduction of carbonate                 of   soda largely into the      cir
culation altogether prevents this effect.
IX. " A       new Ozone-box and Test-slips."                    By B.      J. Lowe,    Esq.,
        F.R.A.S., F.L.S. &c.               Communicated by John Lee,                 LL.D.
        Received      April 16, 1860.
  The ordinary form of Ozone-box being very cumbersome, the pre
sent one has been contrived to supersede it*. The box is simple in
construction, small in size, and cylindrical in form                   ;   the chamber in
which the test-slips are hung is perfectly dark, and at the same time
there is     a   constant current of air circulating            through      it,   no matter
from what quarter of the compass                     the wind    is   blowing.      The air
either passes in at the lower portion of the box and travels round                         a
circular chamber twice, until    reaches the centre (where the test-
                                          it
slips are hung) and then out again at the upper portion of the box
in the same circular manner, or in at the top and out again                           at the
bottom of the box.
  Fig.   1   represents    a   section of the upper portion of the box, showing
                   Fig.   I.                                     Fig. 2.

the manner         in which the air enters and moves along to the centre
chamber (where the test-slip is hung at A), and figure 2 represents
a section    of the lower half of the box where the air circulates in the
opposite direction, leaving the box on the side opposite to that on
which it had entered.
   The box      has been tested and found to work well.
   On three different          dates, when there was much ozone, test-slips were
hung in one box, whilst others were hung in another which had the
two entrances        sealed up      in order that no current of air should pass
through    ;   the result was satisfactory, viz. : —

   The ozone-box          is capable     of being   suspended  at an elevation above
the ground       ;  and this appears to be a great advantage,           because eleva
tion seems necessary in order to get                 a proper current of air to pass
across the test-slips        ;  indeed as an instance it may be mentioned, that
at an elevation        of  20 feet there is almost always more indication              of
ozone than at 5 feet.
   The plan adopted              here is to suspend the box to a -T- support, it
being drawn up to its proper place by means of                    a thin rope passing
over a pulley ; and there is less trouble                in examining and changing
the test-slips in this manner than there was in the old method.
   The box,        as described,       is made by Messrs. Negretti        and Zambra
of Hatton Garden.
   It  has been        urged that        a  box was scarcely necessary       for ozone
test-slips   ;  but as the papers fade on exposure               to light, it must be

                                                   533
evident that in order to register the maximum amount of ozone                                                 a
dark box is required.
  Test-slips.   — Paper-slips being                  so fragile,           I have    substituted others
made   of calico.          The calico          is to all intents and purposes chemically

 X. " On the Temperature of the Flowers and Leaves of Plants."
        By E. J. Lowe, Esq., F.R.A.S., F.L.S. &c.                     Communicated
        by Thomas        Bell,       Esq., P.L.S., V.P.R.S. &c.                 Received
       April 16, 1860.
                                       (Abstract.)
    The present observations          were made in order to ascertain whether
different plants and flowers influence the temperature of the air
immediately over them.              The author       was induced to undertake the
inquiry from what he had noticed whilst making observations on the
fall-cloud, or white mist of the valley, as it is usually called.
   In the autumn of           1858     it  was    repeatedly noticed that vapour
formed first over those fields from which hay had been gathered in
the summer, and which were covered with a good crop                     of after-math.

                                               535
The mists then gradually formed over                   the shorter grass     of the   pasture
fields, yet, unless when the fog was very thick, it never formed over
stubble fields           (i.   e. where corn had grown).         It was   further observed,
that at times when undrained or imperfectly-drained                        ploughed fields
had this mist, those that were better drained were free from vapour                           ;
moreover,        the furrows or low places of               a   field were the spots on
which fogs first formed.
    Hedges, on the contrary, seem to have                       a   repulsive influence on
fogs   ;   the author has seen          a   field in which the mist rose higher than
the hedges,          but did not flow over or even touch them, but at length
poured out through the gateway in                  a   long dense column.
    These peculiarities seemed to be owing either to the different tem
peratures of different trees and vegetables,                    or of the soils on which
they grew, or perhaps to both.                    To determine this, the author           has
tested as carefully as possible the temperature                       of various flowers     in
comparison with that of grass, as well as that of different soils                     ;   imi
tating artificially the conditions of drained and undrained fields, so
that the observations might be made close together, and therefore
better comparable with each other.                      In this latter     series, which      is
not yet completed, and does not form part of the present                               paper,
daily records are made of the greatest heat and cold on the surface
of soils,    sand,        gravel, clay,     &c,   as well as above the ground,            and
from   2    to   8   inches below the surface.
    The thermometers employed                  were constructed by Messrs. Negretti                •
and Zambra           ;   they are self-registering, and entirely of glass        ;    the de
grees being engraved on the tube, and rendered more distinctly visible
 by   means      of      enamel at the back.         Some   of the instruments         are    of
very small size, in order that they may be placed within the tubes of
certain flowers.
    All    the observations were carried on                 by      myself at the Beeston
Observatory.
    At first the thermometers               were placed over the growing plant, and
afterwards the flowers and leaves were arranged in bottles of water,
and either exposed                 to full sunshine, or placed in the shade,                 the
bottles being sunk in the ground to the level of the grass, filled with
a   bunch of flowers, and the thermometers placed immediately over
them.
    With regard                to the readings on the grass          and on the common

                                    536
Daisy (Bellis perennis), it should be mentioned that a portion of the
grass was selected where a large group of daisies were fully in bloom,
and within a foot of this another space where every daisy was care
fully cut off from    a circle of  12 inches, in the centre          of which    a
second thermometer was placed on the grass, so that these records are
very conclusive as regards the growing plant.
   Bearing upon this subject, it is proper to state, from a series of
experiments with thermometers placed in full sunshine on the grass,
and at 4 feet above the grass,    that in winter the temperature on the
grass is always lower than at 4 feet, whilst          in summer the        reverse
takes place,  the thermometers reading almost alike for a short time
in spring and autumn.       To this circumstance may          be attributed the
less striking  results in hot weather, especially where the difference
between the grass and a flower is only from 1° to 2°.
   Tables stating the details of the observations, which extended from
February 26 to September 19, 1859, and from the 22nd to the 27th
of March, 1860,     are given  in the paper.        The author subjoins        the
following as the principal results     : —
   Great differences    occur from time to time in the temperature of
plants, and much depends upon the meteorology of the day, the dif
ferences   being usually greater with a cloudless sky than with one
which is loaded with cloud.       The time of day        seems also to operate
on some plants to a great degree     ;   as an instance,    the Erica herbacea,
which between     1 and 2 p.m. had shown a warmth              of above 5° over
that of the grass, by 3 o'clock was only 1° warmer, and by 4 o'clock
was colder than the grass.
   In the majority of instances    grass is colder than flowers, as shown
by the following examples : —
    1. Eleven observations on Daphne cneorum               in comparison with
grass.
   The   mean gives Daphne      cneorum     l°-2 warmer than        grass.    The
temperatures range between 41° and 73°-3.              In nine    cases the tem
perature was warmest over Daphne cneorum,               the greatest difference
being  3°7.
    2. Thirty-nine observations     on    Gentiana     acaulis in comparison
with grass.
   The   mean gives    Gentiana   acaulis 2° warmer than grass.               The
 temperatures range between 41° and 89°-8.            In thirty-four    cases the

                                         537
 temperature was warmest over Gentiana acaulis, the greatest differ
 ence being 7°- 9.
    3.  Eight observations       on  Iberis  sempervirens     in comparison with
 grass.
    The  mean gives    Iberis   sempervirens    2°-3 warmer than grass.           The
 temperatures range        between     41° and 630,2.        In seven cases the
 temperature was warmest over              Iberis   sempervirens,      the greatest
 difference being 3°"    1.
    4. Ten   observations on Alyssum tortuosum in comparison with
 grass.
    The   mean    gives     Alyssum     tortuosum     2°-3 warmer than grass.
 The temperatures      range between 41° and 88°- 9 ;          in  every case being
 warmer than grass, the greatest difference being 3°-/.
    5. Eleven observations        of a white Daisy in comparison with grass.
    The   mean   gives   the Daisy 0o-2 hotter than grass ; the range of
 temperature from 40°3 to 80o,5.              Greatest difference 4°-4.
    6. Seven   observations of Veronica            alpina   in comparison with
 grass.
    The   mean   gives    Veronica alpina      l°-9 warmer than         grass ;    the
 temperature ranging from 42°-8 to 65°-5.                 In no instance      was it
 lower than grass.       Greatest difference 5o,0.
    7. Seven   observations of Alyssum          tortuosum in comparison with
 Reseda frutescens.
    The   mean   gives    Alyssum      tortuosum 2°-4 hotter          than Reseda
frutescens.
    8.  Thirty-three observations of Tulipa Gesneriana in comparison
 with grass.
    The mean gives Tulipa Gesneriana l°-9 hotter than grass                     ;  the
 temperature ranging between 31°-4 and 960-5.                    In twenty-five in
 stances it was warmer than grass.            Greatest difference 12°-8.
    9. Twenty-eight      observations     of Eschscholtzia      crocea in compari
 son with grass.
    The   mean gives the Eschscholtzia          3°-6 warmer than grass          ;  the
 temperature ranging between           37° and 102o-3.         In twenty-four in
 stances it was warmer than the grass.            Greatest difference with black
 bulb 15°-7.
     10. Ten observations      of Lilium concolor in comparison with          grass.
    The   mean   gives    Lilium concolor 2°-9 warmer than              grass ;    the

                                         538
 temperature ranging between            64° and 850- 7.    In  every instance    it
 was warmer, the greatest        difference  being 6°-6.
     1 1. Eleven observations of Valeriana tuberosa in comparison with
 grass.
    The    mean   gives    the Valerian 0o,5 warmer than grass;         the tem
 perature ranging between 52°-6 and 73°.             In  seven instances   it was
 warmer than the grass, the greatest difference          being 3°-3.
     [In the last four       examples    the temperature at night, and the
 maximum with black bulb are included, so that the former will tend
 to lower the result and the latter to raise it.]

        Navy, and the Iron Steam-ship 'Great Eastern';" being a

        derick J. Evans, Esq.               Communicated by the Lords
        Commissioners        of the Admiralty.       Received May 5, 1860.
                                     (Abstract.)
   The analysis of the deviations of the compass in this paper com
prises the observations made in forty-two iron ships, varying in size
from 3400 to      1 65  tons,  a selection of wood-built     screw and paddle-
wheel steam-vessels,      as also the steam-ship 'Great Eastern' at various
times prior to her departure from England.
   The observations       made in the    iron-built ships extend    over periods
varying between thirteen and five years         ; and having been made with
the same description      of compass   — the Admiralty standard — and under
similar conditions of arrangement and situation, in accordance              with
the system     carried out in Her Majesty's Navy, details of which are
given, the general results are strictly comparable.
   In the analysis of the Tables, amounting            to nearly 250    in num
ber,   of deviations   observed   in various parts of both hemispheres, the
formula deduced        from Poisson's General Equations          by  Mr. Archi
bald Smith, given in the Philosophical         Transactions for 1846, p. 348,
has been employed.
   In this formula,        the  deviation of the compass        on board ship,

                                              539
reckoned positive when the north point of the needle deviates to the
east, is given by the following expression                 :   —
      Deviation (S) =            A + B sin i' + C   cos   (' + D     sin 2{'   + E cos 2?,
    (' being the azimuth (by               compass)   of the ship's            head,     reckoned
from the magnetic north towards the east                       ;
  A, D, E being constant coefficients depending only on the amount,
quality, and arrangement or position of the iron in the ship : B and
C, coefficients       depending on these, and also on the magnetic dip and
horizontal intensity, are each consisting of two parts                         ; one caused          by
the permanent magnetism of the hard iron, the deviation produced
by which varies inversely as the horizontal force at the place                           ;   and the
other, caused          by the vertical part of the earth's force inducing                          the
soft iron in the ship, the deviation produced by which varies as the
tangent of the dip           :   B representing that part of             the combined attrac
tion acting in a fore-and-aft direction, C that acting in                           a transverse,
or athwart-ship direction.
                                       —
    From the equation tan                  g, the direction of the ship's              force, and
V      -f-   Ca, the total magnetic force           of the ship in proportion to the
horizontal force at the place of observation                         is   obtained   :       for con
venience,        1000 has been adopted to represent the value                     of the earth's
horizontal force at the English ports of observation, in order,                                 by   an
easy comparison, to note the changes                  on foreign stations.
   By comparison of the coefficients of the several descriptions of
ships,    observed that in wood-built steam-vessels, the coefficients
              is
B   and   C it   vary nearly as the tangent of the dip               ;    from whence         it   may
be inferred, as        a   general      rule, that in steam machinery permanent
magnetism bears            but     a   small proportion            to induced   ;   but in iron-
built ships,       B   and   C    generally vary more nearly as the inverse hori
zontal force,         showing that they depend                     more on the permanent
magnetism of the iron of the ship, and thus confirming                                 the view of
the Astronomer Royal, given in his earliest deductions                              (Phil. Trans.
1839), that the effect of transient induced magnetism                                  is    in these
ships small comparatively.                  Numerous examples are given in detail
of this permanency of magnetism, as also of the gradual diminution
of the ship's force resulting from time.
  An investigation of the coefficient D, which    caused entirely by     is
the horizontal induction of the  soft iron in the ship, and which                                      is

                                         540
known as the "quadrantal"             deviation, shows,       that while in wood-
built steam-ships it seldom         exceeds   1°  or 1|°, it rises in iron-built
ships from           to 6° and 7°; the Liverpool              Compass- Committee
recording even a point of the compass.
    The chief characteristics of the quadrantal deviation,             as developed
in this investigation, are —
     1.  That it   has   invariably     a positive     sign, causing an easterly
deviation in the     N.E. and S.W. quadrants            ; and a westerly deviation
in the S.E. and N.W. quadrants.
     2.  Its amount    does not appear to depend           on the size, or mass of
the vessel, or direction when building           ;  or on the existence      of iron
beams.
     3.   That  a gradual     decrease    in amount has occurred, after the
 lapse    of a number of years,        in nearly every vessel that has been
observed.
     4.   That the value remains unchanged in sign and amount, on
 changes of geographic position.
     5.   That  a value not       exceeding   4°, and ranging         between   that
 amount and 2°, may be assumed to represent                 the average or normal
 amount in vessels of all sizes.
     Numerous examples are given in support of these propositions, as
  also of the uniformity of the amount of quadrantal deviation when
 determined in various parts of the ship           ;   and, assuming the normal
 amount in iron steam-ships as from 2° to 4°, an analysis is given by
 which it is seen that 75 per cent. of the iron ships of the Royal Navy
 are included    in this condition.
     Two   questions   of importance here arise      ;  are the results of this ana
 lysis conclusive, and     if so,  under what conditions do large quadrantal
  deviations occur   ?  Reverting to the Astronomer Royal's early experi
  ments in 1838-39, in the iron ships ' Rainbow' and 'Ironsides,' whose
  values   were very small, and presuming that those vessels were               built
  of good    material —from     their then experimental character — as           also
  that similar conditions of material of good quality exist in the iron
  ships of the Royal Navy, it is assumed that the value (2° to 4°) re
  presents the average condition of a ship built of the best or superior
  iron.
     On the other hand,     can the inference be drawn that large quadrantal
  deviation in an iron ship implies that inferior material has been used

                                            541
in her construction         ?  Attention is here directed to the ships ' Birken
           and ' Royal Charter,' which from their well-known
        '
head                                                                         magnetic
coefficients may be regarded as the types respectively of                      "hard"
and     "soft" iron constructed          vessels,    and from their consideration,
as also from a review            of the   general    results, these conclusions are
derived     : —
     1.   That in    an iron ship     of ordinary dimensions, a standard           com
pass can be placed,         the deviations of which will but little exceed        those
obtaining in wood-built steam-ships             ;   and further, that on changes of
geographic position, however distant, these deviations will                  be  within
smaller limits, and can be approximately predicted.
    2.    A divergence from       these conditions     will  arise when the inductive
magnetism of the hull or machinery predominates ; and it is inferred,
                                                  '
especially from the example of the Royal Charter,' that large qua-
drantal deviation and fluctuating sub-permanent magnetism                      (due to
hull    alone   )  are co-existent, and give rise          to conditions of compass
disturbance which are beyond prediction, and which have hitherto
baffled inquiry and given a complexion to theoretical deductions
varying as regarded from different points of view.
    In order to examine the            change which the original        magnetism of
an iron ship undergoes after launching, a series of compass observa
 tions were made in the steam-ship ' Great Eastern' prior to her quit
ting the River Thames in 1859, and subsequently at Portland,                     Holy
 head,     and Southampton* — at the three first-named                  places   within
 short periods of time of each other.
    The results, from           an  Admiralty Standard Compass placed in a
 position the least        subject to influence from local masses of iron, were
 as follows     : — In the first    five days, from Deptford to Portland,            the
 ship's force had diminished from 0-585 to 0-480 [the earth's force
  = 1-000], or nearly one-fifth ; representing a decrease in the "semi
 circular" deviation from 35°              50' to 28° 45' ; the direction        of the
 force, or neutral points, approaching the fore-and-aft line by 10°,
 or changing from 47° on the starboard bow to 37°.
    At the expiration of the next six               weeks,   the  ship in the interim
 having made         the passage to Holyhead,           the ship's force diminished
 from 0-480 to 0-390, or about one-sixth, corresponding to a decrease
    * The     observations  at Southampton    were made after the paper was communi
 cated to the Royal Society,      and are introduced by way of supplement.

                                                542
of "semicircular" deviation from 28° 45'                    to 23° 0', the direction     of
the force changing from 37° to 32°.
     At Southampton, in June              1860,       or nearly eight months after the
experiments made at Holyhead, the force had further diminished
from 0-390 to 0-235, or by one-half, corresponding to a decrease in
the "semicircular"             deviation from 23° 0' to 13° 30';               whilst the
direction of the force approached the fore-and-aft line 25°, or from
32°      to   7° ;    the quadrantal          deviation remaining       nearly     constant
[ + 4^°] the whole time included in the various observations.
   The unvarying tendency of the direction of the ship's force in the
'                      '
    Great Eastern          to assume a fore-and-aft line, supports the view that
time, with the vibrations and concussions due to sea service,                      leads to
a    distribution of the magnetic lines, of the nature of a stable equili
brium depending on the average of the inducing forces to which the
ship is exposed        ;   the respective     sections    of the hull having north     and
south polarity, being separated by lines approximating                        more nearly
a    horizontal plane and vertical axis through the body of the ship                        ;
instead of the inclined axis and equatorial plane of separation                      due to
the magnetic dip of the locality, and divergence                     from the magnetic
meridian, of the hull while building.
  The practical information resulting from the example of the 'Great
        '       is,
Eastern      that prior to  newly built iron ship being sent to sea,
                                      a
her head during equipment should be secured                    in   an opposite direction
to that in which she was              built ;   and that the magnetic lines should
                           " shaken        "
be assisted to be                     down        by the vibrations of the machinery
in   a   short preparatory trip prior to the determination of her compass
errors, or their compensation             ;   but especially that in the early voy
ages vigilant supervision should be exercised                  in the determination of
the compass disturbances.
     Another important point, generally neglected when compasses                        are
adjusted by the aid of magnets in                a   newly built iron ship,   is   rendered
manifest by the results of this investigation                 ;   namely, the necessity
of the errors of the          compass     being determined and placed on record
prior to the adjustment. Without the knowledge to be derived from
these observations of the magnetic force of the ship, all future
changes of magnetism and consequent errors of the compass are
mere      guesswork both to those who adjust, and those in charge of
the navigation of the ship.

                                          543
     It is recommended that, in any future legislation l'or the security
  of  the navigation      of our mercantile marine with          reference   to iron-
  built ships, the determination         and record    of these preliminary    obser
  vations should be secured.
     The paper concludes by directing attention to the general prin
  ciples of practical import which result from the investigation, viz. as
  to the best direction with reference to the magnetic meridian for the
  keel and head of an iron ship to be placed in building, to ensure                the
  least compass    disturbance      ; the best position and arrangement for a
  compass   to ensure      small deviations, and permanency on changes               of
 geographic position        ;  and the changes to which the compass is liable
 from various causes on the foregoing conditions being fulfilled.
     For the   best direction in building,      it is shown that, from the nature
  of the polarity of the hull, and especially of the top sides in the after
  section of the ship and adjoining the compass, where usually placed,
  the latter is least affected in those vessels built in the line of the mag
  netic meridian.
     For iron   steam-vessels      engaged    in the home or foreign trades in
  the northern hemisphere, it is recommended, from the then antago
 nistic magnetic influence of the hull and machinery, to build them
 head to the north      :  for iron sailing vessels, from the top sides, in the
 usual position of the compass,          being magnetically weak       if built head
 to the south, the latter direction is to be preferred.
     The selection for        the  position  of the     compass    depends on the
 direction of the ship during building           ;  in those  built head to north,
 it must be removed as far from the stern as convenience                will permit   ;
 in  those  built head to south, as near to the stern as convenient, but
 avoiding especially, in all cases, proximity           to vertical masses   of iron.
 In ships built    head east or west, there is little choice        of position  :  in
those    built on  the    intercardinal    points,   a  position approximating to
the stern when the action from the top-sides — to be determined expe
rimentally   — is at   a   minimum, is to be preferred.
     Ample elevation above the deck and exact position in the middle
line of the ship, are primary conditions to be observed ; and no com
pass should be nearer iron deck beams than 4 feet.               As   every piece   of
iron not forming       a    part of, or hammered in the fabrication of the
hull, such    as the rudder, funnel, fastenings         of deck  houses,   &c, is of
a   magnetic character differing from the hull of the ship, proximity to
     vol. x.                                                            2 P

                                          544
any such should be avoided,             and, as far as possible,     the compass
should be so placed that they may act as correctors of the general
magnetism       of the hull.
     As    most  compasses    are affected   by the magnetism of the ship to
an amount depending on their elevation,            and the direction of the ship
in building, the disturbances will be large comparatively,               except  in
those vessels      built head   east or west.
     A   series of Tables   is appended, wherein the magnetic coefficients
and ship's force and direction of the various classes              of  vessels are
given, the ships being classed according to the nature of their mate
rial and machinery.
XII. "On          the Sources       of the Nitrogen       of Vegetation; with
          special reference to the Question whether Plants assimilate
          free or uncombined         Nitrogen." By J. B. Lawes, Esq.,
          F.R.S.; J.     H. Gilbert, Ph.D., F.R.S. ; and Evan Pugh,
          Ph.D., F.C.S.        Received    June 21, 1860.
                                      (Abstract.)
     After referring to the earlier history of the subject, and especially
 to the conclusion of Saussure, that plants derive their nitrogen from
 the nitrogenous compounds of the soil and the small amount of
 ammonia which          he found to exist     in the atmosphere, the Authors
 preface the discussion       of their  own experiments on the sources       of the
 nitrogen of plants, by         a  consideration of the most prominent facts
 established      by their own investigations         concerning the amount of
 nitrogen yielded by different crops over a given area of land, and of
  the relation    of these to certain measured,       or known sources of it.
      On growing the same crop year after year on the same land, with
  out any supply of nitrogen by manure, it was found that wheat, over
  a   period of    14 years,   had given rather more than 30 lbs. — barley,
  over a period of      6 years,   somewhat less — meadow-hay, over        a period
  of   3 years, nearly 40 lbs. — and beans, over       11 years, rather more than
  50 lbs. of nitrogen, per acre, per annum. Clover, another leguminous
  crop, grown in 3 out of         4 consecutive   years, had given an average     of
   1 20  lbs.   Turnips,  over 8 consecutive     years, had yielded about 45 lbs.
       The graminaceous crops had           not,  during the period referred to,

                                     545
shown signs of diminution        of produce.        The yield of the legumi
nous crops had fallen considerably.       Turnips, again, appeared greatly
to have exhausted the immediately available nitrogen in the soil. The
amount of nitrogen harvested in the leguminous and root crops was
considerably increased     by the use of
                                          " mineral manures," whilst that
in the graminaceous crops was so in       a  very limited degree.
    Direct experiments further showed          that pretty nearly the same
amount of nitrogen was taken from           a   given area of land in wheat
in 8 years, whether 8 crops were grown consecutively,               4  in alterna
tion with fallow, or 4 in alternation with beans.
    Taking the results of 6 separate courses of rotation, Boussingault
obtained an average of between one-third and one-half more nitrogen
in the produce than had been supplied in manure.                     His largest
yields of nitrogen      were  in the leguminous        crops  ;  and   the cereal
crops were larger, when they next succeeded               the removal of the
highly    nitrogenous leguminous      crops.      In their own experiments
upon an actual course        of rotation, without manure, the Authors
had obtained, over 8 years, an average annual yield of 57-               7 lbs. of
nitrogen per acre     ; about twice as much         as was  obtained in either
wheat or barley, when they were, respectively, grown year after year
on the same land.       The greatest yield of nitrogen had       been in a clover
crop, grown once during the 8 years          ;  and the wheat crops grown
after this clover in the first course of 4 years, and after beans in the
second    course,  were about double those obtained when              wheat   suc
ceeded wheat.
    Thus,   cereal  crops grown     year after year on the same land,
gave an average     of about 30 lbs. of nitrogen, per        acre,   per annum    ;
and leguminous       crops much more.          Nevertheless the cereal        crop
was    nearly doubled when preceded        by a leguminous one.            It  was
also   about doubled when preceded         by fallow.      Lastly,    an entirely
unmanured rotation had yielded nearly twice as much nitrogen as
 the continuously grown cereals.
    Leguminous     crops were,    however,      little  benefited,   indeed fre
 quently injured,   by the use of the ordinary direct nitrogenous ma
nures.     Cereal crops, on the other hand, though            their yield of ni
 trogen was comparatively small, were very much increased                by direct
 nitrogenous manures, as well as when they succeeded a highly nitro
 genous leguminous crop, or fallow.         But when nitrogenous          manures
                                                                2 p 2

                                           54-6
  had been       employed for the increased           growth    of the   cereals,   the
  nitrogen in the immediate increase of produce had amounted to little
  more than 40 per cent.        of that supplied, and that in the          increase   of
  the second year after the application, to little more than one-tenth
  of the remainder.         Estimated    in the same way,         there had been in
 the case of the meadow            grasses    scarcely any larger proportion         of
 the supplied nitrogen recovered.              In the leguminous crops the pro
 portion so recovered         appeared    to be even less     ; whilst   in the root
 crops it was probably somewhat greater.                  Several possible explana
 tions of this real or apparent loss               of the nitrogen supplied by
 manure are enumerated.
     The question      arises — what are the sources          of all the nitrogen of
 our crops beyond that which is directly supplied to the soil by arti
 ficial means      ?   The following actual or possible sources may be
 enumerated:       — the nitrogen in certain constituent minerals of the
 soil ;  the combined nitrogen          annually coming down in the direct
 aqueous      depositions from       the atmosphere        ; the accumulation        of
 combined nitrogen from the atmosphere by the soil in other ways                      ;
 the formation of ammonia in the soil from free nitrogen and nascent
 hydrogen      ;  the formation      of nitric    acid   from free nitrogen     ;  the
 direct absorption        of combined nitrogen from the atmosphere by
plants themselves       ; the assimilation of free nitrogen by plants.
    A consideration of        these   several    sources   of the nitrogen of      the
vegetation       which covers the earth's surface showed that those of
them which have as yet been quantitatively estimated                 are inadequate
to account for the amount           of nitrogen obtained in the annual pro
duce    of  a   given area of land beyond that which may be attributed
to supplies by previous manuring.               Those, on the other hand, which
have     not yet been        even   approximately       estimated   as to    quantity
— if    indeed fully established qualitatively — offer many practical
difficulties in the way of such an investigation as would afford results
applicable in any such estimates as are here supposed.                  It  appeared
important, therefore, to endeavour             to settle the question whether or
not that vast        storehouse of nitrogen,         the atmosphere, affords to
growing plants any measurable            amount of its free nitrogen.          More
over, this question had        of late years been submitted to very extended
and laborious experimental researches              by  M. Boussingault, M. Ville,
and    also   to more limited investigation by MM. Mene, Roy, Cloez,

                                          547
De Luca, Harting, Petzholdt           and others, from the results of which
diametrically opposite conclusions had been arrived at.            Before enter
ing on the discussion of their own experimental evidence, the Authors
give   a  review of these results and inferences      ; more especially those   of
M. Boussingault who         questions,    and those of   M. Georges Ville who
affirms the assimilation of free nitrogen in the process               of vegeta
tion.
   The     general   method of experiment instituted          by Boussingault,
which has been followed, with more or less modification, in most
subsequent researches,         was that adopted by the      Authors in the pre
sent inquiry ; namely, to set seeds or young plants, the amount of
nitrogen in which was estimated by the analysis of carefully chosen
similar specimens       ; to employ soils and water        containing either no
combined nitrogen, or only known quantities of it                ;  to allow the
access    of  free air (the plants being protected from rain and dust) —
of  a   current of air freed by washing from all combined nitrogen — or
of  a  limited quantity of air, too small to be of any avail so far as any
compounds of nitrogen contained in it were concerned               ;  and finally,
to determine the amount           of combined nitrogen in the plants pro
duced,     and in the soil, pot, &c, and so to provide the means of
estimating the gain or loss of nitrogen during the course of the ex
periment.
   The plan adopted by the Authors in discussing their own experi
mental results, was —
   To consider the conditions          to be fulfilled   in order to effect the
solution of the main question,            and to endeavour to eliminate all
sources     of error in the investigation.
   To examine a number of collateral questions bearing upon                   the
points at issue, and to endeavour           so far to solve them, as to reduce
the general      solution to that of     a single question to be answered by
the results     of a final set  of experiments.
   To give the results of the final experiments, and to discuss their
bearings upon the question which it is proposed to solve by them.
   Accordingly,      the following points are considered      : —
    1.   The preparation of the soil, or matrix, for the reception of the
plants and of the nutriment to be supplied to them.
    2.   The preparation of the nutriment, embracing that of mineral
 constituents, of certain solutions, and of water.

                                        548
    3. The conditions of atmosphere to be supplied to the plants,
and the means of securing them ; the apparatus to be employed, &c.
    4. The changes undergone by nitrogenous organic matter during
decomposition, affecting the quantity of combined nitrogen present,
in circumstances more or less analogous to those in which the expe
rimental plants are grown.
    5.  The action of      agents,   as ozone   ;   and the influence of other
circumstances which may affect the quantity of combined nitrogen
present    in connexion with the plants, independently              of the direct
action of the growing process.
    In most   of the experiments      a  rather clayey soil, ignited with free
access  of air, well-washed with distilled     water, and re-ignited, was used
as   the matrix or soil.       In  a few cases washed       and ignited pumice-
stone was used.
    The mineral constituents       were supplied      in the form of    the ash    of
plants, of the description to be grown,           if practicable, and    if  not,  of
some closely allied kind.
    The distilled water     used for the final rinsing      of all the important
parts of the apparatus and for the supply of water to the plants, was
prepared by boiling off one-third from ordinary water, collecting the
second    third  as distillate,  and redistilling this, previously acidulated
with phosphoric acid.
    Most of the pots used were specially made, of porous ware, with a
great    many holes at the bottom and round the sides near                    to the
bottom.      These were placed in glazed stone-ware           pans with inward-
 turned rims to lessen evaporation.
    Before use, the red-hot matrix and the freshly ignited ash were
 mixed in the red-hot pot, and the whole allowed to cool over sul
 phuric acid.     The soil   was then moistened        with distilled  water,     and
 after the lapse of   a  day or so the seeds or plants were put in.
    Very carefully picked bulks of seed were chosen           ; specimens      of the
 average weight were taken for the experiment, and in similar speci
 mens the nitrogen was determined.
    The atmosphere supplied to the plants                was  washed     free   from
 ammonia by passing through sulphuric acid, and then over pumice-
 stone saturated with sulphuric        acid.   It   then passed through a solu
 tion of carbonate    of  soda before entering the apparatus enclosing the
 plant, and it passed out again through sulphuric acid.

                                        549
    Carbonic    acid, evolved from marble by measured              quantities of
hydrochloric     acid, was passed daily into the apparatus, after passing,
with the air, through       the sulphuric    acid and the carbonate       of  soda
solution.
   The enclosing apparatus consisted of a large glass shade, resting in
a  groove filled with mercury, in a slate or glazed earthenware stand,
upon which the pan, with the pot of soil,            &c,   was placed.     Tubes
passed under the shade, for the ingress and the egress            of air, for the
supply of water to the plants, and, in some cases, for the withdrawal
of the water which      condensed     within the shade.      In other  cases, the
condensed    water was removed by means of a special arrangement.
    One advantage     of  the apparatus adopted was, that the washed air
was forced, instead      of being aspirated, through the enclosing         vessel.
The pressure upon it        was thus not only very small, and the danger
from breakage,      therefore, also small, but it was exerted          upon the
inside instead of the outside of the shade        ; hence,   any leakage would
be from the inside outwards, so that there was no danger           of unwashed
air gaining access to the plants.
    The conditions of atmosphere            were  proved to be adapted for
healthy growth, by growing plants under exactly the same circum
stances,  but in    a  garden soil.     The conditions of the artificial soil
were shown to be suitable for the purpose, by the fact that plants
grown in such soil, and in the artificial conditions of atmosphere,
developed     luxuriantly,    if  only manured with substances         supplying
combined nitrogen.
    Passing to the subjects of collateral inquiry, the first question con
sidered was, whether         plants growing      under the conditions       stated
would be likely to acquire nitrogen from the air through the medium
of  ozone, either within or around the plant, or in the soil         ; that body
oxidating    free  nitrogen,     and thus rendering it assimilable by the
plants.
    Several series of experiments were made upon the gases contained
in plants or evolved        from them, under different circumstances of
light, shade, supply of carbonic acid, &c.            When sought for, ozone
was   in no    case detected.      The results of the inquiry in other re
spects, bearing upon the points at issue, may be briefly summed up
as follows  : —

                                        550
    1.  Carbonic acid within growing          vegetable   cells and intercellular
passages    suffers decomposition very rapidly           on the penetration of
the sun's rays, oxygen being evolved.
    2.  Living   vegetable    cells, in the dark, or not penetrated by the
direct rays of the sun, consume oxygen very rapidly, carbonic acid
being formed.
    3. Hence, the proportion of oxygen must vary greatly according
to the position     of the cell, and to the external conditions of light, and
it will oscillate under the influence of the reducing force of carbon-
matter (forming carbonic acid) on the one hand, and of that of the
sun's rays (liberating oxygen) on the other.                  Both actions may
go on simultaneously according to the depth of the cell                ; and the
once outer cells      may gradually      pass from the state in which the
sunlight is the greater reducing agent to that in which the carbon-
matter becomes the greater.
    4.  The great reducing power operating in           those parts  of the plant
where ozone is most likely,         if at all, to be evolved, seems unfavour
able   to the oxidation      of nitrogen   ;  that is under circumstances in
which carbon-matter is not oxidized, but on the contrary, carbonic
 acid reduced.      And where beyond the influence of the direct rays of
 the sun, the cells seem to supply an abundance of more easily oxi
 dized carbon-matter,       available for oxidation, should free oxygen or
 ozone    be present.     As nitrates   are available as a source     of nitrogen
 to plants, if it were admitted that nitrogen is oxidated within the
 plant, it must be supposed (as in the case of carbon) that there are
 conditions under which the oxygen compound of nitrogen may be                  re
 duced within the organism, and that there are others in which the
 reverse action, namely, the oxidation         of nitrogen, can take place.
     5. So great is    the reducing power of certain carbon-compounds of
 vegetable   substances,    that when the growing process has ceased, and
 all the free oxygen in the cells has been consumed, water is for                  a
 time decomposed,       carbonic acid formed, and hydrogen evolved.
     The suggestion      arises, whether     ozone may     not be formed under
 the influence of the powerful reducing action of the carbon-com
  pounds of the cell on the oxygen eliminated from carbonic acid by
  sunlight, rather than under the direct action of the sunlight              itself
  — in  a  manner analogous to that in which it is ordinarily obtained
  under the     influence of the active       reducing agency      of phosphorus

                                            551
But,   even  if it  were    so, it may       be questioned     whether the ozone
would not be at once destroyed when in contact with the carbon-
compounds present.           It  is more probable, however, that the ozone
said to be observed      in the vicinity of vegetation, is due to the action
of the oxygen of the air upon minute quantities of volatile carbo-
hydrogens emitted by plants.
   Supposing ozone to be present,            it might, however, be supposed to
act in a more indirect manner as a source             of combined and assimilable
nitrogen in the      Authors'      experiments, namely, — by oxidating the
nitrogen dissolved in the condensed                water of the apparatus       — by
forming    nitrates in contact with the moist, porous, and alkaline
soil — or  by oxidating       the free nitrogen in the cells of the older
roots, or that evolved in their decomposition.
   Experiments were accordingly made to ascertain the influence of
ozone    upon    organic matter, and on certain               porous and alkaline
bodies,   under various circumstances.             A current of ozonous air       was
passed over the substances            for some time daily, for several months,
including   the whole of the warm weather of the summer                     ; but in
only one case out of eleven was any trace                  of nitric acid   detected,
namely, that of garden soil         ;   and this was proved to contain nitrates
before being submitted to the action            of  ozone.
   It  is not, indeed,    hence      inferred that nitric acid could under no
circumstances be formed through the influence of ozone on certain
nitrogenous compounds, on nascent nitrogen, on gaseous nitrogen in
contact with porous and alkaline substances, or even in the atmosphere.
But, considering the       negative      result with large quantities of ozonous
air, acting upon organic matter, soil,           &c, in   a wide range    of circum
stances and for so long a period, it is believed              that no error will be
introduced into the main investigation by the cause referred to.
    Numerous experiments were made to determine whether free ni
trogen was evolved during the decomposition of nitrogenous organic
compounds.
    In the first  series  of   6 experiments, wheat, barley, and bean-meal
were    respectively mixed with ignited pumice and ignited soil, and
submitted for some months to decomposition in                     a current of air,
in such manner that any ammonia                  evolved   could be collected and
estimated. The result was, that, in              5 out of the    6 cases,  there was
 a greater or less evolution of free        nitrogen — amounting, in two of        the

                                           552
cases, to more than        12  per cent. of the original nitrogen of the sub
stance.
   The second series consisted of 9 experiments                ;  wheat, barley, aud
beans     being again     employed, and, as before,           either ignited soil    or
pumice used as the matrix.              In  some cases the seeds were      submitted
to experiment whole, and allowed to grow, and the vegetable                     matter
produced permitted to die down and decompose.                        In other cases,
the ground       seeds,   or meals,      were    employed.       The conditions      of
moisture were also varied.            The experiments     were continued      through
several    months, when from 60 to 70 per cent, of the carbon had
disappeared.
   In   8 out   of the  9   experiments,      a loss  of nitrogen,   evolved    in the
pure state, was indicated.          In most    cases, the loss amounted to about
one-seventh or one-eighth, but in one instance to 40 per cent. of the
original    nitrogen.      In all    these   experiments the decomposition of
the organic substance        was very complete, and the amount              of carbon
lost was comparatively uniform.
   It  thus appeared that, under rare circumstances, there might be no
loss  of nitrogen in the decomposition of nitrogenous organic matter ;
but that, under a wide range of circumstances, the loss was very
considerable — a point, it may be observed,             of practical importance in
the management        of the manures of the farm and the stable.
   Numerous        direct    experiments       showed,    that when      nitrogenous
organic matter was submitted to decomposition in water, over mer
cury, in the absence         of  free oxygen, no free nitrogen was evolved.
In fact, the evolution in question             appeared    to be the result of an
oxidating process.          Direct experiments also showed,          that seeds may
be submitted to germination and growth, and that nearly the whole
of  the nitrogen may be found in the vegetable               matter produced.
   It   is observed    that in the cases referred to, in which so large an
evolution of free nitrogen took place,              the organic substances        were
submitted to decomposition for several months, during which time
they lost two-thirds         of their carbon.        In the experiments on the
question of assimilation, however,            but a very small proportion of the
total organic matter is submitted to decomposing actions apart from
those    associated   with growth,         and this for     a   comparatively short
period of time, at the termination               of which the organic form is
retained, and      therefore but very little carbon is lost.                It would

                                            553
appear,     then, that in experiments on assimilation no fear need be
entertained of any serious error arising from the evolution of free
nitrogen in the      decomposition          of the nitrogenous organic matter
necessarily involved, so long as that is subjected merely to the ex
haustion required to supply materials for growth                           in the ordinary
process     of germination.        On    the other hand, the facts adduced afford
a probable explanation        of any small          loss   of nitrogen which       may occur
when seeds have not grown, or when leaves, or other dead matters,
have suffered     partial decomposition.               They       also point out an objec
tion to the application of nitrogenous organic manure in such expe
riments.
     Although    there   can be no doubt               of   the    evolution of hydrogen
during the decomposition of organic matter, and although it has long
been admitted that nascent               hydrogen may, under certain circum
stances,     combine with gaseous nitrogen and form ammonia                          ;    never
theless, from considerations stated at length in the paper, the Authors
infer that there ueed be little apprehension of error in the results of
their experiments, arising from an unaccounted supply of ammonia,
formed under the influence of nascent hydrogen given off in the de
composition of the organic matter involved.
     The Authors next consider the questions, whether assimilation of
free nitrogen would be most              likely     to take place when the plant had
no other supply      of combined nitrogen than that contained in the
seed sown,      or when supplied with a limited amount of combined
nitrogen, or with an excess of combined nitrogen                           1   And       again
                                                                                                 —
whether at an early stage of growth, at the most active stage, or
when the plant was approaching maturity                       1    Combinations of these
several circumstances might              give   a   number of special conditions, in
perhaps only one of which assimilation of free nitrogen might take
place, in case it could in any.
     It   is hardly to be supposed that free nitrogen would be assimilated
when an excess of combined nitrogen is at the disposal of the plant.
It   is obvious, however, that a wide range                  of conditions would           be ex
perimentally      provided,       if,   in some instances,           plants were supplied
with uo more combined nitrogen than that contained in the seed,
in others brought to          a   given stage of growth               by   means   of limited
 extraneous     supplies of combined nitrogen,                    and in others supplied

                                          554
 with combined nitrogen in a more liberal                measure.       It  has  been
 sought to provide these conditions in the experiments under con
 sideration.
     In the   selection  of plants, it  was thought advisable to take such as
 would be adapted to the artificial conditions of temperature, moisture,
 &c. involved in the experiment, also such as were of importance in
 an agricultural     point of view— to have representatives, moreover,              of
 the two great Natural Families, the Graminaceae and the Leguminosae,
 which seem to differ so widely in their relations to the combined
 nitrogen supplied within the soil — and finally, to have some of the
 same descriptions as those experimented upon by                 M. Boussingault,
 and   M. G. Ville, with such discordant results.
    Thirteen     experiments were made,         4  in 1857 and 9 in 1858, in
 which the plants were supplied with              no other     combined nitrogen
 than that contained in the original seed.              In  12   of the    cases pre
 pared    soil was the matrix,         and   in the remaining         one   prepared
 pumice.
    Of   9 experiments with graminaceous plants,             1 with wheat and 2
 with barley were made in 1857.              In  one  of  the    experiments with
 barley there was again of 0-0016, and in the other of 0-0026 gramme
 of nitrogen.       In only two     cases  of the experiments with         cereals in
 1 858,   was there any gain         of nitrogen indicated ; and in both it
 amounted to only       a   small fraction of a milligramme.         Indeed, in no
 one  of the   cases, in either 1857 or 1858, was there more nitrogen in
 the plants themselves, than in the seed sown.              A gain    was indicated
 only when the nitrogen in the soil and pot — which together weighed
 about 1500 grammes — was brought into the calculation.                   Moreover,
 the gain only exceeded        1 milligramme in the case of the experiments
 of  1857, when slate, instead        of glazed earthenware      stands were used
 as the lute vessels      ;  and there was some reason to believe that the
 gain indicated was due to this circumstance.              In   none   of the other
 cases   was    the   gain more     than would be expected          from error in
 analysis.
    The result     was then, that in no one case      of these experiments was
 there any such gain of nitrogen as could lead to the supposition that
free nitrogen had       been assimilated.      The plants had, however,         vege
 tated for several     months, had in most cases more than trebled the
 carbon of the seed, and had obviously been limited in their growth

                                         555
 for want of a supply of available nitrogen in some form.            During this
long period they were surrounded by an atmosphere containing free
nitrogen   ;  and their cells were penetrated by fluid saturated with that
element.       It may     be further   mentioned, that many of the plants
formed glumes and paleae for seed.
    It is to be observed        that the results of these experiments with
 cereals go to confirm those        of M. Boussingault.
    The leguminous         plants    experimented     upon   did  not grow        so
healthily under the artificial conditions      as did the cereals.    Still, in all
three   of the    cases   of  these plants in which no combined nitrogen
was provided beyond that contained in the original seed, the carbon
in the vegetable matter produced was much greater than that in the
seed — in one instance more         than 3 times greater.      In no case, how
ever, was there any indication          of assimilation of   free nitrogen, any
more than there had been by the graminaceous plants grown under
similar circumstances.
    One experiment was made with buckwheat, supplied with no other
combined nitrogen than that contained in the seed.              The result   gave
no indication of assimilation of free nitrogen.
    In regard to the whole of the experiments in which the plants
were supplied with no combined nitrogen beyond               that contained in
the seed, it may be observed         that, from the constancy of the amount
of combined nitrogen        present in relation to that supplied, throughout
the experiments, it may be inferred, as well that there was no evolu
tion of free nitrogen by the growing            plant, as that there was no
assimilation of it   ;   but it cannot   hence be concluded that there would
be no such evolution       if an  excess of combined nitrogen were supplied.
    The results of     a number of experiments, in whxh the plants were
supplied with more or less of combined nitrogen, in the form of am
monia-salts or of nitrates, are recorded.            Ten   were   with  cereals;
4  in  1857,    and 6 in 1858.        Three were with leguminous         plants;
and there were also some with plants of other descriptions — all in
1858.
    In the   case of the    cereals  more particularly,  the growth was very
greatly increased    by the extraneous supply of combined nitrogen             ; in
fact, the amount of vegetable          matter produced was 8, 12, and even
30 times greater than in parallel cases without            such supply.       The
amount of nitrogen appropriated was also, in all cases many times

                                         556
greater, and in one case more than 30 times as great, when a supply
of combined nitrogen          was provided.    The  evidence   is therefore suffi
ciently clear that all the conditions provided, apart from those which
depended      upon     a  supply   of combined nitrogen, were adapted for
vigorous growth        ;  and that the limitation of growth where no com
bined nitrogen was supplied was due to the want of such supply.
    In  2 out    of the   4 experiments with cereals     in 1857, there was a
slight gain of nitrogen beyond that which should occur from error
in analysis    ;  but in no one of the 6 in 1858, when glazed earthenware
instead   of  slate stands were used, was there any such gain.          It is con
cluded, therefore, that there was no assimilation of free nitrogen.
In    some cases the supply       of combined nitrogen      was not given    until
the plants showed signs of decline        ; when, on each addition, increased
vigour was rapidly           manifested.    In others   the   supply was given
earlier and was more liberal.
    As in the     case   of the leguminous plants grown without extraneous
supply of combined nitrogen, those grown with it progressed much
less healthily than the graminaceous plants.             But the results under
these conditions, so far as they go, did not indicate any assimilation
of   free nitrogen.
    The results of experiments with plants of other descriptions, in
 which an extraneous supply of combined nitrogen was provided, also
 failed to show an assimilation of free nitrogen.
    Thus,    19   experiments with cereals, 9 without and 10 with an ex
 traneous    supply of combined nitrogen — 6 with leguminous plants,
 3 without       and 3 with an extraneous supply of combined nitrogen,
 and also some with other plants, have been made.                 In none   of the
 experiments, with plants so widely different as the graminaceous and
 the leguminous, and with          a wide range of conditions of growth,       was
 there evidence of an assimilation of free nitrogen.
     The conclusions from         the whole   inquiry may    be briefly  summed
 up as follows     : —
     The yield of nitrogen in the vegetation over a given area, within a
 given time, especially in the case of leguminous crops, is not satis
 factorily explained by reference to the hitherto           quantitatively deter
 mined supplies of combined nitrogen.
     The results     and conclusions hitherto recorded by different experi

                                      557
menters    on the question whether plants assimilate free or uncom-
bined nitrogen, are very conflicting.
   The conditions provided in     the experiments     of the Authors  on this
question were found to be quite consistent with the healthy develop
ment of various Graminaceous Plants, but not so much so for that of
the Leguminous      Plants experimented upon.
   It is not probable that, under the circumstances of the experiments
on assimilation, there would be any supply to the plants of an unac
counted quantity of combined nitrogen, due to the influence either
of ozone or of nascent hydrogen.
   It is not probable that there would        be  a loss  of any of the com
bined nitrogen involved in an experiment on assimilation, due to the
evolution of free nitrogen in the decomposition of organic matter,
excepting in certain cases when it might be presupposed.
   It is not probable that there would be any loss due to the evolu
tion of free nitrogen from the nitrogenous constituents of the plants
during growth.
   In numerous experiments with graminaceous plants, under            a wide
range   of conditions of growth, in no      case was there any evidence    of
an  assimilation of free nitrogen.
   In experiments with leguminous plants the growth was less satis
factory, and the range of conditions was, therefore, more limited.
But the results with     these  plants, so far as they go, do not indicate
any assimilation of free nitrogen.        It  is desirable that the evidence
of further experiments with such plants, under conditions of more
healthy growth, should be obtained.
   Results obtained with some other plants, are in the same sense as
those   with graminaceous and leguminous            ones,   in regard to the
question   of the assimilation of   free nitrogen.
   Seeing the evidence     afforded of the non-assimilation of free nitro
gen by plants, it is very desirable that the several actual or possible
sources whence they may derive combined nitrogen should be more
fully investigated, both qualitatively and quantitatively.
   If it be established that plants do not assimilate free or uncom-
bined nitrogen, the source of the large amount of combined nitrogen
known to exist on the surface of the globe, and in the atmosphere,
still awaits  a satisfactory explanation.

   XIII.   "   Observations          made     with the Polariscope during the
         'Fox'      Arctic      Expedition."         By David        Walker, M.D.,
         Surgeon to the Expedition, — in                 a   Report transmitted by
         Sir Leopold McClintock.                     Communicated by Professor
         Stokes, Sec. R.S.             Received March 7, 1860.
      The observations        made with the polariscope*,          with one exception,
   were confined to solar halos and parhelia.               Several times      I tried the
  instrument when lunar halos appeared,               but the light was so faint that
  only once was       I  able to make an observation.             The direction of the
  polarization was the same in all the cases observed, namely, in                  a plane
  parallel to   a  line joining the part looked at with the centre of the
  sun or moon.       In  several instances the instrument was turned round so
  as to find the plane      of maximum polarization, but it           was always found
  greatest  in the parallel or perpendicular plane              : when     the plane was
  oblique, no perceptible polarization at all was perceived.                    The light
  was never completely polarized, the greatest                amount not being more
  than half  ;  such occurred on 21st           of April, and 5th and 6th of May
  1859.    All the halos         observed    had a diameter of about 45° : there
  were some seen        of diameter 90°, but       the polariscope was not at hand
 at the time.        Almost always the halos round the moon or sun were
 more    or less prismatic, red internal.             The observation on October
  10th, 1857, was not on           a halo, but the cloud which surrounded the
 moon at a distance of about             1^°   had circular and prismatic          edges ;
 light from     these edges was slightly polarized, but not                  of the  same
 image as in all the other instances.
                                          Moon.
     October 7th, 1857. — Polariscope applied to              a halo round the moon,
 diameter about 45°         ;  slight polarization     ; arrow and brighter image
    * The  polariscope     employed    consisted  merely   of  a  double-image   prism  of
quartz, formed of two quartz prisms cut in the usual manner and cemented toge
ther, which was fixed at the eye-end of a tube about 18 inches long, provided at
its other end with a rectangular aperture having its edges parallel and perpendi
cular to the planes of polarization of the two images, and of such breadth that the
two images just touched each other along one edge. The plane of polarization of
that image which was polarized in a plane passing through the axis of the instru
ment, was marked by an arrow at the eye-end, lying in that plane, and placed on
the same side of the axis as the image in question.

 XIV. "    Notice of ' The Royal Charter Storm ' in October 1859."
       By Rear-Admiral          Robert FitzRoy, F.R.S.                  Received
       June 21, 1860.
                                  (Abstract.)
    The author   commenced      with some remarks on the recent progress
 of meteorology, on its    advances    towards precision and consistency as
 a science, and the comparative certainty and confidence              with which
 it may now be relied on in its practical applications.             He adverted
 also to the measures     now systematically adopted by the Meteorolo
gical Department of the Board of Trade and by the Admiralty for
promoting simultaneous meteorological observations at various places,
 and for obtaining accurate registration of atmospherical conditions at
 sea and on land in many parts of the world ; and drew attention to
                                      2   Q   2

                                       562
 the steps taken by these public departments for diffusing practical
 knowledge concerning the laws of winds and storms, and of weather
 in  general,   among mariners and others more especially standing in
 need  of such information,     as well as to the practice now followed,        of
 lending   trustworthy      meteorological instruments to commanders of
 ships able and willing to make an adequate            return in the shape of
 accurate meteorological records, and of supplying other such aids, of
 a kind specially suited to their    wants, to various      of the most   exposed
 and least affluent fishing villages.
    Notice was then taken of some of the more important practical
 results derived from meteorological inquiry, — especially the remark
able   fact, now fully established,       of the constancy of barometric
pressure    between    five and ten  degrees of north latitude; the phe
 nomena of cyclones, and the explanation afforded of their production,
following Dove's theory of polar and equatorial currents in the atmo
sphere.
    In treating of the main subject of his communication, the " Royal
                    " and the severe
Charter Storm                          gale of the first two days of Novem
ber last, the author made use of illustrative          diagrams, which were
exhibited to the Meeting.        Of  these, four,  of large    size, showed  suc
cessive phases      of the storm on the 25th and 26th of October ; the
first at 9  a.m. and the second at 3 p.m. on the 25th; the third at
3 a.m. and the fourth at 9 a.m. on the 26th.              These were intended
to show simultaneous or synchronous            direction and force       of wind
over a certain area within       a few minutes     of   time,    any noteworthy
difference    of longitude having  been allowed for.       Smaller diagrams, in
like manner, showed simultaneous direction and force of wind from
the 22nd of October to the 2nd of November.                  In both    cases the
direction was indicated with reference to the true meridian, and the
force according to estimation only, which, however, was checked by
many comparisons with velocities and pressure instrumentally                  ob
tained at      the observatories of      Greenwich,       Cambridge,      Oxford,
Wrottesley, Liverpool, and at other well-known establishments.               The
same charts also showed curves        of barometric pressure and        curves of
temperature.        These diagrams or charts were compiled by            Mr. Ba-
bington,     assisted  in copying by Messrs. Pattrickson,             Simmonds,
and Symons        ; but notwithstanding     the large amount of materials
already made use of in their compilation,         the author observed        that

                                         503
 noue  of them, nor      indeed    any part    of  the work,   could yet he con
 sidered as nearly complete, and that much matter would                      still  be
 added as, from time to time, information               might be obtained from
 various sources.
    The storm of the 26th of October              was first noticed in accurate
 records, and measured        by instrumental       observations, in the Bay of
 Biscay, near Cape Finisterre in Spain.              This particular tempest did
 not come from the west, but from the south-south-west, true.
    Successive   barometric effects of the storm were traced             by similar
 means in that direction from        S.S.W.   to  N.N. E.  across England,       from
 the Channel through Cornwall, across the central southern counties
 and Lincolnshire,      over the   North    Sea to between    the Shetland Isles
 and Norway.
    By referring    to these charts and the diagrams,        it will   be seen that
 the lowest barometer and         a  corresponding or simultaneous lull pre
 vailed over ten, fifteen, or twenty miles consecutively in the direc
 tion pointed out.       But  at the time that this comparative         lull existed
 there was around this centre, by some called a vortex (but           it can hardly
 be appropriately so termed, because there was no central disturbance),
 only variable wind or calm for       a short time in the middle of the space,
 which was about ten or fifteen miles in irregular area.
    The wind obtained       a varying velocity      of from  60 to 100 miles an
hour at a distance of from twenty to about fifty miles from this space,
and in unequal eddyings crossed            England    towards the north-north
 east, the wind blowing        from all points of the compass           around the
 lull.  When at Anglesea the storm came from the north-north-east,
in the Straits of Dover it was from the south-west            ;   on the east coast
it  was easterly  ;   in the Irish Channel it was northerly,           and on the
coast of Ireland it was from the north-west.
    The charts show that this circulation or cyclonic commotion                    was
passing northwards from the 25th to the 27th, being two complete
days   from the time of its first great strength in the            " Chops of the
Channel,"    while outside of this circulation the wind became less and
less violent   ; and it is very remarkable that even so near as on the
west coast   of Ireland there       was fine weather with      light winds, while
in the British Channel it blew a furious northerly and westerly gale.
    At Galway and        at  Limerick     on   that occasion     there were light

                                       564
winds only, while, as already stated,         over  England,   the wind was
passing in    a tempest,    blowing from all points of the compass around
a   central lull.
     The next storm that occurred        was similar in its features,    though
it  came from a rather different direction.
     It raged on the 1st and 2nd of November, and its character was in
all respects like that just described, now usually called the          " Charter
Storm."
     Coming more from the westward, it passed across the north of
 Ireland,    the Isle of Man, north of England,         and then across      the
North     Sea towards Denmark.         Further than that  distance    facts have
 not yet been gathered, but in the course of time they will be obtained
and collated.
     The general effect of    these storms was felt unequally in our islands,
 and much less inland than on the coasts.
     Lord Wrottesley      has   shown by observations made at his obser
 vatory in Staffordshire, that the wind is diminished or checked by
 its passage over land      ; and, looking to the mountain ranges       of Wales
 and Scotland, rising 2000, 3000, or 4000 feet above the level of the
  ocean, we see they must have great power to alter the direction and
  probably the velocity of wind, independently of alterations caused
  by changes    of temperature.      The very remarkable similarities of this
  storm of the    1 st and 2nd   of November, that of the 25th     and 26th of
  October, the series of storms investigated by Dr. Lloyd during ten
  years,   and  the observations of     Mr. William   Stevenson    in Berwick
  shire, require special notice on this occasion.        There is no discre
  pancy between the results of the ten years' investigations published
  by Dr. Lloyd in the Transactions         of the Irish Academy, the three
  years' inquiry       published by Mr. William Stevenson, and all the
  investigatious which have been brought together during the last four
   years.    They all tell the same story. Dr. Lloyd only found in ten
   years   one instance of even a partial storm which differed, namely,
   one that came from the north in the first instance.
       Storms from the south-west are followed by sudden and dangerous
   storms from the north or east, and these are the storms that do
   most damage       on our coasts.     Upon tracing the   facts,   it is proved
   that the storms which come from the west and south come on gra

                                         565
dually, but that storms from the north              or   east begin suddenly, and
at times with extraordinary force.
   The barometer, with       these north-eastern storms,           does not give so
much warning upon this coast,            because     it  ranges   higher than with
the wind from the opposite quarter.             But though      the barometer does
not give much indication of        a  north-eastern gale, the thermometer
does, and the now well-known average temperature                   of every week in
the year affords the caution.       The temperature being much above or
below the mean     for the time of year shows whether the wind will be
northerly or southerly — thanks to           Mr. Glaisher's discussion of the
Greenwich observations for temperature.
   To revert  to a few  of the signs which        preceded the     "Charter Gale."
For  a few  days before that storm came on, the thermometer was ex
ceedingly low over all the country         ;   there were north winds in some
places, and a good deal     of snow    ;  though there had been         a great deal
of exceedingly dry and hot weather previously.                    These anomalies
require consideration    ; and it may be mentioned that everywhere in
these islands, for days before that time, from the 22nd to the 25th               of
October, barometers were very low.              Many days preceding the Char
ter storm, an extraordinary clearness           in the atmosphere was noticed
in the north of Ireland    ;   the mountains of Scotland were never seen
so prominently     as they were      in the      few days preceding those        on
which the great storm took place.             Every   one is aware that last sum
mer was remarkable for its warmth.                 It   was exceedingly dry and
hot.    All over the world, not only         in the Arctic, but in the Antarctic
regions, in Australia, South America, in the West Indies, Bermudas,
and elsewhere,  auroras and meteors were unusually prevalent, and they
were   more remarkable in their features            and appearances       than had
been noticed for many years.           There was also an extraordinary dis
turbance of currents along telegraph wires.               They   were so disturbed
at times, that   it was evident there were            great   electric or magnetic
storms in the atmosphere, though they could be traced to no appa
rent cause.
   Probably these electric disturbances were connected with a peculiar
action of the sun upon our atmosphere.                Submarine wires, as well as
electrical wires above ground, were unusually disturbed,                  and these
disturbances were     followed within two or three days by great com
motions in the atmosphere, or by some remarkable change.

    The question of areas of barometric pressure— or lines (which Espy
 contends   for), namely, long lines from north to south, or from one
 point direct to another, having been much discussed, the principal
 object of making the sections,         as it were       soundings, of the atmo
 sphere which are shown      in the diagrams, was to prove whether lines of
 pressure, or whether areas of pressure prevailed ; and in the author's
 opinion, when they are closely examined they go to prove that while
 the atmosphere     in the British Islands       varies in its pressure from time
 to time, such variation is not along a particular             line, but extended
over a large and wide area.
    As remarkable exceptions to the           force   of  these particular storms,
it may be noted that at some places                there was little or no wind      ;
although the barometer fell much, without any consequence                 but rain.
The wind circulating around these districts did not affect them, while
at other places the storm was tremendous.
    The following    few details are given respecting the data on which
the diagrams have       been constructed       : —
The probable limits      of error of   the barometric curves on the synoptic
              charts, 2\st October to 2nd November, 1859.
    1. Observations quite correct. — The observations at the regular
observatories,    such as Greenwich,         Oxford,      Cambridge, Wrottesley,
High field House, Kew, &c,         have     had all corrections applied, and
have   been   reduced    to sea-level,   and the temperature of 32° Fahr
enheit.
       Error probably very small,         less certainly     than                —
    2.                                                             half a tenth.
The returns from members of the British              and Scottish Meteorological
Society (nearly ninety in number) have been corrected for height
above   sea-level,   within  a few   feet   ;    and   the corrections of instru
mental errors with reductions to 32° have been applied.
    Observations probably within a few hundredths of an inch. — The
continental observations, collected from Dutch papers and from the
" Moniteur,"     have been reduced      to 32°, and have also been corrected
for instrumental errors.
    The heights of    some stations     are known,        and the corrections due
to those heights have been applied, while others are but little,               if at
all, above the sea-level.

                                         567
   Any error in laying down         curves from these data can scarcely have
exceeded two or three hundredths            of an inch.
   3.   Observations less accurate.        — The     heights of the stations of
some observers        are not known      so nearly.       Other corrections have
been applied only in a few       cases, — the observations sometimes recorded
only to the nearest tenth, as at a few lighthouses, not being deemed
sufficiently reliable.
   Returns in which the barometrical observations are evidently erro
neous    (from comparison with other neighbouring                 and contempora
neous observations) have been rejected.
   On the whole it may         be safely assumed       that the observations from
which the curves are laid down are less than a tenth in error.
   4. Lighthouses.      —The     heights of the lantern above the sea-level,
and   of the tower, being known, the heights of the barometers               have
been ascertained,      and corrections for the heights have been applied.

dually rises for about half an hour.                            If   it   be now submitted to
distillation,     it   begins to boil at 94°          C,     and between this temperature
and 140°      a    considerable quantity of              a   colourless liquid distils over.
The distillation then suddenly                  stops,     the thermometer rises rapidly,
and, to avoid secondary products of decomposition, the operation
should now be interrupted.                  The materials remaining in the retort
solidify, on cooling, into             a   mass of large crystals, which are com              a

    This body, for which              we propose the name boric ethide, is pro
duced by the following reaction                 :   —

        Boracic etber.            Zincetbyl.                 Boric ethide.             Ethylate of zinc.
    The ethylate of zinc thus formed combines with zincethyl                                         to form
the crystalline compound above alluded to.
    Boric ethide     possesses the following properties                            :   — It   is a colourless
mobile liquid of      a   pungent odour             ;       its vapour is very irritating to the
mucous membrane, and provokes                           a   copious flow of tears.                  The     spe
cific gravity of boric ethide at 23° C. is -6961                               ;       it boils at    95°   C,
and the results of several              determinations of its vapour-density give
the number 3-4006.     The calculated vapour-density of boric ethide,
volumetrically composed like terchloride of boron, is 3-3824.
   Boric ethide is insoluble in water, and is very slowly decomposed
by prolonged contact with it.                   Iodine          has    scarcely any action upon
it,   even at 100°   C.      It   floats upon concentrated nitric acid for several
minutes without change            ;   but suddenly             a   violent oxidation takes place,
and crystals of boracic acid                separate.               When boric ethide vapour
comes in contact with the air               it      produces slight bluish-white                      fumes,
which have      a    high temperature.                       The liquid        is       spontaneously in
flammable in air, burning with                  a   beautiful green and somewhat fuli
ginous flame.        In contact with pure oxygen                          it   explodes.            Placed in
a   flask and allowed to oxidize gradually, first in dry air and finally in
dry oxygen,     it   forms   a    colourless liquid, which boils at                           a   higher tem
perature than boric ethide, but cannot be distilled under atmospheric
 pressure without partial decomposition.                             In   a   stream        of dry carbonic
 acid this product of oxidation evaporates without residue.                                         By distil

     This compound dissolves instantly in                      water, and       is   resolved into
alcohol and         a   volatile white crystalline body, which may be sublimed
without change,             at   a   gentle heat,   in    a   stream    of carbonic acid,           and
then condenses             in magnificent crystalline              plates      like naphthaline.

evaporates          slowly at ordinary temperatures, undergoing at the same
time partial decomposition, and invariably leaving                          a   slight residue of
boracic acid.  Its vapour tastes intensely sweet.       reddens litmus      It

heat      it   fuses, and at     a   higher temperature boils with partial decom
position.
     We    are at present        engaged with the further study                 of   these bodies,
and with the corresponding reactions                      of zincethyl upon silicic,                car
bonic, and oxalic ethers.

that every number is composed of 4 square                                        numbers (0 [or zero]
being considered as an even square).                                   If   every odd number be com
posed       of   4 square          numbers, then every even number must also be
composed of                4 square     numbers          ;    for every even number must, on a
continued division by 2, ultimately become                                       an odd number.                     The
paper relates chiefly to the Table which accompanies                                             it,   from which
it   appears         that   a   remarkable law obtains as to the division of odd
numbers          (2»+l)          into   4       square        numbers —when              a       number of the
form 4n          +1    is   divisible into        2    square numbers, which (as An                             +   1   is
an odd number) must be one                            of them odd, the other even. Before
explaining the Table,                 it   is   proper to state that              if    an odd number be
divisible into         4    square numbers, three                   of them must             be odd, and one
of   them even, or one of them must be odd, and                                  3   of them           even, other
wise their sum cannot be an odd number                                  ;   it   follows from this that                 if
the difference between any two of them be an odd number, the differ
                                                                        -                        -
ence between the other two must be an even number, and vice versd                                                       ;
for let     aa   +   + <? + da = 2n + then aa b' = 2p,
                      b'                          1
                                                  ,         da must equal
                                                                  if                        ca
2q+l;         if   possible let e2—d'=2r, then aa— b2+e'— <P=2p+2r                                                      ;
add 2b'      +    2d2 (an even number) to each, and aa b' + ca+da will be            +
an     even number,              which by the hypothesis                      it   is   not      ;   if,    therefore,
a2—     b'   be an even number, e2— da cannot also be an even number,
and therefore must be an odd one.                                  If, therefore, the four roots of
the squares into which any odd number may be divided are arranged
in any order there will be three differences                            ;   the two exterior differences
will    be one odd, the other even                    ;      the middle difference may be either
odd or even.
     The Table             is   arranged thus: — the lowest row of figures                                     is   the
series      1,   5,   9,    13, 17, &c.         (4n+         1)
                                                              ;    the next row above                  is   the series
of natural numbers,                   0,   1,    2,    3,     4,   &c. (n), &c.         ;    the next row               is
1,     3,   5,   7,    9,    &c.      (2n+l)          the odd numbers;                   each          of the odd
numbers          is   the first term in           a   series increasing upwards by the num

                                                             572
bers 2, 4, 6, 8, 10,                 &c, forming              an arithmetic                 series        of the second
order (the first and second differences being respectively 2 each) ;
when the number in the lowest row cannot be divided into 2 squares,
the arithmetic series is not formed, and the squares are marked                                                       with
an asterisk, but when the number An                                     +    1    is divisible into 2 square
numbers, the roots of these squares                                    constitute the two exterior                       dif
ferences    of the roots into which the odd number may be divided, and
also   of the roots into which each term of the series increasing upward
may be divided              ;    the middle difference of the roots will be the smaller
half of the sum of the                         2    roots of the square                     numbers into which
4»+     1   may be divided, with a negative sign, and will increase by                                                   1   in
each successive term of the upward series.
     For     example,           in the Table take the number                               29    in the lowest row,
7x4+1 = 29,                 7 is     the number above                      it,   and       7x2+1 = 15            the odd
number, which               is      the first term of the series 15, 17, 21, 27, 35, &c.
Now        29    is   composed of              2     square        numbers,            4    and 25, whose             roots
are    2    and
                    5,
                    2       +   5   = 7; the smaller half                        is   3,   and       2,   —3,   5   will be
the differences                 of the roots of the                    squares         into which 15 may be
divided, and whose sum will equal                                 1
                                                                  ;     thus
                                                        2,   -3,       5

the roots when squared and added together equal 15, and the other
terms       of the     series follow               in like manner, obeying the law indicated                                 ;

The proof of all this depends on property of numbers mentioneda
in the Philosophical Transactions for 1854, vol. cxliv. p. 317.
   If any number be composed of two triangular numbers, will also                                           it
equal      a    square and           a   double triangular number.                              If
                                                   n—              H              ,
                                                          2                2
it   will      be     of the form a'                + a +    b1,    and may be assumed                           equal       to

                                          573
a2  + a+ba.      For  if 2 numbers be both odd or both even, they may
always be represented by          a+b and         a — b;   if  one be odd and the
other even, they may always be represented by                    a+6+1 and a—b,
or by a+    b  and  a—b+l      ; and   if the    two numbers be made the bases
of trigonal numbers, the sum of the two trigonal uumbers will
always be of the form a' + a + ba, or a' + b + ba : now when any
number in the natural series of numbers is composed                     of two trian
gular numbers, it may be represented               by a' + a +    ba, and 4n + l will
then equal     4a' + 4a+ 1 +46", — obviously           the sum of an odd and an
 even square,     whose roots are 26 and 2a +           1 ;   and 2n +   1, the    corre
 sponding odd number, will equal            2aa+2a+l        + 26J, — obviously com
 posed   of 4 square numbers, whose roots are b, b, a, a +             1 ;   and  if they
 be arranged thus,
                               26, — (a      + b) 2a+l
                                  —6,    6,   —a,   «+l,
  so that the sum    of their roots may equal           1,  the exterior differences
  of the roots will   be 26 and 2a +        1, the roots of the two squares into
  which 4n + 1 is divisible ; and the middle difference will be — (a + b),
  the smaller half of the sum of the roots (26+2a + 1) with a nega
  tive sign ; if  the exterior differences       be reversed     and the middle dif
  ference be increased    by 1,  the differences will be 2a + 1 , — (a + 6— 1),
  26, and the roots whose sum          will    equal  1  will   be, with     their differ
  ences above them,
                           2a+l,     -(a + 6-1),         26
                          -(a+1), «-(6-l),              6+1,
  and the sum of the squares of the roots will be 2 more                   ;  from these
  two sets of roots all the rest may be obtained, by adding one to each
  of two roots   and subtracting     1  from each of the other two roots             ; the
   exterior differences   of the roots will therefore always be the same,
   and the middle difference will increase by 1 at each step ; the sum
   of the squares   of the roots will     increase by
                                  2, 4,     6,  8, &c.
.  As the  sum   of any two   square numbers         of which      one is odd and the
   other even (4«a + 4a + +46a) must be of the form 4n+l, every
                              1
   possible case of an odd square combined with an even square must
   occur somewhere in the series
                                 1,  5, 9,     13,  &c,
   and the Table    (if extended)     must contain every possible case of odd

                                                   574
and even numbers as exterior differences,                          combined with every pos
sible and available middle difference                 ;   for negative differences may be
rejected, inasmuch as,              if the   roots be put according to their algebraic
value, all the differences               must be even     ;   thus the roots and differences
of   15   above were
                                              2,   -3, 5
                                            -1,    1, -2,     3;
if the
     roots be placed according to their algebraic value, they would
be —2, — 1, 1, 3, and with the differences above
                                               1, 2, 2
                                            -2, -1,       1,3;
15   will therefore       be found in the column above 5, and in the                           fourth
place.      The Table (extended indefinitely) would therefore contain
every     possible odd number the sum of whose roots may equal 1 .
     It   is possible that this connexion between                   the roots of the squares
into which An +           1   may be divided, with the exterior differences of
the roots of the four square                   numbers into which               In +   1   may be
divided, formed part of the mysterious properties of numbers                                       to
which Fermat alluded when he announced the theorems of the poly
gonal numbers.

     Succinic       acid bears           the same relation to the diatomic alcohol
(glycol)     that propionic              acid bears to ordinary alcohol.               Propionic
acid can be obtained by treating the cyanide of the alcohol radical
with potash. Can succinic acid be obtained by treating the cyanide
of the glycol radical with the same reagent, or is it an isomeric acid
that is formed under these circumstances                       1

     The following experiments            were performed with the view                 of   deter
mining this point      :—
  Preparation of Cyanide of Ethylene. — As a preliminary step to
the formation of succinic acid in this way, it became of course neces
sary to prepare the cyanide of ethylene.    This body I obtained by
submitting bromide of ethylene to the action of cyanide of potassium.
  The process was thus conducted : — A mixture of two equivalents
of the cyanide      and one         of the bromide       was introduced into a large
balloon, together with          a   considerable quantity of alcohol, sp. gr. "840,
and exposed to the temperature               of   a water-bath, a      Liebig's condenser
having been previously attached to the balloon in such a manner as
to prevent the alcohol from distilling                  off the reacting ingredients.
As    soon as all the cyanide         of potassium had         been converted into bro
mide, the alcohol was separated               and distilled.          A semifluid         residue
was thus obtained, which                 was filtered at the temperature                  of   100°
Cent.      On treating the filtrate with          a   saturated solution of chloride of
calcium,    a   reddish oil rose to the surface, which was well washed with
ether,   and exposed           for some time to the temperature of 140°,                         in
order to remove        any bromide of ethylene that might have escaped
the solvent action of the ether.               This body proved, on analysis, to
be cyanide      of ethylene.        It   was not, however, quite pure.                There are
difficulties attending its complete purification                    which    I   have not yet
overcome.
     At the temperature of the air, cyanide of ethylene is                         a semisolid
crystalline mass of        a   brownish colour.         It    melts under 50° Cent.              It
is very soluble in water and alcohol, and sparingly soluble in ether.
It   cannot be distilled.           Nevertheless it bears a tolerably high tem
perature without       suffering much decomposition.                     Heated with an
alcoholic solution of potash, it gives                  off ammonia.             Treated with
nitric acid, it forms a body which crystallizes from alcohol in long
needles.        This and   some other reactions           I   am at present engaged              in
studying.
   Preparation of Succinic Acid. — Bromide of ethylene and cyanide
of potassium were made to react upon each other in the same manner
as in the preparation          of the cyanide of ethylene.              As   soon as the re
action was complete, the alcohol was separated                       from the bromide of
potassium, some sticks of caustic potash were added to                             it,    and the
whole heated for several days by means of                     a   water-bath.      Torrents of
     Vol. X.                                                                      2   R

                                         576
ammoniawere given off on applying the heat. As soon as the evolution
of this    gas had ceased,    the alcohol was distilled off and the residue
treated with     a   considerahle excess of hydrochloric                 acid.        This was
then heated gently as long as acid vapours continued to be evolved,
digested    with absolute alcohol, and filtered, and then the filtrate was
evaporated    to dryness.    The dry    mass thus obtained was treated several
times with alcohol in a similar manner.                The result of       these repeated
digestions was then dissolved in water, and                a few   drops of   a   solution   of
nitrate of silver were added to        it,   which occasioned       slight precipitate
                                                                     a
of chloride of silver. This     was separated          by filtration, and the filtrate
was exactly neutralized      with ammonia.            On adding excess of nitrate of
silver to this, an abundant white precipitate was obtained, very soluble
in nitric acid   and ammonia.       This          gave, on analysis, numbers agree
ing very well with the composition of succinate                    of silver.         The acid
itself possessed     also all the properties         of succinic acid.           It   sublimed
on the application of heat, was soluble in water, alcohol, and ether,
and gave, when neutralized,        a     reddish-brown             precipitate with per-
chloride of iron.       Moreover, on digesting this precipitate with am
monia, an acid could be detected    in the filtered liquor, which gave
white precipitates with nitrate of silver, and with    mixture of chlo
                                                                     a
ride of barium and alcohol.
  Succinic acid can then be obtained from glycol in the same manner
as propionic     acid from ordinary alcohol            ;   the bromide of ethylene,
the point from which     I    started, being capable of derivation from the
diatomic alcohol.
I    propose extending this investigation to some other hydrocarbons
of the    series C„ Hn, with the view         of ascertaining whether or not the
homologues of succinic acid can be obtained from these bodies by                             a
similar process.
IV. "Results of          Researches          on    the Electric         Function of the
      Torpedo."      By Professor Carlo Matteucci of Pisa. In
     a     Letter to Dr. Sharpey, Sec. R.S. Received August                                  3,

  " It    has hitherto been believed          that the action of the electric organ
of the Torpedo        was    momentary only; — that                it   becomes        charged

                                                    577
under the influence of nervous action and discharged immediately
that action ceases, somewhat like soft iron under the influence of an
electric current.            Such, however, is not the real state of the case.
The electric organ is always charged. It may be conclusively shown
by experiment that the action of that organ never ceases, and that
round the body of a Torpedo, and probably of every other electric
fish, there is       a   continual circulation         of electricity in the liquid me
dium in which the animal is                     immersed.   In fact, when the electric
                                                it,
organ, or even a fragment of                    is     removed     from the living fish and
placed between           the ends of        a    galvanometer, the needle remains de
flected at     a   constant angle for twenty or thirty hours, or even longer.
     "
     I   must here explain that in electro-physiological experiments                            it
is   highly advantageous to employ, as extremities of the galvanometer,
plates of amalgamated zinc immersed in neutral saturated solution
                                                              a
of sulphate of zinc. This arrangement, which can be worked with
the greatest        facility,      gives   a    perfectly homogeneous circuit,             leaving
the needle         at zero    in an instrument of 24,000 coils              ;     the liquid in
contact with the animal part experimented on has the greatest pos
sible conductibility while  does not act chemically on the tissue,
                                           it
and the apparatus             is   entirely free from secondary polarity.
       " To   return to the Torpedo.                 The electric organ, or       a   portion of
 it,   detached     from the fish and kept at the temperature of freezing,
preserves       its electromotive properties for four, six, or even eight
days   and an organ which has been kept for twenty-four hours in
         ;
                                                                                                a
vessel surrounded with   frigorific mixture of ice and salt,
                                     a                         found to               is
possess an electromotive power
                                 as great as that of the organ recently
detached       from the living fish.                Thus the electric organ retains its
functional activity long after both muscular and nervous excitability
have been extinguished.
       " What then       is   the action of the nerves on this apparatus               ?     Here
again experiment affords
                                       a    very distinct and conclusive answer.              De
tach the organ of            a   live torpedo and cut       it    into two equal portions, in
such   way as to leave each half in connexion with one of the large
         a
nervous trunks   place the two halves on
                         ;                   plate of gutta percha,a
with electric couples opposed                   ;   that is, with the similar surfaces (say
the dorsal) in contact and connect the two free (ventral) surfaces
                                   ;
with the extremities of the galvanometer. There will usually be no
deflection of the needle,                or, at most,     a   very slight effect which will
                                                                          2   R   2

                                        578
soon disappear.       Now, after having opened the circuit            of the galva
nometer, irritate the nerve of one of the segments,             by pinching,      by
the interrupted      electric current,    or in any other way      ;  or prick the
piece   itself with   a needle.    The portion of organ thus stimulated
will give several discharges in succession, and a rheoscopic frog's limb
with its nerve applied to the part will each time be thrown into vio
lent convulsions.       If, after this, the galvanometer      be applied as be
fore, there   will be a very strong deflection      in a direction answering to
the segment     stimulated.      This deviation endures for          a short time,
but gradually becomes less, so that in         a few minutes the effect of the
two segments is equal.         Stimulation    now of the other segment will
in like manner render its electricity predominant.               These alterna
tions may be repeated several times, but naturally the effect becomes
less and less marked.
    " Thus   the electromotive apparatus becomes charged and acts in
dependently of the influence of the nerves, but that influence renews
and renders persistent the activity          of the apparatus.         We know,
moreover, that the discharge, which is only a state of temporary in
creased activity    of the organ, is brought on by an act of the will in
the live animal, or by the excitation of the nerves of the organ.
   "I    shall not enter now into further details respecting my recent
experiments on the Torpedo,           but   I venture to think that we have
really made a step towards clearing up the theory of the animal elec
tromotive apparatus.         The organ of the Torpedo       does not, under the
influence of the nerves, act as an induction apparatus           ;   the operation
seems more analogous to that         of a 'secondary pile,' created,       through
the influence of the nerves, in each constituent cell of the organ.
    " The   case is very different in muscular action, the changes occur
ring in which are better understood now that we know the pheno
mena    of muscular respiration.        I  do not here refer to the variation
of the muscular current which           takes   place at the moment         of  con
traction.     In that   case it would appear from experiment, as            I lately
showed,    that there are indications of       a current in an opposite direc
tion  ;  but the conditions of the animal structure in action are                 so
complex that no inference can be drawn as to the intimate nature of
the phenomenon.           It is otherwise, however,     in comparing        muscles
which have been left at rest       with muscles which       have     been fatigued
by repeated contraction.         Being still  engaged    in the investigation of

                                          579
 this matter,   I shall content myself now with mentioning one result of
 my inquiry, which        I  consider as well established       ; the result, in fact,
 of performing on        muscles    the same kind of experiment as the one
 above described on the organ          of the Torpedo.        The experiment is as
 follows : — Having      selected    a series of muscles, entire or divided,
 which have been proved (by my method of opposed muscular piles)
 to be equal in electromotive power          ; subject a certain number of them
 to repeated stimulation, and then, by means of the method of opposed
 couples, compare the muscles which have been exercised with those
 which have been left at rest, and it will be found that the latter
 will manifest     a much greater degree          of electromotive power than
 the   former.    The nervous excitation, which             causes   muscular con
 traction, developes       heat,   generates   mechanical force and consumes
 chemical affinity    ;   and as the electromotive apparatus of muscle
 operates through means          of that affinity, it must    get weakened,     like a
pile in which the acid has become weaker.                 In  the Torpedo, on the
other hand, there is neither heat nor mechanical force produced, and
the electromotive apparatus is set up again, as it were, through the
influence of the nerves, after the manner of            a  secondary pile."

    The purple dye so esteemed by the ancients has by turns excited
the curiosity of naturalists and of historians.                    The number of
memoirs upon the subject is considerable, and they are to be found
in almost all tongues.           However, in all these works, remarkable in
many respects, and which cannot be analysed in this short notice,
three deficiencies      are to be noted regarding           matters of very great
moment in the history         of this  substance.
    What    are, 1st, the producing        organs? 2ndly, the nature?          3rdly,
the natural     primitive colour of the dye        ?   It  is difficult to give any
answer     to these three questions by means of the facts contained in
existing memoirs.          It is for the purpose of replying to them that            I
                     * Translation received August 22, 1860.

                                       580
have undertaken       the investigation, whose chief results               I   have the
honour now to lay before the scientific world.
    The two     genera    Murex and Purpura             have       yielded the species
observed.  In very distant localities, as at Mahon in Minorca, Murex
brandaris, M. trunculus, and Purpura hamartoma have furnished
results which     observations conducted at Boulogne on Purpura                          la-
pillus, at Pornic (Vendee) on the same species and Murex erinaceus,
and at La Rochelle and L'lle de Rhe, have confirmed. At Marseilles,
Murex brandaris          has   yielded altogether similar results;             and this
concordance of all the observations permits me to offer them with
much confidence.
   What is the organ which produces the dye 1
   The analogy which some chemists imagine they have found
between the colour of alloxan or of murexide and the purple of the
Mollusca, has led them to misconceive          the nature of the organ which
produces the colouring          matter.   It is indubitable that uric acid
treated    with nitric acid    gives a beautiful reddish purple colour when
the residue is exposed          to ammoniacal vapour           ;    and this reaction
furnishes    a means of detecting the renal organ in mollusks.                           But
from this circumstance no one could be justified in concluding that
the purple dye was either the secretion          of the kidney or the result of
a   modification of the urine.
    Careful dissection of the purpuriferous             mollusca proves that the
purple dye is secreted by a very limited portion of the mantle, which
can in no way be confounded with the true renal organ, as which
the organ of Bojanus is now generally regarded ; the position and
the structure    of the purpuriferous organ         are indeed totally different
from those of the kidney.
  Small in extent, this part occupies very nearly the space bounded
by the branchiae and the rectum, beyond whose extremities it
hardly extends     anteriorly, while posteriorly         it,   at most, reaches          the
organ of Bojanus.         It   forms neither   a   sac nor     a    reservoir, as   it   has
been stated to do        and these phrases, as well as             purpuriferous vein,'
                                                           '
                    ;
should be rejected, because          the organ     is   simply extended over the
surface.
    Large elongated cells, placed perpendicularly side by side on the
surface    of the pallial cavity in the direction of its            greatest   diameter,
compose its tissue.        They form about two or three layers,                the most

                                                        581
exterior of which, covered                       with vibratile            cilia, presents the most
developed           cells.       Below lies       a     very rich capillary                network, which
distributes the blood coming from the organ of Bojanus and the
neighbouring parts of the mantle to the branchiae.                                         The    cells, when
they have reached                  maturity,           fall into the pallial                cavity, become
endosmotically distended, burst, and mingle their contents with the
other mucus which already existed there.                                       This independent and
isolated shedding of the histological                            elements        constitutes the secre
tion of the dye-stuff, which, it is obvious, is uot produced by a com
pound gland, or indeed by any gland in the proper sense of the
word, but by a glandular                     portion of the pallial surface.                        It     is the
granular but soluble matter contained in these cells which possesses
singular properties, and constitutes the dye-stuff.
     The peculiar layer              whose       position has just been indicated is not
special,        anatomically speaking, to the two genera Murex and                                          Pur
pura      ;    and this is important             if,   in looking at the matter morpholo
gically,       a   similar part of the surface                   of the mantle of most                     gaste
ropods appears to produce                    a   substance        of like histological character,
but different in its properties.                        In the Aplysiee and the Snails                      it   is
naturally coloured, whilst in Turbo                         littoralis and Trochus cinereus
it   is   colourless, and undergoes                    no modification               by   the action       of   the
solar rays.
     Thus, then,        it   is    incorrect to say, with some chemists, that, ana
tomically speaking, the purple dye-stuff                             is   yielded by the kidneys of
Mollusca.
     Anatomical         investigation has led to the recognition in the genera
Murex and Purpura of                         peculiar anal gland placed alongside the
                                      by a
rectum, and opening                      a    terminal pore close to the anus.                              This
gland, which does not seem to have been described                                            hitherto,      is   in
structure and the arborescent disposition                                 of its secretory             caeca,    a
well-defined gland           ;     and   by   this very circumstance                  it   is   impossible to
confound         it   with the purpuriferous organ.
     Properties         of   the   Purple Dye-stuff.             —   A    very curious fact, known
from all antiquity, since the very existence of the dye depends upon
                                         of the dye-stuff                 by
it,
is        the transformation                                                   the action of the solar
rays.          In the living animal this                 substance         is   at first colourless, or
more          or less yellowish      ;   exposed to the light                   of   the sun,     in   a   moist
state     it   acquires      a   pure violet hue        ;   in   a   word,      it   is   photogenic.

                                       582
   The solar action      causes the three    simple colours to be developed
successively,     and in the following      order,   yellow,   blue, and red.
 Between these, the compound colours green             and violet which result
from their mixture, are obtained with the greatest distinctness            if the
action is slow.       But whilst the yellow disappears by prolonged
action, a   considerable amount of blue always remains ; whence in
nature the final red is never pure, so that the dye always inclines
more or less to violet.
   These properties have been placed beyond doubt by the possibility
of making photographs on silk and cambric, which exhibit a remark
able delicacy in detail, combined with great strength          of tone.
   In  a photograph obtained       in this way,   the different tints through
which the dye-stuff passes before becoming violet are more or less to
be seen, but the deep violet predominates, and represents            the black
of ordinary photographs.
   The changes in the colour of the purple dye-stuff are accompanied
by the production of a very penetrating foetid odour, similar to that
of  essence    of garlic.   The evolution of this odour is          as charac
teristic of the solar action as the changes of colour, a consideration
of much importance when we desire to solve the problem to which
I now turn — What was the primitive colour of the purple stuffs of
antiquity  1
   At first sight this question        seems   to be easily answered     ;   but
when one seeks for     a precise  signification of the word
                                                                " purple,"   one
soon becomes embarrassed.         If we  ask  a painter, without telling him
why, — Be     so good as to paint the shade which          you would give to
a purple    drapery in    a  historical painting — each painter to whom
the request     is made   will give   a different colour.     This is the   case
because no one has an exact idea        of the primitive colour, which       has
been gradually modified, and which has now become              the red, almost
scarlet,  which many painters understand by the word purple.                   It
is only by the interpretation of the phrases of the ancients, and com
paring them with direct observations, that one arrives at a solution
of the difficulty, which would appear        to be  of great use to art.
   It  is enough to remark that the purple colour exists only because
it has been developed       by the sun, in justification    of the conclusion
that the ancients must have been acquainted with this peculiarity,
as  also  with that of the development of the characteristic foetid

                                       583
odour.     Pliny, moreover,    speaks     of both, and    hence  it cannot be
doubted that the purple was produced formerly exactly as at present,
unless we admit that the animals and their dye-stuff have changed,
which would be an altogether gratuitous hypothesis.            The conclusion
to which we are driven then is this     :  the colour was produced formerly
as at present, under the same conditions and with the same characters,
so that  it ought to  have been similar to that which we now obtain.
   In simple and natural experiments the violet has never failed to
appear,   while pure red has always been absent.           One is led to con
clude, therefore, that the natural          and unmodified      purple of the
ancients was violet, as it is now; for whoever discovered it must
have made the experiment, as         it  has been so often repeated,   on the
sea-shore,    by breaking a purpuriferous        mollusk,   and crushing   its
mantle on moist linen which is exposed to the sun.
   Pliny   cites Cornelius   Nepos, who states positively that at first
the violet purple was esteemed        ; and the passages of Plato and of
Aristotle, which relate to the colour, lead to the same conclusion.
However, it cannot be doubted that though the colour of purple
stuffs was primitively   violet, the requirements of taste and of fashion
led to the variation of its shades.           Thus   some   stuffs were dyed
twice, to give them a richer and more vivid colour — the so-called
'
  purpurea dibapha.'       The mixture of species also contributed to
modify the hues.
   Murex trunculus     gives  an almost blue shade.         The fishermen of
Port Mahon told     me that  it always yielded that colour, and especially
that it would give a   fixed and permanent colour.           On the contrary,
Purpura hamastoma (which they call ' cor              de fel ') was known to
them as staining their linen very permanently and ineffaceably.
   It ought also to be recollected that when mineral colours replaced
the animal matter of mollusks, the hue varied          ; and though the term
•purple' might be retained, it was easy to pass by degrees to the
deep red which rises in the mind when we recollect the purple worn
by cardinals.
   Perhaps also the manipulations         to which the molluscan dye-stuff
may have been subjected by the dyers, and of whose nature we know
nothing, approximated the purple to the red, which Pliny compares
to that of coagulated blood.
   But it remains none the       less demonstrated, both by the passages

                                             584
from ancient authors and by experiment, that the primitive                            and
natural colour of the purple was formerly, as                 now, violet.
    Hence it would appear to be requisite for                  a painter to consider
the epoch when the personages who are represented                     clothed in   purple
drapery lived, for the hue varied with the age.                     The    properties of
the purple dye-stuff also render intelligible one ground of the                   esteem
in which the colour was held               ;  for, developed by the influence           of
light,    it could not      fade, like the red      of cochineal for      example,     but
must always have remained beautiful,                   even  in the luminous          and
dazzling atmosphere of Italy and the East.
    It   would    be difficult,     with the scanty materials we             possess,   to
determine exactly the species employed by the ancients.                         Without
doubt Pliny has indicated the two genera Murex and Purpura of the
moderns by the names Purpura and Buccinum.                         It is  probable that
Murex trunculus and brandaris,                   and Purpura        hamastoma,       were
employed by the dyers           ;  but it would be difficult to identify the dif
ferent species indicated by Pliny.               Zoological investigations,       accom
panied by experiments which are all simply and easily made,                        would
perhaps lead to results more definite than can be obtained by                     the in
terpretation of passages,         if one  could carry them out on the          shores of
countries formerly famous for their purple — those of Tyre for                 example.

VI. " Contributions         towards the History       of Azobenzol and Ben
       zidine."     By P. \V. Hofmann, Ph.D. Communicated by
       Dr. Hofmann. Received July 24, 1860.
   Among       the numerous compounds into which benzol,                when sub
mitted to reagents, is converted, azobenzol and its derivatives have as
yet received      but limited     attention.    Although more than twenty-
five years    have elapsed      since   this interesting body was discovered
by Mitscherlich,      both its formation and its constitution remain still
doubtful.
    Mitscherlich*, who discovered          azobenzol in 1834, when submitting
nitrobenzol to     the action of an alcoholic solution of potassa, repre
sented this compound by the formula
                                      C8H5Nt,
but left the reaction which gives rise to the formation of azobenzol
unexplained.       In   1845   this body was reprepared by Hofmann            and
Muspratt J, who      observed     among the collateral products of the reac
tion    aniline   and   oxalic    acid.     They represent the formation of
azobenzol     by the equation
     2 C0 H5   NO, +
                       0^^=
                                    CJMJ + C8 H7 N + Ca Ha O, + H, O,
     Nitrobenzol.      Alcohol.    Azobenzol. Phenjlamine. Oxalic acid.
adding at the same time that they are far from considering                    this
 equation    as  more than the representation of one phase of the trans
 formation of nitrobenzol, since several other rather indefinite com
pounds or products are formed simultaneously.
    At about the     same period Zinin        made the interesting observation
 that azobenzol     is capable      of fixing hydrogen and of being thereby
 converted into a well-defined base, benzidine, which he represented
 by the formula
                                       C6H8N.
    Considering the physical characters both of azobenzol              and of ben
 zidine, especially the high boiling-points of these substances, and the
 ratio of hydrogen and nitrogen in the latter compound, the sum of

 the number of equivalents of these two elements              not being divisible
 by 2, many chemists were inclined to double the formulae                 of both
 bodies,  and to represent them by the following           expressions : —
                         Azobenzol              Cla H10 Na
                          Benzidine             Cls Hla Na
 This view   received    the first experimental confirmation in the forma
 tion of the nitro-derivatives      of azobenzol, which       were  examined     in
 1849 by Gerhardt       and Laurent.        The formation of
          Nitrazobenzol.. ..      ClaH,NsOa=Cla(H0 NOa)               Na,    of
         Dinitrazobenzol     . .  Cla H8 N4   04=Cla     [H, (N0a)J   Na,
 and of several     derivatives of these      bodies,    having established the
 C,a-formula of azobenzol,       but little doubt could be entertained re
garding the formula of benzidine, which is as readily obtained from
 azobenzol by reducing agents, as       it may   be reconverted into azobenzol
by nitric acid*.
    The molecular value of benzidine being thus almost exclusively
 fixed by the determination of the formula of the compound from
 which it originates, it was of some interest to obtain additional experi
mental evidence for the molecular weight of azobenzol.
    With this view     I  have determined the vapour-density          of azoben
zol.    This body boiling at a rather high temperature, I have availed
myself of the method of displacement lately proposed by Professor
 Hofmann.       Experiment proved the density of the azobenzol-vapour
to be 94 referred to hydrogen as unity, or 6-50 referred to air.             The
theoretical vapour-density of azobenzol, assuming that one molecule
of this compound furnishes,           like the rest of well-examined sub-
                                        1 82
stances,   2 vols.  of vapourf, is           =  91  referred to hydrogen, and
                                          m
6-32 referred to air.
    The determination of the vapour-density, then, plainly confirms the
higher molecular weights proposed for azobenzol              and for benzidine.
    When determining the vapour-density of azobenzol,             I had occasion
to observe that, probably        in consequence      of  a typographical   error,
the boiling-point     of this compound is misstated in all the manuals
which I could consult, and even in the original memoirs of Mit-
scherlich himself.       The boiling-point is stated to be 193° C, whilst
it is in reality  293°   C.

   Benzidine, when expressed by the formula
                                   ClaHlaNa,
presents   itself as a well-defined diacid diamine.          The molecular con
struction of the diatomic base remained to be decided.
   I   have endeavoured to solve            this problem by the process         of
ethylation,    as yet the simplest and         the best guide in determining
questions of this      kind.     Benzidine      in the   presence  of alcohol is
rapidly attacked by iodide of ethyl.             After two hours' digestion at
100°   C. in  sealed tubes,    the reaction is complete. The solution on
evaporation yields a crystalline iodide,
                    C10HaaNaIa=C1aHJa(CaH,)aNaIa,
from which ammonia separates           a   solid crystalline   base very similar
to benzidine.      This compound, which          fuses at 65°   C,   and resolidi
fies at 60°   C,  is diethylbenzidine     :
                      Cle HM Na=C,a        H10 (Ca H5)a Na,
which forms well-crystallizable       salts with     the acids, and yields with
dichloride of platinum a difficultly soluble crystalline platinum-salt
containing
                             Ci6,Haa  N, CI, 2PIC1,.
   When diethylbenzidine is treated again with iodide of ethyl, the
phenomena previously observed repeat themselves.                 The iodide
                    C^NJ^C^H^H^NJ,
is formed, which when decomposed               by ammonia yields tetrethyl-
                       ^ ^ N _c ^ (Ca H)4 ^
benzidine
                                         ^
Tetrethylbenzidine      resembles    the diethylated and the non-ethylated
base.    It  fuses at 85°   C,   resolidifying at 80°     C,  produces with the
acids crystalline compounds, and furnishes with              dichloride of plati
num a platinum-salt of the formula
                            C^H^Cl^PtCl,.
    The further action     of iodide of ethyl upon tetrethylbenzidine is
extremely slow.       After   12 hours'      digestion at 100° C. only a very
minute quantity of the base had been transformed into an iodide.
Iodide of methyl, on the other hand, acts with great energy.                   An
hour's digestion is sufficient to produce the final diammonium-com-
pound.
    The iodide
                 Ca H„ Na Ia=Cia H8 (Ca Hs)4 (CH,)a N, Ia
is very difficultly soluble in absolute alcohol, but dissolves with
facility in boiling water, from which it is deposited on cooling, in

                                               588
long beautiful needles.          The solution of this iodide is no                       longer   pre
cipitated by ammonia, but yields with oxide of silver a powerfully
alkaline solution, exhibiting all the characters of the completely                                sub
stituted ammonium- and diammonium-bases discovered by Professor
Hofmann.       The solution of this dimethyl-tetrethylated                             base, which
contains
             C     TT     N O — Cia H*                      (^3)a       NJ       n
is not further      acted     upon by either iodide of ethyl or methyl.
With acids it forms          a series     of    salts which are remarkable                     for the
beauty with which they crystallize.  The platinum-salt is almost in
soluble in water, but soluble with difficulty in concentrated boiling
hydrochloric     acid, crystallizing            from    this solution           on cooling          in
beautiful needles.         This salt contains
                              CaaH34NaCla,2PtCla.
The   above experiments appear to establish the molecular construction
of benzidine in      a satisfactory          manner.        This       base     is obviously            a
primary diamine, in which the molecular group C,a Hs, whatever                                      its
nature may be, functions            as   a   diatomic radical.              A   glance at         the
subjoined Table exhibits the construction of benzidine and of                                     the
several compounds which        I      have described.

VII. " On Bromphenylamine and Chlorphenylamine." By E.
    T. Mills. Communicated by Dr. Hofmann. Received
        July   24, 1860.
    Nitrophenylamine,         when prepared from dinitrobenzol                            (i.   e.   by   the
indirect method), differs in so many respects from the isomeric base
which    is   obtained from phenyl-compounds                        (i.   e.   by the direct method),
that chemists have           distinguished            these         two bodies as alpha- and
beta-nitrophenylamine
                              * — Bromphenylamine                          and chlorphenylamine
have     hitherto      been produced         only by the action of potash upon
bromisatin and chorisatin, the indirect method, by which they were
originally obtained by Dr. Hofmann                        ;   it    appeared therefore of some
interest      to ascertain whether the bodies generated                                 directly      from
 *     The alpha-nitrophenylamine (nitraniline) was formed about sixteen years ago
by Dr. Muspratt and myself (Chem. Soc. Mem. vol. iii. p. 112), by the action of
reducing agents on dinitrobenzol. The beta-nitraniline was discovered by Arppe
(Chem. Soc. vol. viii. p. 175), who obtained this compound when distilling pyro-
tartronitrophenylamide with potash.         The two bases resemble each other in                            a
remarkable    manner; but there are differences in their physical and chemical
characters which leave no doubt as to the fact of their having different constitu
tions.  I  may here remark that        have repeated Arppe's experiments, the results
                                        I
of which  I  can confirm in every particular. Since the phenyl-compound from
which Arppe obtained his substance            accessible only with difficulty,
                                                 is                               have               I
endeavoured to nitronate       amore easily procurable   phenyl-compound. Acetyl-
phenylamide may be used for this purpose with considerable advantage.          solution          A
of the compound in cold fuming nitric acid yields, on the addition of water,                                a
crystalline difficultly soluble precipitate, which easily obtained pure byrecrystal-

and yields, when       heated with potassa, the beta-nitrophenylamine of Arppe with
all its properties.    Imay here recall  former observation, which has now become
                                             a
perfectly intelligible.    When studying the action of nitric acid upon melaniline,
I  found (Chem. Soc. Mem.          t.305) that the dinitromelaniline, which
                                        i.                                     thus                  is
formed, essentially     differs from the dinitromelaniline obtained by submitting
nitrophenylamine (alpha-) to the action of chloride of cyanogen.     The two nitro-
bases, which are both expressed by the formula
                           C11H1iNi04-C„[Hi1(N02)JN„
stand    to each      other in the same relation which obtains                      between     alpha-nitro
phenylamine      and beta-nitrophenylamine.               In   fact,   I       have since found that the
distillation of the nitro-base, obtained by treating alpha-nitrophenylamine with
chloride of cyanogen, furnishes alpha-nitrophenylamine whilst beta-nitrophenyl ;
amine may be detected amongst the products of the distillation of the dinitromel
aniline which     formed directly from melaniline by means of nitric acid. — A. W. H.

                                      590
 compounds of phenylamine would exhibit differences          in their proper
 ties similar to those which distinguish      alpha- and beta-nitrophenyl-
 amine.
     With the view of deciding this question experimentally,           I   have
 submitted acetylphenylamide to the action of bromine and chlorine,
 in the hope of thus forming directly from phenylamine            the bromi-
 nated and chlorinated compounds in question.
                Action of Bromine on Acetylphenylamide.
     A cold aqueous solution of acetylphenylamide, when agitated with
 bromine gradually added in small quantities until the yellow colour
 imparted to the liquid no longer disappears, furnishes a crystalline
 compound difficultly     soluble in cold, but easily recrystallizable    from
 boiling   water.   The   substance   consists chiefly of monobrominated
 acetylphenylamide
                                       (C.H.Br) ]
                    (C„H6BrNO=(CaH,0) \ N,
 which is however invariably       mixed with small quantities      of dibro-
 minated acetylphenylamide
                                      (C.H,Br,))
                  (C„H,BraNO=(C,HaO) I N.

    T  have  not been able to find a method of separatmg these             two
bodies perfectly.
    The brominated compound is readily attacked by potash.                  On
distilling the mixture, the vapour of water carries over a volatile
body which solidifies in the condenser into beautiful acicular crystals,
acetate   of potassium remaining in the retort.
    The solidified distillate  was purified by recrystallization  from boil
ing water, and submitted to analysis.         Both the combustion of the
base itself and the platinum-determination         of the beautiful golden-
yellow platinum-salt proved this body to be bromphenylamine
                       C,H6BrN=

    In its appearance,   odour, and taste, as likewise in its deportment
with acids and with        solvents generally, the brominated       base ob
tained from acetylbromophenylamide          resembles   perfectly the brom
phenylamine produced from bromisatin,           a specimen   of which   I ob

                                       591
tained from Dr. Hofmann's          collection.    There is only one point in
which    a   slight  difference was      observed.     Both compounds         are
capable   of crystallizing either in   needles or in well-defined octahedra,
the former being generally obtained from water, and the latter from
alcohol.    The bromphenylamine, obtained from the acetyl-compound,
appears    to be more inclined to crystallize in needles than in octa
hedra.     Circumstances      have  prevented me from entering into an
examination of the products           of decomposition of the two brom-
phenylamines      ; and  the question whether these two bodies are really
identical, or similarly related as the two nitro-compounds,            must be
decided by further experiments*.
                 Action of Chlorine     on Acetylphenylamide.
   The phenomena         observed    in the action of chlorine      on a cold
saturated solution of the phenyl-compound             are perfectly similar to
those   presented in the corresponding           reaction with   bromine.       A
crystalline compound immediately separates from the solution                ;  as
soon as the crystals cease to augment, the current        of chlorine is inter
rupted.      Washed with       cold, and once recrystallized from boiling
water,   the chlorinated      body is found to be nearly perfectly pure
monochlorinated acetylphenylamide

the constitution of which,          as far as my experiments        go, may  be re
presented     by the formula
                    [C,(H,Na')0][C7(H4)HaN)0]l
    There are not less than three other compounds known which                   em
pirically may      be represented       by the same formula as amidobenzoic
acid, viz. nitrotoluol,        salicylamide, and anthranilic      acid.    The  two
former substances         differ from amidobenzoic acid both physically         and
chemically in a marked manner             ; anthranilic acid, on the other hand,
is so closely allied to the benzoic derivative, that special experiments
were   required to distinguish          these two bodies.     Gerland, when       he
submitted the two acids to Piria' swell-known            reaction, observed that
both are converted by nitrous acid into non-nitrogenated acids, which,
although still isomeric, essentially differ in their properties ; amido
benzoic acid being transformed into a new acid, — oxybenzoic                   acid,
whilst anthranilic acid yields salicylic acid.
    It appeared     of   some interest to    try whether the substitution of ni
trogen for hydrogen in anthranilic              acid would furnish a compound
isomeric with the double acid obtained from amidobenzoic acid.                    A
current of nitrous acid, when passed into a cold alcoholic solution of
 anthranilic    acid,    rapidly transforms this substance into a compound
 crystallizing    in white prisms, which is easily obtained by allowing
 the alcohol to evaporate         at the common temperature.         The new  body
is extremely soluble in water, insoluble in ether.             By analysis it   was
proved to contain
                                      C   H N O
    The new compound is thus seen to be far from isomeric with the
 derivative of amidobenzoic acid produced under similar circumstances,
 with which, in fact, it shows no analogy whatever.                 I have not yet
 arrived    at a definite       view regarding the molecular construction of
 this body    ;  nevertheless its deportment with water shows even             now
 that the nitrogen in it exists in two different forms.              Gently heated
 with water, the new compound disengages torrents of nitrogen ; on
 cooling, the liquid solidifies into a crystalline mass of salicylic acid,
 free nitric acid remaining in solution.           This metamorphosis is repre
 sented by the equation

 which has been controlled by quantitative experiments.                The   idea
 suggests itself to assume one-fifth     of the nitrogen in the form of nitric
 acid, when the new       body might be viewed as a salt-like compound of
 the formula
                      C7H4Na'OalHNO           .
                      C7H4N,'OJUNO"
 the action of the water consisting simply in the replacement of the
 monatomic nitrogen by the elements of water, which would produce
 salicylic acid, nitric acid being liberated.
     I avail myself of this opportunity of mentioning the deportment of
 several    other isomeric bodies     under the influence of nitrous acid.
 There are two basic compounds,
                                 C.fH.NOJN,
 known    ;  the one is the alphaphenylamine of Hofmann and Muspratt,
the other the betaphenylamine observed by Arppe.               When submitted
to the action of nitrous       acid, these two isomeric bodies        yield two
perfectly different nitrogen-substituted        derivatives.     The  substance
obtained from alphaphenylamine           (the base formed by the reduction
of dinitrobenzol)     has been already mentioned in one of my previous
notes, the body derived from betaphenylamine is              still under  exami
nation.
    The action of nitrous acid proves that there are also two bromphe-
nylamines similar to the two nitrophenylamines.             The original brom-
phenylamine discovered by Hofmann, and which is formed by the di
stillation    of bromisatin with hydrated potash, yields with nitrous
acid   a compound,
                                        (C.H.Br),
                      C„H()BraNa=               N"'

crystallizing    in beautiful golden-yellow      needles,   insoluble in water,
and difficultly soluble in alcohol and ether.           The bromphenylamine,
on the other hand, which was lately prepared by Mills * from acetyl-
bromphenylamide,        exhibits   with nitrous    acid a perfectly    different
deportment, being transformed into a yellow scarcely crystalline com
pound, easily soluble in alcohol and ether, but insoluble in water.            I
have not as yet analysed         this compound     ;  its formation, however,
                           * See the previous abstract.

                                     594
and its properties render    it probable that it will     be found to be iso
meric with the product of decomposition previously mentioned.              I am
engaged    in  a more minute examination of this compound,             which     I
hope may assist in explaining the cause of the still enigmatical             iso
merism exhibited by the derivatives of phenylamine.
   I  have already repeatedly called attention to the different       atomicity
exhibited by nitrogen under different conditions.           In the derivatives
of amidobenzoic and of anthranilic          acids,  it  can   be  proved   that
 1 equiv. of nitrogen replaces       1 equiv. of hydrogen      ; while in the
derivatives of phenylamine,        the nitrogen is present with the value
of three molecules of hydrogen.
   The experiments which I have described           were performed      in  Dr.
Hofmann's laboratory.

       No.    III.  Compound Ammonias by Inverse Substitution.
       By A. W. Hofmann, LL.D., F.R.S., &c. Received July
       24, 1860.
   Many     years ago  I showed   that the bromide or iodide of a quartary
ammonium splits under the influence of heat into the bromide or
iodide of an alcohol-radical on the one hand, and a tertiary monamine
on the other.
   Having lately returned      to the study  of this   class  of substances,   I
was led to examine       the deportment, under the influence        of heat, of
the tertiary, secondary, and, lastly, of the primary monammonium-
salts.
   Experiment      has  shown that these      substances     undergo an ana
logous decomposition.        The chloride of     a tertiary    monammonium
when submitted to distillation yields, together with the chloride of an
alcohol-radical, a secondary monamine        ;  the chloride of    a secondary
monammonium, together with an alcohol-chloride,              a primary mona
mine   ; lastly, the chloride of   a primary monammonium, the chloride
of an alcohol-radical and ammonia.
   Exactly, then, as my former experiments show that we may rise in
the scale by replacing the four equivalents of hydrogen in ammonium
 one by one by radicals, so it is obvious from these new experiments

                                         595
that  we may also        step by step     descend,      by substituting      again  hy
drogen for the radicals in succession.

   The    above   reactions, interesting when regarded from a scientific
point of view, admit of but limited application                    in practice.    The
purity of the result        is disturbed     by several       circumstances, which
it is difficult   to exclude.      Unless the temperature be sufficiently
high, a small portion of the ammonium-salt submitted to distillation
sublimes    without change      ; again, a portion       of the   same salt is repro
duced in the neck      of the retort and in the receiver*, from the very
constituents into which it splits ; lastly, if the temperature be too
high, the chloride of ethyl is apt to be decomposed                     into ethylene
     * This inconvenience    may be partly obviated    by distilling into an acid.

 and hydrochloric      acid,      the latter producing,       with the monamine
 liberated in the reaction,       a salt which in its turn is likewise      decom
 posed.
     Thus the chloride of diethylammonium, for instance, together with
 chloride of ethyl and ethylamine, yields ethylene and chloride of
 ethylammonium which splits into chloride of ethyl and ammonia.
     The idea  naturally suggested          itself, to attempt, by means     of this
 reaction, the formation of the primary and secondary monophosphines,
 which are at present unknown.                Experiments    made   with the view
 of transforming triethylphosphine            into diethylphosphine    have as yet
 remained unsuccessful, the chloride of triethylphosphonium               distilling
 without alteration.

       Remarks on anomalous Vapour-densities.                   By A.   W. Hof-

    In a note addressed      to the Royal Society* at the commencement
of this year, I have shown that the molecules of the diamines, like
those of all other well-examined compounds, correspond to two
volumes of vapourf, and          I  have endeavoured      to explain the apparent
anomalous vapour-densities of the hydrated diamines by assuming
that the vapour-volume           experimentally      obtained was   a   mixture   of
the vapour     of the anhydrous            base and of the vapour of water.
Thus, hydrated ethylene-diamine was assumed to split under the
influence of heat into anhydrous ethylene-diamine (2 vols. of vapour)
and water (2 vols. of vapour).

 leave to record an observation which            appears     to furnish an experi
 mental solution to the question.
    Ethylene-diamine,      when submitted to the action of iodide of ethyl,
 yields  a series of ethylated derivatives, amongst which the diethylated
 compound has claimed my particular                attention.    This body in the
 anhydrous state is an oily liquid containing
                     CeH16N,

 With water it forms       a beautiful crystalline very stable hydrate *, of

    The vapour- density of the anhydrous            base was found by experi
 ment to be 57'61, showing that the molecule of diethyl-ethylene-
 diamine corresponds to 2 vols. of vapour, the theoretical density
    On submitting the crystalline hydrate to experiment,               I arrived at
the vapour-density 33-2.        This number is in perfect         accordance    with
the result obtained in the case       of ethylene-diamine.         The legitimate
interpretation of this number is that here again               the hydrated base
splits into the anhydrous       diamine and water,          and that the density
observed     is that of a mixture of equal volumes of diamine-vapour
and   of water-vnpour, the theoretical density of which is
                                                                      ^ j~^=33.

The correctness of this interpretation            admits of an elegant      experi
mental demonstration.
    Having     observed  that the hydrate loses its water when repeatedly
distilled with a large excess of anhydrous baryta, the idea suggested
itself, to attempt the decomposition of the hydrate in the state of
vapour.      If  the vapour obtained by heating this hydrate to a tem
perature    1 5° or 20° higher than      its boiling-point      actually consisted
of  a  mixture of    equal volumes of its two proximate constituents in a
state  of dissociation (to    use a happy term proposed by Deville),               it
appeared      very probable that the volume would be halved by the
                           * Proceedings,   vol. x. p. 104.

anticipation.
     The upper half of      a glass  tube
 filled with, and inverted over, mer

glass tube open at both ends and        of
a   diameter about treble that of the
 former, the annular space between
 the two being closed at the bottom
 of   the  outer tube by a well-fitting
 cork. The vessel thus formed round
 the upper part of the inner tube
 was moreover provided       with a small
 bent copper tube open at the top
 and    closed   at the bottom, which         :£-'J?

 vessel being filled with paraffin and a lamp being applied to the         copper

 kept at     a  high  and   constant temperature, whilst the lower end,
 immersed in the mercury-trough,          remained accessible.         A glance at
 the figure explains the disposition of the apparatus.             A small quan
 tity of the hydrated base was then allowed to rise           on the top of the
 mercury in the tube      ; and the paraffin bath having been heated            to
  170°, the volume     of the vapour     was    observed.    Several pellets    of
  anhydrous baryta were        then allowed to ascend         into the vapour-
  volume, while the temperature was maintained constant.                 The mer
  cury began immediately to rise, becoming stationary again, when a
 fraction of the vapour had disappeared, which amounted, the neces
  sary corrections being made, to half the original volume.

         mann,    LL.D., F.R.S.        Received    July   24, 1860.
      Among the numerous compounds capable of the metamorphosis
  involved in Zinin's beautiful reaction, the nitriles have hitherto

                                           599
escaped    the  attention of chemists.             This is the more remarkable,
since   some    of   these     bodies   are    easily converted into crystalline
nitro-compounds       .
    When examining           several   of the diamines which            I  have   lately
submitted to the Royal Society*,              I was induced to study the trans
formation which benzonitrile            undergoes      under the successive       influ
ence   of nitric acid and reducing         agents.
    Benzonitrile, when treated with           a mixture of sulphuric and fuming
nitric acid, furnishes, as is well known,            a solid nitro-substitute which
crystallizes from alcohol in beautiful white needles, containing
                         C7H4NaOa=C7(H4,              NOJNf.
    In order to obtain this body, it is            desirable    to perform the opera
tion with small quantities, and to cool the liquid carefully, otherwise
the formation of appreciable proportions                  of nitrobenzoic acid        can
 scarcely.be avoided.
    The nitro-compound is readily            attacked    by an aqueous solution of
 sulphide of ammonium ; sulphur               is abundantly precipitated, and on
 evaporating     the liquid,       a  yellowish     red oil      is separated,    which
 gradually and imperfectly solidifies.              This   substance     possesses    the
 characters of    a  weak base, dissolving with facility in acids, and being
 again precipitated by the addition           of ammonia and the alkalies.           The
 preparation in the state of purity, both of the base itself and of its
 compounds, presents           some    difficulty.     This circumstance       has   pre
 vented me from analysing the base.                I have,    however, examined one
 of its products of decomposition, which leaves no doubt that nitro-
 benzonitrile, under the influence of reducing agents, undergoes the
 well-known      transformation        of nitro-compounds, and that the             com
 position of the oily base is represented by the formula
                             C,H,N,=CtH4(NHJN.
    The oily   base, when left        in contact with sulphide of ammonium,
 is gradually changed, a crystalline compound being formed, which is
 easily soluble in alcohol and in ether, but difficultly soluble in water,
 and which may be purified              by several     crystallizations from boiling
 water,   being deposited on cooling in white brilliant needles.                     This
 compound is       a   well-defined organic base         ;  it dissolves with facility
 in acids,   and is precipitated from these solutions                 by the addition

   of  potassa    or of ammonia.        With hydrochloric acid it forms a cry-
  stallizable salt, which yields, with dichloride of platinum, an orange-
   yellow crystalline precipitate.
      On analysis, the new base was found to have the composition
                                       C7HaNaS,
  explaining its formation, in which evidently two phases                 have to be
   distinguished     :
             ( 1)   C7  (H4 NOa) N + 3Ha S = 2Ha0 + 3S + C7           H8 Na,
             (2)    C7H6Na+HaS=C7H8NaS.
      The   new sulphuretted      base has the same          composition as sulpho-
  carbonyl-phenyldiamide,         a feebly basic compound which           I  obtained
  some     time ago      by the action of ammonia             on sulphocyanide      of
  phenyl*.

     The   new sulphuretted base is closely connected           with an interesting
 compound which Chancel obtained some years ago, when he submitted
 nitrobenzamide to the action of reducing agents.                   The crystalline
 base produced in this reaction contains
                                     C7H8NaO,
and differs from the body which forms the subject of this note only
 by having oxygen in the place          of sulphur.
    The formation of this oxygenated compound                has given rise to some
misconceptions, which         I take this opportunity to elucidate.         A short
time before the discovery of the body in question,               I had obtained    a
compound of exactly the same composition by the action of the
vapour of cyanic acid upon aniline,
                        C,H7N+CHNO=C7H,Na0.
    The   mode    of producing this       substance     pointed it out as an

logue of urea, and hence the designation aniline-urea, under which
I described the      new body as the first of the group of compound ureas,
which has since been so          remarkably enriched by Wurtz and several
other chemists.
   The aniline-urea, or phenyl-urea as it is more appropriately called,
differs from ordinary urea in its deportment with acids, being, in
fact, no longer capable       of producing       saline compounds.                 The   absence
of basic properties in the new phenyl-compound                            was sufficient to
throw some doubt upon its ureic character, and this doubt appeared
to receive additional      support by Chancel's subsequent discovery of a
compound possessing         not only the composition of phenyl-urea, but
forming likewise well-defined saline combinations.                            This compound
is,   however, the amide of amidobenzoic acid, its constitution being
interpreted     by   Chancel, in accordance         with its formation              :

      Nevertheless chemists, by silent but general consent, began to look
upon this compound as the true phenyl-urea                     ;   and in most manuals,
even Gerhardt's        'Traite   de   Chimie' not            excepted,        it   figures under
this appellation.
      Let   us see how far this view       is    supported by the deportment of
this substance.       Compound ureas, as        I    conceive the character               of this
class, must imitate the deportment               of urea par             excellence,     both in
their mode of formation and their products of decomposition.                               Urea
is    formed whenever cyanic acid or cyanates                      come       in contact with
ammonia or ammoniacal salts.                These are precisely the conditions
under which the substance which            I     have described as phenyl-urea                 is
generated.  This compound    obtained by the union of cyanic acid
                                      is

    On the other hand, no cyanogen-compound is involved in the
 formation of amidobenzamide, or amidobenzamine, as it might be
 more appropriately called, on account         of its basic properties.
    Not   less decisive  is the evidence      furnished    by the products of
 decomposition of the two bodies.            The    most  characteristic      trans
 formation of urea is its decomposition into ammonia and carbonic
 acid when it is submitted to the action of the alkalies.         A     compound
urea   thus treated should       yield,   together with carbonic         acid    and
ammonia, the monamine from which                it  has  arisen.   Phenyl-urea
should furnish carbonic acid, ammonia, and phenylamine                :  these are
precisely the products observed         in the decomposition       of the      com
 pound which is formed by the action of cyanic acid on phenylamine.

   No   trace   of carbonic acid and no     trace  of phenylamine       are elimi-

perfect destruction of the compound ensues, when, as Chancel                    has
distinctly observed, in the first place ammonia, and ultimately                car
bonic acid and phenylamine are evolved.
   What    I  have  said respecting phenyl-urea applies with equal           force
to diphenyl-urea.       Gerhardt describes as diphenyl-urea the              com
pound obtained by       Laurent   and Chancel when they examined               the
action of reducing agents      upon nitrobenzophenone, and which,               on
account of its yellow colour, was originally            described    as  flavine.

which is certainly the formula of diphenyl-urea.               But  here
chemists have been misled by the basic properties of the substance.
    It  is not my object at present to dwell on the constitution               of
flavine, which    I intend to examine in    a subsequent     note ; suffice it to
say that this substance     is not diphenyl-urea.
    The true diphenyl-urea is the      substance    commonly called carbani-
lide, or carbophenylamide.

         Oxide of Triethylphosphine.          By A. W. Hofmann, LL.D.,
         F.R.S.     Received    July  24, 1860.
     In our former experiments *, Cahours                and  myself had often
  observed    this substance,  but we did not succeed in obtaining it in a
  state  of purity fit for analysis. Nevertheless, founding our conclu
  sion   on the composition      of the corresponding sulphur-compound,
  and having regard to the analogies         presented by the corresponding
                            * Phil. Trans. 1857, p. 575.

terms of the arsenic- and antimony-series, we designated this body as
 the oxide        of the phosphorus-base
                                          CeH„PO=(CaH5)3PO*.
I   have since confirmed this formula by actual analysis.
    The difficulties which                         in our former experiments opposed                     the
preparation of this compound in the pure state, arose entirely from
the comparatively small quantity of material with which we had to
work.           Nothing is               easier    than to obtain the oxide in a state                    of
purity,         provided the available quantity of material is sufficient                                for
distillation.              In the        course    of   a   number of preparations   of triethyl-
phosphine              for         new    experiments,         a    considerable quantity of the
oxide had accumulated in the residues                                  left after distilling the zinc-
chloride-compound                        with potash.          On subjecting          these   residues to
distillation in                a   copper retort, a considerable quantity of the oxide
passed          over with the aqueous                   vapours, and a further quantity was
obtained,         as       a    tolerably anhydrous but strongly coloured liquid, by
dry distillation of                 the solid cake          of salts which remained after all the
water had passed over.                        The watery distillate             was evaporated      on the
water-bath as far as practicable, with or without addition of hydro
chloric         acid   ;       and the concentrated solution                    was    mixed with solid
hydrate of potassium, which immediately separated                                       the oxide in the
form of an oily layer floating on the surface                                    of   the potash.      The
united products were                        then left in           contact with solid potash for
twenty-four                hours         and again distilled.            The first portion of the
distillate still contained traces of water and                              a    thin superficial layer
of triethylphosphine.                        As     soon      as    the distillate       solidified,    the
receiver was charged, and the remaining                                portion —about         nine-tenths
— collected            separately          as the pure product.                 To prevent absorption
of water, the quantity required for analysis                                 was taken during          the
distillation.
    With        reference           to the properties of oxide of triethylphosphine,                     I
may add the following statements to the description formerly given                                      -f.
This   substance crystallizes                 in beautiful         needles, which,    if an appreciable
quantity of the fused compound be allowed to cool slowly, frequently
acquire the length of several inches.    have been unable to obtainI

 this substance    could be crystallized.     It  is soluble in all proportions,
 both in water and alcohol, and separates              from these     solvents  on
 evaporation     in the liquid     condition,   solidifying     only after every
 trace   of water or alcohol is expelled.           Addition of ether       to the
 alcoholic solution precipitates this body likewise as a liquid.               The
 fusing-point     of oxide of triethylphosphine           is  44°;   the point of
 solidification at the same temperature.         It  boils at 240° (corr.).
    As   no determination    of the vapour-density of any member of the
 group of compounds to which oxide of triethylphosphine belongs
has yet been made, it appeared to me of some interest to perform
this experiment with the oxide in question.                  As the quantity     of
 material at my disposal was scarcely sufficient for the determination
by Dumas' s method, and Gay-Lussac's was inapplicable                  on account
of the high boiling-point of the compound, I adopted a modifica
tion of the latter, consisting essentially in generating the vapour
in the closed      arm of a U-shaped tube immersed in             a  copper vessel
 containing    heated   paraffin,   and   calculating its volume from the
weight of the mercury driven out of the other arm.                 Since I intend
to publish a full description of this method, which promises to be
very useful in certain cases,     I shall here content myself with stating
the results obtained in one of the experiments.

    These numbers       prove the vapour-density           of oxide of triethyl
phosphine to be 66-30, referred to hydrogen as unity, or 4-60 re
ferred to atmospheric air.        Assuming that the molecule of oxide of
triethylphosphine      corresponds to 2 volumes of vapour*, the spec,
grav. of its vapour =-*-|^= 67, when referred to hydrogen, and 4 63
when referred to air.        Hence we may conclude that in oxide of
triethylphosphine     the elements are condensed in the same manner as
in the majority of thoroughly investigated organic compounds.
    From the facility with which triethylphosphine is converted into
the oxide by exposure to the air, even at ordinary temperatures, and

the very high boiling-point of the resulting compound, in consequence
of which the vapour of the latter        can exert but a very     slight tension
at the common temperature,           I am  induced to think that the phos
phorus-base may be used in many cases for the volumetric estimation
of oxygen. When a paper ball soaked in triethylphosphine is passed
up in a portion of air confined over mercury, the mercury immedi
ately begins to rise, and continues to do so for about two hours, after
which the volume becomes constant, the diminution                corresponding
very nearly to the proportion of oxygen in the air.             To obtain very
exact results, however,     it would   be  probably necessary in every case
to remove     the residual vapour of triethylphosphine          by means      of a
ball saturated with sulphuric acid.
    Oxide of triethylphosphine      exhibits in general but   a small tendency
to unite with other bodies.         Nevertheless it forms crystalline        com
pounds with iodide and bromide of zinc.              I  have   examined     more
particularly the iodine-compound.

 solutions of the two bodies,        the compound      separates,    either   as a

 crystalline structure.     It  is easily purified by recrystallization      from
 alcohol, when it is deposited     in often well-formed monoclinic crystals

 excess   of hydriodic and   even   of hydrochloric acid.
    Oxide of Triethylphosphine and Bichloride of Platinum. — No pre
 cipitate is formed on mixing the aqueous solutions of the two com
 pounds, however concentrated.          But  on adding the anhydrous oxide
 to  a   concentrated solution of dichloride       of platinum      in absolute
 alcohol,  a  crystalline  platinum-compound       is deposited after a few
 moments.      This compound is exceedingly soluble in water, easily
 soluble in alcohol, insoluble in ether. On adding ether to the
 alcoholic solution, the salt is precipitated, although with difficulty,
 in the crystalline state.     The alcoholic solution, when evaporating
 spontaneously, yields beautiful hexagonal plates of the monoclinic
 system, frequently of very considerable dimensions.              The crystals
have the rather complex formula
     Cai H,8 P4 O, Pt, C1.=3[(C, H,), PO] + (C, Hs),         PC1a,   2Pt CI,.

    On mixing the concentrated solution of the oxide with trichloride
of gold,   a deep yellow oil is separated,     which crystallizes with diffi
culty after considerable standing.          This compound is exceedingly
soluble in water and in alcohol.            When the aqueous solution is
heated, the gold is reduced ; the transformation which the oxide of
triethylphosphine    undergoes in this reaction is not examined.
    Chloride of tin forms likewise an oily compound with the oxide                :
I  have not succeeded     in crystallizing this compound.
    Chloride of mercury is without         any action on oxide of triethyl-

    Oxychloride   of Triethylphosphine. — On passing          a  current of dry
hydrochloric    acid through      a layer    of oxide of triethylphosphine
which is fused in a U-shaped           tube surrounded by boiling          water,
brilliant crystals  are soon deposited.       These crystals disappear, how
ever, rapidly,   the compound formed in the commencement of the
 reaction uniting with an excess of hydrochloric           acid.    The viscous
liquid which ultimately remains behind, when heated loses the excess
of hydrochloric acid, leaving      an exceedingly deliquescent crystalline
 mass, very soluble in alcohol, insoluble in ether.
    For analysis, the    new compound was washed with absolute ether
 and dried over sulphuric acid in vacuo, either at the common tem
 perature or at 40°.     Three chlorine-determinations         in specimens     of
 different preparations, which, owing to the extraordinary avidity of
 this compound for moisture, exhibit greater discrepancies than are
 generally observed     in experiments of this description, lead to the
 formula          CIa H,0 Pa    O Cla= (C, H,), PO,     (Ca H,), PCI,.
 The dichloride of triethylphosphine cannot          be formed by the action
 of hydrochloric acid upon the oxide.
     The oxychloride exhibits with other compounds the deportment
 of the oxide. It furnishes with dichloride of platinum the same
 platinum-salt which is obtained with the oxide.             In   a similar man
 ner it gives with iodide of zinc the iodide of zinc-compound of the
 oxide previously described.      Only   once — under conditions not sharply
 enough observed      at the time, and which        I  was  afterwards unable
  to reproduce in repeated       experiments    —a    compound of the oxy
  chloride with iodide of zinc was formed.            This substance, readily

   The facility with which the bromide of bromethyl-triethylphos-
 phonium furnishes, when submitted to the action of ammonia and
 monamines, the extensive          and well-defined group of phosphammo-
 nium- compounds, induced me to try whether similar diatomic                 bases
 containing phosphorus and arsenic might be formed by the mutual
 reaction between the bromethylated bromide and monarrinea.                 There
 was no necessity for entering into a detailed examination          of this class
 of compounds.       I have,   in fact,   been satisfied to establish    by a few
 characteristic numbers the existence of the phospharsonium-group.

   It   is thus obvious that the arsenic-base imitates triethylphosphine

    The phospharsonium-compounds, and more especially the hydrated

of the diphosphonium- and even of the phosphammonium-series.                      If
the product of the action of triethylarsine upon the brominated bro

            to the action of reagents,                 the substances       formed by its union             with
            bodies similar to ammonia, have hitherto almost exclusively occupied
            my attention.           I   have, however,        of late examined        a variety      of other
            changes      of this body, which           deserve to be noticed.
                 When     heated,       the bromide begins to evolve hydrobromic                     acid   at a
            temperature of about 200°, which continues for                      a   considerable length
            of time.       The product of this reaction is evidently the                       bromide           of
            vinyl-triethylphosphonium,

            It   is,   however, difficult to obtain the substance pure                   by   this    process,
            since the temperature at which the last portion                      of hydrobromic             acid
            is   eliminated closely approximates the degree                     of heat    at which the
            vinyl-body      is   entirely destroyed       ;   and since the latter compound                 may
            be obtained  with the greatest facility by other processes    have                  *,   I
            not followed up any further this direction of the inquiry.

    the bromethylated bromide with oxide of silver           ; the whole of the
    bromine is eliminated in the form of bromide of silver, a new base
    being formed.
       According to circumstances, this      base may be the vinyl-compound
    previously mentioned, or another body differing from the latter by
    containing the elements of one molecule of water in addition.           This
    substance,    which is always formed when the reaction takes place in
    moderately dilute solutions, is the oxide of     a phosphonium, with three
    molecules of ethyl substituted for three equivalents of hydrogen, the
    fourth equivalent of hydrogen being replaced by an oxygenated radical
    Ca H5 O, arising from the radical Ca H4      Br by the insertion of HO in
    the place    of Br

       I   have fixed the nature of this compound by the analysis of the
    iodide, of the platinum-salt and of the gold-salt, and, moreover, by
    the study of several remarkable transformations which it undergoes
     when submitted to the action of reagents.
        It  appeared  of some interest to ascertain    whether the oxethylated
     might be reconverted into the bromethylated base.           The chloride of
     the former is energetically attacked by pentabromide of phosphorus          ;
     oxybromide of phosphorus and hydrobromic acid are abundantly
     evolved, and the residue of the reaction contains the chloride of
     bromethylated triethylphosphonium.
[(Ca H5 O) (C, H5), P]Cl-rPBr5=HBr+POBr,+ [(Ca H, Br)                 (C2 H5), P]0.
    Thus it is seen that the molecular group C, H, O, which          we assume
    as   hydrogen-replacing     in  this salt, suffers   under the influence of
    pentabromide of phosphorus, alterations identical with those which
    it is known to undergo under similar circumstances, when conceived
    as a constituent    of alcohol.
        If  we consider the facility with which the bromethylated triethyl
     phosphonium is converted into the oxethylated compound, by the
     action of oxide of silver, and the simple re-formation of the first-
     mentioned body by means of pentabromide of phosphorus, a great
     variety of new experiments suggest themselves.             As yet but little
     progress has been made in this direction      ;  one of the reactions, how
     ever, which    I have studied deserves even now to be mentioned.
        The   salts of bromethylated and oxethylated triethylphosphonium

                                                612
may be regarded as tetrethyl-phosphonium-salts, in which an equiva
lent of hydrogen in one of the ethyl-molecules is replaced by bromine
and by the molecular group                  HO respectively.

and the question arose, whether the bromethylated compound might
not     be converted, simply                by reduction,           into      a    salt of tetrethyl
phosphonium.    This transformation may, indeed, be effected with
out difficulty. On acidulating the solution of the bromethylated
bromide with sulphuric acid and digesting the mixture with granu
lated zinc, the latent bromine                 is   eliminated as hydrobromic                       acid, its
place being at the same time filled                      by   1   equiv. of hydrogen,
           [(C, H4 Br)        (Ca H5)3   P]Br+2H=HBr+ [(C, H5)4 P]Br.
   It    was      chiefly the facility with which                   a    tetrethyl-phosphonium-
compound may be obtained from the brominated bromide, that in
duced me to designate                        molecules Ca H4 Br,
                                     the hydrogen-replacing
and   H5 O, which we meet with in the compounds above described,
        Ca
as bromethyl and oxethyl. It remained to be ascertained whether
these compounds might                actually be formed                  by   means      of direct sub
stitution-products             of ethyl-compounds.                  It    was      with the view of
deciding this question that              I   have        examined the deportment                     of tri-
ethylphosphine with the monochlorinated                                chloride and the mono-
brominated bromide of ethyl.
   The former of              these substances      has been long known, having been
investigated            by   Regnault many years ago               ;     the latter had not been
hitherto        obtained.      I    have    prepared          it    by    submitting           bromide    of
ethyl to the action of dry bromine under pressure*.                                       It   isa    heavy
aromatic liquid boiling at 110°.

although          essentially      different      in their physical                    properties      from
dichloride and dibromide of ethylene, with which they are isomeric,
nevertheless            resemble    the ethylene-compounds                     in their deportment
with triethylphosphine.
   In both        cases the final product         of the reaction             is   a   salt of hexethyl-
 *    In     addition   to the monobrominated       bromide        of ethyl, (C, H, Br) Br, there          is
also formed in this reaction        the dibrominated bromide,            (C, H, Bra) Br.

ated ethylene-diphosphonium.                       I have      identified these salts with those
obtained by means of dichloride and dibromide of ethylene, both by
a careful examination of their physical properties, and by the analysis
of the characteristic iodide and of the platinum-salt.      I have not
been able to trace in the first               of   these reactions a salt     of chlorethylated
triethylphosphonium              ;    but   I   have established by experiment that in
the   reaction between               triethylphosphine           and brominated bromide of
ethyl, the formation        of bromethyl-triethylphosphonium                            invariably
precedes      the production of the diphosphonium-compound.

     The    salts   of the hybrid diphosphonium crystallize like those of the
hexethylated diphosphonium,                 but, so far as they have been examined,
are somewhat more soluble.                  This remark applies especially to the
iodide.
     It    seemed    worth       while to try whether the bromide                       of brom-
ethylated triethylphosphonium                    was capable          of fixing   a   molecule of
phosphoretted          hydrogen.           It    was    found, however, that              the   two
bodies do not act upon one another.                       Phosphoretted           hydrogen      gas,
passed      through the alcoholic solution of the bromide, either cold or
boiling, did not seem to affect it in any way.
          Action of Trimethylphosphine                 on Dibromide       of Ethylene.
     This reaction exhibits         a repetition        of all the phenomena observed
in    that which takes          place between          the dibromide and triethylphos-
phine.        The    process     is completed sooner,             if   possible, than in the
ethyl-series.  The lower boiling-point and the overpowering odour
of trimethylphosphine render it advisable to mix the materials with
considerable quantities of alcohol or ether                       ;    and on account      of the
extreme       oxidability       of the phosphorus-compound,                 it is best to ope
rate in vessels filled with carbonic acid and subsequently sealed before
the blowpipe.          After digestion for          a short time at 100°, the            mixture
of   the two liquids solidifies to a hard, dazzling, white, crystalline mass

       Triethylphosphine       and di-iodide    of methylene act     so  powerfully   on
   one another, that      it is  necessary to moderate       the reaction by the pre

   completed, even when the mixture is largely diluted, especially                  if it
   be heated to 100°       in sealed tubes.      The saline residue left after the
   evaporation of the ether is immediately seen to be            a mixture   of several
   compounds, one        of which — a sparingly soluble iodide crystallizing in

   Experiment has, however, established the presence of the first only.
      The difficultly soluble crystals just mentioned are easily purified,

      The   new iodide behaves with nitrate           of silver like the bromide     of
  bromethylated       triethylphosphonium        ;   half the iodine    is eliminated
  in   the form      of iodide of silver.          It  differs, however, from      the
  bromide in its deportment with oxide of silver which, after removal
  of the   accessible  iodine, leaves the latent iodine untouched, even after
. protracted ebullition.        A powerfully     alkaline solution is thus obtained

     The crystals of the iodide were transformed into the chloride by

  cold water, but may be recrystallized from a considerable quantity of
  boiling water.      As the liquid     cools,   splendid needle-shaped crystals

The sparingly soluble iodide is present in proportionally                                small quan
 tity only among the products                     of the action of di-iodide of methylene
 on   triethylphosphine.                  I have    in vain endeavoured            to detect among
these    products          anything         of the nature of                a diphosphonium-com-
pound.       On treating the mother-liquor of the sparingly soluble
iodide    with chloride of silver, and the dilute filtered solution with
dichloride of platinum, a few needles of the iodated platinum-salt
are    still deposited          ;   but after considerable evaporation the solution
yields crystals,          all of which exhibit an octahedral habitus.                                I    was
equally unsuccessful in a particular experiment,                              in which      I   subjected
di-iodide of methylene to the action of                            a    large excess of triethyl
phosphine        ;   and    a       similar report must be made of the attempt to
produce the desired body by treating the ready prepared iodide with
triethylphosphine, according to the equation
       [(C Ha I)(C, Hs)3 P]I + (C, H6)3 P= [(C   (C, H5)0 PJ»           By                           Ia.
      The examination of the mother-liquor of the sparingly soluble
iodide   is  a   difficult and thankless proceeding                     ;   nevertheless,       by   a   suffi
cient number         of iodine-        and platinum-determinations,                it   may     be   shown
to be    a   mixture of four different compounds.                             The mother-liquor             is
thus found to contain, together with the hydriodate of the phos
phorus-base, two crystallizable iodides differing in solubility, and to be
separated from one another only                      by   a   great number of crystallizations.
      The more soluble salt                  is    the iodide of oxymethylated                   triethyl-
phosphonium,               corresponding             to the iodomethylated                  compound         ;
the less soluble salt                is   the iodide of methyl-triethylphosphonium.
The last mother-liquors                    contain considerable quantities of oxide of
triethylphosphine.
                     Iodide of Oxymethyl-triethylphosphonium.
      This salt      is   extremely soluble both in water and in alcohol, even
in absolute alcohol, and crystallizes only after the alcohol has been
completely evaporated. The crystals, resembling the frosty efflores
cences on      a     window-pane, contain
                          C7HiaOPI = [(CH30) (C3H.)3P]I.
The iodide, treated with oxide of silver,                          is   converted into the corre
sponding caustic oxide, which, when mixed with hydrochloric                                               acid
and dichloride of platinum, yields                        a    rather easily soluble platinum-
salt of an octahedral habitus.

                        Iodide of Methyl-triethylphosphonium.
          The nature of    the less soluble iodide was determined     by an   iodine-
      determination, and by the analysis of the platinum-salt.           The   iodide
      dissolves in water and in alcohol, but is insoluble in ether.       By adding
      ether to the alcoholic solution, tolerable crystals are obtained.          This
      compound is most conveniently purified by precipitating the alcoholic
      mother-liquor, after freeing it by crystallization as far as possible
      from the iodomethylated iodide, with a quantity of ether insufficient
      to precipitate the whole, so that the greater part of the iodides          may
      remain in solution.
          The iodide thus prepared contains
                            C7H18PI=[(CH3)(CaH5),P]I.
      For further verification of this formula the crystals were           deiodized
      with silver-oxide, and the caustic liquid thus obtained was saturated
      with hydrochloric acid and precipitated by dichloride of platinum.
      The platinum-salt, which crystallizes in beautiful octahedra, was
      found to contain
                     C7 H„ P PtCl3=[(C HO (C, H8)3        P]C1,  PtCl,.
          The two iodides      are accompanied by a considerable quantity           of
      oxide of triethylphosphine,      which immediately    separates  in oily  drops
      on treating the last mother-liquor with potash.        Its presence was like
      wise unmistakeably recognized by the preparation            of the platinum-
      salt.    If the last  mother-liquor of the iodine-compounds be deiodized
      and mixed with hydrochloric        acid and dichloride  of platinum,   a quan
      tity of octahedral salts    separates in the first place, which are removed
      by sufficient concentration      ; the remaining liquid, when mixed with
      alcohol and ether,      yields  a  crystalline precipitate, which    separates
      from alcohol       by spontaneous      evaporation in the beautiful large
       hexagonal tables consisting of the platinum-salt of the oxychloride
       of triethylphosphine, which has been more fully described in one of
       the previous notes on these researches.

      By A. W. Hofmann, LL.D., F.R.S.                Received August 17,
      1860.
   In recording my experiments on         the derivatives   of triethylphos-
phine,   I  have had more than one opportunity           of alluding to the
energy and precision which characterize the reactions of this com
pound. The usefulness of triethylphosphine as an agent of research
has   more particularly    manifested itself in the study of the poly
atomic bases, the examination of which, in continuation of former
inquiries, was naturally suggested    by the beautiful researches on the
polyatomic alcohols published      during the last few years.         In the
commencement these studies were almost exclusively performed with
reference   to derivatives of ammonia   ;  but the results obtained in the
examination of triethylphosphine      have, in a great measure,      changed
the track originally pursued, and of late       I have   generally preferred
to solve the problems which     I had proposed to myself, by the aid of
the phosphorus-bases.
   The light which the study of these compounds throws upon the
nature of the polyatomic bases generally, will be fully appreciated
by a retrospective glance at the deportment of triethylphosphine
under the influence of dibromide      of ethylene, and      a comparison   of
the products formed in this reaction with the results suggested            by
theory.
   A simple consideration shows that the action of diatomic bro
mides upon bases must give rise to the formation of several classes
of compounds.       Let  us examine by way     of illustration the products
which may be expected to be formed in the reaction between               am
monia and dibromide of ethylene.
   The diatomic bromide being       capable    of fixing two molecules of
ammonia, we have in the first place        four diatomic bromides of the
formulae
                          [(C,HJ" H.NJ''Br,
                          [(C.H,)." H4N,]"Bra
                          [(C.HJ/'H.N,]'' Br,
                          [(CaH4V       NJ"Br..
   voL. X.                                                      2 u

                                        620
     These are, however, by no means the only salts which, in accord
 ance with our present conception           of diatomic compounds,      may be
 formed    in this reaction.         Taking into consideration     the general
 deportment of dibromide of ethylene, there could be no doubt that,
 under certain conditions,         this body would act with ammonia as a
 monoatomic compound, giving rise to another series               of bodies, in
 which the hydrogen would be more or less replaced by the mono-
 atomic molecule Ca H4 Br, viz.
                             [(C,H4Br)-H3N]Br
                             [(C,H4Br),H,N] Br
                             [(C,H4Br),H N]Br
                             [((3, H.Br),      N]Br.
     Further,  if the   reaction took place in the presence    of water, it was
 to be expected     that the latent bromine of these salts, wholly or par
 tially eliminated in the form of hydrobromic         acid, would be replaced
 by the molecular residue of water, and thus, independently             of any
 mixed compounds containing simultaneously bromine and oxygen, a
 series of salts might    be looked for,  in which  a molecule Ca H4  (HO)=
 Ca  H, 0 would enter monoatomically.
                             [(C3H6O) H3N]Br
                             [(C,H80)aHaN] Br
                            [(C,H30)3H N]Br
                            [(CsH50)4         N]Br.
    Lastly, remembering the tendency exhibited by ethylene-com-
 pounds to resolve themselves in the presence of alkalies into vinyl-
 products, it appeared not improbable that          a fourth series  of bodies
 would likewise be formed,
                            [(C,H.) H3N]Br
                            [(CaHs)aHaN]Br
                            [(C.HJ.H N]Br
                            [(CSH3)4       N]Br.
    In the experiments on the action of dibromide of ethylene upon
ammonia, which        I  have   already partly published,    and which,   in a
more connected form,         I  hope soon to lay before the Royal Society,
I  have not, indeed, met with the whole of these compounds ; but in
the place of the deficient members of the groups new products have
made their appearance, whose formation in the present state of our

                                       621
 knowledge could scarcely have been predicted, and thus the problem
 of disentangling the difficulties of this reaction becomes a task of
 very considerable difficulty.       Nor did the action of dibromide of
 ethylene upon ethylamine, diethylamine, and triethylamine, which              I
 subsequently studied, afford a sufficiently simple expression of the
 transformations suggested by theory.          The difficulties disappeared at
 once when the experiment was repeated          in the phosphorus-series. In
 the reaction with dibromide of ethylene, the sharply -defined characters
 of triethylphosphine exhibited      themselves    with  welcome  distinctness,
 and in consequence        more  especially of the absence of unreplaced
 hydrogen — whereby the formation of a large number of compounds
 of subordinate theoretical interest       was excluded — the general cha
 racter of the reaction, the recognition of which was the object of
 the inquiry, became at once perceptible.
    I  have    shown that the action of dibromide           of ethylene upon
 triethylphosphine     gives rise to the formation     of four different  com
 pounds, viz.
                        [(C.HJ"       (C3H5)6P,J"Bra
                         [(CaH4Br)(C1H,),P] Br.
                        [(C3H50) (C3H5)3P] Br
                        [(C3H.)       (C,H.),P] Br,
 each   of which represents      one   of the four groups of compounds,
which under favourable circumstances may arise from the mutual
reaction between      ammonia and dibromide of ethylene, the produc
tion of    a  greater number of terms being impossible on account of
 the ternary substitution of triethylphosphine.
    Whilst going on with the         researches     on  the phosphorus-bases
which    I  have taken the liberty     of submitting to the Royal Society,
in notes sketched as      I advanced, I have not altogether lost sight of
the experiments in the nitrogen-series, which             had originally   sug
gested    these  inquiries.   Numerous      nitrogenated bases, both mono-
atomic and diatomic, with which          I have become      acquainted during
this investigation, must be reserved       for   a future communication.      I
may here only remark, that these substances, although differing in
several points, nevertheless     imitate in their general deportment so
closely the corresponding terms of the phosphorus-series,             that the
                                                             2 u 2

                                     G22
picture which      I have  endeavoured   to delineate of the phosphorus-
compounds, illustrates in     a great measure the history    of the nitrogen-
bodies.
    In conclusion,    a few words about      the further    development       of
which the experiments on the polyatomic bases appear to be capable,
and about the direction in which I propose to pursue the track which
they have opened.
    Conceived in its simplest form, the transition from the series of
monoatomic to that of diatomic bases, may be referred to the intro
duction of     a  monochlorinated or a monobrominated alcohol-radical
into the type ammonia, the chlorine and bromine thus                   inserted
furnishing the point of attack for a second molecule of ammonia.
    If  in bromide of ethylammonium       —to    pass from the phosphorus-
series to the more generally interesting nitrogen-series        — we    replace
 1  equiv. of the hydrogen in ethyl by bromine, we arrive               at bro
mide of bromethylammonium,           which   fixing a second equivalent of
ammonia, is converted into the dibromide of ethylene-diammonium,
the latent bromine becoming accessible to silver-salts.
           [(C, H4 Br)  H3 N] Br+   H3  N = [(C, H4)" He NJ'3 Br,.
    The further      elaboration of this reaction indicates two different
 methods for the construction of the polyatomic bases             of  a higher
 order.     In the first place, the number    of ammonia-molecules,       to be
 incorporated in the new system, may be increased by the gradually
 advancing bromination of the radical.         By   the further   bromination
 of ethyl in bromide of bromethylammonium                and   the action of
 ammonia on the bodies thus produced, the following              salts may   be
 generated    :—
       [(C, H,   BrJ H, N] Br+ 2H, N = [(C, H,)'" H8 N,]"' Br3
       [(C, H, Br,) H3 N] Br + 3H, N = [(C3 Ha)»" H,s NJ'"' Br4
       [(C, H Br,) H3 N] Br+4H3 N = [(Cs H )"«' H„ N.]'»" Br5
       [(Cs      Br,)H3N]Br+5H3N=[(Cs )"">> H„ N,]""" Br,.
     Again, the fixation of the ammonia-molecules may be attempted,
  not by the progressive bromination of the ethyl, but by the accumu
 lation of monobrominated ethyl-molecules in the ammonium-nucleus.
 The bromide of di-bromethylammonium, when submitted to the
  action of ammonia, would thus yield the tribromide of a triammo

                                         623
nium   ;   the bromide of tri-bromethylammonium,          the tetrabromide     of
a  tetrammonium       ;  and lastly, the bromide of tetrabromethylammo-
nium, the pentabromide of a pentammonium.
         [(C, H, Br)a Ha N] Br+ 2H3N= [(C, HJ,"            H8  NJ"      Br3
         [(CaH4Br)3H N]Br+3H,N=[(CIHJ,"H10N4]""                        Br4
         [(C, H4Br)4         N] Br+4H3N = [(CaH4)/'HlaN5]              Br5.
    As yet the bromination of the alcohol-bases          presents   some    diffi
culty  ;   appropriately selected reactions, however, will doubtless fur
nish the several brominated bases.           They may probably     be obtained
by indirect processes, similar to those by which years ago         I  succeeded
in preparing the chlorinated           and brominated derivatives    of phenyl-
 amine   ;   or these bodies may be generated        by the action of penta-
 chloride or pentabromide of phosphorus upon the oxethylated bases,
 a process,    which, to judge from the few experiments recorded in one
 of the preceding       sketches,  promises  a rich harvest of results.
    I  have    but a faint hope that       I may be able to trace these new
 paths in the numerous directions which open in              a variety at once
 tempting and perplexing.           Inexorable experiment follows but slowly
 the flight     of light-winged      theory.   The commencement is         never
 theless    made, and even now the triammonium-           and tetrammonium-
 compounds begin         to unfold themselves    in unexpected variety.      One
 of the most remarkable compounds belonging             to the triammonium-
 group is Methylene triamine,
                           c4ii13n3=(C3^)"'}n5.
 This   base, the   first triacid triammonia, forms splendid       salts  of the
 formula
                            [(CaHJ"aH8N3]»'Cl3,

 I. " On    the Laws of the Phenomena           of the larger Disturbances
        of the Magnetic Declination in the Kew Observatory                  : with
        notices  of the progress      of our knowledge regarding the
        Magnetic Storms."         By Major-General Edward Sabine,
        R.A., Treas. and V.P.        Received      November 15, 1860.
     The laws manifested by the      mean     effects   of the larger   magnetic
 disturbances (regarded commonly           as   effects of magnetic       storms)
 have been investigated at several stations on the globe,          being   chiefly
 those  of the British Colonial Observatories         ; but hitherto there     has
 been no similar examination     of the phenomena in         the British  Islands
 themselves.     The object of the present paper is to supply this              de
 ficiency, as far as one element, namely the declination, is concerned,
 by a first approximation derived from the photographs in the years
 1858 and 1859,    of the self-recording declinometer of the observatory
of the British Association at Kew ; leaving it to the photographs
of subsequent    years  to confirm, rectify, or render more precise the
results now obtained by a first approximation.              The method of       in
vestigation is simple, and may be briefly described as follows           :—
    The photographs      furnish a continuous record of the variations
which take place in the direction      of the declination-magnet, and          ad
mit of exact measurement       in the two relations of time, and of the
amount of departure from a zero line.           From this automatic record,
the direction of the magnet is measured at twenty-four equal inter
vals  of time in  every solar day, which       thus become the equivalents
of the "hourly observations"        of the magnetometers in          use at the
Colonial Observatories.      These measures,      or hourly directions of     the
magnet, are entered    in monthly   tables, having the days       of the  month

                                        625
in successive      horizontal lines, and the hours of the day in vertical
 columns.      The "means" of the entries in      each vertical column    indi
 cate the mean direction      of the magnet at the different hours of the
 month to which the table belongs, and have received the name of
 " First Normals."         On inspecting any such monthly table, it is at
once   seen that a     considerable portion of the entries in the several
columns differ considerably from their respective means or first nor
mals, and must be regarded         as
                                      " disturbed observations."     The laws
of their relative frequency, and amount of disturbance, in different
years, months and hours, are then sought out, by separating for that
purpose a sufficient body of the most disturbed observations, com
puting the amount of departure in each case from the normal of the
same month and hour, and arranging the amounts in annual, monthly,
and hourly tables.        In making   these computations, the first normals
require to be themselves        corrected, by the omission in each vertical
column of the entries noted as disturbed, and by taking fresh means,
representing the normals of each month and hour after this omission,
and   therefore uninfluenced by the larger disturbances.           These new
means    have received the name       of " Final Normals,"    and may be de
fined as being the mean directions of the magnet in every month and
every hour, after the omission from the record          of every entry which
differed from the     mean a  certain amount either in excess or in defect.
    In this   process there is nothing indefinite   ; and nothing arbitrary
save the assignment       of the particular amount of difference from the
normal which shall be held to constitute the measure of a large dis
turbance, and which, for distinction sake, we may call       " the separating
value."      It  must be an amount which will separate a sufficient body
of disturbed observations to permit their laws to            be satisfactorily
ascertained    ;  but in other respects its precise value is of minor sig-
nificancy   ;  and the limits within which a selection         may  be made,
without materially       affecting the results, are usually     by no means
narrow   ;  for it has been found experimentally on several occasions,
that the Ratios by which the periodical variations of disturbance in
different years, months and hours are characterized and expressed, do
not undergo any material change by even considerable differences             in
the amount of the separating value.           The separating value must     ne
cessarily be larger at some stations than at others, because the abso
lute magnitude of the disturbance-variation        itself is very different in

                                    G26
 different parts of the globe, as well as its comparative magnitude in
relation to the more regular solar-diurnal variation      ; but it must     be
 a constant quantity throughout     at one and the same       station,   or it
will not truly show the relative proportion of disturbance in different
years and different months.
    The strength    of the Kew establishment being insufficient for
the complete work of a magnetic observatory, the tabulation of
the hourly directions from the photographic         records has been per
formed by the non-commissioned          officers of the Royal     Artillery,
employed under my direction at Woolwich, where this work has been
superintended by     Mr. John Magrath, the principal clerk, as have
been also the several    reductions and calculations, which have been
made on the same plan as those      of the Colonial Observatories.
    In the scale on which the changes     of direction of the declination-
magnet are recorded in the Kew photographs, one inch of space is
equivalent to 22'-04 of arc.     On  a general view and consideration       of
the photographs      during   1858   and 1859,    0-15 inch,   or 3,-31     of
arc appeared to be a suitable amount for the separating value to           be
adopted at that station     ; consequently every tabulated value which
differed 3'-3l or more, either in excess or defect from the final nor
mal   of the same month and hour, has been regarded as one           of the
larger disturbances, and separated accordingly.        The number of dis
turbed observations in the two years was 2424 (viz. 1211 in 1858,
and 1213 in 1859), being between one-seventh and one-eighth of the
whole body of hourly directions tabulated from the photographs,             of
which the number was 17,319.         The  aggregate   valne of disturbance
in the 2424 observations, was 14,901 minutes of arc       ; of which 7207
minutes were deflections of the north end of the magnet to the west,
and 7694 to the east ; the easterly deflections thus having a          slight
preponderance.      The number of the disturbed observations,        as well
as their aggregate   values,  approximated very closely in each of the
two years, 1859 being very slightly in excess.       The decennial period
of the magnetic storms, indicated by the observations at the British
Colonial Observatories between     1840 and 1850, had led to the antici
pation that the next epoch of maximum of the cycle might take place
in the years 1858-1859.       The nearly  equal proportions in which the
numbers and aggregate values       of the larger disturbances took      place
in 1858 and 1859 are so far in accordance        with this view.    Should

                                              027
the records      of the succeeding         years at    Kew,     made with the same in
struments, and examined by the same method, show decreasing                                   dis
turbance in 1860 and 1861, the precise epoch                       of the maximum indi
cated by the records           of the Kew declinometer will                  be  "  the end of
1858 or commencement                of 1859."
    In Table I.      are shown the aggregate             values     of disturbance in the
two years, arranged under the several                   hours of solar time in which
they occurred.           They      are also    divided into the two categories                  of
westerly and easterly deflections, since the experience gained at other
stations has now fully established that the westerly and easterly dis
turbance-deflections are characterized in all parts of the globe by
 distinct and dissimilar laws.              The Ratios       are also shown which              the
aggregate      values at the different hours, both               of the westerly and the
 easterly deflections, bear to their respective               mean values,       — or, in    other
words, to the sums respectively of the westerly and easterly deflec
tions at all the hours, divided by 24, and taken as the respective units.

   The westerly and easterly deflections in the British Islands,                 as
represented    by the automatic records at Kew, are obviously governed,
as in  all other parts of the globe where the phenomena have been
analysed, by distinct laws. The westerly deflections have their chief
prevalence    from     5 a.m. to 5 p.m., or during the hours        of the day       ;
the easterly    deflections, on the other hand, prevail chiefly during the
hours of the night, the ratios being above unity from 7 p.m. to 3 a.m.,
and below unity at all other hours.             The easterly have one decided
maximum, viz. at           11  p.m.,   towards which they steadily and con
tinuously progress from 5 p.m., and from which they as steadily and
continuously       recede     until  5   a.m. the following      morning.      The
westerly deflections appear to have two epochs                 of maximum,     one
from   6   to  7   a.m., the other about 3 p.m., progressing regularly
towards the first named from 3 a.m., and receding from it to 9 a.m.                 ;
at 9, 10, and     1 1 a.m. the ratios remain almost sensibly the same, but
towards noon they begin to increase             afresh, and continue to do so
progressively to the second maximum at 3 p.m., from which hour
they progressively decrease to 7 p.m.             Those ratios which are less
than unity,      viz. those of the westerly deflections from 6 p.m. to
4 a.m., and     of the easterly from        4 a.m. to 6 p.m., do not    in either
case exhibit the same          decided tendency to one or two well-marked
minima, as the ratios which are above unity do in both cases towards
their maxima.         It is possible, however, that this may in some degree
be explained by the following consideration            : —
    The  aggregate      values  of the disturbances prevailing at the different
hours, as stated in the Table, are those which have prevailed, not
only over the forces which would retain the magnet in its mean po
sition, but also over any disturbing influences in an opposite direc
tion, which may be conceived             to have existed contemporaneously        ;
and we cannot but suppose             that as both westerly and easterly dis
turbances do record themselves             as prevailing   at the same hours on
different days, that these opposite influences may sometimes              coexist,
neutralizing each other and not appearing              in the record.    We may
reasonably suppose that the degree in which the aggregate               values  in
the Table, both westerly and easterly, may be diminished thereby at
the different hours, may be in some measure                indicated by the dis
parity, or the reverse, in the amount of the aggregate             values of dis
turbance in the opposite directions at those              hours.   Thus  we may

                                       G29
suppose    that at a particular      hour,  11    p.m. for example,     when the
amount of westerly deflections is very small, and of easterly very
great, the diminution       of the   aggregate     values  of either by mutual
counterbalance may be           extremely small, while of equal absolute
amount in both.        Now    a very small amount deducted from the large
aggregate    easterly value will scarcely have any effect whatsoever on
the ratio at that hour to its unit or mean          hourly value   ; whereas the
same small amount deducted from the far less aggregate                    westerly
value   at the same hour would have a far more sensible               effect upon
its ratio.    Assuming,      therefore, the probability      that westerly and
easterly disturbing      influences do sometimes         coexist and neutralize
each other in the record, and        that we may in some degree judge of
the respective      amounts of the conflicting        influences at the several
hours by the means above stated, we should be prepared to expect
that the ratios which are below unity do not represent the actual
variations of the disturbing influences at those hours quite so purely
as do the ratios which are above        unity   ;  and that they are liable to
be affected,   though in a very subordinate degree, by the abstraction
of the neutralized portion, when the            aggregate    values   which they
represent are very small.
    ~Without, however, resting undue weight upon this suggestion, we
may safely say that the hours, when the ratios are below unity, are
hours of comparative tranquillity, and that their variations from hour
to hour are   of a far less marked character than during the hours when
the ratios exceed unity.         Thus viewed, the character of       the disturb
ance-diurnal variations may be conceived            to have  some analogy     with
that of the phenomena of the regular solar-diurnal variation.             We may
imagine the disturbance- variation (either the westerly or the easterly,
it is indifferent which is taken), — divided as it is into two portions, by
the ratios being in the one case above, and in the other below unity,           —
 to correspond in one       of its divisions   to the hours when the sun is
above the horizon,      in the part of the hemisphere where the disturb
 ance may be imagined to originate, whilst the other division, or that
in which the ratios are below unity, and manifest hours of compara
 tive tranquillity,  may be viewed as the hours of night at the same
locality.     The solar hours at       a station     of observation which      are
 characterized by disturbance ratios above unity, will in such case
 correspond in absolute time with the hours of the day at the sup

                                                  630
posed     originating         locality, modified            (it   may     be) by  more or less
                                                                                       a
rapid transmission of the disturbance.                            It   will be understood, that
in this hypothetical             suggestion, the purpose in view                         is   to aid the
imagination,       if    it   may be so, in apprehending the ensemble of the
phenomena          as   far as they are yet known to us, rather than to ad
vance     a   theoretical explanation, when we have not yet sufficient                              facts
before us by which            it   may be judged        ;    it   may be remarked, however,
that the conception of             a   double locality of origination                  of the disturb
ances (easterly and westerly) in the one hemisphere                                   will present no
especial difficulty to those who are conversant with the general facts
of terrestrial magnetism.
     If our    attention be limited to the consideration of the facts observed
at   a   single station, unaccompanied by                a    view of corresponding pheno
mena elsewhere,            we might          be   in danger of regarding some                    of   the
features,      particularly        perhaps those            which           are not the most          pro
minent, as having an accidental rather than                                  a     systematic origin    ;
and we might thus lose                  a    portion of the instruction                    which they
may otherwise convey.                  On this account             it       has    appeared    desirable
to exhibit the phenomena as observed                              at   a    second station,     in com
parison with those at Kew                ;    and I  have selected for this purpose the
results of         a    similar investigation           to the present at                Hobarton in
Tasmania       ;   not only because the facts have                           been     remarkably well
determined there, but also because, though                             it   is
                                                                            a     very distant station,
differing widely in geographical latitude and longitude, and situated
indeed in       a       different hemisphere, there                    is
                                                                       a      striking     resemblance
in the laws of the magnetic storms experienced                               at both.      This resem
blance,       which      is   not only general, but extends to very minute par
ticulars,     is   such that    it   seems impossible to resist the impression                        that
the accordance            cannot be accidental          ;    and that the methods of obser-
vationandof analysis which have been pursued, have proved themselves
well adapted to open to us the knowledge of the existence of system
atic laws, pervading and regulating the action of the forces which
are  in daily operation around us, and are at least co-extensive with
the limits of our globe and thus to lead us ultimately to the correct
                                   ;
 theory of these forces.            I    have placed          therefore beside each other in
 the next Table the Ratios of Disturbance at the different hours of local
 solar time at each of the two stations, separating them as before
 into westerly and easterly deflections, and placing the westerly deflec

                                       631
tions at Kew in immediate juxtaposition         with the easterly at    Hobar
ton, and vice versd,    as   that obviously constitutes the just compari
son.    The Hobarton Ratios exhibit the relative            prevalence  of dis
turbance at the several hours, derived from hourly observations con
tinued for seven years and nine months, viz. from January              1, 1841
to September 30, 1848      ;  a series unparalleled  in duration at any other
of the Colonial Observatories, and which         has borne admirably,      as  I
shall hope to have a future opportunity of explaining to the Society,
an unquestionable test of its substantial accuracy and fidelity.           The
 number of recorded hourly observations was 56,202, of which 7638
 differed from their respective normals of the same month and hour
 by an amount equalling or exceeding         2'-13 of arc, and constituted
 the body of separated observations from which the aggregate             values
 of disturbance    at the different     hours and their      ratios have been
 obtained.    The proportion of disturbed observations thus separated,
 to the whole body of observations, is about 1 in 7-35 ; differing very
 little from the proportion already noticed         as obtained at    Kew by   a
 separating value of 3'-3.        The disturbing     effects due   to magnetic
 storms are therefore somewhat greater at Kew than at Hobarton,
 though    some portion      of the difference may     be ascribed to the cir
 cumstance, that the terrestrial horizontal        force, antagonistic to the
 disturbing   forces and tending to retain the magnet in its mean
 position, is less at Kew than at Hobarton, in the proportion, approx
 imately, of 3-7 to 4.5.

    For the     convenience      of  those who prefer graphical illustration,               I
have represented          on an accompanying woodcut the results to                  which
I have referred.          The curves drawn in unbroken black lines, in figures
1  and 2,    show the phenomena at Kew ; those in dotted lines in the
same figures, the phenomena at Hobarton.                      Fig. 1 presents westerly
disturbances at        Kew,   and   easterly    at  Hobarton in comparison with
each other ; they are obviously allied phenomena.                      Fig.    2 presents
easterly disturbances at Kew and westerly at Hobarton                        ;  these   are
also, obviously, allied phenomena, but are as obviously governed by
distinct laws from those in fig.           1.
    Had the phenomena at Kew and Hobarton                         been the only ones
known to us, we might              have    inferred that we had obtained the
characteristic forms of the diurnal variations due to the action of two
distinct and independent forces             ;  and   we might have expected            with
some      degree    of confidence     to have      found curves of corresponding

form by a similar analysis elsewhere         ; — and   so  far   experience     has
been in accord with expectation.         But,    as the  forms of      these    two
pair of curves are not only respectively similar,            but    as they     also
correspond in the hours at which their chief characteristic                features
occur, we might also have formed an inference which                  would     have
proved erroneous,    viz. that the hours as well as the forms would               be
the same     at   other stations.     Now this is      so  far from      being      in
accordance   with the facts which we already possess,            that  whilst    the
forms present generally     a marked resemblance,       the hours at      different
stations exhibit every variety.       To exemplify this      I  have given in        a
third figure the curve of the westerly disturbance-diurnal               variation
at St. Helena, of which the form is manifestly the same                as that of
the two curves in fig. 2, whilst the hours of its most marked             features
exhibit  a  difference of nearly     12 hours of local time from those             in
fig. 2.
   It may not be unsuitable on the present occasion              to take    a brief
retrospective view of the progress of our knowledge respecting                these
remarkable phenomena, videlicet, the casual magnetic disturbances,
or magnetic storms.      Antecedently to the formation          of the   German
 Magnetic Association and the publication of its first Annual              Report
in  1837, our information concerning them went no            further   than that
there occurred at times, apparently not of regular recurrence,               extra
ordinary agitations or perturbations       of the magnetic needle,           which
had been noticed in several      instances  to have taken place contempo
raneously in parts of the European continent distant from each other;
and to have been accompanied by remarkable               displays of Aurora,
seen either at the locality itself where the needle was disturbed, or
observed   contemporaneously elsewhere.          The opinion which       appears
to have generally prevailed at this time, was that the Aurora                  and
the magnetic disturbances were kindred phenomena, originating                  pro
bably in atmospherical      derangements,      or connected    at least in some
way with disturbances of the atmospherical equilibrium.                      They
were classed accordingly as " Meteorological Phenomena,"               and    were
supposed to have      a local, though it might be in some instances                a
wide, extension and prevalence.
   The  special  purpose of the German Magnetic Association                 was to
subject the  "irregular magnetic disturbances"           (as   they were      then

                                      635
called in contradistinction    to the regular periodical and secular varia
tions) to a more close examination, by means of systematized ob
servations made simultaneously in many parts of Germany. With this
view, six concerted days in each year were set apart in which the di
rection of the declination-magnet         should be observed        with great
accuracy, by methods then for the first time introduced, at successive
intervals of five minutes for twenty-four consecutive hours          ;  the me
teorological instruments being observed          at the same     time.       The
clocks at all the stations were set to Gottingen mean time (Gottingen
being the birth-place of the Association),        and the observations were
thus rendered strictly simultaneous throughout.             The high     respect
entertained for the eminent persons       with whom the scheme            of the
Association originated, obtained for it a very extensive          cooperation,
not limited to Germany alone, but extending over           a great part of the
European    Continent.      The observations of the "Term-days,"               as
they were called, were maintained until 1841,           and were     all trans
mitted to Gottingen for coordination and comparison.
   The principal results of this great and admirably conducted co
operative undertaking were published in works well known to mag-
neticians.   They may      be summed up as follows       : — The phenomena
which were the subjects of investigation were shown to be of casual
and not regular occurrence; to prevail contemporaneously everywhere
within the limits comprehended by the observations            ; and to exhibit
a correspondence surprisingly      great, not only in the larger, but even
in almost all the smaller oscillations     ;  so that, in the words       of the
Reporters, MM. Gauss and Weber,
                                          " nothing in   fact remained which
could justly be ascribed to local causes."
   Equally decided     were the conclusions drawn against the previously
imagined connexion between the magnetic disturbances and derange
ments of the atmosphere, or particular states of the weather.                 No
 perceptible influence whatsoever on the needle appeared to be pro
 duced either by wind-storms or by thunder-storms, even when close
at hand.
   The correspondence in the simultaneous          movements    of the declina
tion-magnet,   so strikingly manifested over an area of such wide extent,
was however more remarkable in respect to the direction                of  a per
turbation than to its amount.        The disturbances    at different stations,
and even, as was expressly stated, at       all the stations, coincided,     even
    vol. x.                                                     2 x

                                                      636
in the smaller           instances,        in time and in direction, but with                  dissimilar
proportions          of magnitude.               Thus it      was found         generally     that by      far
the greater number of the anomalous indications were smaller                                          at the
southern stations and larger at the northern                                ;   the difference        being
greater than would                      be due       to the difference in the                antagonistic
retaining force              (i.   e.   the horizontal        force   of the earth's         magnetism,
which       is   greater       at the southern than                   at the northern           stations).
The generality of this occurrence led to the unavoidable inference,
that, in Europe, the energy of the disturbing force must be regarded
weaker as we follow its action towards the south.
     A    close and minute comparison                    of the simultaneous              movements          at
stations in near proximity to each other led to the further conclusion,
also stated to be unavoidable, that                       " various forces must be              admitted
to be contemporaneously in action, being probably quite independent
of   each other, and having very different sources                              ;   the effects of these
various forces            being intermixed               in very dissimilar              proportions            at
various places           of observation according to the directions and                         distances
of   these from the sources whence the perturbations                                    proceed."         (Re-
sultate aus den Beob. des Mag. Vereins, 1836. pp. 99, 100.)                                               The
difficulty of disentangling the complications which thus occur                                    at every
individual station was fully foreseen and recognized                                ;   and the Report,
which bears the initial of                    M. Gauss, concludes with the remark                         that
"   it   will   be   a   triumph         of   science,   if   at some future time we                should
succeed         in reducing into order the manifold intricacies of                              the      com
binations, in separating from each other the several forces of which
they are the compound results, and in assigning the source                                                 and
measure         of each."
     Such was the state of the inquiry when                           it   was entered upon           by   the
Royal Society.   The Report of the Committee of Physics drawn up
(inter alia) for the guidance of the Magnetic Observatories esta
blished by H.M. Government for       limited period in four of the
                                                           a
British Colonies,             bears date        in    1840.      The objects proposed               by    this
Report          were     a   very considerable enlargement upon those                               of     the
German Association, as well as an extension of the research to                                        more
distant parts            of the globe.            The German observations                     had        been
limited for the most part to one only of the three elements                                     required
in   a   complete investigation.                     When the German Association                      com
menced its operations, the Declination                          was the sole element for which

                                         637
 an apparatus had been devised            capable  of recording its variations
 with the necessary precision.          To  meet  the deficiency in respect to
  the horizontal component of the magnetic force,         M. Gauss constructed
 in- 1837    his bifilar magnetometer,     which was employed at Gottingen
 and   at some few of the          German stations, concurrently       with the
 Declinometer,       in the term observations of the concluding years of
 the Association.        But  an apparatus for the corresponding        observa
 tion of the vertical portion of the Force was as yet wholly wanting             ;
 without such an apparatus as          a companion to the bifilar,    no deter
 mination could be made of the perturbations or momentary changes
 of the magnetic Dip and Force        :  and without a knowledge of these no
 satisfactory conclusion in regard to the real nature, amount and
 direction of the perturbing forces could be expected.          The ingenuity
 of Dr. Lloyd supplied the desideratum by devising the vertical force
 magnetometer,       which, with adequate care, has been found scarcely, if
 at all, inferior to the bifilar    in the performance of its work.         The
 scheme     of the British Observatories     was thus enabled to comprehend
 all the data required for the investigation of the casual disturbances,
 whether that investigation was to be pursued as before by concerted
 simultaneous observations at different stations, or, as suggested in the
 Report, by the determination        of  the laws, relations and dependencies
 of the disturbances at individual stations obtained independently and
 without concert with other observers           or other stations.     Thus, in
 reference    to these particular phenomena, the British system was both
 an enlargement and an extension          of the objects of the German Asso
 ciation  ;  but it also embraced       within its scope the determinations
with a precision, not previously attempted, of the absolute values of
the three elements,       and of the periodical and progressive changes to
 which they are subject        ; premising however, and insisting with a
sagacity which has been fully justified         by subsequent experience,     on
the necessity      of eliminating in the first instance the      effects  of the
casual and transitory variations, as an indispensable preliminary           to a
correct knowledge         and analysis of the progressive and periodical
changes.       A  further prominency was given to investigations into the
particular class of phenomena which form the subject of this paper,
by the declaration that
                               " the theory of the transitory changes      is in
itself one of the most interesting and important points to which the
attention of magnetic inquirers can be turned, as they are no doubt
intimately connected       with the general causes of terrestrial magnetism,
                                                             2x2

                                      638
and will probably lead us to a much more perfect knowledge              of  these
causes than we now possess."
   The instructions contained in the Royal Society's Report for the
adjustments and manipulation of the several instruments provided for
these purposes were clear, simple and precise.          In looking back upon
them after the completion         of the    services   for which they were
designed,   it is impossible to speak of the instructions otherwise than
with unqualified praise. But the guidance afforded by the instruc
tions terminated with the completion of the observations.              To have
attempted to prescribe the methods by which conclusions, the nature
of which could not    be anticipated, should be sought out from observa
tions not yet made,      would have been obviously premature.                Yet
without some discussion of the results, the mere publication             of   un
reduced observations is comparatively valueless.            It  has  been well
remarked by an eminent authority, whose opinions expressed               in the
Royal Society's Report have been frequently referred to in the course
of this paper, that " a man may      as well keep a register    of his dreams,
as of the weather, or any other      set  of daily phenomena, if the spirit
of grouping, combining, and eliciting results be absent."               It was
indispensable that the attempt should be made to gather in at least
the first fruits of an undertaking on which       a  considerable amount of
public money and of individual       labour had been expended        ; and the
duty of making the attempt might naturally be considered to rest on
the person who had been entrusted with the superintendence               of the
Government Observatories.        The methods and processes adopted for
reducing, combining, eliminating, and otherwise eliciting results were
necessarily of   a novel description  ;  they were in fact an endeavour to
find a way by untrodden paths to simple and general phenomenal
laws where no definite knowledge of the origin or mode of causation
of the phenomena previously existed. Happily it is not necessary
to trespass on the time or attention of the Society by a description
of the methods and     processes  which have been employed to elucidate
some   of the leading features of the magnetic storms,       as these are  fully
described in the discussions prefixed to the ten      large volumes in which
the observations at the Colonial Observatories have been printed.              It
will be only necessary to advert, and that very briefly, to some         of the
principal conclusions which may be supposed          to throw most light on
the theory of these phenomena.
   The results of the extension of the term-day comparisons to the

                                      639
American     Continent,    and to the Southern         Hemisphere     and the
Tropics, may first be disposed of in a very few words.           The contem
poraneous character of the disturbances, which had been shown by
the German term-observations to extend over the larger portion of the
European Continent, manifested itself also in the comparisons of the
term-days in 1840, 1841, and 1842 at Prague and Breslau in Europe,
and Toronto and Philadelphia in America, published in 1845; and
the same conclusion was obtained by comparing with each other the
term-days at the Colonial Observatories, situated in parts of the globe
most distant from one another.      The   days of disturbance still appeared
to be of casual occurrence, but were now recognized as affections com
mon to the whole globe, showing themselves simultaneously at stations
most widely removed from each other.           When distant stations       were
compared, as for example stations in Europe with those in America,
and either or both with Tasmania, discrepancies in the amount of par
ticular perturbations, similar to those which had been found in com
paring the European stations with each other, presented            themselves,
but larger and more frequent, and extending occasionally even to the
reversal of the direction of the simultaneous disturbance.           Instances
were   not unfrequent of the same element, or of different elements,
being disturbed      at  the same    observation-instant     in Europe     and
America   ;  and on the other hand, there were perturbations, sometimes
of considerable magnitude, on the        one continent,    of which no trace
was visible on the other.      Hence it was concluded, with the increased
confidence due to this additional        and more extensive        experience,
that various forces proceeding from different sources were contem
poraneously in action;       and it was further     inferred that the most
suitable and promising mode of pursuing the investigation was by an
endeavour    to analyse  the effects produced at individual      stations, and
to resolve them    if possible into their respective   constituents.
   The hourly      observations    which   had been      commenced      at  the
Colonial stations in 1841 and 1842,        and continued     through    several
subsequent years, furnished suitable materials for this investigation,
the first fruits of which were the discovery, that the disturbances,
though casual in the times of their occurrence, and most irregular
when individual perturbations only were regarded, were, in their
mean   effects,  strictly periodical   phenomena     ;  conforming in each
element,   and at each station, on a mean      of many    days,  to a law   de-i

                                         6-10
pendent on the solar hour           ;  thus constituting    a   systematic     mean
diurnal variation distinct from the regular daily solar-diurnal variation,
and admitting        of being separated from it by proper processes of
reduction.       This conformity of the disturbances to a law depending
on the solar hours was the first known circumstance which pointed to
the sun as their primary cause, whilst at the same time a difference in
the mode of causation of the regular- and of the disturbance-diurnal
variations seemed to be indicated by the fact, that in the disturbance-
variation the local hours of maximum and minimum were found to
vary (apparently without limit) in different meridians, in contrast to
the general uniformity of those hours in the previously and more
generally recognized       regular solar-diurnal variation.
     This first   reference   of the magnetic storms to the sun            as  their
primary cause, was soon followed by a far more striking presumptive
evidence    of the    same, by a further      discovery of the existence        of a
periodical variation in the frequency of occurrence;             and amount       of
aggregate     effects,  of the magnetic storms, corresponding in period,
and coincident in epochs of maximum and minimum, with the de
cennial variation in the frequency and amount of the spots on the
sun's disk, derived by Schwabe from his own systematic observations
commenced        in 1826 and continued thenceforward.              The decennial
variation of the magnetic storms is based on the observations                 of the
four widely       distributed    Colonial    Observatories,    and is concurred
in by     all.     This remarkable        correspondence between         the   mag
 netic storms and physical           changes    in the   sun's photosphere,       of
 such enormous magnitude as to be visible from the earth even by
 the unassisted     eye, must be held to terminate altogether any             hypo
 thesis which would assign to the cause           of the magnetic disturbances
 a  local origin on the surface       or in the atmosphere of our globe, or
 even in the terrestrial magnetism itself,          and to refer them, as cos-
 mical phenomena, to direct solar influence           ; leaving for future solu
 tion the question of the mode in which that influence produces the
 effects which we believe       we have     thus traced to their source in the
 central body of our system*.
    * The  existence of a decennial period of the magnetic storms was not, as some
 have supposed, a fortuitous  discovery ; but a consequence   of a process of exami

     We may regard as a step towards this solution the separation of
  the disturbances of the declination into two distinct forces acting in
  different directions and proceeding apparently from different foci;
  the phenomena of distinct (though in so many respects closely allied)
  variations exhibit the same peculiar features at all the stations to
  which the analysis has hitherto extended, and have been exemplified
  by the observations at Kew, as shown in the early part of this paper.
  A similar separation into two independent             affections,   each having its
  own distinct phenomenal laws,          has followed from an analysis          of the
  same description applied to the disturbances             of the magnetic dip and
  force at the Colonial stations ; thus placing in evidence, and tracing
  the approximate laws of the effects of six distinct forces (two in each
 element) contemporaneously in action in all parts of the globe, and
 pointing in no doubtful manner to the existence of two terrestrial
 foci or sources in each hemisphere from which the action of the forces
 emanating from the sun and communicated to the earth may be con
 ceived   to proceed.       Such an ascription naturally           suggests to those
 conversant with the facts of terrestrial magnetism the possibility that
 Halley's    two terrestrial magnetic foci in each hemisphere may be
 either themselves      the localities in question, or may be in some way
 intimately connected        with them.      The important observations which
 we owe to the zeal and devotion of Captain Maguire, R.N. and tha
 Officers of H.M.S. ' Plover,' have made us acquainted with Point Bar
 row as a locality where the magnetic disturbances prevail with an
 energy far beyond ordinary           experience,    indicating     the proximity of
 that station to the source or sources            from which the action of the
 forces may proceed.          Now Point Barrow        is situated in a nearly inter
 mediate position between what we believe to be the present localities               of
fall within the limits comprised by the observations.      The period being decennial,
and the epoch of minimum occurring at the end of 1843 or beginning of 1844,
the epoch of maximum was necessarily waited for in order to ascertain the precise
duration of the cycle.     The maximum took place in 1848-1849, the observations
in 1850 and 1851 showing that the aggregate value of the annual disturbances
was again diminishing as it had been in 1842 and 1843.           The process of deter
mining the proportion of disturbance      in different years is a somewhat   laborious
one, and requires time : but in March 1852,     I  was able to announce to the Royal
Society the existence of a decennial    variation, based on the concurrent testimony
of the observations   at Toronto and Hobarton ; deeming it proper that so remark
able a fact   should   not be publicly stated until it had been thoroughly assured
by independent    observations  at two very distant parts of the globe.

                                           642
Halley's northern foci, and          at no great distance    from either   :  in such
a situation the exposure to disturbing influences proceeding from both
might well be supposed to be very great.               The displays of Aurora at
Point   Barrow exceed also         in numerical frequency any record received
from any other part of the globe.
    The further prosecution of this investigation appears to stand in
 need of some more systematic proceeding than would be supplied by
the uucombined efforts of individual zeal.               Observations similar to
 those  of the Kew Observatory, made at a few stations in the middle
latitudes of the hemisphere, distributed with some approach to
symmetry in their longitudinal distances apart, would probably fur
nish data, which by their combination might serve to assign the
localities from whence the disturbances are propagated —contribute
still further to disentangle the complications of the forces which pro
duce them, — and thus hasten the attainment of that "triumph of
science"      foreseen     and foreshadowed by the great geometrician              of
the last age.         Of   such a nature was the scheme          contemplated by
the Joint Committee            of  the Royal Society    and   British  Association,
and submitted          to   H.M.     Government    in   the    hope   of obtaining
their aid in the execution of such part of it as fell within                 British
dominion     ;   and of thus     " maintaining  and perpetuating our national
claim to the furtherance and perfecting of this magnificent depart
ment of physical inquiry."                                 '
                                          (Herschel in        Quarterly Review,'
September 1840, p. 277.) The scheme was no unreasonable one:
probably eight or nine stations in the contour of the hemisphere
might suffice      ;  and of these we already possess the observations at
Toronto    ;   those at Kew are in progress        ;  and self-recording instru
ments, similar to those at        Kew,   are now under verification at   Kew pre
paratory to being employed on the Western or Pacific side                    of the
United States Territory, at a point not far from the previously desired
Station of Vancouver Island, for which           a substitute is thus provided.
This Observatory,         as well as one at   Key West on the southern         coast
of the United        States, in which self-recording instruments are already
at work, will     be maintained under the authority and at the expense
of  the American Government, and both have been placed under the
superintendence of the able and indefatigable director of the
                                                                            " Coast
Survey,"     Dr. Alexander Dallas Bache.           The Russian Observatory        at
Pekin,   the trustworthy        observations of which are already known to

                                      643
the Society, is understood to have recommenced its hourly observa
tions, and stands only in need      of an apparatus for the vertical force
(which might be readily supplied from this country), to contribute
its full complement to the required data.      More than half the stations
may therefore be regarded as already provided for, and there are
other Russian observatories in the desired latitudes and longitudes
which might be completed with instruments for a full participation.
   It  would be wrong to conclude these imperfect notices withont
recognizing how greatly the researches          have    been aided in their
progress by the united and unfailing countenance and support of the
Royal Society and of the British Association.        The Kew Observatory
owes its existence    and maintenance to funds most liberally supplied
from year to year by the British Association        ;  and the cost of the
self-recording magnetic instruments,       of which the first instalment of
the results has formed the early part of this paper, was supplied from
funds at the disposal of the Council of the Royal Society.             Mag-
netical science,   rapidly as it is advancing, is even yet in its infancy  ;
and it is in their early stages particularly that all branches of natural
knowledge stand in need of the fostering aid of societies          in which
science is valued and cultivated for its own sake.

                            (Abstract.)
  The arrangement observed in the divisions and subdivisions of the
bronchial tube is that of a panicle. There is everywhere to be di
stinguished a straight diminishing          tube, from which lesser tubes are
given off alternately from its sides        ;   these   lesser tubes   in their turn
observe a similar plan   of distribution, and the smaller          tubes, down to
their ultimate terminations, are governed by the same system.                 There
is nowhere to be found either a true dichotomous or a trichotomous
division.
  The distinction    between    that part which is bronchial              tube    and
that which is parenchyma,       is,   in   a    properly injected lung, marked
and very decisive, and can never be mistaken by even the most inex

perienced person, when a fragment, however small, is examined                                         by
the microscope.
  When the bronchial tubes                      have    reached their penultimate               termi
nations, the coats which form their perimeters split, as it                                 were, into
two layers.        The outer of        these,       which is tougher, thicker, and more
fibrous, expands and encloses an                    ultimate portion of the parenchyma.
                                                                                   '
To   these portions  of the lung the name of ' leaflets is given in                                   this
treatise.     The outer coat of the bronchial tube, by being spread                                   out
in the leaflets,    becomes continuous with the general parenchyma                               of the
lungs. The inner portion of the tube immediately divides into nu
                                                    '
merous minute tubes, to which the name of ' pedicels is now given.
   Each of the pedicels goes to a different leaflet,                               but each      leaflet
receives several pedicels from different terminal                              bronchial    tubes.
   A minute        anastomosis        is thereby established between the termina
tions of the different bronchial                       tubes,      through       the leaflets.        On
entering the leaflet, each pedicel splits up into processes which                                     ex
tend to the internal perimeter of                   the leaflet, and by intersections with
similar processes derived from the other pedicels, divide the interior
into compartments called ' air-cells.'
   Each leaflet      is,   to   a   considerable extent, divided from those which
surround     it   by sulci, but       it   is   continuous in structure with them                      by
certain parts of its base, in which                      it   is   in contact with them              and
adherent.
   On the     surface      of the lungs           these leaflets          give the appearance          of
bodies of    a   somewhat quadrilateral shape.
   The interior of all the bronchial                    tubes      is   marked with    '
                                                                                           rugae,' and
these rugae show the direction                    of the bundles of longitudinal                     con
tractile fibres, which              are placed immediately                    beneath the mucous
membrane.          These longitudinal                  fibres are surrounded            by circular
ones, and             by the contraction of these latter that the rugs

formed.       When the bronchial tubes                     have been kept distended, the
rugae are not present       ;   the mucous membrane                     is   then perfectly smooth.
   There are no such things as                      alveoli     belonging to the tube.

   The bronchial artery supplies the following structures —                            :
  I. The successive layers of cellular tissue, the lymphatic                                  glands,
coats    of the pulmonary vessels, neurilemma, &c.
   II.    The fibrocartilaginous and fibrous portion of the                                 bronchial
tubes   ;   some exceedingly minute capillaries, derived from these, ex

                                         647
tend into the mucous membrane, but do not in any way anastomose
with the proper vascular plexus belonging to this structure.
    III.   The bronchial artery also freely supplies the walls and pro
cesses    of the leaflets with arterial blood.
    IV.    Some small branches arrive at the surface           of the lungs, being
conducted thither        by some minute bronchial tubes, which communi
cate with longitudinal        air-passages   to be found in the substance         of
the pleura.         These    small    arteries anastomose       freely with other
branches of the same artery in the sub-pleural cellular tissue.
    The bronchial artery forms no sort of anastomosis with the pul
 monary system in any part of the lungs, and is quite incapable of dis
 charging the function of the latter under any circumstances whatever.
     The bronchial    veins are    of two sorts   : one forms a very free system
 of inosculation     on the surface     of the lungs, the other is always dis
 coverable (in the recent       lung) in the loose cellular tissue surrounding
 the bronchial tubes : they both have valves, and consequently cannot
 be injected    in a retrograde direction, but they can both be injected
 from the bronchial        artery.    Neither of them can be injected under
 any circumstances from the pulmonary                 system.     They both   have
 large intercommunicating          trunks.
     The pulmonary artery accompanies the bronchial tube, dividing
 precisely as it divides ; wherever there is a bronchial tube, however
 small, there is likewise      a  corresponding pulmonary artery, and never
 more than one.        It  gives off no branches to any collateral structure,
 and it forms no inosculations           either with its own branches or with
 any other vessels     ;  every portion     of it ultimately   reaches the leaflets,
 and there it makes        a most minute, uniform          and equal reticulation,
 anastomosing throughout the lung.
     The pulmonary vein commences by tufts in the interior of the
  leaflets ; part of the capillary vessels emerges on to the surface of the
  leaflet, and commences the formation of minute veins, which imme
  diately dip down through the sulci which divide the leaflets, to reach
  the interlobular surfaces, where they increase in size, and ultimately
  come into contact with the under surface              of  a bronchial tube  :  the
  other part of    the capillary vessels makes its way from the interior           of
  the leaflet by means of         the pedicel, and reaches       the mucous mem
  brane, where a most abundant, minute, and exceedingly regular plexus
  is formed, occupying        the whole surface       of the mucous membrane.

                                         648
 This plexus in     the larger tubes is reinforced       by blood-vessels derived
 from numerous leaflets which surround the bronchial tubes                ;  straight
 vessels penetrate from these leaflets through the          walls of the bronchial
 tubes, to reach the plexus       in the mucous membrane.
    On the external surface of the bronchial tubes, numerous radiating
 vessels collect the blood from the plexus            in the mucous membrane,
 and the trunks      of these radiating vessels soon terminate        in the veins,
 already described as coming into contact with the under surface of
 the bronchial tube.
    The    vessels  which    have   been    alluded to as receiving     their tri
 butaries in the interlobular      surfaces,    collect their blood from all the
 surrounding lobules      ; consequently the blood which reaches the vein
 placed in contact with a particular            bronchial    tube, is not derived
 exclusively from the same lobules as those with which that bronchial
 tube and its accompanying artery are in connexion, but it receives
 its blood from all parts of the lungs promiscuously.
    The pulmonary veins accompanying the bronchial tubes continue
 to increase in size in proportion as the tubes themselves increase, and
 finally they terminate in the large veins which enter the left auricle.
 XVII. " On        the Curvature       of the Indian Arc." By the Vene
        rable J.   H. Pratt, Archdeacon of Calcutta. Communicated
        by Prof.    Stokes, Sec. R.S.           Received Sept. 3, 1860.
                                     (Abstract.)
    This communication completes the              series  of the author's papers
on the subject of the Indian Arc.            He   commences     by recapitulating
the chief results of his former calculations, and adverting to the at
 tempt which he made in his former papers to explain the difficulty
which those calculations brought to light, namely, that the ampli
 tudes of the arcs from Kaliana to Kalianpur and from Kalianpur to
 Damargida, determined geodetically, were so little in excess as they
proved to be of the same amplitudes determined astronomically,                  —a
 difficulty which he endeavoured to get over by attributing                 to the
Indian Arc     a curvature different from that corresponding to the mean
meridian of the earth.         In   the present     communication, introducing
the condition that the length of the chord of the arc must be the same
in both the ellipses, the local and the mean, drawn through the

                                       649
stations at the extremities of the arc, he demonstrates        that no change
in the curvature of the        arc,  within   reasonable  and   indeed within
wide limits, can have any appreciable effect on the calculated am
plitude.    The author's conclusions from the whole investigation           re
garding the Indian Arc are thus summed up : —
    (1) Colonel Everest discovered that the astronomical amplitudes of
the two portions of the Indian Arc between Kaliana and Kalianpur,
and between Kalianpur and Damargida, are, the first less by 5" -24,
and the second greater by 3". 79, than the geodetic          amplitude calcu
lated with the mean semi-axes and ellipticity of the earth.
    (2) The geodetic amplitudes of          these  two portions of the arc,
calculated from the measured          lengths and with the mean axes, will
be sensibly exact, even should the curvature           of the  arc differ from
that of the mean meridian within reasonable but wide limits — a thing
which geology teaches us to be very likely the case.
    (3) Hence the geodetic measurements of the survey being without
sensible error, as is known by the tests applied, the discrepancy in
 (1) can only arise from local attraction affecting the vertical line, and
so changing the astronomical amplitudes.
    (4) Two great visible causes of disturbance of the vertical by at
traction are, the Mountain Mass on the north of India, and the Ocean
on the south.      The influence of both of      these is felt all over India  ;
the first producing      a  northerly   deflection, varying   from 27"-98 at
Kaliana to    a sensible   angle  (probably about 3", but this the author
has not calculated) at Cape Comorin ; the second             producing also a
northerly    deflection, varying from about 19"- 71 at Cape Comorin
to 6"- 18 at Kaliana.
    (5) The combined effect of these two visible causes is to make the
astronomical amplitude of the upper arc 13"- 1 1 too small, and of the
lower    3"-82 also too small.       They   are therefore insufficient   to ac
count for the discrepancies pointed out by Colonel Everest.               Some
other cause must exist tending to increase the upper astronomical am-
tude by 13"- 1 1 — 5"-24=7"-87, and also to increase the lower am
plitude by 3"-82 + 3"-79=7"-6l.
    (6) It has been demonstrated that a slight but wide-spread varia
tion in the density of the crust, from that deduced from the fluid-
theory, either in excess or defect, such as there is no difficulty in
conceiving to exist, is sufficient to account for deflections such as

                                      650
these.    For  example   :  an excess    of density amounting only to     ^
part, extending through        a  circuit of about 1 20 miles around        the
mid-point    of the whole arc between         Kaliana and Damargida        (and
therefore not far from Kalianpur), and to a depth        of about  200   miles,
will produce this   effect, and make the calculated deflections from         the
three causes — the mountains, the ocean, and this hidden         cause below
— exactly accord with the       observed   errors in the astronomical   ampli
tudes.
   (7) The resulting total deflections at Kaliana, Kalianpur, and            Ds-
margida, arising from the three causes, are 26"-29, 21"-05,                  and
24"-84  :  these make the two astronomical amplitudes,         the one   5"-24
smaller, and the other 3"-79 larger than the geodetic             amplitudes,
the error brought to light by Colonel Everest.
   (8) No error    can arise   in the mapping of India by using the geo
detic measurements.        But the position of any places put into the map
thus formed, the latitudes of which are determined from observations
of the sun or any other heavenly body, will be wrong by the               total
amount of the deflection at those places, amounting in the three          cases
above to as much as      half  a mile.

      OBITUARY NOTICES OF DECEASED FELLOWS.
    Dr. Richard Bright         was the third son   of Mr. Richard Bright,
 an eminent merchant of Bristol, and commenced           his education at a
 private school in the neighbourhood       of that city.    He subsequently
 was placed   with the late Dr. Carpenter of Exeter.       In the autumn of
  1808, he matriculated at the    University of Edinburgh, and attended
 the general lectures delivered at that celebrated school       ; but  it was
 not until the following year that he entered       upon the studies    more
 immediately connected with the medical profession.
    In the summer of     1810  he accepted     an invitation to accompany
 Sir George Stuart Mackenzie       and  Mr. (now Sir Henry) Holland to
 Iceland  ; and the departments of Botany and Natural History in ' The
 Travels in Iceland,' subsequently published by Sir George Mackenzie,
 were written by   Dr. Bright.     On his return from Iceland he studied
 at Guy's Hospital for two years, and it was here that he acquired a
 taste for pathological   investigations.     He returned to Edinburgh
 in 1812, and graduated at that University in the following year. He
 intended likewise to take   a degree   at Cambridge, and entered      as an
 undergraduate at Peterhouse; but he kept only two terms, finding the
 college requirements as to residence       incompatible   with his profes
 sional pursuits.  He then   became    a pupil, as he was subsequently a
 colleague, of Dr. Bateman at the Carey-street Dispensary, and ac
 quired a knowledge    of cutaneous     diseases under that distinguished
 disciple of Willan.
    When the Continent was opened to travellers by the general peace
 of 1814, Dr. Bright visited Holland and Belgium, and spent some
months at Berlin, where he attended the practice of Horn and of
 Hufeland,   and made    the acquaintance of Klaproth, Rudolphi, and
 Heim   ; during his residence   at the Prussian     capital, he acquired a
thorough knowledge of'the German language.            From Berlin he went
to Dresden for a short time, and arrived before the close of the year
at Vienna, where he attended the practice       of Hildebrand,    Rust, and
Beer, and became      acquainted with Baron Jacquin, Prochaska, and
the elder Frank.     From Vienna he proceeded in the spring of          1815
to Hungary, and, on his way home, passed through Brussels about
a  fortnight after the battle of Waterloo,        availing himself    of the
                                                                a

                                            ii
occasion   to witness the medical and surgical practice among the sick
and wounded.         His   '
                              Travels in Hungary,' published           in the   year
1818, had reference      to this period, and were deservedly popular.            His
account of the gipsies in that country was especially interesting             ;  and
his sketches,    from which all the plates in that work are copied,
showed his artistic skill to great advantage.
   In  December      18 16   he was admitted      a Licentiate   of the College of
Physicians,    and was soon after elected           Assistant   Physician to     the
London Fever Hospital.           In the   zealous discharge   of his duties there,
he contracted fever during a severe epidemic, and narrowly escaped
with his life.      In  the autumn         of  1818  he again set out on a visit
to the Continent,       aud soon after his return to England, in              1820,
commenced      practice as     a  physician in London.       From this time he
concentrated the whole of his public duties on Guy's Hospital,                    of
which he became Assistant Physician, holding that appointment                  until
 1824, when he succeeded to the office of Physician. His devotion to
the duties of his profession, and to pathology in particular, through
out the period of his connexion with Guy's Hospital,                 was most re
markable.      During many years he spent at least six hours a day in
that great practical school, and his indefatigable industry and un
rivalled talent for observation then laid the foundation for his well-
known discoveries      in renal    disease.
   After giving lectures on medical botany, Dr. Bright, in 1824, began
to lecture on the theory and practice of medicine, and after some
years   associated    Dr. Addison with him in that duty.              He also, in
conjunction    with that gentleman, projected a work intended as a
class-book    and entitled 'Elements of the Practice                of Medicine.'
Only   one volume       was published, which         appeared in 1839,      and is
understood to have been chiefly the composition of his coadjutor.
Dr. Bright resigned the post of Physician at Guy's Hospital in the
year 1843, and on his retirement was complimented by the Governors
with the honorary title of Consulting Physician.
   In  1832   he was elected        a  Fellow of the Royal College of Physi
cians,  and in the following            year delivered the      Gulstonian    Lec
tures, the subject being " The Functions of             the Abdominal     Viscera,
with Observations on the Diagnostic Marks of the               Diseases to  which
the Viscera are subject."           In   1837 he delivered the Lumleian       Lec
tures at the College, and he chose for his subject the disorders                 of

                                                   fii
the brain.        He subsequently            presented        the College with      a    descriptive
account of the pathological collection of Dr. Matthew Baillie.                                    He
became     a    Fellow of the Royal Society in 1821                  ;   and at     a    subsequent
period received the Monthyon Medal from the Institute of France.
  Although Dr. Bright had occasionally                            suffered     from illness for
several    years,      the final and fatal          attack — which        was found to have
depended        on an extensive ossification                  of the aortic     valves    — was of
short duration.            He first    became seriously           ill on the   1   1th of Decem
ber, 1858, and on the 15th, at midnight,                         breathed his last.
  Dr. Bright's contributions to medical                          science are both numerous
and important.             His   '
                                     Reports of Medical Cases,' contained in two
royal quarto volumes, published in 1827 and 1831, embrace investi
gations on diseases of the kidney, the lungs,                            and the brain and
nervous system, and on the pathology of fever.                           The       plates    of this
great work are all coloured              ;   they were executed under the author's
immediate superintendence, and are exquisite samples of the peculiar
art of representing faithfully and without exaggeration the morbid
appearance        of   tissues and organs.
  This        celebrated     work, rich       as   it    is   in the fruits of      sagacious     and
untiring       research,     by no means             comprehends             the whole       of Dr.
Bright's published contributions to medical                         science.     The volumes of
the       Medico-Chirurgical Transactions,'                     from the 14th to the 22nd

he contributed no less than sixteen important memoirs.                               In the eighth

joint production of Drs. Bright, Barlow, and Rees, in the preface to
 which (written         by
                      Dr. Bright) he thus calls attention to an important
 innovation in clinical study — " The few following pages will be found
                                         :
to contain the record             of the first attempt which,            as far as  I     know, has
yet been made in this country to turn the ample resources of an
hospital to the investigation of                a   particular disease,            by   bringing the
patients       labouring         under   it   into one ward properly                    arranged for
observation."
      Such were         the numerous           and varied          contributions          to general
knowledge and to medical science made by Dr. Bright.                                        No phy
sician of the present day has, in our country,                               surpassed,     perhaps
                                                                                   a2

none   has equalled him,     in the extent of his original researches in
pathology    ; and although his fame as a discoverer is founded chiefly
on his researches     into the pathology       of renal  disease   in connexion
with dropsy, his minute and unwearied investigation into the mor
bid anatomy of the kidney, and his detection of the albuminous state
of the urine   as pathognomonic     of  disease   of that organ, yet a perusal
of his writings abundantly convinces us that he brought the same
sagacity and industry to bear upon many other problems                  in patho
logy and practical medicine.       His labours in this country, as those
of Andral and Louis in France, of Hufeland, the two Franks, and
others in Germany, and Abercrombie               in Edinburgh, contributed
greatly to establish a more practical mode of investigation than had
previously     prevailed — a more direct        attention    to the    connexion
between    the symptoms during life and the post-mortem appearances
—a   more constant and extensive application of animal chemistry and
of the powers of the microscope to the elucidation of morbid conditions.
Regardless of systems, a maxim laid down by him in early life, in the
preface   to his ' Travels  in Hungary,'       as applicable to the traveller,
seems    to have     guided him    throughout       his distinguished     career :
" correct    observation,"   says  he,   "  and faithful statement are the
cardinal virtues on which his character must depend."
    William John Broderip, Esq.,                was  the son of an eminent
medical practitioner in the city of Bristol, where he was born on the
21st of November,         1789.   Having     received   a   sound    training  in
classical knowledge at a provincial         seminary, he proceeded in due
time to Oxford, where he entered as         a  student at Oriel College.      At
Oxford he made the acquaintance of Dr. Buckland, who at that time
(1809)    was Fellow and    Tutor of Corpus Christi College, but had as
yet scarcely turned his mind to that study in which he afterwards
became      so  distinguished.    Young Broderip,        on    the other hand,
carried with      him   to the University      a considerable     knowledge    of
 Natural History, and especially of Conchology, with which                he had
 from his earliest years been more or less familiar through             means  of
 a collection belonging to his father.        Such as it was, the zoological
 acquirement of the student became of service to the future Professor,
 who in after-years of well-earned fame, was happy to acknowledge
that he got his first practical lesson on fossil shells, and gathered

                                              V
what became the nucleus of his own fossil cabinet, in a walk to Shot-
over     Hill with his young friend Mr. Broderip.
      After taking his degree of B.A., Mr. Broderip                became   a diligent
student of the law at the Inner Temple.                   He  was called to the    Bar
in     1817, and    in 1822      was appointed     a    police magistrate, in which
office    he continued      till  185b..    In the latter period of his career       he
was elected      " Bencher"         and   " Treasurer" of Gray's Inn, and            to
him was confided the especial charge of the library of that Society.
      Amidst his arduous duties           as a magistrate,      Mr. Broderip found
time to renew his zoological studies, and to begin the formation of a
conchological        cabinet, which       soon   grew into first-rate importance,
and became an object of special interest to foreign naturalists visiting
London, who seldom failed to profit by Mr. Broderip's readiness to
open it freely to their inspection. This collection was purchased for
the British Museum.
      Mr. Broderip      was elected Fellow       of the Linnean Society in 1824,
of the Geological Society in 1825,              and of the Royal Society in 1828.
 He was a zealous cooperator in the formation of the Zoological
 Society, of which he was one of the original Fellows and Members
of Council.        He    was Secretary     of the Geological Society, conjointly
with Sir R. Murchison,            till the year 1830. His death took place on
 the 27th of February,           1859, from an attack        of serous apoplexy.

 abridged from a        brief memoir of him by one of his most distinguished
friends*,     who knew him well; and the following                    account of   Mr.

 power as a writer.         Had circumstances permitted, he would have
 been a      Field Naturalist   second    only to Gilbert White.        When his
 friend Professor Owen became, through Royal favour, the tenant                    of
  one   of the lodges in Richmond Park, Broderip would spend there
  much time in close observation of zoological phenomena afforded by
  the garden and the wooded vicinity            of Sheen Gate.       A     note an
  nouncing the commencement of nidification in the adjacent rookery,
  or the arrival of a migratory song-bird, would immediately bring the
  retired Police Magistrate       to Richmond     Park.    Many     references     to
  facts so observed are made in those delightful          combinations of pro
  found and quaint learning with direct and close observation of nature
  which were contributed         by Broderip    to the ' New Monthly Maga

   and reprinted in the volumes entitled ' Zoological Recreations

 on more than one occasion,         when the river made irruptions        into the
 tunnel, the salvation of the works was due.
     One of his first great independent designs was that for the pro
 posed suspension bridge across the river Avon, from Durdham Down,
 Clifton, to the Leigh Woods         ; and the acceptance    of his proposal he
 owed to the fact that, upon the reference         of the competing designs to
 two distinguished mathematicians, for the verification of the calcula
 tions, his alone was pronounced to be mathematically              exact.   -Want
 of funds   alone prevented, at that period, the execution         of the design,
 which, however, there are now some hopes                of seeing carried into
effect by transplanting to that site the present Hungerford           Suspension
Bridge, which is itself the work of Mr. Brune1.
     His introduction to Bristol led to his appointment           as Engineer   to
the Docks of that city, which he materially improved.               He had been
previously engaged       in the construction of the Old North Dock at
Sunderland, and subsequently he designed the Bute Docks at Cardiff.
    In 1833-34 he        was    appointed Engineer      to the Great Western
Railway    ;  and whilst engaged on the surveys,          he matured his views
of the Broad Gauge, relative to which he sustained one of the hardest
fought engineering contests on record. This work placed his reputa
tion high among Engineers, and henceforth his mental and physical
powers were taxed almost beyond those of any other member of the
profession.      His attention to all the details of         even   the smallest
works was unremitting       ;   and the Hauwell and Chippenham Viaducts,
the Maidenhead, and other masonry bridges, the Box Tunnel, and
the iron structures of the Chepstow              and Tamar      bridges on the
extension of the Railway to the South and West, attest the boldness
and originality of his conceptions, his taste in designing, and his skill
in the use of various constructive materials.
    The partial failure    at the opening      of the Great Western Bailway
appeared only to incite his inventive faculties, and to afford a field
for the exhibition of his great powers.          All the physical impediments
were met and conquered        ;  and his perseverance was ultimately crowned
with   success, in attaining    n speed  of travelling, combined with comfort
and security, hitherto unrivalled.
    In the attempted adaptation of the atmospheric           system   of propul
sion to the South Devon Railway he was, however, signally unfortu
nate, in spite   of all the ingenuity displayed ; but this failure had the

effect  of bringing into view      a  most pleasing feature of his character       ;
for while he duly paid up all the calls upon the stake he had in the
undertaking, he at the same time refused to accept the professional
emolument to which he was entitled.
   His   services were     in constant    demand,   in railway contests, before
 Committees of both Houses of Parliament             ; and he was employed to
construct the Tuscan portion          of the Sardinian railways,     as well as to
advise   upon the Victorian lines in Australia,            and the Eastern       of
Bengal.
   Intimately,   however, as the name of Isambard Brunel will ever be
connected with the railway epoch in Great Britain, it is probably as
the originator of the system of extension of the dimensions of steam-
vessels that he    will be best known to posterity.
   The   ' Great Western '
                                 steam-ship was his first innovation on the
usual system.        In   constructing    that vessel, which was much larger
than any previously built, he had the able assistance of           Mr. Paterson,
of Bristol, as the shipwright, and of Mr. Joshua Field as the constructor
of the   engines  ;   and in spite of adverse anticipations, even among
practical men, the most triumphant            success crowned his efforts, and
demonstrated the correctness of his views.
   His attention     was at that time directed to the subject          of propul
sion by the screw,        a subject on which      Mr. F. P. Smith had         been
long and perseveringly labouring            ; and the experiments made by
Mr. Brunel, in his        voyages    on board the 'Archimedes,'         convinced
him of the practicability         of the adaptation of the       system   to large
vessels.    He then designed the 'Great Britain,'               an iron    ship of
dimensions far exceeding those            of any   vessel  of its period: that
the first essays were         not entirely successful must be attributed to
the fact   of the machinery not having         been designed     by those whose
peculiar study it had been to produce engines of the class required
for such    vessels.    The disaster in Dundrum Bay demonstrated the
scientific design and the practical strength of the hull of the ship,
and the successful voyages         since   made  have   proved the correctness
of his original views. He was then appointed the consulting Engineer
of the Australian Steam Navigation Company, whom he advised to
construct    vessels   of  five  thousand tons burthen,       to run the entire
voyage to Australia without stopping.            His   counsels   were, however,
not followed.

                                       X
     The  ' Great Eastern ' was his                        and to the
                                       crowning effort ;                 design
 and execution of this gigantic vessel, far surpassing          in dimensions
 any ship hitherto      constructed,  he devoted all his energies.         The
 labour was, however, too great for his physical powers, and he broke
 down under the wearying task ; leaving to          Mr. Scott Russell      and
 Messrs. James Watt and Co., his cooperators in the construction of
 the hull and engines,     the actual completion of the work he had          so
 well and so perseveringly brought up to the day          of starting on    the
 trial trip.
     The  disasters attending the launch and the     trial trip were perhaps
 inseparable from so novel an experiment, on so gigantic a scale, but
 the ultimate     results may be looked      forward    to with confidence.
 Whatever      they may be, the impulse given by          Mr. Brunel to the
 construction of large-sized vessels is already felt both in our mercan
 tile marine and in the Royal Navy.
     This sketch of   the professional labours  of Mr. Brunel is     of neces
 sity brief and incomplete, nor can the details be given        of the nume
 rous scientific investigations in which he was engaged ; but the
 devotion, during ten years of considerable portions of his time, to
 completing the experiments made by his father, to test the applica
 tion of carbonic acid gas as       a motive power in engines, must be
 mentioned.       His special objects of study  were mechanical problems
 connected with railway traction and      steam navigation    ; and although
 he was not, perhaps, so sound, or so practical a mechanic as his
 friend, and, at the same time, constant opponent, Robert Stephen
 son, yet his intuitive   skill and ready ingenuity enabled him to arrive
 at satisfactory solutions. The characteristic feature of his works was
 their size, and his besetting fault was     a seeking for novelty,     where
the adoption of       a well-known    model would have sufficed.         This
defect has been unfairly magnified, wherever the pecuniary results          of
an undertaking      have not reached the preconceived standard ; and due
allowance has not been made for the difficulties encountered in the
prosecution of a new and bold enterprise.         It  might, perhaps, have
been as well     if a uniform gauge had been originally       established for
the United      Kingdom, — and    such may still be the ultimate result       ;
but we must still admire the indomitable         energy and consummate
skill with which Mr. Brunel and his coadjutor, Mr. Saunders, pushed
the broad gauge and its tributaries westward to Bristol, Gloucester,

                                       xi
and through Wales, to Milford Haven,           — then south-west        to Exeter
and Plymouth, and onwards to the Land's End              ;  and after invading
the north-west manufacturing district of Birmingham,             finally arriving
at the shore of the Mersey opposite to Liverpool.            This   alone would
have sufficed for the lifetime     of many men ; and in truth the stupen
dous    labours undertaken by Brunel could scarcely be performed
without overtaxing the mental and physical faculties, and eventually
causing them to break down.
     Mr. Brunel  was fervently attached to scientific       inquiry   ;  he was  a
good mathematician, and possessed          great readiness     in the practical
application of formulae.      He   was elected at an unusually early age a
 Fellow of the Royal Society, and was an old Member of the Institution
of Civil Engineers, of whose Council he was one of the Vice-Presi
 dents ; he belonged to most of the principal Scientific Societies of
 the Metropolis, and several Foreign Societies, and was         a  Knight of the
 Legion of Honour.        A liberal patron      as well as a discriminating
judge of art, he was himself devoted           to artistic pursuits,      and his
 early drawings, as well as his professional sketches,        attest his feeling
 for purity of design.
     Of his private character,   those only who were admitted to his          inti
 macy could judge correctly.         Brunel was not    a   demonstrative man,
 but there was    a fund of kindness and goodness          within,    which only
 required to be aroused to stand forth in high relief.               It  has been
 well said of him by an old     friend, — " In  youth a more joyous,         kind-
 hearted companion never existed.           As  a man, always overworked,
 he was ever ready by advice, and not unfrequently, to            a large extent,
  by his purse, to aid either professional         or private friends.         His
  habitual caution and reserve made many think him cold and worldly,
  but by   those only who saw merely his exterior could such an opinion
  be entertained.    His   carelessness   of contemporary public opinion,
  and his self-reliance, founded on his known character and his actual
  works, were carried to a fault.       He   was never known to court ap
  plause.    Bold and vigorous professionally, he was as modest and
  retiring in private life."    He was cut off — in his fifty-fourth year —
  just when he had acquired that mature judgment which in such a
  profession as that of the Civil Engineer can be attained only by
  long experience, and when the greatest work of his life had reached
   the very eve of completion.

   Edward Bury, Esq.,          was born at Salford, near           Manchester, on
the 22nd of October,       1 794.      He received his early education at a
school in Chester.     From early youth he exhibited, in various ways,
a taste for machinery and construction,              and eventually     he  became
established as a manufacturer           of   engines   and machinery      at Liver
pool.   For   some years     following      the opening of the      Liverpool and
Manchester, and the London and Birmingham                    Railways,   Mr. Bury
supplied numerous locomotive engines for those lines             ; and he appears
to have been    very successful in practically applying in the construc
tion of these  engines various improvements in steam-machinery which
had been recently introduced or suggested.               The details of his im
                                                "
provements are described in         a  paper       On the Locomotive Engine,"
                                    '  Transactions of the Institute of Civil
which he contributed to the
Engineers.'     He  also acquired much consideration on the             Continent
on account of his steam-machinery, and especially for his improved
engines employed in the navigation of the Rhone. For some years after
the opening of the London and Birmingham                 Railway,   Mr. Bury had
the entire management of the locomotive department               ; and it deserves
to be noticed, that,  whilst his administrative         services were  duly recog
nized by the Directors,        his    tact,   judgment,    and conciliatory dis
position gained for him, in         a  most unusual degree, the regard and
confidence of those       employed under him.              Mr. Bury afterwards
undertook a similar charge on the Great Northern Railway some
time after it opened   ;  and in the mean time he had been engaged in
different important engineering works at home and abroad.                 He  sub
sequently withdrew      from active       life, and died in his retirement, on
the 25th of November,          1858.      The     date  of his election into the
Royal Society is February        1,   1844.
   Henry Hallam, Esq.,            was born at       Windsor (a.d. 1777).       His
father was  Canon of Windsor and Dean of Bristol ; the latter pre
ferment he resigned during his lifetime.              Mr. Hallam    was educated
at  Eton, and to Eton he felt, and evinced throughout life, strong and
grateful attachment.        Both his sons were likewise educated there.
Classical learning, then almost the exclusive study in that school,
found a congenial mind in           Mr. Hallam,        and   to the last he took
great delight in its cultivation.         Already at Eton he had become a
sound and accurate scholar.             Some of his verses, printed in the

                                      xiii
 *
   Musae Etonenses,' are among the best in that collection, and show
 his command of pure and vigorous Latin, some fancy, and more
 thought than is usual in boyish compositions.           From Eton he passed
 to Christ     Church,    Oxford.     If   his   academic     career   was   undi
 stinguished, it was because in his time the University           offered hardly
 any opportunities of distinction.       But he remained        a faithful mem
 ber of the University.       At the height of his     fame he undertook the
 office  of Examiner in Modern History         ; and Christ Church did her-
 self credit by enrolling his name (he was already Doctor of Laws)
 among her honorary students created under the new academic system.
 Soon after he left the University,     Mr. Hallam commenced the study
 of the Law.     He   entered himself as a member        of the Inner Temple,
 became a Bencher, and took so much pleasure in the society of his
 legal friends, that, almost to the close of his life, he availed himself of
 the privileges and discharged the duties of that dignity.            Some inde
 pendent fortune, which was gradually increased, and an office under
 Government, in the Stamp Department,             — an   office  which he held
 till the dissolution of the Board, — happily placed him               above   the
 necessity of striving     for the emoluments of bis profession, while
 those   legal studies were     an admirable      preparation for his future
 career.    Had he   devoted   himself to the practice of the Law, there
 can be no doubt that, although       he may not have had the bold and
ready eloquence, the pliancy, quickness, and versatility of a consum
mate advocate,     yet his profound,   accurate,    and comprehensive learn
ing, his indefatigable industry,      his sagacity in penetrating          to the
depths of    an abstruse subject, his grave, calm wisdom, which had so
much      of the true judicial character, might have led him to the
highest honours and rank in the Law. It is well, however, for his
country, for the cause of letters, and indeed of Constitutional              Law
itself, that he left the dignity of the Bench or of the Woolsack                to
his eminent contemporaries, and became           — what no other man of his
day could have become
                            — the Historian of Constitutional Government
and    Law.    In that character,   and in that    of a  man of letters, he has
acquired fame and influence as extensive          as the world-wide      English
language, and indeed throughout          the whole of Europe, where his
works are generally known by translations.            Mr. Hallam became, by
deliberate choice and predilection,       a man     of letters in the highest
and noblest sense.      His dignified mind, and     we may add, his indepen

                                           xiv
dent circumstances, as they had placed him above following the                  Law,
so also raised him above           following     literature as  a  profession. He
was in the enviable position that, while he sought and obtained the
fame, he could disdain the drudgery of authorship ; and there was
no fear that such     a  mind would degenerate into indolence,           or indulge
in the serene voluptuousness of literary leisure.                He was a man of
books, but not of books only            ;  he took great delight in society, in
which he mingled freely        ;  and his own house was open not only to
many attached friends, and to his legal contemporaries,               but to  states
men, men     of letters, of art, and of science, and to cultivated foreigners,
whom he       received with easy hospitality.             There were few distin
guished men in England,            or even in Europe, who were not proud
of his acquaintance      ;  with many          he lived    on terms   of the most
intimate friendship.
    Mr. Hallam     became early a Member           of the Royal Society.   Though
not strictly to be called a man            of  science,   yet bis active and com
prehensive mind was sufficiently grounded in the principles                of most
of the   exact sciences,    especially of mathematics, to follow out their
progress with intelligent judgment, and to watch their rapid advance
with the utmost interest.           In the proceedings of this, and of other
kindred    societies,  particularly       the Antiquarian,      as well as   in the
administration of the British Museum, of which he was an elected
Trustee, he took part        ;   and always, from his remarkable          range of
 knowledge and sound practical habits, with great advantage.
    But though Mr. Hallam had thus early taken up his position as a
 man of letters, he did not come forward as an author till of mature
 age,   and then, with       a   publication     which had demanded years of
 industrious research and of multifarious inquiry.                It was the grave
 and deliberate work of a man conscious of great powers, one also
 (which is more rare) fully conscious of the responsibility attached to
 such powers, and who well knew that the best faculties and attain
 ments may be wasted,           as to     permanent usefulness and enduring
 fame, by that hasty ambition which grasps too eagerly after popular
 applause,   and wearies      the public mind by incessant demands on its
 attention.    Till this  time    Mr. Hallam       was only known by his general
 reputation    as a well-read       and accomplished scholar, and by some
 articles in  the ' Edinburgh Review.'              The conductor of that journal,
 then at  its height of power and fame (as appears from recent publi-

                                           XV
cations), fully appreciated the value of his aid, the extent and the
variety of his attainments          ; one  of his articles on Scott's 'Dryden'
was remarkable as blending the courtesy due to a man like Walter
Scott with free and independent judgment of his opinions, and at
the    same   time as giving        a  just but discriminate criticism on the
most unequal       of our great poets.
    It  was not   till past his fortieth year (a.d. 1818) that Mr. Hallam
announced himself         to the world as an author            ; but his ' View of
                                           '
Europe during the Middle Ages                 placed him at once in the highest
rank of historic writers.            Of the great qualifications of     a  historian,
except     that of flowing, rapid, living narrative (precluded                by the
form of his work, which unavoidably took that of historical disqui
sition), none appeared         to be wanting.       There was profound research
into original sources of knowledge, where they existed              ; the judicious
choice of secondary authorities, which always met with generous and
grateful appreciation       ;   sagacity in tracing the course of events and
the motives of men          ;   thorough     independence of judgment,         which
cared not what idols       it threw down in the pursuit, of truth ; singular
firmness with unaffected candour ; above all, an honesty of purpose,
which almost resembled           a passion (the only passion which he betrayed);
 a  style manly, clear,       vigorous, — if inartificial, sometimes unharmo-
 nious, yet sound idiomatic English, — an apt vehicle for the English
 good sense which was the characteristic of the whole.                There was no
 brilliant paradox, no ingenious theory to which all the              facts must be
 warped : all was sober, solid, veracious.               The ' View '  was received
 not only with respect,         and   with the acclamation of all qualified to
judge     of such     a work, but even with popularity, considering its
 subject and extent, surprising.             It  was emphatically described by a
 high authority of the day as a book which every scholar should read,
 and every statesman          study.     Like all great works of the kind, it
 created    and supplied a        want in the public mind.          The History of
 the Middle Ages up to this time was                a wilderness, which few were
 disposed    or able to penetrate.            There   had been     much     laborious
 investigation, much ingenious speculation on parts of the subject                    ;
 but it was   a labyrinth which wanted a clue, — darkness which repelled,
                                               '       '
 confusion which bewildered.             The     View     was as remarkable for its
 completeness      and comprehensiveness as for its depth and accuracy.
 Though the subjects on which Mr. Hallam dwelt at                   greatest   extent,

                                              xvi
 and it seemed with greatest predilection              (as, indeed, of the     most im
 portance), were the rise, growth, and development                of the  governments,
 laws, civil, political and religious institutions           of the European       family
 of nations, yet the book likewise          entered  with great though      proportion
 ate fulness on the progress           of  customs, inventions,     language,     letters,
 poetry, arts and sciences.           It  was enlivened    by many      passages of    fine
 criticism    ;   the note on Dante, for instance,           may be read      with    high
 interest, after all that has been             subsequently written on        the great
 Italian   poet.      Since the publication of      Mr. Hallam's work,        awakened
 curiosity, the study of the philosophy of history, chiefly                   by   Conti
 nental writers, and, above all, religious zeal, have investigated                 almost
 every point relating to the Middle Ages                 with emulous       ardour     and
 industry   ;   yet  Mr. Hallam's work has stood the test, and still maintains
 its ground. Mr. Hallam himself, with the modesty inseparable from
 true wisdom, and only anxious for the promulgation of sound truth,
 instead of narrow jealousy of trespassers            upon   his province,     watched
 with careful interest         every advance      in knowledge    on those     subjects
which he had treated almost without                  a guide.    In   a supplemental
 volume, afterwards incorporated with the original work, he                   collected
from every quarter of Europe whatever in his judgment might                       throw
 a  broader and clearer light on these dark places             of mediaeval history.
     Nearly     ten years elapsed       before   the publication   of Mr.    Hallam's
 second great work,          'The Constitutional History of England,'          in July
  1827.    This      was   in some respects a continuation of part              of   the
former book, which, among the other polities of Europe, had                     traced
the growth          and expansion       of the British Constitution       during     the
Middle Ages.            It may be     almost enough to say of this         work,    that
by common consent it has become the standard authority on                      its all-
important        subject.     It  is constantly appealed to in the         Houses     of
Parliament        ; it is the text-book in the Universities            as well   as in
the higher schools         ;   and this, from a general infelt acknowledgment
of its truthfulness, which           overawes     and convinces against their      will
those    to whom its doctrines may at first sight seem unacceptable.
Nor    was this from a cold, stately assumption               of superiority   to the
great questions which have divided Englishmen in all ages. Through
out the work, in which every event which has stirred the
passions    of     men, every character illustrious        for good or for    evil in
our    annals, passes         in review,      and is    summoned       to judgment,

                                                   xvii
though      Mr. Hallam holds avowedly                      and without         disguise his own
strong opinions, those of a calm, conscientious Whig of the old school,
still there is an enforced impression that nothing could tempt him to
be an unfair partisan             ;   that he seeks, and only seeks — and seeks with
out fear,      without compromise, without                     awe    of great         names, without
respect     for popular       idolatry — right           and truth, justice and humanity,
sound law, tolerant religion.                   If there       has grown up a more general
accordance      of sentiment and opinion on English Constitutional History ;
if   extreme      differences         have died away, and,            so far as past times are
concerned,        the old party watchwords have nearly sunk into oblivion;
if   there has been greater general sympathy for the wise and good,
more    unanimous reprobation of the base and bad, this may in some
degree be attributed to the influence                     of   •
                                                                   The Constitutional History
of England.'
  After another interval of nearly the same length (in Sept. 1838
and July 1839) appeared the 'Introduction to the Literature of the
15th, 16th, and         1   7th Centuries.'          This view of the intellectual                   deve
lopment of the world during the most active and prolific                                       period in
the history of the human mind,                     if with Mr.        Hallam       a   work of labour
(to most others it had been a work of intense labour), was yet a work
of love.     It    was the overflow           of   a mind      full to abundance of the               best
reading on almost all subjects, a disburdening, as it were, and                                  a   relief
from the stores of knowledge accumulated during                                a   long life.        If it
be hardly possible for a single mind to achieve                         a   history of literature

was that     of Mr. Hallam.                 How well he had             read the best authors
may be tested by his criticisms on Shakspeare, on Ariosto, on Cer
vantes, and on some           of our older         poets   ;    his power of grappling with
more profound and abstruse subjects, by his estimate of Locke                                   ;    while
writers of     a   more dry and uninviting                 class,     scholars, even gramma
rians, pass before          us,       if   with less minute investigation, with much
more than      a   dull and barren recension of their                   names.
     Only   one other work,            a   small one, bears the name of                 Mr. Hallam       ;
and that, though printed for private distribution, having been liberally
                                                                                         b

communicated to his numerous friends, may              justify at   least  a passing
allusion.     It records a melancholy chapter in an otherwise             uneventful
life to which men of letters might have looked            with respectful        envy.
It  pleased Divine Providence to       try this  wise   and blameless      man with
almost unexampled domestic affliction.              He married        an     excellent
lady, the daughter of Sir Abraham Elton.                Of many children,           four
only, two sons and two daughters, grew up to mature age.                  The    eldest
son was one whom such a father              (for Mr. Hallam, with          not   much
outward show, was        a man of the deepest and most tender affections)
could look upon with pride, with love, and with hope allotted to few
distinguished men.         What was the promise of Arthur Hallam may
be known from the volume          of his 'Remains,'      printed by his        father;
what he was in disposition as well as in mind,               from the       exquisite
'In   Memoriam'        of Mr. Tennyson.        The blow which           bereft      Mr.
Hallam of this son was frightfully sudden.             His eldest    daughter       and
his wife followed the first-born to the grave.           One son remained          ; he
too,  if of less  originally speculative and poetic temperament than                the
elder, with great acquirements and endowments, was gifted                  also with
a gentleness     and tenderness    of disposition, singularly fitted to be the
consolation, the surviving hope of such a father. He too was carried
off with almost equal suddenness.             One daughter remains,          married
to Colonel       Farnaby     Cator,   and has     children.     Bowed       but    not
broken by these sorrows,       Mr. Hallam preserved his vigorous            faculties
to the last, and closed his long and honoured life in calm                Christian
peace.
    Arthur Henfrey            was born at Aberdeen,         of English      parents,
on the 1st of November, 1819.            He studied medicine at St. Bartho
lomew's Hospital,        and in   1843 became a Member          of the   College of
Surgeons, but delicate health prevented            him from engaging          in  the
practice of his profession.         Accordingly,   having    a taste   for   botany,
and having already attained to great proficiency in that science,                   he
thenceforth      devoted    himself   exclusively   to its pursuit,      and     soon
acquired a distinguished         position    among English Botanists.               I"
 1847 he was appointed Lecturer on Botany at St. George's Hospital,
and in     1 854   succeeded    the late    Professor Edward      Forbes in       the
Botanical Chair at King's College          ; he was also Examiner in Natural
 History   to the   Royal Military Academy and the Society of              Arts.

                                       xix
    Notwithstanding his feeble bodily constitution, Professor Henfrey's
labours were incessant. Whilst constantly engaged in original in
vestigations,    the results of which he made known in various papers
which appeared in the 'Transactions'            of the Royal and Linnean
Societies,    the ' Annals and Magazine       of Natural History,' and the
'Journal of       the Agricultural    Society,'  his untiring   industry  also
enabled     him    to furnish     numerous   translations   and abstracts of
foreign memoirs to the Natural History Journals, and to give
reviews and critical notices of botanical works in these periodicals,
as   well   as in    the 'Quarterly    Review.'     Moreover,   he translated
several independent works from the French and German languages,
and composed        some valuable elementary treatises      on botanical sub
jects, of which his 'Elementary Course of Botany,' published in
 1857, is the last and most important.          For three years also he con
 ducted the     'Journal of the Photographic        Society,' and since 1858
 was one of the most active editors of the new series of the 'Annals
 of Natural History.'
     Professor   Henfrey     was a man    of an amiable and gentle nature,
 which neither the pressure of daily toil nor the trying interruption
 of ill-health could ever ruffle : his death, on the 7th of September,
 1859, at the early age of thirty-nine,      hastened as it probably was by
 his unremitting exertions, has      been deeply lamented by all who knew
 him.
     Thomas      Horsfield, M.D.,       was born at Bethlehem,       in Penn
  sylvania, on the 12th of May, 1773, of parents who were Moravians,
  in which Christian communion he lived and died.            He  was educated
  for the medical profession in the University        of Pennsylvania, where
  he took the degree       of Doctor of Medicine in 1 798. Early in life he
  went to Java, where he passed sixteen years, actively engaged in the
  pursuit of Natural History, to which he had devoted himself.          During
  his residence     in Java, he thoroughly explored every part of the
  island, in quest of its natural productions.         From Java he visited
   Banca, and gave the fullest and best account which exists of that
  island.    After the restoration of Java to the Dutch in          1816,  Dr.
   Horsfield made     a  long sojourn in Sumatra, and there continued his
  favourite studies    ;  but having made the friendship of Sir Stamford
   Raffles, who is said to have imbibed from Horsfield his well-known
                                                                b2

love  of Natural History,     he followed that eminent person                to England
in 1818, and soon after was made Keeper of the Museum                       of the East
India Company, which charge he held till his death, which took
place on the 24th of July, 1 859, in the 87th year of his age.
    Whilst in the East, Dr. Horsfield           diligently collected          the plants
of Java    and   the adjacent islands;        and the folio volume afterwards
published in this country, under the title of
                                                          '

riores,' contains figures of selected species from his collections,                   with
 descriptions furnished by his friends          Mr.   J. J.  Bennett and the late
Mr. Robert Brown.            During his stay in Java          also, he    contributed
various papers      on the Geology and Natural            History of the Eastern
                  '
Islands to the      Transactions of the Batavian Society,' of which he
was a member.         The   same collection also contains a very             interesting
experimental inquiry, by Dr. Horsfield,             on the physiological           action
of the Upas Antiar poison, the juice of a tree which was afterwards
                                       '                            His writings on

East India Company's Museum, and numerous papers on zoological

subjects contributed to the Linnean Transactions,' the Zoological
Journal,' and the' Proceedings of the Zoological Society.' His latest
                       '
publication is the Catalogue of the Lepidopterous Insects in the East
India Museum,' of which only the first volume                has appeared        ; it was
compiled by     Mr. Moore, his       assistant,  from Dr. Horsfield's          materials
and manuscripts, and under his direction.                Dr. Horsfield had some
years before commenced         a  Catalogue of these insects, of which only
 two parts were published        (1828-29); and this publication, though
 incomplete, deserves notice, as containing an elaborate Introduction,
 with   a general    arrangement of the Lepidoptera               founded on their
 metamorphoses.       The importance of the transformations of insects in
reference   to their classification had indeed become early impressed on
 Dr. Horsfield's    mind, and he accordingly spent three seasons during
his stay in Java in collecting the larvte of numerous species of Lepi
 doptera, watching their development, and making careful descrip
tions and drawings of their successive               changes     up to the perfect
 state.
    Dr. Horsfield    was a member        of various learned        societies    at home
and abroad.       He     was elected     a Fellow of the Linnean              Society in

                                       xxi
 1820, and    of the Royal Society in 1828. He was a man of retired
 habits, but of amiable character and unblemished integrity.
    Manuel John Johnson,             the late Radcliffe Observer, expired
 suddenly on the 28th of February, 1859, in the fifty-fourth year of his
age.      Cut off as he was in the midst of his invaluable labours and in
the full vigour of his high intellectual powers, his death has caused
a severe loss      to science, which,   however deeply deplored by the
numerous friends who enjoyed the privilege of his intimate acquaint
ance,   will only   be appreciated  in its full extent when the great and
important works which he designed, and so nearly executed, shall have
been duly completed.
    After passing through the usual course of studies at Addiscombe
College, Mr. Johnson commenced his public career in 1821 as an
officer in the St. Helena Artillery, and while acting as aide-de-camp
 to General Walker, then in command of the island, was appointed to
 the control of a small but efficient observatory, founded by the
 Honourable      East   India Company.      The establishment came into
 active service   in 1829, and in the short space of three years and a
 half,  a valuable catalogue of 606 stars had been observed by the young
astronomer and a single assistant.          This  catalogue  was afterwards
published, at the expense of the Court of Directors, in the ' Memoirs
of the Royal Astronomical Society,' and obtained for its author the
award of the gold medal of that body in the year 1835.
    On the termination of this important work, Lieut. Johnson re
turned to England,         and entered the University      of Oxford  as an
undergraduate.        On the death of Professor Rigaud, in 1839, he was
 appointed Radcliffe Observer, and speedily rendered the Observatory
one    of the most active scientific institutions in the world.
    One of his first acts was to obtain permission of the Radcliffe
Trustees to publish an annual volume of Observations — thus scorning
the life of comparative ease he might have chosen, and giving the
world an effectual guarantee for the performance of those self-imposed
duties to which he so willingly and faithfully devoted the remainder
of his life.    He accordingly immediately      began the re-observation  of
'
  Groombridge's      Circumpolar   Catalogue,' adding thereto all conspi
cuous adjacent stars, and many others of especial interest.          To this
important work the resources         of the Observatory    were devoted  for

                                      xxii
more than fourteen years     :  volume after volume has been issued            with
a regularity hitherto unsurpassed     ;   while the  high character      for  accu
racy of the star-places in each annual catalogue has been fixed              by the
unanimous approval of the most eminent           European authorities.            To
render this great work complete, however, required the reduction                   of
every individual observation to a fixed epoch, and the incorporation               of
the whole into one general catalogue.         Much yet remained to be done,
though the work was fast progressing ; and had its lamented author
been spared another year or two, he would have presented to astro
nomers a monument of industry and devotion to duty unsurpassed
in the   annals  of British science.     The point now most to        be desired,
previous to the publication        of the final catalogue, is,        a   rigorous
investigation of the errors of division of the        Meridian     Circle,   which
has not yet been attempted, owing to the too          numerous and        pressing
pursuits of the unwearied and enterprising Director.
    In  1 854 a new project was commenced,      — ' A Catalogue of Remark
able Objects,' comprising all stars of suspected         large proper     motion,
the binary systems, variable and coloured stars,         all bright   stars   down
to the third magnitude, and indeed whatever of interest               was    obser
vable with a four-inch       object-glass.     In  the discussion of        proper
motion      Mr. Johnson's plan of procedure was that                adopted      by
Madler, viz., instead of deducing the change of place from two                most
widely distant authorities alone,       to employ    all published     positions,
 and thus to deduce the best possible final value ; leaving no             broken
 link, no contradictory observation uncorrected, or at least          unnoticed,
 to raise future discussion as to the value derived.          Such a      method
 is of course the most laborious, but nothing less can be regarded                as
 definitive, and, to secure the best results, neither time nor trouble         was
 spared.
    The most eventful     epoch   in the history of the Radcliffe         Obser
 vatory and of its late Director remains to be noticed, viz. the      establish
 ment of the fine heliometer — a treasure unique in its improvements,
 unrivalled in its marvellous powers, but almost the labour of a life
 to develope and turn to the best         account.    It  was  erected by
                                                                                its
                      Repsold of Hamburg, in October 1849,
                                                                              was
 makers, Messrs.                                                       and
 forthwith employed in incessant and toilsome research by its skilful
 manipulator.      The Radcliffe Trustees, with their usual      liberality, not
 only provided and equipped this very costly instrument, but, in            order

                                       xxiii
to enable     Mr. Johnson to   devote himself almost exclusively to its use
without interrupting      the pursuits     of which we have already spoken,
granted him an additional         assistant.     After  a careful study    of the
peculiarities of the instrument, in the course of which his acquaint
ance with German       enabled   him to derive most         important aid from
the learned disquisitions of Bessel,           Hansen, Wichman,        and other
astronomers, an elaborate      description of it appeared in the preface to
vol. xi. of the Itadcliffe Observations.         The detection and treatment
of certain corrections peculiar to the Oxford heliometer afforded                a
fine example of       Mr. Johnson's        suggestive   genius.     Before   com
mencing the more difficult         investigations     of stellar parallaxes, he
passed,    step by step,    through     a   patient and judicious course of
training, by the measurement       of  some well-known double stars,       of the
diameters of the planets, and of the brighter stars in the Pleiades.
In  1 85 1  the heliometer was employed in a novel and purely original
manner to determine the light-ratios            used by different astronomers
in their estimations of the magnitudes of the fixed stars.                 In the
two following years his most successful achievements            with this instru
ment were accomplished, viz. the determinations of the parallaxes
of  the stars 61 Cygni and 1830 Groombridge.                His  near agreement
with the values obtained by Bessel for the former, and by Professor
Peters and Otto Struve for the latter object, was most satisfactory,
and gave ample evidence of his complete success in these intricate
investigations.     In  1854   and 1855       the parallaxes of Castor, Arc-
turus,   n Lyrae, and one      of the comparison         stars  previously used
in the case of 1830 Groombridge, became the objects of researches
the  details of which are given in vol. xvi. of the Radcliffe Observa
tions.
   The   same spirit    of enterprise and progress which Mr. Johnson
cviuced in the purely astronomical part of his duties was manifested
in a yet more marked degree in his management of the meteorolo
gical department.       From   a  single page of ordinary        records of the
barometer and thermometer, the subject rapidly expanded, under his
treatment, to an extent hitherto          unprecedented.       The introduction
of photography     as a means   of barometric registration by Mr. Ronalds,
and its ingenious extension to the wet- and dry-bulb thermometers by
Mr. Crookes,     as also, at a later period, to the records        of the direc
tion and strength of the wind and the depth and time of fall of rain,

                                       xxiv
added such an amount         of anxious labour to the already      overwhelming
requirements of his     office, as for the last three    years completely       pre
cluded him from making further             researches    with the     heliometer.
This is the more     to be deplored, as there is       reason to fear      that the
monotonous, though cheerfully endured, fatigue inevitable in reducing
so novel and accumulative a process to a regular            system, accelerated
the sad event which it has been         our mournful task to record.
   An    earnest  labourer himself,      Mr. Johnson was ever ready to
further the scientific labours of those whom he had it in his power
to assist ;  and it was in this spirit that he sanctioned and encouraged
his assistant,   Mr. Pogson, in making independent              researches      with
the Radcliffe Equatorial, after the hour of closure         of the   official work
of the Observatory, whereby that gentleman            was   enabled to    discover
four planets and ten new variable stars.
   The remembrance of his high social qualities, his refined taste,
and extensive fund of ready information in literature and the fine
arts as well as in science,      his frank    and agreeable     demeanour,       his
thorough integrity of purpose, and his unostentatious               benevolence,
will be long cherished by a wide circle         of friends, especially in the
University, where he was so         bright an ornament and so general a
favourite.
   He   was President    of the Royal Astronomical Society in the years
 1857 and 1858,     and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in
1856.
   Lieutenant-Colonel       Charles Hamilton Smith                was born       in
Austrian Flanders,     on the 26th of December,          1 776, of a Protestant
family holding    a  good position in the province, and partly of British
descent.     He  was bred to      the military    profession, and began his
career  as a volunteer in the       British army in the Netherlands,           but
soon obtained a commission, and in          1 797 was transferred to a regi
ment in the West Indies.           After serving for     twelve  years   in that
part of the world, he returned to Europe, and joined the Walcheren
expedition as Deputy Quartermaster-General.             In   1813 he was again
employed in the Low Countries         ;  and on this occasion    he succeeded,
with  a  handful of men, in capturing the fortress of Tholen,           whereby
a new and better basis        of operations   was opened up to the Brifi-'h
forces in Brabant.     After being   engaged, in 1816, on a mission to        the

                                               XXV
United States        and Canada,         in connexion with the Foreign Office,        he,
in     1820, retired from active public duty.
      In the course of his active military life, Colonel Smith found time for
varied study.         History, Archaeology, and Zoology were his favourite
subjects, and these he continued to cultivate in his retirement.                    The
matured results of his labours he gave to the world in various well-
known works, of which he was sole or part author.                         For many of
 these he had early begun to accumulate materials, especially pictorial
 representations of the objects described                ; and for this employment
his taste and skill as         a   draughtsman gave him both inducement and
 facility.
      Whilst     on the staff        of the Horse Guards, he wrote the military
                                         '
 part of Archdeacon Coxe's Life of Marlborough,' which is said to
 have excited the interest of Napoleon at St. Helena as to its author
  ship, inasmuch as it showed                a practical acquaintance with military
  affairs scarcely to be expected           of  a churchman.     He is  also the author
  of the article    " War " in         the ' Supplement to the Encyclopaedia         Bri-
  tannica,' and of the introductory paper on the "                Science   of War " in
         '                   '
  the      Aide Me'moire       of the Royal Engineers.
       The first publication in which the powers of Colonel Smith's
                                                            '
  pencil were called into requisition was the Costume of the original
  Inhabitants      of the British Islands,' undertaken in connexion with the
  late     Sir Samuel Meyrick.             A still greater work, which    was in reality
   hardly less indebted to Colonel Smith, although his name does not
   appear in the title, is       Sir S. Meyrick's ' Critical Inquiry into the His
   tory of Ancient Armour.'                 We are informed that most of the illus
   trations (blazoned in gold and colours) of that celebrated work were
   copied, with his full concurrence, from Colonel Smith's drawings.
        Well, however, as Colonel Smith was known as a historical anti
   quary of no common order, his reputation as                    a  writer on Natural
   History was perhaps higher.                      The article     "Ruminantia"         in
    Griffith's edition of        Cuvier's ' Regne       Animal' (1835)      was    written
   by him ; and many of              the engravings in that edition were from his
                                                                                 '

    was also the author        of the elaborate articles on Natural History, and

    The extraordinary amount of materials collected by Colonel Smith
is not, however, to be estimated only by his published works.
He has left more than twenty volumes of manuscript notes on the
most varied      subjects.    In many instances         these   notes illustrate   his
remarkable collection of drawings, amounting in number to many
thousands.       The whole of      these   valuable collections, as well as his
personal assistance,      were throughout his life placed          freely at the dis
posal   of all to whom they could        be  of service   ;  and it was at all times
sufficient for the Colonel to be assured that by his advice and assist
ance    he could further       the objects of the literary          inquirer  or  the
 artist to ensure his active cooperation.
    Colonel Smith became a Fellow of the Royal Society                 in 1824, and
 of  the Linnean in 1826.        On    the formation      of the Devon and Corn
 wall Natural History Society, he was               elected    President.    On his
 retirement from active military service he fixed his residence at              Ply
 mouth, where he died on the 21st of September, 1859.
    Sir George Thomas Staunton, Bart., D.C.L., was the only
 child of the late Sir George Leonard Staunton, who is well known
 to the public as having        accompanied Lord Macartney              as Secretary
 of the first Embassy      to China,    in the year     1 792, and as the author
 of the account of the Embassy which            was afterwards published.         He
 is not less     known to those       who are acquainted with the history
 of British India,      as having, when      Lord Macartney was Governor of
 Madras, concluded the peace          with Tippoo Sultan in the year 1 784 .
     Sir George Thomas Staunton           was born       in May 1781, and died,
 after a succession of paralytic          seizures,    in the summer of 1859.
 He     succeeded    his   father    in the baronetcy in the year              1801.
 After his father's death he was the last male representative              of a very
 ancient English family, the branch of it from which he was descended
 having been established as landed proprietors in the county                 of Gal-
 way in Ireland since the middle of the            1 7th   century.
     Sir George Leonard         Staunton     had some peculiar notions as          to
 education, which he endeavoured            to carry out in the training of his
 son.     The   son was brought       up entirely at home, under his father's
 eye ; and, except on a few very rare occasions,              never associated with

                                         xxvii
boys of his own       age, but lived entirely   in the society of older persons.
A tutor      living in the    house   instructed him in the Greek and Latin
languages.        He had   masters   to teach him Mathematics, Botany, and
other    sciences,   and he attended lectures on the various departments
 of Natural Philosophy. Partly,          perhaps, from his not being occupied
 with the pursuits of other boys, but principally from his being natu
 rally endowed with great powers of application and much readiness
 of apprehension, he made a remarkable progress in all these branches
 of knowledge      ;  so that when he was not more than fifteen or sixteen
 years of age he was as much advanced as many even diligent students
 when they are eight or ten years older.
     In the year     1792 he accompanied his father to China, under the
  nominal designation of Page to the Ambassador.                 For  some  time
  before the embassy embarked, and during the voyage to China, he
  had the opportunity of studying           the Chinese language under two
  native Chinese missionaries from the Propaganda College at Naples              ;
  and he soon made          such proficiency    as  to be able to speak it with
  tolerable fluency, and to copy papers written in the Chinese charac
  ter.    In this manner he     became very useful to the embassy.         When
  the embassy was presented         at the Chinese      Court, the Emperor    in
  quired for the little boy who could speak             Chinese, conversed with
  him for some time, and good-naturedly presented him with an em
  broidered yellow silk purse for holding             areka-nuts, from his own
  girdle.
      On leaving      China,   Sir George L. Staunton        engaged   a Chinese
  servant to accompany him to England, in order that his son, by
  constantly communicating with him in Chinese, might keep up and
  extend his knowledge of the language.
      In the year     1 799,  having received    the appointment of Writer in
   the factory of the East India Company at Canton, young Staunton
   proceeded a second        time to China.       He remained at Canton, with
   some    occasional visits to Europe, until the year 1817, having for
   some    time before his final return to England filled           the office of
   Chief of the factory. His residence in China afforded him the
   opportunity of still further advancing himself in a knowledge of the
   Chinese language by means of native teachers.                He  was the first
   among the members of the factory who had ever studied the lan
   guage of the country in which          their duties required them to reside     ;

                                    xxviii
 and thus he became      very useful by superseding the necessity of    em
 ploying native interpreters, in whom (principally from the fear which
 they had of the local authorities) much confidence could not be
 placed.    While residing in China, he made several translations from
 the Chinese    ;  the principal, and that a work of great importance,
             ' Ta Tsingleu-lee,' or Chinese penal code. This last was
 being the
 published in the year 1810.        Other translations of much interest,
 though of inferior importance to this, have been published since.
     In the year    1816 a second  embassy   was sent to  China, the   late
 Lord Amherst, Sir Henry Ellis, and Sir George Staunton being ap
 pointed joint Commissioners of Embassy.          An account of the pro
 ceedings of this Embassy has been published by Sir Henry Ellis.
 Sir George Staunton, however, printed his private journal, and dis
 tributed copies of it among his friends.
    After his return to England, Sir George Staunton purchased a
 house and landed property in Hampshire, where he afterwards re
 sided during a part of every year.    For  some time he had the  honour
 of representing South Hants in Parliament.         He afterwards repre
 sented Portsmouth,     and continued to do so     until he resigned the
 charge a very few years before he died.
    After his being finally re-established in England, he occupied him
self but little with the pursuits of his early life ; though it may have
been partly his knowledge       of botany that led him to lay out  an ex
tensive   garden, with numerous hothouses and conservatories,      full of
the rarest trees and plants.
    Although his life   was prolonged   until he had entered on his 79th
year, he was always of a delicate frame, and not capable of great
physical exertion.      Others observed in him a certain shyness and
awkwardness of manner,       of which his peculiar education affords an
adequate    explanation.    But with this he on various occasions dis
played great moral courage and determination.          Many instances of
this might be quoted, but one will be sufficient.      On the occasion of
the second embassy, the Chinese Court refused to receive it unless
                                                                      the
ambassadors      performed the ceremony of the Kotou before the
Emperor.       Lord Amherst and Sir H. Ellis wished that they should
do so,  but Sir George was so satisfied that it would be regarded
                                                                       by
the Chinese as an act of humiliation, and something like the
                                                                 homage
paid to a feudal lord, that he positively refused his consent.       The

                                       xxix
Chinese were     aware ot this, and threatened to dismiss the rest         of the
embassy, but to detain him as a prisoner.            But he declared that
this    made no alteration in his view of the subject      ;  that, being con
vinced that he was right, he was quite ready to take his chance of
whatever might befall him, rather than            swerve   from what he re
garded as the strict line of his duty.
     Mr. Robert Stephenson, M.P.,               the  only son      of   the late
Mr.     George Stephenson, was born on the 16th        of October,      1803, at
Willington     Quay, near Newcastle-upon-Tyne,        where his father had
charge of the colliery engine. The rudiments of his education
were received at the village school at Long Benton, whence he was
transferred, at the age of ten years, to the academy of Mr. John
Bruce,    at Newcastle, which he left at the age      of sixteen.      He then
received some instruction        in mathematics from Mr. Riddell, now
the Master of the Naval School at Greenwich, and              was apprenticed
 as  a  coalviewer to  Mr. Nicholas Wood, with whom           he stayed about
three years.      Mr. George Stephenson having by that time raised
 himself    to the position   of  a consulting   mechanical engineer,        and
 appreciating the advantages      of that education which it had not        been
 his own good fortune to receive, determined to send his son to the Uni
 versity of Edinburgh, where Robert Stephenson was entered in 1821.
 During    one session, which was all that could be afforded for him, he
 followed so indefatigably      the lectures of the celebrated        Professors
 Leslie, Hope, and Jameson, that he carried off most           of the prizes of
 the year   ; and feeling the value of the opportunity, he laboured most
 assiduously, not only to learn everything that was placed before him,
 but more especially to lay the foundation for future self-instruction.
     In  1822 he quitted the university to become the apprentice          of his
 father, at the works then first        established at Newcastle-on-Tyne
 for the manufacture of machinery, and whence proceeded the loco
 motive engines which were destined to produce such             a revolution in
 the internal communication of all countries.
    His health having    suffered from unremitting study and close appli
 cation to his duties at the factory, he accepted       in   1824 an appoint
 ment to investigate and to report upon some silver mines in South
 America.      This occupied him for nearly four      years ; and upon his
 report the Columbian      Mining Association     was formed.       Before his

                                      XXX
departure for America       he had assisted his father      in the survey       of
the line of the Stockton and Darlington        Railway, which was opened
for traffic on the 27th of September, 1825. During the progress of
the works, public attention was so much attracted to the subject,
that the project was resuscitated for a railway between Liverpool and
Manchester, intended chiefly for the conveyance           of cotton from      the
port to the place of manufacture.            Mr. George Stephenson           was
appointed to survey the line contemplated for the undertaking ; and
being afterwards appointed engineer for the construction          of the work,
in the year      1826,  and feeling the need of his son's assistance,          he
summoned him to England.           Robert Stephenson, on his return home
by way of the United States of America and through Canada, fell in
with Trevithick, who was also coming home from South America.
 That   steam locomotion should form a constant topic         of conversation
 between     two such men was only natural      ;   and Robert    Stephenson,
who was already acquainted with and had assisted             in carrying out
 the improvements of his father in the Killingworth and other loco
motive engines, was well inclined to listen to what were then con
 sidered the    "visionary schemes" of Trevithick, whose utmost            ideas
 of attainable    speed were, however, so soon to be far exceeded.
    Whilst    engaged, after his arrival in England, in assisting his father
in the construction of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, Robert
 Stephenson at the same time directed his attention to the systems of
railway     traction,  and was    successful in the competition         for the
 prize offered by the Directors     of the railway for the    best locomotive
 engine.      The result of his experiments, added to the joint Essay by
 himself and Mr. Joseph Locke, in reply to the Report of Messrs. Walker
 and Rastrick, which recommended fixed engines and rope traction,
 led to the settled adoption of the locomotive engine, and contributed
materially to decide the question of the general introduction            of rail
                                                                      '          '
 ways  in this country.      Soon after this he constructed the         Planet
engine,    at the Newcastle factory, which     became    the type of all the
very successful engines      that have been since employed.         About the
same period the United States        Government sent three officers of the
 corps of Topographical      Engineers   to examine into and report upon
 steam locomotion on railways as practised        in this country.   For these
gentlemen Robert Stephenson designed and constructed two locomotive
 engines,   embodying    a special contrivance adapting them to traverse

                                           xxxi
the    sharp curves of the American railways             ; and in the majority of
the    American engines that mode of construction has since been fol
lowed.      Thus it is to Robert Stephenson that are               due the types    of
the locomotive engines used in both hemispheres.
     The successful result of        the  Liverpool and Manchester Railway
 led   to the project   of  a line between London and Birmingham.                 The
 survey for this line had been entrusted to Robert Stephenson, who
 removed to London for the purpose of devoting himself to the execu
 tion of the works, which had            also been committed        to him.     They
 were very heavy, and demanded the exercise of the greatest                skill and
 constant personal attention, especially in such works as the Kilsby
 Tunnel, where the quantity of water met with threatened to stop the
 proceedings.       The railway, which was commenced in 1834, was com
 pleted in 1838     ; and such was the reputation acquired by the engineer,
 that his   advice and assistance      were    henceforth sought in all the im
 portant undertakings of the period, either for the construction of the
  works or in prosecution         of the bills      before   Parliament.      Foreign
 governments also sought his assistance           ;  and for the attention devoted
 to the scheme for the Belgian railways, both George and Robert Ste
  phenson received from the         King of the Belgians, in 1 844, the         deco
  ration of the Order of Leopold.           Robert Stephenson received also, in
  1848, the Grand       Cross of St. Olaf of Norway for similar services.
  He   was thus consulted on the construction              of railways in Belgium,
  Switzerland, Germany, Norway, Denmark, Tuscany, Canada, Egypt,
 the East Indies, and other countries.              During the progress of      these
 large systems of lines, he was called upon to design and to execute
 many very important and some very novel works, of which we can
 here only mention the Kilsby and numerous other tunnels, large
  viaducts, such as the High            Level    Bridge     at Newcastle-on-Tyne,
  the Victoria   Bridge     at Berwick,      and the Conway and Britannia
 tubular iron Bridges.          The latter great innovation in constructive
 art, which has since been extended           to architectural construction with
 the greatest    success, was     at first viewed with great distrust       ;  and it
 required some considerable time to convince the public of the security
 of such works    :   subsequently it was as difficult to settle the question
 as to the real originator      of the system. We have here only to record
 that in 1855     the Council of Presidents and Vice-Presidents of the
 French Exposition,        awarded to      Mr. Robert Stephenson the Great

  Gold Medal of Honour for the invention and introduction of the
  system of tubular plate-iron bridges, and First Class Silver Medals
  to Messrs. William Fairbairn        and Eaton Hodgkinson, for their co
  operation in the experiments      ;  and also to   Mr. Edwin      Clark,    for
  his aid in the consideration of the designs and in the construction
  of the bridge itself. As a further recognition, the Emperor added
  the decoration of the Legion of Honour.          This system of construc
  tion has since    been   extended     to  the Victoria Bridge     across   the
  St. Lawrence River, in Canada, the total length of which is nearly
  two miles, in twenty-five spans.       That bridge is the greatest example
  of the  system,  which has, however, also been employed           on a large
  scale by  Mr. Robert Stephenson, in the bridges         across the Nile,    at
  Benah and at Kaffre Azzayat, on the Egyptian Railway from Alex
  andria to Suez.      The limits of this memoir will only permit the
 further mention of the remarkable constructions on the sea-shore
  between   Conway and Bangor, for the protection of the Chester and
 Holyhead     Railway  ; and the recent restoration of the iron bridge at
 Sunderland, which was the last engineering work upon which he was
 actively engaged.
     Mr. Robert Stephenson      was considered as the leader      in the  cele
 brated discussion, called the    " battle of the  gauges," for determining
 whether the narrow or the broad gauge should be the standard for the
 Kingdom.      Events have since proved how correct were his views; and
 notwithstanding    the brilliant talents of his friend, but then oppo
 nent, the late Mr. Brunel, the broad gauge did not spread beyond a
 certain district.    It was, moreover, to his strenuous and persistent
 opposition that was due the rejection of the atmospheric system of
 traction, attempted to be introduced on the Dalkey, the Croydon,
 and the South Devon Railways.
     For some years after he reduced the sphere of his active profes
sional employment, he was engaged in several important public in
vestigations, such as that of the Consulting            Commission     of  the
Metropolitan     Sewers,  and others.      He  made able investigations and
reports upon various great undertakings,          of which the Liverpool
Water-works      may be mentioned as an example         ; and he wrote the
article  " Iron Bridges"    in the '  Encyclopaedia Metropolitana.'
    The work of his predilection       was,  however, the management of
the Engine Factory at Newcastle-on-Tyne.           To that he  devoted  him

                                      xxxiii
self  as a labour    of  love, thinking over improvements and designing
innovations,    the necessity for which had become            apparent in the
working of his lines of railway.
    In the year   1847,   Mr. Robert Stephenson       was elected to represent
Whithy in Parliament, and he continued to sit for that borough until
his decease. He did not speak much in the House ; but when he
spoke he always commanded attention, and on such questions as that
of the   Canal of the Isthmus of Suez, which he is well known to have
strenuously opposed,       he carried every one with him.       He   was a very
useful member of Committees         ; and had his life been spared,     there is
no doubt that his     services would have been even more frequently re
quired by the Government,          who had already learned to appreciate
the honesty and truthfulness of his views.
    He was devotedly attached to scientific investigations,         and,  as far
as his occupations permitted, he was           a   frequent attendant at the
various learned societies of which he was        a  member.     He  was elected
a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1849, and served on the Council.
He joined the Institution of Civil Engineers in the year 1 830, was a
member of Council,        and filled the office    of President from    1856 to
 1858.     He   was also    a  Member    of  the   Geological,  Geographical,
 Astronomical,    and Meteorological      Societies, and of the Institute of
 Mechanical Engineers, as well as of numerous societies in the coun
 try.    The honorary degree of D.C.L.       was conferred upon him by the
 University of Oxford in 1857; and           he    had previously received      a
 similar honour from the University        of Durham.
    A  most   successful   professional career, unceasing activity and in
 dustry,   combined with wisely considered investments, resulted in
 producing    a very large fortune, which      he employed during his life
 time most liberally,     and from which at his decease, after providing
 munificently for his numerous relatives, and recollecting all his friends
 and dependents, he bequeathed upwards of .3625,000 to a few chari
 table institutions and scientific societies,  — and this after having given
 such sums as £3000 at a time to the Literary and Philosophical              So
 ciety of Newcastle, to relieve it from debt, and to extend its sphere
 of utility, especially to young   men  of the working   class — an  advantage,
 by which Stephenson himself had profited in early life, and which he
 had never forgotten.
    The health of Mr. Stephenson had not            been good for the last two
                                                                   c

                                    xxxiv
years  ; and just before his last journey to Norway,     he had complained
of want of strength.      Whilst in Norway he was very unwell, and ex
hibited such symptoms of decided liver complaint as induced his
speedy return.     During the voyage, heavy weather was experienced
in the North Sea, and he was very sick and ill.           On his arrival at
Lowestoft, he was so weak as to be carried from his yacht to the rail
way,    and from thence to his bed, at his residence in Gloucester
Square, where his state grew so rapidly worse          as to leave  but faint
hopes    of his recovery.     The affection of the liver was deeper than
had been at first suspected, and was associated with further internal
disease ; and although his state was for a time alleviated, there was
not sufficient strength to struggle against the malady, which termi
nated his valuable life on the 12th      of October, 1859.
    Thorough uprightness of character        was in Mr. Stephenson joined
 with an amiable disposition, and he conciliated the affectionate regard
 of all with whom he      came into immediate relation.       To those who
 stood in need of his bounty his hand was ever open, but his bene
 ficence was without display, and he rejoiced in an occasion        of doing
 good unseen.     His  great care was for the children   of old friends who
 had been kind to him in early life    ; and many young hearts, who owe
 their present position to his kind solicitude and generosity,   will mourn
 his irreparable loss.
     Mr. John Welsh, Superintendent of the Kew Observatory,              was
 born at Boreland, in the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright, on the 27th
 of September, 1824. His father was George, the eighth son of
 John Welsh, Esq., of Craigenputtock, a small estate in that district,
 which had been in the family from an early period.             Mr. George
 Welsh, who was extensively engaged          in agriculture, died in 1835,
 and his widow with his two sons settled at Castle Douglas, where
 the elder — the subject of this notice — continued his preparatory edu
 cation, and the younger died in 1841, in his 13th year.
     In November     1839,    Mr. John Welsh     entered  the University of
 Edinburgh, and studied Mathematics and Natural Philosophy, under
  Professors Kelland and Forbes, with       a view   to the profession of a
 Civil Engineer.     He attained the highest prize but     one  of his year,
 also  prizes in  Classics  ;  he also studied Geology in the lecture-
  room and in the field, under the late Professor Jameson.

                                          XXXV
      In December      1842,   Sir Thomas Brisbane, Bart., President of           the
 Royal      Society of Edinburgh,         with the advice      of Professor    J.  D.
 Forbes, engaged       Mr. Welsh       as an observer for his Magnetical          and
 Meteorological      Observatory       at Makerstoun,      under   Mr. John Allan
 Broun, F.R.S., the Director, who, in his Report for 1845, says, —
 " I owe my best thanks to my principal assistant, Mr. John Welsh,
 for the care and assiduity with which               he assisted   me on all occa
 sions, whether connected with            the making or reducing of the ob
 servations          The   more difficult observations for the magnetic dip,
and all the determinations of constants, were made by                   Mr. Welsh
and myself."
     In  1850, the period originally         contemplated by Sir Thomas Bris
bane for the duration       of the Observatory being completed, Mr. Welsh
was     anxious to obtain some other scientific appointment.                  To aid
him in the attainment of this object, Sir Thomas gave him                    a letter
of introduction      to Colonel Sykes,       F.R.S., at that time Chairman of
the Kew Committee of the British Association ; Mr. Broun also
wrote to Colonel Sykes, expressing his high opinion of Mr. Welsh's
scientific ability   ;  and accordingly, at the Edinburgh Meeting of the
British Association in 1850, the Kew Committee reported that they
had engaged Mr. Welsh to assist Mr. Ronalds, F.R.S., who had,
ever since the establishment          of the Observatory, gratuitously under
taken     the office   of Superintendent.         From this period to within a
short     time of his death,       Mr. Welsh       devoted   himself to scientific
labour in that establishment, upholding and, year by year, increasing
the efficiency of      a  physical Observatory, which, without           any pecu
niary aid from Government,              has,   since   its  commencement, been
entirely supported by annual grants from the British Association,
assisted from time to time by donations from the               Royal Society.
    In 1851, shortly after his appointment to the Kew Observatory,
Mr. Welsh presented to the Association an elaborate Report on the
performance of Mr.Ronalds's three Magnetographs                  ; and at the same
meeting (Ipswich) he described              a  Sliding Rule for Hygrometrical
Calculations, and one        for converting the observed readings of the
Horizontal- and Vertical-force Magnetometers into variations of mag
netic dip and total force       ; both sliding rules being devised by himself.
    In   the same year, the Committee, being impressed with                 the im
portance of enabling          scientific observers     at  home and abroad to
                                                                     c 2

obtain, at     a moderate      cost, barometers and thermometers             of   more
accurate construction and trustworthy             character than      those    usually
sold, directed       Mr. Welsh     to undertake a series       of experiments        for
that object.        The results of his labours were most satisfactory, and
are   fully described in a paper printed in the Reports of the Asso
ciation for 1853.         Accordingly,    at the present    time, standard      instru
ments are supplied to scientific investigators            direct from the Obser
vatory, and barometers and thermometers which have been compared
with the standards at Kew, and each accompanied with its special
table of corrections, are not only supplied to the Government De
partments of the Admiralty and the Board of Trade, but can now be
obtained from any instrument-maker               at greatly reduced    prices.
    In the summer of         1852  Mr. Welsh      made four ascents     in a balloon,
for scientific objects.        A  detailed account of these ascents and          of the
experiments he performed, with               a description of the various      instru
ments      employed, and a statement of the general results obtained,
was    communicated to the Royal Society in 1853, and published in
the ' Philosophical
                                          '
                           Transactions      for that year.
    Sir John Herschel, in his article " Meteorology
                                                                  " in the 8th edi
tion of the ' Encyclopaedia Britannica,' makes the following remarks
on   Mr. Welsh's performance: — "All the observations were con
ducted with scrupulous precision, and the reductions very scienti
fically made     ; . . . these four ascents leaving nothing to desire in point
of instrumental appliances          and scientific precision in their     use."
    In  1854,    Mr. Welsh, at the request of the Kew Committee, under
took    a   series   of experimental investigations          on the action     of the
mercury in marine barometers, known under the term                       of "  pump
ing." For this purpose, he went, in company with Mr. Adie, to
Leith and back in a steamer, and subsequently to the Channel
 Islands.      The result of his observations led him             to the conclusion
that the tube of a marine barometer should, in order to reduce the
pumpings, be contracted, so that the mercury will take about twenty
minutes to fall from the top of the tube to the height indicating the
true pressure      ;   and that by this means the probable error from the
cause     indicated would not exceed 0-01 of an inch.               The account of
these experiments was published             in the Kew Report for 1853.
    In  1855,    in consequence       of its having     been   represented    to the
Committee that Her Majesty's Government were anxious that mag

                                      xxxvii
netical and meteorological instruments, showing the advanced              state
of   those  sciences   in this country, should be sent to the Paris Exhi
bition, Mr. Welsh was requested to proceed to Paris with the instru
ments     and to superintend       the arrangements.        An account of the
instruments appears in the Report of 1855 of the Kew Committee.
In the 'Philosophical Transactions' for 1856 there is a paper of
Mr. Welsh's entitled " An Account of the Construction of a Standard
Barometer,       and Description     of the Apparatus       and Processes em
ployed in the Verification       of Barometers     at the  Kew Observatory ;"
                '
and in the Proceedings of the Royal Society,' vol. vi., a Report of
the general process adopted in graduating and comparing the
Standard Meteorological Instruments for the Kew Observatory ;
also a Report      of the graduation of Thermometers supplied from the
Observatory for the use of the Arctic Searching Expedition under
 Sir Edward Belcher.
     In January     1856, a series  of monthly determinations of the abso
lute magnetical force, and of the magnetic dip, was commenced at
 the Observatory by Mr. Welsh, with instruments provided by General
 Sabine from his department at Woolwich              ;  and in the same year    a
 set   of self-recording magnetometers were constructed : these were
 arranged in the basement of the Observatory, and have been in action
 since   January 1858. In the Report of the British Association for
  1 856, Mr. Welsh described a process         for the graduation of boiling-
 point thermometers intended for the measurement of heights.
     In  1857  Mr. Welsh    was elected a Fellow       of the Royal Society — a
 position, to which his qualifications fully entitled him to aspire, but
 which his natural diffidence would have led him to postpone, had it
 not been urged on him by those who appreciated his merits.                  To
 his personal friends he always spoke with feelings of gratitude of the
 mode in which his services to science had been thus recognized.
     Twenty years having elapsed since the execution           of the Magnetic
 Survey of the British         Islands,  it  was   determined by the British
 Association      that another survey should be made.         With this view,   a
 Committee, consisting of the same five members by whom the former
 survey was conducted, with the addition of         Mr. Welsh,   was appointed,
 and   Mr. Welsh undertook the Magnetic Survey of the North British
 division of the United Kingdom.            In the summer of 1857 he deter
 mined the magnetic elements at thirty -one stations, and in the summer

                                    xxxvin
of last year he resumed his labours, completing the survey at twenty-
four other stations in Scotland and the adjacent islands.
    Through the winter of 1857-58, Mr. Welsh had suffered from
an affection of the lungs ; and on his return from Scotland, in the
autumn of 1858,        the disease had evidently made          rapid progress.
Arrangements had been made which would have                enabled him to pass
the winter in a tropical climate     ; but acting under the best medical
advice that could be procured in the metropolis, he, accompanied              by
his mother, proceeded      to Falmouth.       In that   place, by the kindness
of Mr. R. W. Fox and his family, Mr. Welsh            received every attention
which they had it in their power to offer.            His only regret during
his illness appears    to have been his inability to complete the works
he had undertaken.        He died on the    1 1th of May, 1859, in the 35th
year   of his  age, not less esteemed for his private worth by those who
 had the pleasure     of his  acquaintance,    than appreciated for his emi
 nent abilities and valuable services by men of science.
    Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet                 was born at   Diiren, where
 his father was Commissaire de Poste, on the 13th of February,            1 805.
 After going through the course of instruction followed in the Gym
 nasium of Cologne, he went to Paris to continue his studies, and
in May     1823 he became tutor in the family         of General Foy. Here
 he formed an acquaintance        with the most distinguished mathema
 ticians of France.      On the recommendation of Fourier, who was
 the first to appreciate his genius, and aided by Gauss, Von Humboldt
procured for him an appointment in Prussia.                In November     1827
he obtained the position       of Teacher in the University of Breslau,
and in the year following was nominated Professor Extraordinary.
Being appointed soon after to lecture at the Royal Military School
of Berlin,    he became    Professor Extraordinary       in the University    of
that place.    On the 13th of February, 1832, he was elected a Member
of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Berlin ; on the 6th of May, 1833,
Corresponding      Member of the Institute of France; in 1833 Corre
sponding Member of the St. Petersburg Academy ; in 1839 Ordinary
Professor of the University of Berlin; in 1846 Member of the
Gottingen     Academy of Sciences.        In    1847  a Professorship   in the
University of Heidelberg was offered to him.           In  1854 he was elected
Member of the Academies of Stockholm              and   Munich, and Foreign

                                        xxxix
Associate of the French Academy            ;  and in 1855 Member       of the Bel
gian Academy, and Foreign Member of the Royal Society.
    After    the death    of Gauss he        was   appointed   Professor    of the
Higher Mathematics in the University of Gottingen, in the spring of
 1855, and entered upon the duties of his office in the autumn of the
same year.       He returned in     bad health from an excursion         in Switz
erland in the autumn of 1858, and died at Gottingen                on the 5th    of
 May, 1859.
    By his death the University of Gottingen has lost not only                a di
 stinguished teacher and a man of the brightest intellect, but                 per
 haps the only mathematician of the time likely to succeed in com
 pleting the unfinished works of Gauss, a task which he had declared
 himself willing to undertake.
    His mathematical memoirs, the first of which            was presented   to the
 Institute of France in 1825, are too numerous to admit of introducing
                                                                                   '

 of the Berlin Academy from the year               1833   to 1854,   in 'Crelle's

    The Baron Friedrich Heinrich                      Alexander von Hum
 boldt,     was the second      son  of Alexander       George von Humboldt,
 descended from a noble Pomeranian family.               His father  was a major
 in the Prussian army, and had served with distinction as aide-de-camp
 to the Duke Ferdinand        of Brunswick in the       seven years' war.      The
 distinguished subject of our present brief notice was born at Berlin on
 the 14th   of September, 1769. At the        age of ten years he lost his father.
 From 1787 to 1789       he studied, first for some months in the Univer
 sity of Frankfort on the Oder, and afterwards in that of Gottingen.
 During the vacations, he made geological excursions to the Harz,
 and on the banks of the Rhine, and published the results of his
                          the title   ' Ueber          Basalte am Rhein, nebst
 observations under                               die
 Untersuchungen iiber Syenit und Basanit der Alten.'                In the spring
 of  1 790  he made a hasty excursion through           Holland, England, and
 France, in the company of George Forster, who sailed with Cook in
 his second voyage round the world.             On his return from this excur
 sion, he passed     some months at Hamburg,            preparing himself for      a
 post in the Finance department of his native country.             In June    1791

                                          xl
  he went to Freiberg,       where he attended the lectures of Werner, and
  became acquainted with Von Buch and Del             Rio. During his residence
  at Freiberg he collected the materials for his work entitled ' Specimen
  Florae subterranean     Fribergensis et aphorisimi ex physiologia chemica
  plantarum.'       After obtaining   an appointment       in the Administration
  of Mines     at Berlin,  he filled the office of Director-General          of the
  mines    of Ansbach and Baireuth        from 1792 to 1797-           Daring this
  time he prepared his work on the irritability of muscular and nervous
  fibre.    On the death of his mother in            1796,   his desire to travel
  increased.      He resigned the post of Director of Mines, and devoted
 himself to the study of practical astronomy under v. Zach.                   After
 passing some months at Jena and Vienna, he made an attempt to
 visit Italy, accompanied by v. Buch, for the purpose of examining
 the volcanos of that country.           Being forced by the war          of which
 Italy    was the scene to relinquish        this undertaking,      he passed the
 winter of     1 797-1798 in the study of meteorology at Salzburg and at
 Berchtesgaden.         He  was invited by    Lord Bristol to accompany an
 exploring party into Upper Egypt, and went to Paris to procure the
 necessary instruments. On his arrival, in May 1 798, he was apprised
 of the failure of Lord Bristol's project in      consequence     of the departure
 of the French expedition for Egypt.              Here he became        acquainted
 with his future fellow-traveller      Bonpland.         He obtained permission
 from the Directory       to accompany Baudin in his voyage             round the
world.       The sailing of this expedition having          been   postponed, he
made an attempt to        join the French in Egypt.          Failing, however, in
consequence       of the non-arrival of  a   Swedish frigate in which he had
been promised a passage           to Tunis, he went to Spain, accompanied
by Bonpland, where he passed the winter of            1 798-1 799.    Encouraged
by the Spanish Minister,        Luis  de  Urquijo, to visit Spanish America,
he and Bonpland embarked at           Corunna on the 5th of June, 1799.
They landed       at Santa Cruz on the 19th       of June,    ascended   the Peak
and explored the Island of Teneriffe.             On the     1 6th  of July they
reached the Cumana.           After having    traversed   Venezuela, the valleys
of the Orinoco and Amazon, the countries of Peru and Mexico,
Humboldt embarked on the 7th of March, 1804, for the Havana,
where he remained six months.            After visiting the United States, he
sailed   from America on the 9th of June, and landed at Bordeaux on
the 3rd     of August,   1804.

     He  made Paris his residence       from 1805 till 1827, occupying him
self with     the publication      of the results of his travels, in eight
separate works, and with various chemical and physical                   researches.
He visited Naples with Gay-Lussac and v. Buch in 1805. During
the residence      of Prince William of Prussia in Paris in 1807-1808,
Humboldt held        a  diplomatic appointment.          In  1814 he accompanied
his elder brother Wilhelm v. Humboldt,               then sent on an embassy to
London, and was elected          a Foreign Member of the Royal Society in
                                                              '

                   Me'moire sur les lignes isothermes           appeared in 1817.
He     was present    at the Congress     of Aix-la-Chapelle       in  1818,    and at
that of Verona in 1822, and in the same year accompanied the late
King of Prussia to Naples.
     From    the   year 1827     he made Berlin his home.               In    1829  he
travelled with Ehrenberg           and G. Rose, under the auspices              of the
Emperor Nicholas, through Siberia, as far as the frontiers of China.
The results of this journey, which lasted nine months,                       are pub
lished in his ' Asie Centrale.'and in G. Rose's ' Reise nach                dem  Ural,
 Altai, und    dem Caspischen Meere.'
     After the French Revolution of 1830, v. Humboldt                  was commis
 sioned by Frederick        William  III. to recognize      the accession of Louis
 Philippe on the part of Prussia.             About this time     he completed his
 '
    Examen     critique    de la Geographie         du nouveau Continent.'           In
  1841 he accompanied        King Frederick William IV. to England, and
 visited Paris for the last time in the winter of 1847-1848.                   In 1845

 second part is so far prepared that no obstacles             to its completion are
 anticipated.
      He enjoyed good health till near the           end of his life.      In October
   1858,   he  was    attacked by an illness from which              he never com
  pletely recovered.       On the 21st     "of  April, 1859, in consequence of a
  cold, he was unable to leave          his bed.      He retained the use of his
  faculties till the morning of the 6th of May, when he became speech
 less, and died at half-past two in the afternoon             of the  same day.
      In  1852 the    Royal Society awarded him the Copley Medal for his
   eminent services     in Terrestrial Physics, and he considered this to be

  the highest honour he had ever received.              A  letter from Dr.      Pertz'
  the Librarian of the Royal Library at           Berlin, to Sir      Charles Lyell,
  states, that the Medal was found after his          death amongst       the objects
  which he wished to be for ever        preserved in the family           archives at
  Tegel.     The outer  envelope  of the box containing the          medal bore this
  inscription in his own handwriting        :
                                               " Die wichtige       beruhmte Cop-

  exterior envelope he had written :     "    Das ehrenvollste, das ich besitze,

 Al. Humboldt.      6 Marz,    1859."
     Looking forward to the probable appearance         of a complete     biography
 of this illustrious philosopher and traveller at no very distant             period,
 it is needless at the present time to enter more fully into the               details
  of his life and labours.
     Karl Ritter       was born at Quedlinburg          on the 7th of       August,
  1779.     His education    was completed       in the University of          Halle.
 In   1 798 he became tutor in the family         of M. Bethmann Hollweg,
 and travelled with his pupils through a large portion of Europe.
 He then went to Gottingen, in order to avail himself of the library
of that place in prosecuting his      researches     in ancient history.       After
four years' assiduous labour, he succeeded Schlosser as Professor of
History at Frankfort ; he was then chosen Professor of Geography
in the Military School, and afterwards Professor of History in the
 University of Berlin.
     He   was a  Knight of the Order Pour          le  Merite  ;  Member of      the
Academy of Sciences of Berlin         ;  Foreign      Associate of the French
Institute ; Foreign Member of the Academies of               Sciences of Gottin
gen, Copenhagen, St. Petersburg, and           Munich   ; Honorary      Member of
the Vienna Academy of Sciences,         and of numerous other literary          and
scientific societies.     He  was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal
Society in 1848.       He died on the 28th of September,            1859.
    The most important of Ritter's works is the second              edition of the
'
   Allgemeine vergleichende Geographie,'           the first volume of       which
                                                                                 by
appeared     in 1822, and the twenty-third          in  1859,    accompanied
                                                                              have
an Atlas,     on  which    Etzel,  Grimm,      Mahlmann      and Kiepert

                                       zlüi
laboured in succession.        This work, though still incomplete (of the
three parts the author intended to devote to Asia Minor, only two,
parts xviii. and xix. have been published), is considered the most valu
 able work on Geography in existence.          Among the other writings of
 Ritter, the following    deserve especially to be mentioned      : — ' Europa
 ein geographisch-statistisches Gemälde' (1807); Vorhalle Europäis
                                        '
 cher Völkergebilde     vor Herodot       (1820); 'die Stupas' (1838);
 'die   Colonisirung    von     New-Seeland'     (1842); 'Blick auf das
                 '            ' der
 Nilquell-land     (1844)  ;        Jordan, und   die Beschiffung des Todten
 Meeres'    (1850); 'Blick        auf Palestina' (1852);       'das   Kameel'
  (1852).     Many memoirs by Ritter have appeared in the 'Trans
          '
 actions of the Berlin Academy, and in the ' Journal of Universal
 Geography.'       Some of these have been collected and published under
              '
 the title of   Einleitung zu einer mehr wissenschaftlichen Behandlung
  der Erdkunde.'
    These labours entitle     M. Ritter to   be considered as the creator    of
 scientific  geography.      Instead of limiting geography to collecting
 isolated facts,   and descriptions without       logical order, he tried to
 discover the natural and intimate relations which exist between              a
 country and its inhabitants      :  employing all the ideas which history
 and the natural sciences supply, he has drawn conclusions, which have
 erected the geography     of the present time into     a kind of physiology
 of the earth.
