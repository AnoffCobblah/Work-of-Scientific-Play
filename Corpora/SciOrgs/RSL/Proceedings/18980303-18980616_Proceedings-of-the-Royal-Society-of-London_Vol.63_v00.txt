      OBITUARY NOTICES OF FELLOWS DECEASED.
    Dr. Hubert A. Newton, Professor of Mathematics in Yale Uni
versity, whose death occurred on the 12th of August, 1896, was born
in 1830, on the 19th of March, at Sherburne, in the State of New
York. Both his parents were descended from ancestors who were
among the first British settlers in Connecticut.     His father built the
Buffalo section of the Erie Canal, and it is recorded of his mother,
whose maiden name was Butler, that she was remarkable for her
mathematical attainments.       He was one of ten children — seven sons
and three daughters.
    At school the lad showed the aptitude for mathematics, and especi
ally for geometry, which distinguished him throughout his life.        He
entered    Yale University at the age of 16, and graduated with the
highest mathematical honours in 1850. After his graduation he
continued for two and a half years more to devote himself to the
study of advanced mathematics, at the expiration of which time he
 was, in 1853, appointed mathematical tutor in his university. Two
years later, at the unusually early age of 25, he was elected to the
full professorship, which he held through the rest of Jiis life. In
 1859 he married a daughter        of the Rev. Joseph C. Stiles, who
 survived her husband only three months, leaving two daughters.
    Professor Newton's life was one of great industry. He was Associate
 Editor of the ' American Journal of Science for twenty-seven years,
                                                '
 was a member and afterwards President of the Publishing Committee
 of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, and, in addition to
 a long list of original memoirs, wrote articles for various cyclopaedias,
                         '
 among others for the Encyclopaedia Britannica.'       He took an active
 part in promoting the introduction of metric measures into America,
 and on the Board of Management of the Yale Observatory, which
 owed its existence largely to the efforts and personal sacrifices of
 Professor Newton, and of which he was for a long time Secretary
 and for two years Director.       He even took a part in municipal
affairs, and it is characteristic of the esteem in which he was held,
 that it is recorded of him that he was elected alderman in a ward in
 which the prevailing politics were in opposition to his own. In 1875
 he presided over the Mathematical Section of the American Associa
 tion for the Advancement of Science, and in 1885 was President of
 the Association.      At an early period he received the honorary
 degree    of  LL.D.   from Michigan University, and in 1888 was
    TOL. lxiii.                                                   b

  awarded the Smith Gold Medal of the American National Academy
  of Sciences, in recognition of his original work. In this country
  he was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society, of the
  Royal Astronomical Society, and of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.
     The first of his papers seems to have been published in 1857, and
  the last, " On the Relation of the Plane of Jupiter's Orbit to the
  Mean Plane of 401 Minor Planets," in 1895.          Between   these dates
  he published a long series of papers — usually from two to four each
 year — covering a variety of subjects in mathematics, insurances, and
  especially in that branch of astronomy which relates to meteors and
  comets.     These intimately connected phenomena early fixed his
 attention.    His first paper in reference to them was published        in
  1860, and a continuous    succession, nearly fifty in all, have been the
 result   of his studies in this department of astronomy, and have con
 tributed largely to the immense advance which the astronomy of
 meteors has made within the last forty years.
    Two memoirs may be selected to illustrate how much modern
 science owes to Professor Newton's industry and clear insight. The
 first of these is his great memoir entitled " The Original Accounts of
 the Displays in former times of the November Star-shower : together
 with a Determination of the length of its Cycle, its Annual Period,
 and the probable Orbit of the Group of Bodies round the Sun."
 This memoir is published in the 'American Journal of Science ' (' Sil-
 liman's Journal'), vols. 37 and 38 (1864).       In it Professor Newton
 makes use*of the collections of ancient records of star-showers
 which had been brought together chiefly by the great industry of
 French antiquarians and French astronomers.           From these records
 Professor Newton traces out all which refer to former visits to the
 earth of that great swarm of small bodies which are now known as
 Leonids, but which, when first observed, radiated from the constella
 tion Cancer. In each case he cites the actual words of the original
 records, of which there are usually several referring to each shower ;
 and by a careful scrutiny of these he is able to fix, in many
 instances with certainty, in others with more or less probability,
 the actual date on which each shower occurred, and even in some
 cases the hours during which it lasted.      He thus discovered that we
 possess records of thirteen showers of these meteors, of which
 the earliest was in a.d. 902, and the last (at the time when he
 wrote this memoir) was in 1833.          To these we have now to add
 the two great displays witnessed from Europe in 1866, and from
America in 1867.
    By this careful scrutiny Professor Newton discovered several im
portant facts — that the main swarm returns to the earth at intervals
of 3325 years ; that on each return the earth encounters the dense
part of the swarm in two consecutive years; that the date of the

                                     iii
principal showers has advanced at a nearly uniform rate from October
12, old style, which was the date in a.d. 902, to November 12, new
style, which was the date in 1833; and finally that the meteoric
orbit, whatever  it  is,
                       is but little inclined to the ecliptic, and that the
motion of the meteors where they enter the earth's atmosphere               is
nearly perpendicular to the direction of the sun.
    Such being the facts, he proceeds to determine what inferences
may be drawn from them.             From the dates of the showers he
ascertained that the node of the meteoric orbit — the point of its
intersection with the earth's orbit— has been since a.i>. 902 advancing
in longitude nearly uniformly and at the average rate of 1-711'
annually.     Allowing for the precession of the equinox, this              is
equivalent to an advance of 29' in 33f years, measured from            afixed
point.    This motion    is accordingly direct, and Professor Newton
infers from this and from dynamical considerations that the motion
of the meteors in their orbit must be retrograde.       He next considers
whether the meteoric orbit     is wholly  or only partly occupied by the
dense swarm of meteors.        He first examines the hypothesis of an
elliptic orbit along which the meteors are distributed uniformly, and
which suffers such perturbations that      it  shifts about so as periodi
cally to intersect the earth's orbit three times in        a  century.     He
finds that this hypothesis mnst be rejected, because         it involves an
apsidal motion so rapid as would require perturbing forces of an
intensity which we can satisfy ourselves do not exist.         Accordingly
 the meteors, leaving out of account the sporadic meteors which have
 got separated from the main swarm, occupy only a portion of their
 orbit. He next inquires what further can be learned about an orbit
 of which the main swarm of meteors occupies only a portion        ;  and he
 made the important discovery that only five orbits are compatible
 with the observed return of the swarm to the earth at intervals of
 33^ years.    One of these five, accordingly, must be the true orbit.
 Professor Newton determined the periodic times in these orbits, and
 thus ascertained the axis major of each.      All that was then wanting
 to fix the precise form and position of each of the five orbits was        a
 sufficiently accurate determination of the "radiant point," i.e., of that
 direction from which the meteors are seen to enter our atmosphere.
 On account of Professor Newton's representations, efforts were made
 by  astronomers to make this observation with the utmost care during
  the great meteoric showers of 1866 and 1867.        This direction, when
  corrected for the deflection of the meteors by the earth's attraction,
  furnishes the position in space of one tangent to the orbit.     Knowing
  then the focus, the axis major, and the position and point of contact
  of one tangent of each of the five orbits, its exact form and situation
 in   space can be ascertained.       Thus the five orbits become fully
  known; and the next step was to determine which of them              is  the

                                     iv
actual orbit of the meteors.     Professor Newton pointed out a line of
investigation by -which it was possible that this discrimination might
be made.     Bodies revolving round the sun in these several orbits
would be differently acted upon by the surrounding planets.          The
perturbations in these five orbits would accordingly be different, and
would probably lead to a different rate of shift of the node of the
orbit along the plane of the ecliptic. If then, the perturbations in all
the five orbits can be so fully investigated that the rate of the shift
of the node in each can be computed, it will then be seen which of
the five computed amounts accords with that which Professor Newton
deduced from the observations, viz., an advance of 29' in 33J years, or
50'2" annually.
   This was an invaluable suggestion, and the key to the complete solu
tion of the problem, although there was at the time little hope that any
mathematician could be found competent to grapple with the difficulties
of the problem, which involved the investigation of a kind of per
turbation which had never been attempted, viz., the perturbation by
a planet of a body revolving in the reverse direction in an orbit round
the sun, which is nearly coincident with the orbit of the planet.
Fortunately our own Professor J. Couch Adams was able to cope
with all the difficulties of the problem, and after five months' labour
found himself in a position to make known which of the five orbits
is the real orbit of the meteors.    This marvellous achievement, how
ever, would not have been possible without the discoveries that had
been made by Professor Newton : 1st, of the amount of the average
shift of the node ; 2nd, of the fact that the choice lay between five
orbits which he defined ; and 3rd, that a discrimination between
these was theoretically possible by the method afterwards success
fully employed by Adams.         Thus one of the most marvellous dis
coveries of the century in dynamical astronomy is duo to the
associated efforts of these two great men.         Professor Newton in
dicated the problem and pointed out how it was to be attacked, and
Professor Adams successfully grappled with its immense difficulty.
   One other example of Professor Newton's contribution to our
knowledge of astronomy must here suffice. It may be treated briefly.
Most comets come into that portion of space which is occupied by
the solar system from great distances outside.        Such comets move
either in parabolas, or in ellipses or hyperbolas which approximate to
parabolas.    By an examination of the orbits of 247 comets, Professor
Newton establishes the fact that the planes of the orbits of these
non-periodic comets lie in all positions indifferently, and that such
comets exhibit no preponderance of direct over retrograde motion ;
whereas all the known periodic comets, which are about fifteen
in number, move in planes which are but moderately inclined to the
planes in which the principal planets move, and show such a marked

 preponderance of direct over retrograde motion that only two have
 their motion retrograde, viz., Halley's comet and the comet associated
 with the great Leonid swarm of meteors.
     Professor Newton succeeded in explaining this remarkable differ
 ence in behaviour of the two classes of comets.             He shows that the
 preponderance      of small   inclinations and the preponderance of direct
 over retrograde motions would inevitably establish themselves amongst
 comets of short, period, on the supposition that each of these is a
  comet of the other class which has at some time passed so close to a
 planet that it was drawn aside from its original orbit.
     Laplace had shown that if a comet passes close to a planet the
  influence of the planet upon it may be found to a first approximation
  by drawing a sphere of a certain size round the planet, and suppos
  ing that the comet has moved in a parabola round the sun, undis
 turbed by the planet, until it passes inside the sphere; and that
 while inside the sphere it moves in a hyperbola relatively to the
 planet, attracted by the planet alone and unperturbed by the sun.
 This is equivalent to supposing that as a first approximation we may
  neglect   the small difference between the direction            and amount      of
 the   sun's attraction upon the comet and planet while the former is
 traversing the sphere from the point of its entrance into the sphere
 to its point of exit.
    Professor Newton points out that if the comet passes in front of
 the planet as the planet advances along its orbit, then it will neces
 sarily accelerate the planet and thereby increase the planet's kinetic
 energy.     An equal amount of energy must be lost by the comet, of
 which therefore the speed relatively to the sun decreases ; and there
 fore, if the orbit round the sun was a parabola before it entered the
 sphere of the planet's influence, it will start along an ellipse after
 emerging from that sphere. It thus becomes a member of the solar
 system.     On the other hand, if the comet pass behind the planet the
 opposite effect is produced.         The planet loses kinetic energy which
 the comet gains, so that the comet when it extricates itself from the
 sphere of the planet's influence, proceeds to move in a hyperbolic
orbit round the sun, past which it can make but one sweep, and will
then finally quit the solar system unless it encounter some other
planet.
     Professor Newton deals specially with the planet Jupiter.                 It is
manifest that the only parabolic orbits which approach that planet
are to be found amongst those of which the perihelion lies as near
to the sun or nearer than the orbit of Jupiter. Professor Newton
shows that out of 1,000,000,000 comets traversing the solar system
in such orbits, about 839* will have their orbits changed by that
    * From this number a small deduction, perhaps of some dozen or so, has
 to be made, to allow for those comets which actually collide with the planet.

                                     vi
planet    into elliptic orbits with a periodic time less than that of
Jupiter    ; and by a further scrutiny of the dynamical    conditions he
finds that moderate inclinations to the orbit of Jupiter will largely
preponderate among the comets so affected, and that direct motions
 will preponderate over retrograde — thus explaining both these
observed facts of nature.        This remarkable investigation will be
found in three papers, one in the ' American Journal of Science and
Arts,' 3rd Series, vol. 16 (1878), and the other two in the Reports
of the British Association for 1879 and 1891.
    It is recorded of Professor Newton that he was noted in his own
university for the special pleasure which he took in all mathematical
investigations     upon which geometrical insight could be made to
 bear; and it must strike every student of Professor Newton's
published work that science in large measure owes the discoveries
 which he made to the clearness of his geometrical and dynamical
conceptions, and to his facility in dealing with them.
    This record ought not to close without referring to the circum
stance that Professor Newton's original researches were the offspring
of his leisure.     He regarded the duties of his professorship as those
 of primary obligation upon him ; to these he at all times first gave
 his full attention, and he seems to have possessed in a conspicuous
 degree the powers of imparting to the students who had the good
 fortune to be brought into contact with him a share of his own
 enthusiastic love of mathematics.        The motives which impelled
 him to devote in addition the time which he felt to be at his own
 disposal to a search into the secrets of nature, are illustrated by
 words that he once used and which will find an echo in many
 minds : — " To discover some new truth in nature, even though it
 concerns the small things in the world, gives one of the purest
 pleasures in human experience, and it gives joy to tell others of the
 treasure found."

    Richard Quain, who died on March 13, 1898, at the age of 81, was
 born on October 30, 1816, at Mallow-on-the-Blackwater, co. Cork, in
 which county his family was one of tho best known and most
 respected.     His father, John Quain, was a younger brother of
 Richard Quain, of Ratheahy, whose sons, Jones and Richard, were
 distingnished for their knowledge of anatomy and surgery, and John
 Richard as a lawyer and judge in the Court of Queen's Bench.          The
 father of the subject of this notice married, in 1815, Mary, daughter
of Michael Burke, of Mallow, a member of an ancient and honoured
 Irish family.
    After early education at Cloyne, Richard Quain was apprenticed to
 a medical    practitioner in Limerick, where he acquired a knowledge    of

                                      vii
many of the essentials of medical practice.         In 1837 he entered the
University College of London, where his two consins were, the one
Demonstrator, the other Professor of Descriptive and Practical
Anatomy, from whom he seems to have received much sympathy and
valuable instruction.       In this School of Medicine he studied with
much diligence, and his perseverance and keen powers of observation
obtained for him many distinctions.
   In 1840 he graduated as M.B. of the University of London, obtain
ing high honours in physiology, surgery, and midwifery. He con
tinued to gain much experience in the appointments of Resident
Surgeon or Physician at the hospital, and in 1842 he obtained the
degree of M.D. at the London University, receiving a gold medal and
certificate of special proficiency.       He was soon afterwards elected a
Fellow of University College.
   In 1848 he became Assistant Physician to the Hospital for Diseases
of the Chest, at Brompton, where he was associated with Drs. Walsh,
Theophilus Thompson,           and Cotton.     In 1855 he was elected
Physician    to this hospital, and his connection with it as a Consulting
Physician continued till the time of his death.          He was also Con
sulting Physician     to the  Seamen's  Hospital at  Greenwich, and to the
Consumption Hospital at Ventnor.
   In 1851 Quain was elected a Fellow of the Royal College of
Physicians, and was identified with it till the time of his death ; for
he was a member of the Council, Censor, Lumleian Lecturer, Senior
Censor in 1877, Harveian Orator in 1885, and Vice-President in
 1889.     In 1888, on Sir William Jenner's retirement, he contested
the Presidency with Sir Andrew Clark, who, however, was elected,
though only by eight votes, in a large meeting.
    In 1863 Quain was elected as Crown nominee of the Medical
Council, and continued in that post till his death. He was a moving
spirit in all the work of that body ; he was a member of many com
mittees, serving with great distinction on the Pharmacopoeia Com
mittee, which he seemed to make his special care, though most active
on several others.       The services he rendered to this Council in the
 various offices he held were most valuable, and the result was his
appointment, on the death of Mr. John Marshall in 1891, to the post
of President, to which he was unanimously re-elected on the expiry
of bis first term of office in 1896, when he gave a valuable address,
clearly setting forth the questions in which the Council were in
terested and his own practical and statesman-like             view of the
methods of dealing with them.          His predecessors in this important
office were Sir Benjamin Brodie, Joseph Henry Green, Sir George
Burrows, Sir George Edward Paget, Sir Henry Acland, and John
Marshall, none of them more devoted to the duties or more efficient
 as President of the Council than himself.

departments of medical science were, if not numerous, very important.
As a member of the Royal Commission appointed in 1865 to con
sider the question of rinderpest or cattle plague, in which he was
associated     with Lord Spencer, Lord Cranborne (now Marquess of
Salisbury), Lord Sherbrook, Dr. Lyon (now Lord) Playfair, Dr.
Edmund Parkes, and Dr. Bence Jones, he took a prominent part,
and was an earnest advocate of the stamping-out measures recom
mended by the Commission, which, though strongly opposed at the
time, subsequent events have proved to have had the result of saving
large snms of money to the nation.             He was a frequent contributor
          '                                    ' Lancet,'
to the      Saturday Review,' to the                       and other medical

Medicine' some years later.            His reports, in conjunction with the
staff of the Brompton Hospital, compiled for several years, of the
cases treated there ; some valuable contributions to the 'Lancet' of
                                             '

Medicine on '     "  Injuries of the Valves of the Heart," together with

on " Diseases of the Muscular Walls of the Heart

   But the great work with which Quain's name will ever be asso
                             '
ciated is that of the          Dictionary of Medicine,' on which the years
between 1875 and 1882 were spent,. and which reappeared in a second
edition in 1894, enlarged and brought up to the knowledge of the
present time.        For this cyclopaedia of medical science he had care
fully selected the contributors from the most eminent members of
the medical profession, whose communications were all revised and,
in some cases, modified by himself.              His own contributions, espe
                        " Fatty                     of the Heart," " Angina
cially those on                    Degeneration
Pectoris," " Aneurism of the Heart," " Diseases of the Bronchial
                                                  " are not the least valuable.
Glands and General Remarks on Disease
The work, in short, having filled a want long felt by the profession,
gained their entire confidence.        To his able coadjutors, Dr. Frederick
Roberts, Dr. Mitchell Bruce, and Mr. John Harold he gave due
credit, and to their untiring devotion to the work its success is in
great part — as he himself would have acknowledged — to be attri
buted.
   Not the least interesting of Quain's contributions to medical litera
ture was his Harveian Oration, delivered before the Royal College of
Physicians in 1885, in which he dealt eloquently with the healing art
in its historic and prophetic aspects.
   In 1871 Dr. Quain was, for his eminence as              a physician and for

                                        ix
    scientific  research into subjects  connected with medicine, elected a
    Fellow of the    Royal Society.    He was also a member of the Senate
    of London University elected by the Queen, LL.D. of Edinburgh,
    M.D. (Hon.) of Dublin and of the Royal University of Ireland, and
   also a Fellow (Hon.) of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland.
   He was Fellow and President of both the Medical and Chirurgical
                                               '               '
   and the Pathological Societies, to the        Transactions of which he
   made several valuable contributions, and member and President of
   the Harveian Society of London.
       In 1890 he was appointed Physician Extraordinary to the Queen ;
  and on New Year's Day, 1891, received the well-merited honour of a
   baronetcy of the United Kingdom.          This becomes extinct with his
  death, as Sir Richard Quain leaves no son.           Isabella Agnes, Lady
  ¦Quain, to whom      he was married in 1854, was the only daughter of
  Mr. George Wray, of Cleasby, Yorkshire           she died, to his profound
  grief, a few months after the baronetcy had been conferred upon
  him. Four daughters survive him.
      Sir Richard Quain was much and justly esteemed by his profession
 and by the public. The kind-heartedness and geniality of his nature,
  his amnsing and epigrammatic         conversation, his wide knowledge of
  men, and his unwearying sympathy and kindness, made him popular
  not only with the younger       as well as the older members of his pro
  fession, but with society generally, and in the Athenaeum and Garrick
  ClubB, of which he was a well known member, whilst the bright and
 cheering effect of his presence in the sick room was always beneficial.
 Few men have been more endowed with the faculty of endearing
 themselves to their acquaintances, friends, and patients ; and few
 will be more regretted than the warm-hearted, genial Irishman and
 physician who has been taken from us, though not until advanced
 age had afforded the world full opportunity of appreciating his merits.
                                                                      J. F.
     James    Joseph   Sylvester was born in London on September            3,
 1814.      He was     the  youngest son of Abraham Joseph, and had
five     brothers   and  two sisters.    His eldest brother early in life
established himself in America, and assumed the name of Sylvester;
an example followed by all his brothers.
    James went to Neumegen's well-known Jewish boarding school at
Highgate from the age of six until he was twelve.          Mr. Neumegen, a
good mathematician,         was strongly impressed by the boy's mathe
matical talent, sedulously       fostered it, and sent him at the age of
eleven to be tested by Dr. Olinthus Gregory at the Royal Military
Academy at Woolwich.            Dr. Gregory, after examining in algebra,
['renounced him to be possessed of great talents, and recommended
his mathematical tutor to pay great attention to his instruction.         He

                                           X
subsequently went to Mr. Daniell's school at Islington for a year and
a half, where he came under Mr. Downes.                Thence to London Uni
versity for five months, and in 1829, being then fifteen years of ager
he was sent to Liverpool.            During this time Dr. Gregory kept up
his interest     in   the  boy,  for,  in March, 1827, he wrote to his father
" Pray have the
                         goodness to drop me a line so soon as your son
returns home that          I  may endeavour to fix a day in which              I  may
have the pleasure of seeing him here, and tracing his progress since-
1 saw him before."
    At about this period he was for a short time a pupil of De Morgan.
At Liverpool he went to the Royal Institution,* which had itself
been founded in 1814, and its school in 1819.                  He lived with his
aunts, who had a school in Duke Street almost opposite Colquill
Street at the corner of Cornwallis Street, the house then commonly
known as " Morrell's Foil}-."           One of his aunts was married to Elias
Moxley, one of three brothers who represented Barnard's Bank in,
Lord Street. It appears from the school records that at a meeting
of proprietors on the 12th February, 1830, Thomas Langton, Esq.,
president, Sylvester was awarded the prize in the second class as the
result of the examination after the winter vacation.                   Other prize
winners were William Robertson Sandbach, George Hancox, and
 Murray Gladstone.           In regard to the mathematical prize secured by
 Sylvester,    it  is   stated  " In the Mathematical School one of the-
stndent.s,   who had previous to entering it attained considerable pro
 ficiency, was so far advanced before the other scholars that he could
 not be included in any class ; the first prize has without competition
 been awarded to him."           At the presentation of prizes, Mr. Langton
addressed him in the followiug words : — " In presenting to you,
 James Sylvester, the youngest of the successful students, the first
 prize for mathematical progress, let me caution yon not to look upon
 it as an occasion of triumph ; in receiving it you are giving a pledge
 of your future diligence in the improvement of those natural abilities-
 with which a kind Providence has blessed you." The pupils of the
 school numbered but thirty. The Rev. T. W. Poile, B.A., Fellow
 of Trinity College, Cambridge (afterwards head master of Repton)r
 was head master; William Moore, B.A., of Trinity College, Dublin,
 second master ; and Mr. Marratt, mathematical master.
     Few now remain who were with him at this school. Of these Sir
 William Leece Drinkwater, until quite recently first deemster, Isle of
 Man, perhaps knew him best, and I am indebted for many particulars
  to a letter which he Las been good enough to write me.                 It does not
     * Mr. John Forsliaw,    who went to the school shortly after Sylvester left, write*
  that the Mechanics' Institution, originally founded in 1825, has since been trans
  formed into the Liverpool Institute, which must not be confused with the Liver
  pool Koyal Institution standing about a quarter of a mile away in Colquill Street.

                                      xi
appear that Sylvester was in all cases kindly treated by his school
fellows. He was kind-hearted and brave, but rendered extraordinarily
irritable by the constant references, in a spirit of opposition, to his
Jewish extraction.       He fought many battles in defence of his religion
with, it is said, greater courage than skill. On at least one occa
sion he wished to fight a duel, being aware that with fists he was
no match for his opponent.         At one time, considering that he was
treated with oppression by one of the under-masters, and being
directed, with the rest of the class, to write a theme on " Des
potism," he composed an excellent essay, giving various instances,
both high and low, of the abuse of power, but reflecting unmistakably
upon the case of the under-master and himself.           He concluded: —
" Thus we see that
                        power begets tyranny, whether in the case of the
mightiest monarch or of the petty usher of a school or institution."
The severe punishment that followed, it is related, was endured with
great courage.
   Soon after, Sylvester ran away from the school.          He sailed from
Liverpool, and shortly found himself in the streets of Dublin with
but a few shillings in his pocket.         This led to a singular incident.
As the boy was walking down Sackville Street he was observed
by   an elderly gentleman who, his curiosity aroused, stopped and
inquired into his circumstances.           A few moments' conversation
sufficed to reveal the fact that the boy was related to his wife, being,
in fact, her   first, cousin !   Thereupon he invited him to his house
entertained him, and finally sent him back to Liverpool. The gentle
 man was the Right Hon. R. Keatinge, Judge in the Prerogative
 Court of Ireland.
    Being fully aware of his great knowledge of mathematics, he was
in the habit of proposing questions beyond the capacity of the
mathematical       master.     Before leaving he gained a prize of ^ve
hundred dollars offered from the United States for the solution of a
certain question.       It seems that a problem in combinations of great
difficulty had come under the notice of a certain D. V. Gregory, a
friend of Sylvester's elder brother in New York.             On the advice
of the latter it was sent to the yonnger brother in Liverpool,
who almost immediately solved it.           Its nature may be gathered
from the subjoined extracts from a letter addressed to him
a few years afterwards           by D. V. Gregory : — " You solved my
problems, which I submitted without their knowledge, to the great
satisfaction of the Contractors of Lotteries in this country, and they
expressed, frequently, an exalted opinion of your mathematical attain
ments in solving so intricate a subject.        The inventor of the combi
nation system himself was never able, as I learn, to package by
any mathematical rule . . . On account of their withdrawing
from business at the end of this year, the managers had prepared all
                                                                 c 2

                                      xii
the necessary printing to complete their engagements, which print
ing was done according to the making up of packages by boys in our
employ without any order or system or mathematical arrangement.
This was a tedious process, and required some months' labour and
consequent expense, and terminated in making a great number of
miscellaneous packages containing a disproportion of numbers.         Hat!
your mathematical skill been known when they commenced business
in 1823, or even five years after, and had they adopted your arrange
 ment, they would have saved thousands of dollars expended by them
 in preparing for the printer."
     Sylvester was less than two years at the Liverpool Institution.
 Afterwards he read for a few months with the Rev. Richard
 Wilson, D.D. (late Fellow of St. John's College, Cambridge), and
 then in 1831, at the age of seventeen, was entered at St. John's
 College, Cambridge.         He came out first in his first year ; but in
 June, 1833, he became seriously ill and had to remain at home till
 November.       He then returned to the University, but again unfort
 unately became ill in February, 1834, and was obliged to remain at
 home for nearly two years, not rejoining his college till January,
 1836.     In the following month he had the misfortune to break a
 blood-vessel.     On recovering, he pursued his studies till January,
 1837, when he came out Second Wrangler.              Griffin was Senior of
 the year, and the    list contained also the name of Green.
     Being unwilling to sign the Thirty-nine Articles, he wa3 unable to
 take a degree, to obtain a Fellowship, or to compete for one of the
  Smith's prizes.
     At this time, on the occasion of laying the foundation stone of the
  Mechanics' Institution, Mount Street, Liverpool, Sylvester presented
  Lord Brougham with his pamphlet criticising Euclid's definition of
  a straight line as length withont breadth.     He also composed his first
             " Fresnel's Optical           of
  paper  on                        Theory     Crystals," which appeared in
                     '                            '
  vol. 11 of the        Philosophical Magazine ;     and on the death of
  Dr. Ritchie in the same year he became a candidate for the Chair of
  Natural Philosophy in the London University College.            The testi
  monials which he received for that occasion are evidence of the high
  estimation in which he was held by tutors, examiners, and the other
  scientific men with whom he had been brought into contact.           The
  list of his supporters includes the names of J. W. Heaviside (the
  Senior Moderator in 1837), S. Earnshaw (Senior Examiner), George
  Peacock, W. H. Miller, H. Philpot, J. Hymers, W. Hopkins, J. W.
   Colenso, P. Kelland, J. Bowstead, J. Cumming, Frederick Thackeray,
  James Hildyard, E. Bushby, Richard Wilson, J. Challis, and Olinthus
   Gregory.    Evidently all these were aware that a star of the first
  magnitude was rising in the mathematical firmament.            They seem
  particularly to have noticed his analytical power and command of

                                       XUl
language,     combined      with originality and enthusiasm : qualities
which     were    conspicuous throughout all his subsequent scientific
career.    It may be observed too that his interest was not confined to
the subject of his greatest predilection, for whilst at Cambridge he
attended regularly the chemical lectures of Cumming and the classi
cal lectures of Bushby.        This catholicity of taste, so early exhibited,
is doubtless    one reason for the brightness and freshness with which,
throughout life, he could treat the dullest and most abstruse sub
jects.
   He was appointed       to the Chair at University College in the session
1837-38, his friend De Morgan holding the Chair of Pure Mathe
matics.    He had some difficulty in drawing diagrams on the black
board to illustrate his lectures.      He was, in fact, never clever with
his hands, his handwriting in particular being very bad.            A curious
instance of his constant desire to be thorough is brought to light by
the circumstance that for some time after taking up the professor
ship he took lessons in drawing from the college drawing master ;
it is said, however, with small results.       He published a remarkable
series of papers in the 'Philosophical         Magazine,' vols. 13 to 17>
principally on matters connected with the Theory of Equations'
Elimination, Sturm's Functions, &c, and laid the foundations of
the work with which his name will ever be associated.               He retired
from University College in the session 1840-41, and immediately
afterwards accepted the Professorship of Mathematics             in the Uni
versity of Virginia.       For the due appreciation of matters that will
be presently related, it should be stated that Sylvester at this period
felt strongly on the subject of slavery, and was, moreover, in the
habit of expressing       himself thereon with great warmth.          He was
indeed antagonistic to oppression in all its forms.
   In the   United States 1840 was the presidential       year.    It was the
eve  of the   introduction of new political methods. A new party was
formed,   with   the platform " Absolute and unqualified divorce of the
general government from slavery, and the restoration of equality of
rights among men."           Feeling ran high, particularly in Virginia,
which was, later on, one of the Confederate States.           Men of expe
rience warned Sylvester that he should, on crossing the water, be
gnarded in his expressions, and refrain from hotly stating his
opinions on the subject of slavery.        He, however, determined to go,
and, after sitting for a full length portrait in oils, by Patten, of the
 Hoyal Scottish Academy,          now in possession of the family, he
embarked at Liverpool in a Cunard sailing vessel.               The portrait
is evidently the work of a good painter,           and is stated to be an
excellent likeness.      It represents a young man of six and twenty, in
cap and gown, with dark, curly hair, and spectacles, seated, book in
 hand,  at a table.

                                   xiv
   In America he appears to have been at war with his surroundings
from the first.    He found nothing sympathetic or inspiring, and the
cause of his exit from the country after six; months arose from an
unfortunate incident with two students in his own class.
   For two or three years after his return from Virginia he appears
to have done little work. As remarked by Dr. Halsted there were dis
tinct periods of his life during which he felt much discouraged, and
seemed to have no heart for mathematical research.
   In  1844   activity recommenced.    He was elected to the post of
Actuary   to  the Legal and Equitable  Life Assurance Company. This
was a responsible post, particularly  at that time when, through mis
management, one of the principal       establishments in England had
been brought to the brink of ruin.    He made constant valuations and
acted as check officer and scientific adviser to the directors of this
and some other companies for many years, residing for the greater
part of the time at 28, Lincoln's Inn Fields. He also accomplished
an extraordinary amount of mathematical research. A few titles of the
papers now published during this time will give a general idea of the
subjects which principally occupied      his mind : — " On the Dialytic
Method of Elimination,"     "
                              Elementary Researches on the Analysis of
Combinatorial Aggregation," "On a discovery in the Theory of
Numbers relative to the Equation Aar'-r-B^ + Ca3 = Dxyz," "On the
Rotation of a Body about a Fixed Point," " Sketch of a Memoir on
Elimination, Transformation, and Canonical           Forms," " On the
Principles of the Calculus of Forms,"          " On the Expressions for
the Quotients       which appear in the Applications of Sturm's
Method to the discovery of the real Roots of an Equation."            A
number of these papers refer to the subject now known as the
theory of invariants. It rose from its foundations, which had been
partially laid by Boole in 1844, under the strong hands of Cayley
and Sylvester.       The conception of the problem and much of its
orderly development may be ascribed to the former, whilst nearly
the whole of the nomenclature and a great deal that is now recog
nised as being of capital importance, both as regards initiation and
brilliant extension, is due to the latter. During the decade from
 1845 he established his position as one of the foremost mathema
ticians of Europe. He had the friendship and esteem of such men
on the       continent of Europe as Lejeune-Dirichlet,         Poncelet,
Borchardt, Duhamel, Bertrand, Serret, Hermite, Otto Hesse, Peters,
Kummer, Richelot, Joachimsthal, Chasles, with many of whom his
correspondence was frequent and voluminous.          The contemporaries
in  his own   country  — William  Rowan   Hamilton,   Ivory, De Morgan,
Graves, MacCullagh, John Herschel, Babbage, Donkin, Challis,
Kelland, Salmon, William Thomson, and others — also testified on
occasions that they were aware a great mathematical genius had

                                     XV
appeared in the ranks of scientific men, and was rapidly forsing his
way to the front.
    In                     W. M. Christie, Sylvester was a candi
           1854, on the death of
date for the Professorship of Mathematics at the Royal Military
Academy at Woolwich.      Christie had been professor since 1838, pre
ceded by Gregory, 1821-38; Bonnycastle, 1807-21; Hutton, 1773-
1807; Cowley, 1761-1773; Simpson, 1743-1761.
  Leading mathematicians      at home and abroad testified to his
eminence and fitness for the appointment, but, as shown by the
subjoined letter, he was not successful : —

"J. J.      Sylvester, Esq."
    Owing to the destructive       fire of 1873 there is now no record of
this letter in the archives of the academy.
   One cannot help recalling the rejection by the same establish
ment, a century before, of the celebrated Benjamin Robins, Copley
medallist of the Royal Society, in favonr of a Mr. Miiller.
   Mr. O'Brien was known as a fair mathematician, and had pre
viously held the post of Lecturer on Physical Science. He did not
take np the appointment, as a few months after his election his
death occurred, when Sylvester was elected.     In the interval, how
ever, he sought, but did not obtain, election to the vacant Pro
fessorship of Geometry in Gresham College, and delivered a pro
bationary lecture on geometry before the Gresham Committee on
December 4, 1854.      The lecture was printed, and in the preface
                                               "
occur the following characteristic remarks : — The author will only
so far forestall the arrival of the period (quod longum absit               .')
above alluded to by protesting against the use of the word
             as employed by an ingenious lecturer who succeeded liiin

  cient evidence in itself of a practical mind.    The first rule of prac
  tice is to do all things at the right time and in their proper places p
  to proportion the means to the ends and the ends to the means ;.
  above all to know what is possible, and to confine one's endeavours
  within the limits of the feasible. The author allows, and has
  habitually acted on the principle, that for the purpose of illustrating
  lectures on geometry or any other abstract science, the lecturer
  should lay his hands on the plough, the loom, the forge, the work
 shop, the mine, the sea, the stars, all things on earth or under heaven
 which may help to arouse the attention or interest the imagination of
 his auditors.    But to profess to make the mere applications of a
 science such as geometry the staple of the matter to be taught within
 the walls of the college by the Gresham lecturer, to undertake to
 comprise within a course of geometrical lectnres systematic instruc
 tion in mechanics, astronomy and navigation, descriptive geometry,
 engineering and drawing, the method of interpolation, the theory of
 toothed wheels, the two kinds of perspective, machinery, mapping,
 the art of shipbuilding, rules for cutting the best form of screws,
 and for enabling the citizens of London to qualify themselves for
 being their own land surveyors, is a suggestion which, with all due
 deference to its propounder, the author regards as one of the wildest
 and most visionary which ever entered into the mind or issued from
 the lips of a practical man."   The address, composed at short notice,
 is a powerful essay on geometrical science.
     He took up the appointment of Professor of Mathematics and Lec
 turer in Natural Philosophy at the Royal Military Academy on the-
 15th September, 1855.      In August, 1856, the lectureship was taken
 over by the Professor of Practical Astronomy. The salary of the
 appointment was £550 per annum combined with a Government
 residence, medical attendance, and right of pasturage on the com
mon. He occupied K Quarters, Woolwich Common, being the last of a
 long list of residential professors. The house was commodious and
with a good garden.      There hefrequently entertained his friends from
London and distinguished foreign mathematicians.            At the same
time he always had chambers in London in the neighbourhood
 of the Athenreum Club.         These he had taken originally with
the intention to practise at the Bar. Scientifically this was a
glorious period for Sylvester, for, seated under a walnut tree
which grew in the centre of his garden, he made some of the
great discoveries with which his name will be for ever associated.
He wrote about eighty papers, and naturally it is only possible here
to glance at a few of those which are of fundamental importance.
During 1857-58 he published remarkable advances in the theory of
the,Partition of Numbers, and in 1859 delivered seven lectures on
the subject at King's College, London. The outlines of these dis

                                    xvii
 courses    have this year  (1897)   been published for the first time by
  the London Mathematical Society ; they have attracted considerable
 attention, and have already led to a remarkable paper by Mr. G. B.
  Matthews, F.R.S.
     In these researches   Sylvester,  standing upon the shoulders of
  Canchy, showed how to form an algebraical expression, involving
 the imaginary roots of unity of different orders for the general co
 efficient in the associated generating function. It was a piece of
 analytical skill that could only have proceeded from a mind endowed
 with imagination of the highest order.
    In 1864 appeared in the ' Philosophical Transactions of the Royal
          '
 Society a paper which will perhaps be considered his greatest
 achievement.    The title is " Algebraical Researches : containing a
 Disquisition on Newton's Rule for the Discovery of Imaginary Roots,
 and an allied Rnle applicable to a particular class of Equations,
 together with a complete Invariantive Determination of the Character
 of the Roots of the General Equation of the Fifth Degree, &c."
 Newton had given in the ' Arithmetica Universalis ' a rule for dis
 covering an inferior limit to the number of imaginary roots in an
 equation of any degree, but without proof or indication of method or-
 marshalling of evidence. Maclaurin, Campbell, Euler, and Waring
 had also treated the question, but either failed to obtain a solution
or had fallen into serious error in the attempt.    Sylvester's memoir,
 described by him as a Trilogy, falls into three parts ; in the first he
establishes Newton's rule in regard to algebraical equations as far-
as the fifth degree inclusive ; in the second he obtains a rule appli
cable to equations of the form
                              2(o* + 6)" = 0,
tn being any positive integer, and a, b real coefficients ; in the third
he determines the absolute invariantive criteria for ascertaining the
exact number of real and imaginary roots appertaining to an equa
tion of the fifth degree. Here, as in his treatment of the Partitions
of Numbers, he has frequently resorted to geometrical intuition. In
the present investigation every superlinear function is conceived to-
be in association with a pencil of rays constructed in a definite
manner, and mnch of the argument is given in the language of the
geometry of pencils.     During a conversation with the writer in the
last weeks of his life, Sylvester remarked as curious that notwith
standing he had always considered the bent of his mind to be
rather analytical than geometrical, he found in nearly every case
that the solution of an analytical problem turned upon some quite
simple geometrical notion, and that he was never satisfied until he
could present the argument in geometrical language.
    During these years he continually wrote upon the theory of inva

                                         XVH1
Hants, making important additions to it. The facility with which
he associated subjects the most diverse is evidenced by the titles of
some of      his   papers.    Thus, " Thoughts on Inverse Orthogonal
Matrices, Simultaneous Sign Successions, and Tessellated Pavements
in two or more Colours, with Applications to Newton's Rule, Orna
mental Tile Work, and the Theory of Numbers ;" and " Astronomical
 Prolusions, commencing with an Instantaneous Proof of Lambert's
and Enler's Theorems, and modulating through the Construction of
 the Orbit of a Heavenly Body from two Heliocentric Distances,
the Subtended Chord, and the Periodic Time, and the Focal Theory
•of Cartesian Ovals, into a Discussion of Motion in a Circle and its
 Relation to Planetary Motion."
     Particular events occurred during this period, which should be men
                                                                               '
 tioned. About the year 1855 the ' Quarterly Journal of Mathematics
 was founded, and Sylvester, who took a chief part as Editor, was
 anxious to have a suitable motto for the title page.             He consulted
 many     of his friends   on  the  matter,   De  Morgan  amongst others, and
 finally, after much correspondence, selected the following : —
                  tiai Sidvoia Trpbi ciicaaiav toTi."
 This motto appeared upon the title-page during the whole time
 that he was editor.        The trouble he took in this matter is ovidence
 of his interest in things which may appear trivial to others, but
 which, being important in his own eyes, he spared no effort to
 accomplish successfully.          His mathematical correspondence was of
 wide range, and with             De Morgan, Cayley, Salmon, Hermite,
 and Chasles he exchanged letters continuously.              Cayley for a long
  time resided at 2, Stone Buildings, Lincoln's Inn, and frequently
  met Sylvester ; indeed, they were in the habit of taking long walks,
  Cayley walking from London and Sylvester from Woolwich, meet
  ing near Lewisham. It is certain that some of the fraits of these long
  consultations are before the world to-day.
      It cannot be said that he was a great success at Woolwich as a
  teacher, being too far beyond his pupils who, for the most part,
  regarded mathematics as an irksome duty.             He had the reputation
  of being eccentric and irritable. When not actually engaged in
  teaching, the mind of Sylvester would occasionally become abstracted
  from earthly affairs, and it is stated that on one occasion he suddenly
   looked up from a paper in the hall of study and demanded of the
                        "                      " An
  corporal on duty, What year is it ?                 explosion of laughter in
                           "
  the room led to a scene," and the subsequent infliction of many
  punishments     upon the cadets.
      The sight of Sylvester leaving liis house pursued by his landlady
 ^carrying his collar and necktie is said to have been not an unusual

                                  xix
one.    He came into collision on more than one occasion with the
authorities at the Academy and with the "War Office. The culmina
tion of these disputes was in 1870, when a War Office enactment,
abolishing the separate offices of Professor of Mathematics and Pro
fessor of Mechanics, coupled with a limit of age for the new
appointment, forced him to retire. At first it was the intention to
make him leave without a pension, but, through the strenuous exer
tions of his friends in and out of Parliament, it was finally deter
mined to grant him an annuity calculated in some proportion to the
salary he had been receiving.      Sylvester was consulted as to the
assessment, and characteristically insisted that account should be
taken of the value to him of his government residence, medical
attendance, and right of pasturage on the common.
   The pension was fixed at nearly £300 per annum. He hat! at least
one enthusiastic fellow-worker      during the time he was at the
establishment,   Mr. (now Sir Andrew) Noble, who collaborated
with him in an important degree in the papers on the Theory of
Partitions.
   The London Mathematical Societv was founded in 1864, with De
Morgan as president, a post in which Sylvester succeeded him. In
Jane, 1865, he delivered a lecture in King's College, London, " On
an Elementary Proof and Generalisation        of Sir Isaac Newton's
hitherto nndemonstrated Rule for the Discovery of Imaginary Roots."
   In 1869 he was President of the Mathematical and Physical Sec
tion of the British Association for the Advancement of Science at
Exeter, the meeting being under the presidency of Stokes. His-
address was largely a defence of mathematics from a statement that
                                                              '
had recently been made by Huxley in a ' Fortnightly Review article.
The latter had written,    " Mathematics is that study which knows
nothing of observation, nothing of experiment, nothing of induction,
nothing of causation."     Sylvester put in a powerful and eloquent
plea for the science as one unceasingly calling forth the faculties of
observation and comparison, and affording a boundless scope for the
exercise of the highest efforts of imagination and invention. Those
engaged in this science know the truth of Sylvester's words, but it
must be admitted that men of the highest eminence in other branches
of science frequently are unacquainted with the real nature of the
life work of a man like Sylvester, and of that inner world of thought
where the phenomena require as close attention as those which
present themselves in the outer physical world. Sylvester was a
philosopher, and was well able to take a survey of all the sciences.
While never underrating the importance of any of the recognised
divisions, he saw the intrinsic beauty of that which lie loved beyond
all others, and no one was more competent to repel assaults upon it,
and, it may be added, no one could have been more successful in doing

                                      XX
ho.    His enthusiasm,    combined with his power over the English
language,    made him     an opponent worthy of any controversialist
living. The remainder of the address was on space conceptions, and
mathematics as the science of continuity. In one sentence he stated -
 " It is very common, not to say universal, with English writers, even
such authorised ones as Whewell, Lewes, or Herbert Spencer, to
refer to Kant's doctrine as affirming space to be a " form of thought,
or of the understanding." This led to an interesting controversy,
in the columns of ' Nature,' between G. H. Lewes, T. H. Huxley,
C. M. lngleby, G. Croom Robertson, W. H. Stanley Monck, and, of
course, Sylvester himself.       The correspondence, with many critical
                                                                            '
 notes, will be found in an appendix to Sylvester's ' Laws of Verse
 (Longmans, Green and Co., 1870).
    It is doubtful if Sylvester's reputation was ever higher than at this
 time.    The recognition of his great talents, the appreciation of his
transcendent genius, and the knowledge of the inspiring effect of
his personality were universal. Foreign scientific academies had
showered their honours upon him.           Eminent men of all countries
knew him personally.        A mere recital of his academic distinctions
 would take up too much space.        It can be found in any official list of
 the Fellows of the Royal Society.
    On leaving Woolwich Academy in 1870 lie lived near the
 Athenaeum, and for a few years his mathematical activity was in
abeyance.      He had some idea of becoming a candidate for the
 London School Board, and addressed several meetings of working-
men and other assemblages       of electors in London.     On these occa
 sions he would occasionally sing to contribute to the merriment o
 the evening.    Such old English songs as " Simon the Cellarer " were
 his favourite pieces. He also frequently recited at penny readings.
 In ' The Gentleman's Magazine ' for February, 1871, there appears
 '
   The Ballad of Sir John de Courcy,' translated from the German by
 Nyzygeticns. He recited this versified translation at the New Quebec
 Club and Institute at a reading on April 11, 1879.
    In 1874 he entered the lists again. The occasion was the wonderful
discovery by Peaucellier of the straight line link-motion associated
 with his name. Sylvester soon made additions and generalisations,
 and finally gave a Friday evening discourse on the subject at the
 Royal Institution of Great Britain.           He showed amongst other
 things   of great interest  how   to  construct a link-work of seventy-
eight bars to solve the following problem : — " Required to construct
a link-work fixed or centred at two of its points, such that (when
 the machine is set in motion) some other point or points therein
shall be compelled to move in the line of centres."
    He wrote several papers on the subject, one of them bearing the
 characteristic title: — "Mode of construction and properties of a new

                                    xxi
sort of lady's fan, and on the expression of the curves generated by
any given system whatever of link-work under the form of an
irreducible determinant."
    He invented the plagiograph aliter skew pantigraph.
     A synopsis only of tlie Royal Institution lecture was published.
The manuscript of the lecture as actually delivered is in the posses
sion of George Bruce Halstead, of the University of Texas. Extracts
from it appear in the American journal ' Science,' of April 16, 1897,
from which it appears that it was characterised by that eloquence,
force, and poetical imagination with which students of Sylvester are
familiar.
     In 1875 the Johns Hopkins University, at Baltimore, was founded,
and the Trustees sought the advice of the president, Daniel C. Gilman,
in the selection of the professorial staff. He replied " Enlist a great
mathematician and a distinguished Grecian ; your problem will be
solved. Such men can teach in a dwelling-house as well as in a
palace.     Part of the apparatus they will bring; part we will furnish.
Other teachers will follow them." Joseph Henry also advised that
liberal salaries should be paid and the best men in the world secured.
He brought Sylvester's name prominently forward, and finally the
latter was offered the post of Professor of Mathematics.         He de
 manded a higher salary than that offered, and this being granted
 he finally stipulated that his travelling expenses and annual stipeml
of 5000 dollars should be paid in gold, and then for the second time
 left England to take up a professorship in the United States.
     He found the conditions ideal.      While not being overburdened
 with routine work, he was surrounded by able assistants and
 talented pupils only too eager to aid him in his profound original
  work or to catch inspiration from his lips.        The mathematical
  staff was indeed very strong, including men of such capacity as
  Thomas Craig, W. E. Story, and Fabian Franklin.            Sylvester's
  first high class consisted of but one student, G. B. Halsted.     This
  gentleman, since well known in science, had the most beneficial
  effect upon his master, for it was owing to his enthusiasm and per
  sistence that Sylvester's attention was again called to the Modern
  Higher Algebra and the Theory of Invariants, and a fruitful crop of
  new discoveries was almost the immediate result.    Others, including
   Franklin, Uurfee, Ely, and Hammond in England joined in the inves
  tigations ; a school of mathematics was founded ; and the American
  renaissance in mathematics was an accomplished fact.
      Shortly after joining at Baltimore, the University founded the
  ' American Journal of Mathematics,' with Sylvester as editor; and its
  pagrs are evidence of the activity of the new school.    In five years
   Sylvester himself contributed thirty papers ; some of great length.
   They are concerned chiefly with Modern Algebra, various points in

                                      xxii
 the  Theory of Numbers, the Theory of Partitions, and Universal
 Algebra. A splendid record for five years.
   His address before the University, on Commemoration                   Day,.
 February 22, 1877, was most eloquent, and had an extraordinary                ¦
effect upon      his hearers, amongst          whom' was James        Russell
Lowell. After some remarks concerning the work of the University
and his own share therein, he discoursed upon the difficulty created
by the contending claims of teacher and investigator.           He said that
the solution lay in the never-to-be-forgotten words, which had
recently been addressed to him,
                                       " The University desires from
                                                                           you
your best and highest work." He went on to observe on the re
ligious and other disabilities nnder which students in English
 universities had snffered, and brought into contrast the freedom in
American and German universities. He spoke with as much
 warmth as power for, as he said, the subject came home to him.
For some time he held his audience spell-bound. His speech was never
liner than when under the influence of passion, and he abandoned
himself to a torrent of words.       Those competent to form an opinion,
 believe that there  was  within   him  the material of a great orator.
   The following remarks by some of his pupils in Baltimore are of in
terest as showing his character and method of lecturing.
   Dr. E. W. Davis states : —
   " Sylvester's methods ! he had none. ' Three lectures will be
                                                                         '
delivered on a New Universal Algebra,' he would say ; then                 the
course must be extended to twelve.'          It did last all the rest of that
year.    The following year the course was to be ' Substitution Theory,,
by Netto.' We all got the text.           He lectured about three times,
following the text closely, but stopping sharp at the end of the
hour.    Then he began to think about Matrices again. ' I must give
one lecture a week on these,' he said.         He could not confine himself
to the hour    nor  to the one   lecture   a week.    Two weeks passed and
Netto was forgotten entirely and never mentioned again."
   Mr. A. S. Hathaway says : —
   " I can see him now, with his white beard and few locks of grey
hair, his forehead wrinkled o'er with thoughts, writing rapidly his
figures and formulas on the board, sometimes explaining as he wrote
while we, his listeners, caught the reflected sounds from the board.
But stop, something is not right; he pauses, his hand goes to his
forehead to help his thought ; he goes over the work again, em
phasizes the leading points, and finally discovers             his difficulty.
Perhaps it is some error in his figures, perhaps an oversight in the
reasoning.    Sometimes, however, the difficulty is not elucidated, and
then there is not much to the rest of the lecture.          But at the next
lecture we would hoar of some new discovery that was the outcome
of that difficulty, and of some article for the journal that he had

                                  XX111
began.   If   a text-bookhad been taken up at the beginning, with the
intention of following it, that text-book was most likely doomed to
oblivion for the rest of the term, or until the class had been made
listeners to every new thought and principle that had sprung from
the laboratory of his mind, in consequence of that first difficulty.
Other difficulties would soon appear, so that no text-book could last
more than half the term. In this way the class listened to almost all
of the work that subsequently appeared in the journal. It seemed to
be the quality of his mind that he must adhere to one subject.         He
would think about it, talk about it to his class, and finally write
about it for the journal. The merest accident might start him, but,
once started, every moment, every thought was given to         it, and, as
much as possible, he read what others had done in the same direc
tion but this last seemed to be his weak point he could not read
    ;                                               ;
without meeting difficulties in the way of understanding the author.
Thus, often his own work reproduced what others had done, and he-
did not find  it  out until too late."
     Dr. W. P. Dcrfee, Professor of Mathematics at Hobart College,.
 Geneva, N.Y., has written —:
    " His manner of lecturing was highly rhetorical and elocutionary.
When about to enunciate an important or remarkable statement he
would draw himself up till he stood on the very tips of his toes,
 and in deep tones thunder out his sentences. He preached at us
 at such, times, and not infrequently he wound up by quoting a few
 lines of poetry to impress upon us the importance of wliat he had
 been declaring."
     On the death of H. J. S. Smith, Sylvester was elected to the
  Savilian Professorship of Geometry at Oxford, and in December,
  1883, he finally left Baltimore to enter upon residence in New
  College, Oxford. At the time his mind was occupied with tho
  theory of a new species of invariants these are differential and of
                                          ;
  more immediate application to geometry than those of pure algebra.
  Sophus Lie had treated the whole subject of differential invariants
  from a general point of view, and had given the various categories,
  but had made no attempt to develop the special case treated by
   Sylvester.   His notice appears to have been first attracted to the
  subject by   the well-known invariantive property of the differential
  expression known as the Schwarzian Derivative, which in this country
  had been studied by Cayley and Forsyth.       The invariantive forms, he-
  quickly reached, he termed reciprocants,     the name arising from the
  fact that, from his original point of view, the expressions arrived at
  were unchanged, to    a   factor pres, by the simple interchange of tho
   dependent and independent        variables.  Later he considered the
   general linear and homographic transformations applied to similar
   forms, and propounded an extensive theory of great geometrical

                                      xxiv
  importance.     The lectures on the theory were delivered before the
  University of Oxford during the Hilary, Easter, and Michaelmas
  terms of 1886, and subsequently published in the 'American Journal
 ¦of Mathematics.'      The powerful weapon chiefly employed in the
 research is due to the author himself, and is termed by him "the
 method of infinitesimal variation.'         In many details, and in the
 orderly exposition, he was greatly assisted by James Hammond, M.A.,
 and his fellow- workers in Oxford — E. B. Elliott, C. Laudesdorf, and
  L. J. Rogers —and others outside the University also made notable
 contributions. In particular, L. J. Rogers made a capital discovery
 in the Theory of Principiants (the name given to those reciprocants
 which are invariantive in respect of the homographic substitutions),
 which gave Sylvester material for most of the lectures in the latter
 half of the series.
    This theory was Sylvester's last great work. A masterly contraction
 of Tchebicheff's limits with regard to the number of primes occurring
 between given numbers, and a tract upon Buffon's problem of the
 needle, tfre the only other papers that need mention.
    Failing health, frequently involving acute suffering, came upon
 him when he was close upon eighty years of age. His high sense of
 the duties appertaining to his position would not allow him longer to
 attempt actively to lead the mathematical studies of the University,
 and in 1893 a deputy professor (Mr. W. Esson, F.R.S.) was
appointed.
    The remaining three years witnessed the gradual breaking up of
an iron constitution. He lived for the most part with friends, or in
 apartments in or near Mayfair, with occasional visits to Tunbridge
Wells, where he stayod at the Spa Hotel. For some years he was
quite unable to think of mathematical subjects.          He found that he
could   no longer  understand   notes  that he  had  made  in former years,
and this made him sad and dejected. About August, 1896, a revival
of energy and mental power took place, and till his death, March 15,
 1897, he worked continuously at the Theory of Compound Partition, and
made an heroic attempt to prove or disprove the celebrated Goldbach-
Euler conjecture concerning the partition of every even number
into two primes.      A fortnight before his death, while working in his
sitting-room   at  Hertford  Street, Mayfair, he dropped his pen, and on
stooping to pick it up had a paralytic seizure.           He never spoke
again,   and continuously   sank  until the end  came.
    He was a Royal Medallist of 1861, and the Copley Medallist of
1880.
    While it is certain that he was one of the greatest mathematicians
of all time, it may be doubted whether he will take a place amongst
the small band who occupy absolutely the front line.         His character
and temperament      militated against continuity   of thought.  He would

                                        xxv
 be  oppressed    with a flood of ideas, which made it difficult for him to
 suitably organise his researches.          A theory, half composed, would
be forsaken that he might grapple             with fresh imaginations.      It is
 certain that but a small fraction of his best work has been published
 for the benefit of posterity.        His genius and his greatness are not
 properly represented by the memoirs which he has left.               He had, to
 some    extent, the poetic faculty, and occasionally occupied himself
 with   the composition of sonnets, both in English and Latin.
    He had literary power, and considerable knowledge of languages,
 living  and dead. He wrote French with ease, and conversed readily
 in   French, German, and Italian.            He was acquainted with both
 Latin    and   Greek, and when past seventy-five years of age read
 '             '
   Athenaeus     without a dictionary.
    The   writer, who had numerous opportunities of studying the cha
racter of this illustrious man in the last years of his life, when he
was heroically battling       against acute suffering, consequent upon the
infirmities of extreme old age, formed the conviction, that will never
be shaken, that his personal        character was one of singular beauty,
and that its salient points were simplicity and honesty.              Absolutely
and fearlessly honest from cradle to grave.            Future generations will
mark with admiration the deep footprints he has left upon the sands
of time, but they will not be able to realise the effect which contact
with his great spirit had upon his contemporaries,                who knew and
loved him.        The superficial crust of eccentricities and slight faults
of temperament once pierced, and the kernel of his nature reached,
there was found a roundness and perfection of disposition that is not
often met with.
    It cannot, perhaps, be said that his religious convictions were of a
kind which could be completely defined, but it is certain that he
believed in a Supreme Being, and in a future life, a life full of
t'liuanced intellectual power, and opportunities of intellectual growth.
The atheist will find nothing to give him satisfaction in the story of
this life, throughout which the faith was strong, and the conviction
that high principle should be paramount always present.
    His last sufferings, extending over fifteen days, were borne with
fortitude.
     So passed away one of the great        spirits of the century.

  tallographer Levy by   :     him  the  young  Des  Cloizeaux   was   initiated
  into the mysteries of that science, and was advised to enter upon the
  mineralogical course then being given by Dufrenoy, at the ficole des
  Mines.       At that institution he later made the acquaintance of
  Senarraont, through whose influence it was that he afterwards came
  to devote himself so closely to the optical investigation of crystals.
  His first paper dealt with the crystallisation of ^Eschynite, and
  appeared in 1842 ; for the next half-century scarcely a year passed
  without the issue of one or more papers recording the results of some
  mineralogical research.       In 1843 he was appointed Repetiteur at the
  ficole   Centrale,   and in 1857 Maitre des Conferences at the ficole
  Normale      ; from 1873 to 1876 he took the place of Delafosse at the
  Sorbonne,      and, on the retirement of that professor from his office at
  the Paris      Natural History Museum, Des Cloizeaux was appointed
  (1876)     to   the Curatorship of that important mineral collection.
  This   office  was particularly congenial to his tastes, for he was always
  more happy in the laboratory than in the lecture-room ; lie retained
  it till 1892, when the rules of the Civil Service necessitated his
 retirement at the age of seventy-five.
     Though his life-work related almost wholly to the morphology
 and optics of crystals, his inquiries were not limited to       the examina
 tion of museum specimens ; he was much interested                in modes of
 origin and of occurrence, and in the geological relations         of minerals  ;
 and he was always ready to seek an opportunity for              seeing in its
 native home any mineral to the determination of the characters of
 which he had been devoting his attention.         Ho went on two missions
 to Iceland (1845-6) to investigate the mode of occurrence of the
 well-known spar, about the scarcity of which physicists had already
 become anxious, and he brought back              from that island many
 specimens of its minerals and rocks useful to him in his later
 researches ; in 1868 he was sent on another special mission, on this
 occasion to Norway, Sweden, and Russia ; and in the course of a long
 life he found it practicable to visit all the more important mineral
localities of the Continent.
     Two characteristics     specially manifest  in the work of Professor
 Des Cloizeaux are accuracy and perseverance : he would spare no
pains to obtain the best values for the crystallographic          constants of
the material he was investigatir'g, while, a problem once started
upon, he would persist in its investigation for years, and return to it
again and again as new specimens or new methods became available.
For the first twelve or thirteen years his work was almost wholly
morphological, and consisted in the determination of the crystallo
graphic constants of rare or new specimens and in the description of
the minerals associated together at new localities.           To this epoch
belongs his memoir on the crystallisation        of  quartz ; to the thirty

                                        xxvii
five then      known forms of this common mineral he added no fewer
that     135   new ones, many of them with complicated indices deter
mined through the skilful use of zones : as to the remarkable
stereographic projection prepared by Des Cloizeanx to illustrate the
observed forms of quartz, Professor Ruskin, speaking as an artist
and critic, has more than once expressed to the present writer his
great admiration of the
                                  " patient labour and entire accuracy of
                   "
workmanship therein displayed.
    From 1855 onwards his researches were mainly optical.           It must
be remembered that at the time when M. Des Cloizeaux                 entered
upon the study of minerals, the instrnmental appliances for the
optical examination of small crystals were in the rudimentary stage
of development, and were scarcely in nse outside physical labora
tories.       He improved the polarising microscope of Norremberg,
giving     it a new form, increasing the field of view, and making it a
convenient       instrument for the examination of small sections.
Thereupon, not only did he entertain the colossal idea of determin
ing the optical characters of all known crystals, whether natural or
 artificial, but he began the work.           He was soon led to emphasise
the importance of the " optical sign
                                                " for the discrimination of
minerals, and in his determination of the crystallographic system to
make constant use of the peculiarities of the distribution of colour
in the rings afforded by the sections of crystals in convergent
polarised light.        In 1868 he published his observations of the
changes      of optic  axial angle resulting from changes of temperature.
 In the case of orthoclase he found that, with a maximum tempera
ture of 400° C. only temporary changes were induced, but that with
a temperature         exceeding    700 — 800° permanent   changes resulted.
Further, he pointed out that in the case of orthoclase from some
volcanic rocks this changed optical condition was already a character
of the specimens.
    He was the discoverer         of the circular polarisation of cinnabar,
and showed       that it was seventeen times that of quartz.    He was the
first to find a substance (strychnine sulphate) which rotates the
plane of polarisation, both in the crystallised state and in solution.
 He showed that benzil circularly polarises when in crystals, but is
 inactive when fused or in solution, and that, on the other hand,
camphors are active only when in solution. He was the first to
show, by optical characters, that there are ortho-rhombic members
of the epidote, pyroxene, and araphibole groups, and that the three
 types of humite have characteristic optical features.
    But more especially was he interested in the felspars, a group of
 minerals of fundamental importance in the classification of rocks,
 and to the investigation of which he gave more than twenty years of
  his life. When he began this work it seemed unlikely that much
  was left to be discovered in the case of so long known a group, and

                                  xxvm
 it was  a veritable triumph for his method of work that he was able
 to establish   that there was a kind of potash-felspar distinct from
 orthoclase ; it was anorthic instead of mono-symmetric in its sym
 metry, although approximating to the latter in the development of
 its forms, and its optical characters, instead of being unstable, are
 stable at all temperatures ; to this he applied the term microcline.
 Indeed, it is to Des Cloizeaux that we owe our first precise know
 ledge of the optical characters of all the plagioclastic felspars, and
the determination presented constant difficulty to him by reason of
 the lowness of the symmetry and the smallness and rarity of well-
developed crystals.
    Much of his work has been incorporated in the treatise to which
 he gave the modest title ' Manuel de Mineralogie,' and which is now
the standard book of reference for all that relates to the optics of
minerals.     In its compactness and freedom from unnecessary words,
and indeed in its general characters, it bears a close resemblance to
(Brooke and) Miller's edition of 'Phillips's Mineralogy'; and it is
interesting to know that at first he had intended merely to translate
that book, but was eventually compelled, by the extension of his
optical researches, to prepare an independent treatise.      He adopted
the same general plan      in giving a  stereographic projection of the
observed faces for all the more important minerals, and elaborate
lists of measured and calculated angles useful in the recognition of
the substance.     The preparation of this manual was a work of great
labour, and involved a vast amount of physical observation and
numerical calculation ; he made it a rule never to cite an angle with
out verification by observation or recalculation.    The first volume of
the manual was published in 1862 ; the first part of the second
volume in 1874, and the second part in 1893.         The third and last
volume had not been issued at the time of his death, but is now
being prepared for publication by his successor at the Museum and
former pupil, Professor Lacroix.
    Professor Des Cloizeaux was elected Membre de l'lnstitut in
1869, and President of the Academie des Sciences in 1889.             The
Royal Society awarded him the Rnmford Medal in 1870, and
elected him a Foreign Member in 1875.         He was a founder and the
first President (1878) of the Mineralogical Society of Prance, and
again served as its President eleven years later.     Other Societies in
many parts of the world recognised     the  value of  his scientific work
by enrolling him on the list of Honorary Members. An aged widow,
a widowed daughter (the Vicomtesso d'Herouville), and three young
grandchildren more especially mourn his loss ; but the memory of
his kindly character and encouragement will long be treasured up
by those who were in any way associated with him.
                                                                  L. F.

     By the death of JonN Carrick Moore, science loses the last of that
  band  of ardent field-geologists who, during the first half of the present
 century, did so much to investigate the underground structure of the
  British Islands.    Inspired by the cxamplo and animated by the
 scientific principles of William Smith, they carried out in fuller detail
 than was possible    to their master, his great idea of delineating in
 maps and sections the distribution and relations of tho British strata
 — guided everywhere by the organic remains which
                                                             they contain.
 But while this band of workers     — which included such names as those
 of Buckland,       Conybeare,    Webster, Mantell, Dixon, Lonsdale,
 Sedgwick, Murchison, Fitton,         De-la-Beche, Godwin-Austen, and
 Phillips  — were   so deeply influenced by the teaching of William
 Smith,   yet they were  seldom, with the exception of the lust-mentioned,
 personally instructed by him, but derived their knowledge of his
 principles and methods at second hand from men like Richardson,
 Townsend, and Farey, who were proud to act as tho disciples stnd
interpreters of the distinguished " Father of English Geology."
    John Carrick Moore came of a very famous stock.             His grand
 father, Dr. John Moore, the friend and biographer of Smollett, was
 the  author of many works very famous in his day, of which the
        " Zeluco " has been                             Three of the sons
 novel                         longest remembered.
of Dr. John Moore had very distinguished careers.                The eldest
surviving son was General Sir John Moore, the hero of Corunna, and
a younger son was Admiral Sir Graham           Moore, whose exploits on
the sea were scarely less notable than those of his elder brother in
the field.    The father of John Carrick Moore was James Moore, the
second surviving son of Dr. John Moore, who studied medicine in
 Edinburgh and London, and became one of the most distinguished
surgeons of his day.        He was the friend of Jenner, and, as a well-
known writer in favour of vaccination,         was appointed to succeed
that surgeon as director of vaccine establishments.
   James Moore, who practised          extensively for many years in
London, was        the author of many medical treatises and of a
biography of his brother, General Sir John Moore, published in 1833.
Having had bequeathed to him by a Mr. Carrick, a banker in
Glasgow, the estate of Corsewall, in Wigtownshire, near Stanraer
and Port Patrick, James Moore added to his own surname that of
Carrick.     In 1825 James Carrick Moore retired from practice, and,
having built himself an excellent house upon his estate on the shores
of Loch Ryan, spent the remainder of his life there, dying in 1834
at the age      of 71.     On their mother's side, the Moores were
descended from Robert Simson, the celebrated geometrician.
   John Carrick Moore was the second son of James Carrick Moore,
and was born in 1804.         He went to Cambridge, and was educated
at Queen's College, proceeding to the degree of M.A., and devoting

                                     XXX
muck attention     to mathematics    and physics.    Before the year 1838,
his attention seems to have         been attracted   by the rocks of the
Bhinns of Wigtownshire, near his residence, for we find that he was
in communication with Charles Lyell, who identified the fossils found
by him as graptolites.       In the year named, he was elected a fellow
of the Geological Society.
      In 1839 he traced out carefully the succession of strata along
the west shore of Loch Byan, and in the following year a paper on
the subject was read by him to the Geological Society.             In 1841,
Sedgwick, crossing from Ireland, paid a visit to Corsewall, and was
accompanied by John Carrick Moore in a tour through Ayrshire.
In September 1843, Lyell and his wife paid a visit to the same
hospitable dwelling, examining and confirming the accuracy of
Moore's sections.     Much of Lyell's time seems to have been spent
in studying the rain- and hail-prints, with the fucoid- and crustacean-
markings on the shores of Loch Byan, and he subsequently wrote to
Moore : " The Loch is a grand magazine of geological analogies —
tidal, littoral, conchological,    sedimentary, &c, which I envy you
having at your door."       Subsequently to this visit, Lyell, under the
direction of Moore, visited the remarkable rocks in the neighbour
 hood of Ballantrae and bore testimony to the accuracy of his friend's
work there.
     In 1846 we find John Carrick Moore had become so identified
with the work of the Geological Society, that he was elected Secre
 tary, and in the same year he became a member of the Geological
 Society Club. He held the office of Secretary for six years (1846-52),
 when he was elected a Vice-President of the Society (1853-4),
 resuming his post of Secretary in 1855 for one year.             So active
 indeed was Carrick Moore in the administration of the Geological
 Society's affairs, that between 1846 and 1875 we find him absent from
  the Council only in four years ; he was a Vice-President in 1862,
 and again in 1864-5. In 1848 he read a more extended paper to the
  Geological Society on the Silurian rocks of the Wigtownshire coast,
  the fossils being described and figured by Salter.      In 1856 and 1858
  Moore communicated accounts of further observations on Wigtown
  shire geology to the Geological Society, while his general interest in
  geological research was shown by the papers written by him iu
  1850 and in 1863, on fossils collected and sent home from San Domingo
  by Mr. Heniker, and from Jamaica by Lucas Barrett.            In 1849 wo
  find him describing the Oligocene          fossils found in the New
 Forest.
     John Carrick Moore was proposed          as a Fellow    of the   Boyal
   Society in November,   1855, his nomination paper being signed first
  by his friend Charles     Lyell, while others who subscribed from
  personal knowledge     were Sedgwick, Murchison, Hopkins, Leonard

                                       XXXI
   Horner, and Faraday.        He does not appear, however, to have ever
   contributed a paper to the Society.          By his patient labours in
   studying the geology of Galloway he made valuable additions to
   our knowledge of the stratified rocks of Britain, and he took a
   distinguished place among the band of amateur workers — inclnding
   many landed        proprietors, clergymen, soldiers, and doctors — to
   whose painstaking and detailed work in the field English geology
   owes   so much.       Among these men, John Carrick Moore was
   always   held in the highest esteem, and his time and energy were
   ungrudgingly devoted alike to the advancement of his favourite
  science by careful studies in the field, and to the promotion of the
  interests of the Society identified with that science, during the parts
  of the   year when he resided in London.
      In 1864, Andrew Ramsay spent a few days with John Carrick
  Moore    at Corsewall, mapping the peninsula, which terminates in
  Coraewall Point, for the Geological Survey of Scotland.          Of John
  Carrick Moore's -wide sympathies with all matters connected with
 geology, and of the knowledge and ability -with which, owing to his
 early training at Cambridge, he was able to deal with those ques
 tions of physical geology demanding an acquaintance with mathe
  matical methods, we have abundant evidence.        Between 1865 and 1867,
  he sent   a series  of letters to the ' Philosophical Magazine,' dealing
  in a very able and critical manner -with Ramsay's theory of the
 origin of lake- basins, and with Croll's theory of the cause of the
 glacial period.      These letters show that Moore had not forgotten his
 early training and had kept himself abreast of the science of the day
 by his studies of physical questions ; and the substantial justice of his
 criticisms has been abundantly shown by later researches.          In 1875
 he wrote to
                  ' Nature,'
                             pointing out a curious oversight of Humboldt
 in his ' Cosmos.'
     In 1875, John Carrick Moore finally withdrew from the Council
of the Geological Society, upon which he had served so long and so
faithfully ; and from that time forward he would seem to have ceased
to take any active part in scientific work. Few of the present genera
tion of geologists can even recollect having seen the stately and
courteous gentleman, who was at one time so indefatigable in the
service of their society, and who had so frequently acted as one of
its officials. For nearly a quarter of a century after this withdrawal
from public activity, however, John Carrick Moore lived on, spending
his time between his seat in Wigtownshire and the house in Eaton
Square, where he died on February 10, 1898, at tho great age of
94. His only son had pre-deceased him, but a daughter survives, the
estate passing to his nephew Colonel Sir David Carrick Buchanan,
of Drumpellier.         Besides the Corsewall estate, John Carrick Moore
owned property in Kirkcudbrightshire           and in England, and he was

                                     xxxii
a deputy-lieutenant   of the county of Wigtownshire.         He was not less
highly respected among the gentry of his county and the tenants of
his estate than in the circles of scientific society in London, in
which his presence was so long conspicuous.
                                                                 J. W. J.
   By the death of Baron Ferdinand vox Mueller Australia has lost
a botanist and geographer       who stood in the foremost rank of the
scientific men of the southern             hemisphere.    Ferdinand Jakob
Heinrich Mueller was born id 1825 at Rostock, of which town his
father was Commissioner        of Customs.          He was educated for the
medical profession at Kiel, where he graduated as Ph.D., after having
devoted much of his time as a student to the botany of Schleswig
and Holstein.     Soon after attaining his majority he was seized with
an affection of the   lungs, and having lost both parents from con
sumption, he resolved to seek a more genial climate than that of North
Germany. He accordingly in 1847 left for Australia, to which country
there was then a considerable emigration from Germany.             This was
not till after the completion of his first botanical essay,    " Breviarium
Plantarum Ducatus Slesvicensis austro-occidentalis,"          which was not
published till 1853.* He had meanwhile been enrolled as a member
of the German Association for the Advancement of Science, which
had just been instituted by Oken.
   After his arrival in Australia, Mueller acted for a short time as
assistant to a chemist in Adelaide, but being at once fascinated by
the interest and novelty of the flora, and having apparently some
private means, he gave himself up unreservedly to botanical and
geographical exploration.         Leaving Adelaide, he crossed over to
Victoria in 1848, with the especial object of visiting the then all but
unknown Australian Alps, and connecting their flora with that of
Tasmania.
   During the several years devoted to this object, he, alone and
unaided except by the contributions of a few generous friends, dis
played great intrepidity as an explorer, penetrating into the interior
as far as the Murray River, in crossing which he nearly lost his life,
effecting the first triangulation of any part of the Victorian Alps, and
making extensive botanical collections abounding in novelty and in
terest. At the same time he entered into correspondence with botanists
in Europe, sending them duplicates of his discoveries, and letters that
at once established his reputation as a young naturalist of great
attainments and astonishing powers of work.
   Amongst his English correspondents was Sir W. Hooker, who
interested himself in his favour with Mr. Goulburn, then on the
point of leaving England as Lieutenant-Governor of Victoria, and who
                           • ' Flora,' vol. 36,

                                 xxxm
was    desirous of having the vegetable resources of that Colony turned
to   the best account.  This resulted in the creation of a Department
of    Botany in the public service of Victoria, and the appointment of
Mueller to its directorship.
  In July, 1855, an expedition -was organised at Sydney, with the
view of discovering the fate of Leichardt, who in 1847 had started
with a fully-equipped party in an endeavour to cross the continent
of  Australia from east to west, but of whom no tidings had
been   obtained for seven years.     The search party was conducted
by Mr. A. C. (aftetwavds        Sir Augustus) Gregory, and Mueller
was attached     to it as botanist.   Leaving Sydney in July of that
year in the barque
                         " Monarch,"  the  expedition sailed round the
north roast of Australia to the Victoria River, on the north-west
coast of the continent, and after spending a year in the exploration
of the sources of that river to the 17th degree of S. latitude, it
returned by land across the continent, skirting the Gulf of Carpen
taria, and finally reaching     the Darwin River in Queensland, in
November, 1856.        During this remarkable journey nearly 20° of
unexplored country were traversed, and Mueller, who proved himself
au invaluable member of the expedition,            obtained    magnificent
collections of plants abounding in novelties, all carefully anno
tated and in perfect condition.      He subsequently made two other
extended land journeys, both in Western Australia, one in 1867,
when he explored the country between King George's Sound and the
Stirling Range ; the other to the district east of Shark's Bay,
between the Murchison and Gascoigne Rivers.
   In 1857 Mueller was appointed, at a suitable salary, Director of the
Melbourne Botanical Gardens, with herbarium, library and labora
tory, which post he held till 1S73, when he was deprived of the
administration     of the gardens on the ground of his paying too
much attention to the introduction and cultivation of plants of
purely scientific interest, and too little to the aesthetic require
ments of the Melbourne public, who desired to see their extensive
public grounds and garden rival in beauty the far-famed and no
less scientific establishment    of the same kind at Adelaide in the
adjoining    colony   of  South Australia.  The fact   is,  that, great as
were Mueller's contributions in many ways to horticulture              and
gardening in Australia and Europe, he was neither a practical
horticulturist nor a landscape gardener.         On the occasion of his
demission the Colonial Government            treated    him with great
consideration and liberality, retaining his services as Government
botanist, with residence, undiminished salary, herbarium, library,
and laboratory.
     The principal labours of Mueller may be classed under the two heads
of scientific   and economic botany, especially forestry. It     impos
                                                                is

                                  xxxiv
sible here to give eveu a list of his scientific publications.     Besides
104 papers registered      in this Society's ' Catalogue of Scientific
Papers,' lie produced many works of exceptional value.           Amongst
them the most notable are the ' Fragmenta Phytographise Australia!,'
begun in 1858 and concluded             in 1882, comprised in twelve
volumes, a work teeming with critical observations on Australian
                                                                    '
 plants which have been embodied by Bentham in the                    Flora
Australiensis ; the ' Eucalyptographia,' a revision of the Gum-trees
                '
of Australia, with 129 illustrative plates ; the ' Iconography of
Australian Salsolaceous Plants,' with 90 plates ; the ' Acacias and
their Allies,' with 130 plates ; the ' Myoporineae,' with 74 ; and the
'
   Plants of Victoria,' a fragment, with 90. The descriptive portions
of those works leave nothing to be desired from a scientific point of
view, and the plates, all in quarto, abounding in anatomical analyses
and executed altogether in the Colony, rival the best of those of
European botanical works.        In 1882 he published his ' Census of
Australian Plants,' in which the ranges of the species in the several
Colonies are given, thus initiating a botanical geography of the
continent.     A second edition appeared in LS89.
    From his first years in Australia, Mueller had entertained the
ambition of writing a Flora of that continent, and when the several
Colonial Governments acceded to the representations of Sir W.
 Hooker that such a work should be undertaken, and had voted the
supplies for its execution, the name of Mueller was naturally the first
to be suggested as author. And he no doubt would have been selected
but for the fact that without constant access to the Australian
collections in the British Museum and at Kew it could not be accom
plished.     Mueller at once grasped the 6itnation, and, hearing that
Bentham had been selected as author, he generously offered the use of
 the whole of his materials, including that of his immense herbarium,
 which he transmitted, by instalments, to Kew for the purpose. This
great work, commenced in 1863, was concluded in 1878, Mueller
loyally aiding by correspondence from beginning to end.           Happily
 his collections were returned to him without the loss of a specimen.
     Of Mueller's works in economic botany the most important is
 the ' Select Extra-tropical Plants, suitable for Industrial Culture or
 Naturalisation in Australia.' This work is remarkable as a monu
 ment of botanical erudition, and, as an economic guide, it is unique of
 its kind. It passed through many editions in the colony, has been
  translated into four European languages, and been reprinted in th-j
 United States and in India. Besides being the means of introducing
 many new cultures into Australia, Mueller's activity in sending seeds of
 Australian plants, especially trees, all over the world, was phenomenal ;
 and to him South Europe, Algeria, India, South and West Africa,
 California, and South America, are greatly indebted for the groves of

                                     XXXV
  eucalypti, acacias and other trees that have done so much to adorn
  their hills and plains, and even to improve their climates.       To the
  Royal Gardens, Mnseums, and Herbarium of Kew he was a perennial
  contributor of botanical treasures, continuously for upwards of forty
  years, often at considerable personal cost.     Of this the magnificent
  specimen   of the great fern, Todea  barbara, in the Temperate House,
 is a conspicuous example.      It is a native of gullies in the Victorian
 Alps, from whence Mueller had it transported by wagon to Mel
 bourne, at his    own  expense, and shipped from thence, as a gift, to
  Kew.
    After botany the furtherance of geography was Mueller's constant
 endeavour.       He was President of the Geographical Society of
 Victoria from its commencement, and author of valuable contribu
 tions to its Proceedings.    According to a statement in the ' Melbourne
 Argus,' it was he who induced Sir W. Macgregor to undertake the
 exploration of New Guinea.         He was an active member of Burke
 and Will's Exploration Committee, and he ceaselessly urged upon
 the attention of his fellow-colonists the importance of an Ant
arctic Expedition.      No better evidence could be adduced as to the
 value attached      to his own explorations and his efforts in the
advancement of geographical          knowledge, than that at the Geo
graphical Congress in Vienna he was one of the first to whom a
special vote of thanks was awarded for exceptional services in the
cause of this science.
    Amongst other instances of his devotion to science must be recorded
the fact that he was one of the three founders of the now flourishing
 Royal Society of Victoria, which was established within a year of his
arrival in the colony.     He was President of the Australian Associa
tion for the Advancement of Science at its second session, held in
Melbourne in 1889, and was an active member of the Horticultural,
Acclimatisation, and various other societies of the Colony.        It may
further be mentioned, that being a discriminating devotee of music,
he was chosen acting President of the Melbourne Liedertafel.
   As with many other men of ardent disposition, Baron Mueller had
striking personalities.      He is described as being of middle height
and frugal habits, dressing in black, wearing wooden shoes, and
boasting of never having been possessed of a watch or a looking-
glass.     He was as voluble in conversation as indefatigable in
correspondence, asserting that the latter amounted to 3000 letters
annually, written with his own hand.         His multitudinous titles, and
the decorations with which he delighted to adorn himself, were a
source of innocent gratification to him, especially his foreign heredi
tary dignity of Baron, conferred on him by the King of Wurtem-
 burg ; and the K.C^M.G. by Her Majesty on the announcement to
the Secretary of State for the Colonies of the completion           of the
    vol. lxiii.                                                   /

whole of the savings from his official salary to science, charities,
and good works.     He was elected a fellow of the Linnean Society
in 1858, of the Royal in 1861, and was awarded a Royal Medal
in 1888.    Of other British and foreign scientific societies he
held 150 diplomas.      He never married.   His last and fatal illness
was an affection of the brain, of a fortnight's duration, due to
study, worry, insomnia, and a total abandonment of bodily exer
cise.  He died in his official residence in Melbourne, October 9th,
1896.

                                     [Plate 1.]
    In  an   account given by ouo of us in 1890 of the results of an
investigation of the histological and physiological changes which
take place      in the seeds of the Grasses during germination,* a pro
minent     position was given to a discussion of the relations existing
between     the endosperm and embryo, and to the part played by each
in the     preparation of the reserve materials of the seed for the
nutrition     of the young plant. This branch of the inquiry was
much     facilitated by the discovery that the embryo, when separated
from the other parts of the seed, is capable of an independent
existence, providing it is supplied         with a suitable artificial nutri
 ment in the form of certain          carbohydrates, its own store of pro-
teids being sufficient         to supply the nitrogen requisite             for the
production of young plants of a considerable size.
    The carbohydrates most favourable to rapid growth in such cases
are sucrose, dextrose, and maltose; but it was also found that the
embryo, when deprived of such readily assimilable material, acquires
 the power of dissolving solid starch to a very notable extent, a
 fnnction which was subsequently localised in the columnar epithe
 lium of the scntellum.
    The endosperm        itself was also subjected to examination with a
 view to determine if it possesses any power of acting on the reserve
 materials     contained within its cells, and of bringing about any
 self-depletion which is independent of the influence of the embryo.
    This question was attacked in two different ways.                   In the first
 place, endosperms, after being degermed, were placed under favour
able conditions for the full play of any metabolic activity which
 might be possessed by any portion of their tissue, every facility
 being afforded for the rapid outward diffusion of the products of
 change ; and, secondly, advantage was taken of a fact which had
 previously been established, that an embryo may be transferred
 from one endosperm to another without materially affecting its
 power of subsequent          growth ; thus affording an opportunity of
 subjecting an endosperm to such treatment as may reasonably be
 supposed capable of destroying any residual vitality in its cells,
 and of then observing how this affects the subsequent development
 of a fresh embryo     " grafted " upon it.
     For  the   full details of these experiments        we must       refer to the

4       Messrs. Brown and Escombe.           On the Depletion  of  the
original paper, and here merely quote the general conclusions which
were drawn from them.
   Although the peripheral layer of the endosperm, the so-called
"aleurone-layer," or " Kleberschicht," undoubtedly consists of living
cells, no evidence      could be obtained of the existence of any
residual vitality in the amyliferous cells, which constitute by far the
greater portion of the endosperm.
   No changes were observed in the isolated endosperms in the
direction of self-depletion which were comparable in intensity with
those produced when the embryo was attached ; and when those
changes did occur they were always preceded by an invasion of
bacteria and moulds in the culture-medium, the disintegration and
dissolution of the endosperm-contents in such cases proceeding in
such a manner as to suggest that they were conditioned entirely
by the organisms.
                                              " on
   When living embryos were " grafted               endosperms which had
remained in alcohol for six months, and in which it was then
reasonable to suppose that any residual vitality had been effectually
destroyed, all the usual phenomena incident to normal germination
were observable in those endosperms.          Hence it was concluded that
the idea of any co-operation     on   the part of the endosperm-cells was
superfluous, and that the determining factor in the normal endo-
spermous changes is the embryo itself, which, by independent ex
periment,    had been shown to possess the power of dissolving
starch   and of initiating those phenomena of cytohydrolysis which
are amongst the earliest exhibited in natural germination.          Accord
ing to this view the endosperm of Hordeum, and probably of all the
Grasses, is, as far as its starch- containing cells are concerned, a dead
storehouse of reserve material, whose stores can be converted to the
use of the plant by the action of the embryo only, and that this,
for a limited period of its existence, lives a truly saprophytic
life.
    These conclusions are in accord with the views of Van Tieghem,
that, whilst an endosperm, such as that of Ricinus, containing oil
and aleurone as reserve materials, is endowed with a vital activity
of its own, by virtue of which it is capable of digesting the reserve
material in preparation for the embryo, the endosperm of seeds,
whose reserve materials, on the other hand, consist of starch and
cellulose, remains passive during germination, the digestion of its
reserves being in this case effected by the embryo.
    Two years after the appearance of the above-mentioned paper,
Pfeffer gave a brief description of some work by B. Hansteen,.

       Endosperm       of Hordeum vulgare during Germination.                     5
 which  was followed       the year afterwards by a more detailed paper
on the same      subject by Hansteen himself.*
    Hansteen strenuously        opposes Van Tieghem's division of endo
sperms    into "active" and "inactive," and asserts that the latter
 was led into error on this point by not taking precautions                 to put
his endosperms under conditions favourable for the rapid removal of
 the products of change.         Although reference is made to the Brown
and Morris paper of 1890, the author does not appear to have made
himself thoroughly acquainted either with the details of the experi
ments described or with the conclusions drawn from them.
    Hansteen's principal experiments were made with the seeds of Zea
Mays and Hordeum vulgare, but he also made observations on the
mucilaginous endosperm of Tetragonolobus purpureus, and the cotyle
dons of Lupinus luteus and Helianthus annuus.                  For our present pur
poses  it   is  only necessary     to  consider   the  experiments on barley and
maize.     The seed was, in the first instance, soaked in water for two
days,  and     the embryos, including the scutellum, were removed.               To
the isolated endosperms there was then applied a mixture of plaster
of Paris and water, so as to form a small plaster column, which
occupied the original position of the embryo.
    The little plaster columns, with the endosperms attached, were
then put into glass dishes containing a sufficient amount of water
to reach half-way up the columns.                In order to avoid the disturbing
influence of micro-organisms the seeds were placed for two hours in
a 1 per cent, solution of copper sulphate ; all the materials                   and
vessels used were carefully sterilised,               and the experiments were
 performed under strict antiseptic conditions in a cultivation chamber
so arranged as only to admit germ-free               air.   The author states that
he has been able in this manner to maintain his cultures sterile for
at least a month.         When there was a sufficient amount of water in
the culture dishes, and the conditions                were thus favourable for a
rapid   outward      diffusion   of   the products of change, Hansteen found
that, within from ten to thirteen days of commencing the experi
ment, the isolated endosperms of both maize and barle}' had given
rise to a very considerable self-digestion of the cell-contents.                 In
the immediate neighbourhood of the plaster the cells had quite lost
their starch, whilst the starch-granules,                 even at a distance, were
more or less corroded, and the partially depleted endosperm had
become soft and disintegrated.               In the case of barley these visible
changes were very strongly marked indeed, and simultaneously with
them sugar could be detected in the water into which the small
plaster columns dipped.
    In those experiments in which the amount of water had been
mnch reduced, but very little starch-erosion took place at the point

 6      Me£8re.  Brown and Escombe.                On   the Depletion   of the
 of contact with the plaster, a fact which the author attributes to the
 accumulation within the endosperm of an excess of soluble products,
 which thus exercise an unfavourable influence on the continuous
 chemical change of the solid reserve substances.
    In view of Haberlandt's assertion that the cells of the "               Kleber-
 schinht
          "  have a distinct diastase-secreting               function, Hansteen
experimented in a similar manner with endosperms which had been
 deprived of this layer, and he found the same indications of self-
 depletion as before.        He therefore concluded that the dissolution
 and depletion which he had observed are due to a special activity of
 the inner starch-bearing       cells of the endosperm.            The question is
 then discussed whether, during germination,                 the embryo does or
does not secrete an enzyme, and the conclusions arrived at are in
accord with those of Brown and Morris, and Griiss, that such a secre
tion does take place.          Hansteen, again agreeing with the former
observers, regards this secretion of diastase as conditioned by the
falling off in the supply of readily soluble carbohydrates; whether,
however, the diastase so produced plays an important part in normal
depletion, or whether the asserted self-depletive power of the endo
sperm-cells is sufficient, in normal germination, to account for all the
observed results, the author leaves an open question.
   In a long memoir entitled " Beitriige zur Physiologie der Kei-
mimg,"* J. Griiss discusses the question of the appearance of fer
ments in the endosperms of maize and barley after excising the
                                     " Kleberschicht "
embryos and filing off the                                    (" aleurone- layer ").
From experiments made by burying fragments of such endosperms
for a few days in sterilised moist sand, he concludes that the starch-
bearing cells have the power of producing spontaneously                      within
themselves a    diastase,    the presence      of  which he determined, in the
first place microscopically by the extremely doubtful guaiacum-reac-
tion, and secondly by the increased action of the endosperm-tissue
on thin starch-paste.
   The most recent contribution to the subject is a paper, taking the
form of a preliminary communication, by K. Puriewitsch, " Ueber
die selbstthatige Entleerung der Reservestoffbehalter,"t followed since
                                            "
by a more detailed paper, entitled             Physiologische Untersuchungen
tiber die Entleerung der Reservestoffbehiilter."J               Making use in the
main of Hansteen's method of experiment, Puriewitsch examined,
amongst other seeds, the isolated endosperms of Zea Maya, Triticum
sativum, Hordeum distichon, Secale cereale, and Oriza sativa, and he
extended his observations to the cotyledons, bulbs, rhizomes, and
roots of various other plants, a list of which is given in his paper.

         Endosperm of Hordeum vulgare during Germination.                7
In    the case of maize he found the first indications of action in the
cells lying next the scutellum, and this gradually extended along tho
periphery of the endosperm until, within fourteen or fifteen days,
this was completely emptied of its contents, with the exception of a
few cells in the central portions.  He states that this action is not
dne to any direct influence of the plaster, as suggested by Griiss,.
since it takes place also in contact with water only.      In the coty
ledons of Lupinus the depletion      takes place even with greater
rapidity than in normal germination, and no difference is observed
whether the cut surface in contact with the water or gypsum, as the
case may be, is on the side adjacent or opposite to the axial organs.
With the isolated endosperms of maize and wheat, on the other
hand, Puriewitseh states that the case is different, since self-deple
tion proceeds much more rapidly through the surface originally in
contact with the scutellum than it does from the opposite side.    Tho
author also    found   that
                          the depletion of the endosperm is much
retarded in the case of maize and wheat by the presence iu the
water of 2 per cent, of dextrose or glycerine, or by 3 per cent, of
cane sugar, and that it is completely     arrested by 1*5 per cent, of
sodium chloride or potassium nitrate.    The results on the whole are
regarded as contradicting  the conclusions   of Brown and Morris that
the endosperm is merely an inactive storehouse of reserve material,
and    Puriewitseh considers   that   this is further borne out by the
behaviour of isolated endosperms in an atmosphere of water and by
the action of anaesthetics  such as ether and chloroform. Under these
latter conditions, he states that the endosperms of maize and wheat
remain unchanged,      but that the depletive action recommences as
soon as the disturbing influences          are removed.     Attempts were
made, by applying     food   material   in  the form of weak sugar solu
tions, to induce a re-deposition of reserve material in the self-de
pleted tissue.    These attempts were wholly unsuccessful in the case
of maize and wheat, but the emptied cotyledons of Lupinus albus and
Phaseolus multificrus, the bulbs of Hyacinthus          orientalis, and the
rhizomes of Curcuma      amada    and  Iris germanica were all capable of
re-forming starch within their cells.
   It will be noticed that in the recent work of Hansteen, Pfeffer,
Griiss, and Puriewitseh, there is a general agreement that the amyli-
ferous cells of the endosperm of the Grasses have a definite power of
digesting their reserve materials, this power being entirely inde
pendent of any influence of the embryo, and the only necessary con
dition for its exhibition being that the products of metabolism shall
not be allowed to accumulate within the endosperm.           The conclusion
is, in fact, that the starch-bearing endosperm-cells are still living
unite, just as are the cells of the cotyledons of Lupinus, Phaseolus, and
 Bicinus, which are admitted on all hands to have self-depletive power.

•8      Messrs. Brown and Escombe.            On the Depletion  of the
    As these conclusions are in many respects opposed to those arrived
 at by one of us a few years ago, we have considered it necessary to
 institute a further series of experiments, and to re-examine the
 whole question of the mutual dependence of the embryo and endo
sperm.     In doing this we have endeavoured to free our minds of any
 bias which might,, even unconsciously,          have been given by our
 previous   experiments,   and   to subject    those experiments     to  the
strictest possible criticism.
    Broadly speaking, the question resolves itself into a consideration
of the various causes at work in bringing about the solution of t he
reserve material of the seed in preparation for its absorption by the
6cutcllum of the yonng plant, and the due apportionment of this
work to (1) the embryo itself, (2) the amyliferous cells, and to (3)
the peripheral cells of the endosperm, the so-called
                                                          " aleurone-layer "
or " Kleberschicht."
    In addition to this, we have to take into account the possibility of
 some of the changes being brought about by enzymes pro-existent in
the amyliferous cells, which may be altogether independent of the
present life of the cytoplasm.        We have, further, to determine the
part played by micro-organisms           accidentally brought into action
during   the  experiments,  and   to  eliminate  the changes due to their
influence alone.
   In work of this character we can only attain to results of any
value by a great multiplication of experiments             made in such a
manner as to admit of the close and frequent comparison of different
series performed under every conceivable variation of conditions.
   All our new work was conducted on barley only, and the reuults
are based on very many hundreds of experiments, extending over a
period of more than twelve months, during which time various
possible sources of error were gradually excluded.
    As long as we confine our attention to intact seeds the disturbing
influence of micro-organisms is but small, but the case is different
when the seed envelopes have to be cut through and the embryo
removed, the endosperm, thus bai-ed and deprived of its protective
coatings, being then open to the attack of bacteria and moulds,
 which thrive in the culture-medium employed, and by their action
 induce changes in the contents and cell-membranes of the endosperm-
cells which it is almost impossible to distinguish from those initiated
 by the cells themselves, supposing them to be living and active
units.
    At  the outset of the investigation we spent a considerable time in
 endeavouiingto find some antiseptic agent possessed of such a differ
ential action as to inhibit, or at any rate to materially retard, the
 growth of micro-organisms, whilst not interfering with the normal
growth of vegetable      organs.     Many various     reagents  were tried,

         Endosperm of Hordeum vulgare during Germination.                  9
 commencing with extremely dilute solutions, which were gradually
 increased in strength until their influence on the germinative power
of the seed was just perceptible.           The germicidal effect of such a
solution was then tested on degermed grains in water-culture. At
one time     extremely dilute solutions of formaldehyde and of acid
 potassium fluoride offered some hope of success in this direction, but
neither of these substances on further investigation gave a sufficient
differential action to be of any practical use.
   In the experiments of 1890 (Brown and Morris, loc. cit.) the dis
turbing effect of micro-organisms was minimised by restricting the
time of the experiment as far as possible, and by sterilising the
culture-media, and we have seen that Hansteen relied on killing the
adherent germs with a solution of copper sulphate, and on the
employment of strict antiseptic methods, even to the extent of carry
ing out all the operations in a germ-free atmosphere.
   We have made experiments in order to see how far such a treat
ment with copper sulphate effects sterilisation of the integuments,
the grain after such treatment being incubated in contact with vege
table infusions.     The results have clearly shown us that although
such a procedure     may retard the subsequent development of Bac-
teriacece and moulds, it is impossible       by means of it to ensure a com
plete destruction of all the germs adherent to the paleaj, unless the
treatment is sufficiently prolonged to destroy, or at any rate to mate
rially reduce, the germinative power of the embryo.
   Since any process which will affect the .vitality of the embryo
cannot be without some similar influence on the endosperm, there is
thus   introduced an element of uncertainty into all subsequent pro
cesses which maybe devised for determining whether the amyliferous
cells are living or dead.
   Extreme refinements for avoiding air-sown organisms are obviously
of little efficacy when complete initial sterilisation of the exterior of
the grain cannot be ensured.         Nevertheless, many of our experiments
have been carried on with precautions             of this kind, but have not
yielded better results than those made in covered dishes with sterili
sation of the culture-media and apparatus.
   In all experiments with endospermous seeds deprived of their
embryos both Hansteen and Pfeffer have, very properly, laid great
stress on the necessity for providing for a rapid removal of any
possible products of change iu the isolated endosperm as fast as they
are formed, but these observers have apparently entirely overlooked
the fact that this was fully insisted upon and provided for in the
earlier experiments described by one of us in 1890.*                The plan
adopted was to insert the proximal ends of the degermed grains
into small boles made in a thin mica plate, which was then floated

 10     Messrs. Brown and Escombe.                 On the Depletion     of the
on water in such a manner as to just immerse that portion of the
endosperm which had been in contact with the embryo.
    This method really affords much greater facilities for outward
diffusion from the endosperm than does Hansteen's plan of fixing the
degermed seeds on small columns of plaster partially immersed in
water, and it is also free from the objection of any possible disturb
ing influence due to the solubility of the plaster.                 Moreover, the
mica-raft    method     is   easier   of manipulation,     and  whilst  giving per
haps better facilities for sterilisation, also allows the detection of the
very first appearance of micro-organisms.
    The barley used in our experiments was Hordeum vulgare (var.
distichon), derived from two sources.              One, with which most of the
work    was  done,  was    a  well-matured    Chilian    barley, of the Chevalier
type, the other an English Chevalier barley grown on light land in
Northamptonshire,        both samples being well matured and well har
vested.
    It will   be convenient in the first place to consider the visible
changes     which   can be induced in the endosperm when this is com
pletely deprived of its embryo, and is put under such conditions as
to ensure the speedy removal of any soluble and diffusible products
which may result from any self-digestive processes initiated by any
portion of the endosperm tissue.
    Some of our experiments on this point were made in the following
manner    : —
    The grain was, in the first place, steeped from one to two hours
in a 1 per cent, solntion of copper sulphate, and after being
washed with sterilised water was steeped, also in sterilised water, for
a period of from twenty-four to forty-eight hours.                 From the corns
selected for experiment the paleas and embryos were then removed
with antiseptic precautions, this process being conducted in a glass-
fronted sterile operating chamber, furnished with " sleeves."                    The
degermation was performed with a small scalpel, taking care to
thoroughly remove all traces of the scutellum, and to lay bare the
                     "
"depleted layer of the endosperm.*
    The isolated endosperms were then put in position in small holes
made in a very thin mica-raft which was floated on sterilised water
in a Petri's dish, or in a glass vessel of somewhat similar construction.
   * The nature and origin of this " depleted layer " can only bo understood by fol
lowing the developmental     history of the endosperm and embryo, and this lias been
so fully described in the Brown and Morris paper of 1890 (loc. cit.) that it requires
but a passing notice hero.    The "depleted layer" is made up of several thicknesses
of cell-membrane,   which originally formed part of the amyliferous cells of the
young immature endosperm.         During the later stages of development of the grain,
and some time before maturation, the contents of these cells are used up for the
nutrition of the young embryo, but the cell-membranes persist and become squeezed
 together by the gradual encroachment of the scutellum.

          Endosperm of Hordeum vulgare during Germination.                     11
     In those   cases where comparisons had to be made between endo
 sperms     treated  in different ways the mica-rafts were made to carry
 twelve corns, the two series of six each being placed on either side of
 the raft. In this manner there was an exactly equal chance of the two-
sets being infected to the same extent by extraneous organisms, an
 important condition, which often enabled us in a long series of
experiments to differentiate changes due to the influence of organ
 isms from those due to other causes.                Latterly we found these
extreme antiseptic precautions unnecessary for the reasons already
 given,   and we also found it undesirable to previously steep the grain
 before   degermation, since the embryo may readily begin to func
 tion slightly during the softening process, especially when the
 temperature is high.          In such cases there is a danger of the projec
tion of a small quantity of enzymes from the embryo into the
proximal portions of the endosperm, and these enzymes, after de
germation of the grain and the floating of the endosperms on the
rafts, may give rise to certain changes in the endosperm which may
be wrongly attributed to a self- digestive power of the endosperm-
cells themselves, whereas they have a different origin altogether.
    It is true that this source of error may be minimised by reducing
the period of steeping, and by keeping the temperature of the water-
low ; bnt it is much more satisfactory to degerm the grain whilst still
in its dry resting condition, a process which does not present any
difficulty.     It must, however, be performed with the aid of a lens, so
as to ensure the complete removal of the scutellum and the whole of
its limiting epithelial layer.
    If endosperms thus treated are soaked in water for from' twenty-
four to forty-eight hours, and are then transferred to the perforated
mica- rafts in such a manner as to immerse the whole of the depleted
layer, we observe the following changes to take place.
    Within two or three days from the commencement of the experi
ment the peripheral, tripartite layer of the endosperm, the so-called
"                     "
   aleurone-layer        (" Kleberschicht "), shows an increasing tendency
to separate from the adjacent amyliferous cells.              This is noticeable
in the first instance at the proximal end of the endosperm, on the
dorsal side,* where          the " aleurone-layer
                                                      " is
                                                            intersected by the
 "depleted layer,"       and  whilst it is to some  extent   traceable for some
distance round the periphery towards the ventral fold, it extends
much more rapidly in a distal direction along the dorsal side.
 Where there is this megascopic indication of the separation of the
 "
   aleurone-layer," it is always found that the amyliferous cellsr
 immediately underlying,t show indications of change.                 In the first
    * The  dortal side is that immediately opposite the ventral suture. The terms
 froximal and diital are used with reference to the position of the embryo.
    t The outermost layer of the r.myliferous portion of the endosperm consists of

12     Messrs.   Brown aud Escombe.              On   the   Depletion of    the
place, the cell-contents    become hyaline in appearance, owing to the
protoplasmic      matrix  losing   its granularity and acquiring a refrac
tive power approximating to that of the embedded starch-granules.
Later on these hyaline portions imbibe water and swell up enor
mously, ultimately becoming very elastic and ductile, and capable of
extension into sticky, stringy masses, very similar in appearance to
the gluten of the wheat-endosperm.          "We shall in future refer to this
               "                       At the same time the cell-membrane
 change as gluten-formation."
 of the peripheral starch-cells swells up considerably, and as the
 action progresses the cell-walls undergo disintegration, with all the
 indications of cytohydrolysis as described by Brown and Morris.
     It is to this cytohydrolysis that the separation of the " aleurone-
         " is due, and the
 layer                         disintegration due to this cause proceeds
 centripetally into the endosperm and extends round the periphery
 nearly to the ventral fold, whilst it advances more rapidly in a
 distal direction on the dorsal side. The extent to which this cyto
 hydrolysis has proceeded is always evidenced megascopically by the
 reduction of the endosperm-contents to a " mealy " consistency, but
 even after the lapse of seven or eight days the actual amount of
 depletion is small, as long as micro-organisms are absent, or present
 only iu comparatively small numbers.          If, however, as is frequently
 the case, masses of Bacteriacece in the zooglcea-state attach them
 selves to the mutilated surface of the endosperm, a very distinct
  removal of some of the endosperm-contents may take place.
     The erosion of the starch-granules is generally not very pronounced
  under these conditions, but when it does occur it always commences
  at the same point as the cytohydrolysis, that             is,
                                                         on the dorsal side,
 at the angle of intersection of the " aleurone-layer " and the
  ''depleted layer," and extends distally just as does the cytohydro-
  lytic action.
      The starch-erosion produced in this manner under the "aleurone-
  layer" is, in the main, very different in character from that observed
  immediately under the scutellum of           agrain germinating normally
   with its embryo attached. Whilst in the latter case the action com
  mences by the formation of numerous minute " pits," this pre
  liminary pitting    is rarely observable in the eroded granules lying
  under the "aleurone-layer," which show the production of large
  rifts, and a general concentric dissolution of the various layers.      We
  shall in future refer to these different modes of attack on the starch-
 cells differing in general appearance from the more deeply seated cells. They are
 smaller, are packed with far smaller starch-granules, and the proportion of starch-
 granules to proteinic contents is less. These peripheral cells constitute the youngest
 part of the starchy endosperm, and may be regarded as having been arrested in
 their development by the falling off in the supply of formative material at the
 period of maturation.

although occasional instances may occnr whero one form of attack
merges insensibly into the other, yet, looked at generally, they differ
so   much from each other as to suggest that the transforming agents
are essentially different.
    The accompanying       photographs (Plate 1) illustrate these differ
ences far better than can any mere description.
    It appears to us that the phenomena which are observed when the
endosperms of Hordeum are deprived of their embryos, and are
treated in the manner we have described, must be attributable to one
or more of the following causes : —
    1. They may be the result of micro-organisms originating in the
culture-medium,      and gradually invading the endosperm- tissues,,
which undergo progressive alteration either by the direct action of
the   organisms or in virtue of their secreted enzymes projected into-
the endosperm.
   2.  The phenomena may be due to residual enzymes, cytohydro-
lytic, amylohydrolytic, and proteohydrolytic, left in the endosperm at
the time of maturation and desiccation of the grain.
   3. They may be dae to the revival of metabolic activity of still
living cells of the endosperm when these are placed under favourable
conditions of moisture and temperature, and facilities are afforded for
the removal of the products of change.       If this is the correct solution
the active cells may be those of (a) the
                                              " aleurone- layer," or
                                                                      (6) the
amyliferons portions of the endosperm.
   We must now consider these three possibilities in detail.
   We have already stated that, no matter how careful we may be in
sterilising the apparatus and cultnre-medium,           the appearance of
micro-organisms is only a question of time, unless we employ anti
septic methods of so drastic a nature as to seriously imperil the-
vitality of the endosperm-tissue,        a course which would render it
impossible to get the answer we require as to the respective parts
played by organisms and by autouomous changes in the endosperm-
cells themselves.      We can, however, arrive at certain conclusions by
making     a large number    of experiments and by confining our observa
tions to the period prior to the appearance of organisms, a period
which, under favourable circumstances, may extend to about eight
days.     When this is done we find that the changes originating in the
first place under the
                         " aleurone-layer " of the degermed seeds so far
precede in point of time the appearance and multiplication of the
Bacteriacece and moulds as to render it in the highest degree improb
able that the two sets of phenomena are causally related to each
other.
    A much     more satisfactory proof of the truth of this proposition
 may be obtained      in an entirely different manner.       Endosperms of

 14      Messrs. Brown and Escombe.               On the Depletion    of the
barley which have been degermed in the dry state are, in the
 first place, steeped in a saturated aqueous solution of chloroform
for twenty-four hours. After having freed the endosperms from
¦adherent moisture, they are warmed gently for a few hours in a flask
connected with a water-pump, and are then steeped for a further
period of twenty-four hours in running water, every trace of chloro
form being thus removed.            The endosperms are then floated in the
usual manner on a mica-raft, alongside other degermed endosperms
which have been merely steeped in water for forty-eight hours. The
two sets of endosperms are thus under exactly similar conditions as
regards their liability to attack by micro-organisms, and if the
described " sub-aleuronic changes of the endosperm are due solely
                                "
to the direct or indirect influence of extraneous organisms the same
results ought to bo given by the two series, whereas, if the vitality of
¦any portions     of the endosperm is a determining factor, evidence of
this ought to be forthcoming, since ono set of endosperms has been
under conditions which would completely arrest the vital functions
of any of their component cells.*
     When such an experiment is performed we find very considerable
differencfis between the two sets of endosperms at all stages. Whilst
the series merely steeped in water go through the ordinary cycle
previously described in detail, the series made up of the chloroformed
endosperms show no internal changes for a considerable period of
time.     In the latter case the " aleurone-layer," which so speedily
separates under ordinary conditions, retains its unbroken continuity
with the subjacent amyliferous cells, which in their turn preserve
their cell-walls and cell-contents intact.          Until the growth of micro
organisms has progressed to a very considerable extent the endosperm-
contents of the chloroformed grains show no meeascopic or micro
scopic change, except in the direction of a more hyaline appearance
of the contents of the starch-cells, a change which is apparently the
first stage of the "gluten-formation," to which reference was made in
a,n   earlier part of the paper. There is neither cytohydrolysis nor
amylohydrolysis apparent in the tissues until the micro-organisms
which have attached themselves in a zoogloaa state to the outside of
the " depleted layer" have attained to a very luxuriant growth, and
even then the tissue-changes differ in some important particulars
                                           "
from those produced in a " living            endosperm. It is in fact possible,
    * In our earlier experiments it was assumed that a treatment with chloroform-
water, sufficient to destroy the vitality of the embryo, would also be sufficient to
kill the aleurone-cclls. This, however, is not the case, the embryo being much
moro sensitive to the chloroform than I he peripheral cells of the endosperm.   We
have satisfied ourselves, however, that a twenty-lour hours' cteeping of the dry
endosperms in chloroform-water at a temperature not less than 15° C. will perma
nently destroy the functionating power of all the cells of the grain.

        Endosperm of Hordeum vulgave during Germination.                     15
 by such comparative     experiments,    to differentiate   with certainty the
modifying action of micro-organisms from the autonomous              action of
the endosperm-cells     themselves.
   The action due to extraneous      organisms always commences at the
                  "
surface of the      depleted layer," the cell-membranes of which this is
made up being softened, swollen, and ultimately disintegrated.             This
cytohydrolytic action then gradually extends to the membranes of
 the amyliferons cells, and the proteid contents of the cells are also
involved in the change, which ultimately permeates the whole of the
endosperm.
   There is, however, a striking difference between the mode of pro
gression of this bacterial action from that observed in
                                                                     " living "
degermed      endosperms.     In this latter case, as we have already
noted, the action is essentially centripetal,         commencing under the
                    "
'aleurone-layer       on the dorsal side, where this layer is intersected
         " depleted layer," and extending peripherally and axially, but
 by the
more rapidly on the dorsal side.           In the degermed "dead" endo
sperms, on    the  otber hand,  there  is no differential progression of this
kind, since the action, whilst progressing in an axial direction, does
not extend more rapidly along the peripheral than the central parts,
and does not show the slightest teudency to more rapid extension on
the dorsal side, a tendency which is so strongly marked in "living"
degermed endosperms in water-culture, or in intact grains of barley
undergoing ordinary germination. It is only when the disintegra
tion of the endosperm-contents        under the action of micro-organisms
has proceeded to a very considerable extent that any notable amount
of erosion of the starch-granules is observable.          This sometimes does
not occur for many days, a fact probably due to the bacteria not
secreting any special starch-dissolving enzyme as long as they are
well supplied with readily assimilable            food material from other
sources.
   So  far the conclusions are altogether opposed to the view that the
normal phenomena of endosperm solution and depletion, as they
occur in degermed endosperms in water-culture, can be explained by
the action of extraneous micro-organisms.              It is true that, under
certain circumstances, the mixed growths of Bacteriaceiv which attach
themselves to the mutilated surface of the endosperm can induce
changes in the subjacent tissues by the projection into them of
certain enzymes, the products of their growth, but this action can,
with due care, be clearly differentiated           from the normal action,
which is of quite a different character, and must be in some way self-
induced    by the endosperm-cells     themselves.
   Before considering how far the normal changes are dependent on
the   vitality of any particular portion of the endosperm, we must
inquire if the phenomena are in any way due to enzymes pre-existenc

 16       Messrs. Brown and Escombe.                 On the Depletion  of the
in the endosperm-cells, and this inquiry is the more necessary since
we know that even the distal portions of the endosperms of the
barley-grain contain a certain amount of a feeble diastase, and in
most cases also a distinct amount of a cytohydrolytic enzyme.*
    In the first place we satisfied ourselves that both the amylohydro-
lytic and cytohydrolytic enzymes of barley are not appreciably
weakened in their respective actions by a saturated aqueous solution
of chloroform.f           A number of grains of barley were degermed,
and, after being softened by a sufficiently long steep in chloroform-
water, were placed in the usual manner on a mica-raft, which was
floated on water kept fully saturated with chloroform during the whole
of the experiment.           Under these conditions bacterial growth was
quite     inhibited,   as was  also any antonomous action due to the endo
sperm-cells, but the pre-existent enzymes, on the other hand, were
allowed full play to produce any alterations of which they were
capable.
   Not even the feeblest action           of any kind could ever be detected
in the endosperm-tissue placed under these conditions, even after
the lapse of several weeks, and we must therefore regard such
experiments as fatal to the view that pre-existent enzymes exercise
any appreciable influence in bringing about the well-marked and
definite changes in the endosperm such as we have described.
   We are thus led to what appears to be the only conceivable expla
nation remaining, — that the phenomena are dependent on the meta
bolic activity of some portion of the endosperm itself ; and if this is
the case, it follows that during normal germination the endosperm is
not wholly passive, but takes some share with the embryo in prepar
ing the reserve materials for the use of the young plant.
   It now remains to ascertain how far it is possible to localise the
particular part of the endosperm-tissue which is active in producing
these changes, au inquiry which resolves itself into an examination
of the respective functions of the
                                              " aleurone-layer " and amyliferous
cells respectively.
    The observations of Tangl.J and more recently those of Haber-
landt, have shown that each of the
                                               " aleurone-cells " possesses

plasm with the usual reticulation of              fine  strnnds, enclosing a well-
defined nucleus, and presenting all the usual cytological evidences
of activity. As far as we are aware, no one who has ever carefully

   t  The9e    facts were determined by estimating the diastatic and cytohydrolytic
powers respectively of extracts of the grain made under similar conditions, in the
one case with water only, and in the other with a saturated aqueous solution of
chloroform. The determinations of diastatic activity were made by Lintner's method,
and those of the cytohydrolytic by the times necessary to produce visible action on
the cell- membranes of thin sections of the grain immersed in the two liquids.

examined these cells during the germinative period has ever doubted
that they are actually living units.*
     The cytological evidence as to the state of the amyliferous cells
is not so clear, and we have been unable to find any record of a
systematic examination             of the appearances presented by their proto
plasmic contents.
     The difficulties of examination are, of course, much greater here
than they are in the case of the " aleurone-cells," owing to the
tightly packed starch-grains, which must be removed by some method
incapable of acting on the other cell-contents, which they completely
obscure.          The ordinary reagents which are used for this purpose,
snch as acids and alkalis, are quite inadmissible, and although much
better results are obtained with cold water extracts of malt, or of
animal pancreas, acting for some time at 40 — 50° C, there are objec
tions to both of these agents.            The malt extract often possesses some
cytohydrolytic power, -which acts on the more delicate portions of
the cell-membrane,             and destroys the coherence of the tissue, and
even when this objection is removed by previously heating the malt
extract to 60 — 65° C. for some time, malt-proteids are often preci
pitated in a finely granular form within the sections, and confuse the
results.
      An extract of animal pancreas is a very good solvent for starch,
but since this possesses slight proteohydrolytic power in feebly acid
solutions, there is a danger of solution of the protoplasmic matrix

 (Benger) is used, there is considerable precipitation at 40 —46° C.
     No such objections, however, apply to the use of diluted and
 filtered mixedf human saliva.             With the addition of a little thymol,
 to prevent putrefaction, this agent may be allowed to act on the
 very thinnest sections of seeds at a temperature of 46° C. (the
 optimum temperature for ptyalin) for many hours, without any
 change in the sections other than the dissolution of the starch.                The
 starch-granules dissolve very completely, leaving sharply marked
 lacuna? in the protoplasm, which can then be stained in any desired
 manner.
      In staining, we have used a mixture of iodine-green and fuchsine.
 With thia reagent the nucleus is stained green, and is strongly con
 trasted with the cytoplasm which takes up the red stain.

   When sections       of   the   starch-bearing portions of the mature
endosperm are thus treated, it is seen that the nucleus is either
extremely deformed, or, indeed, in many cases even completely dis
integrated.    That these appearances are not in any way due to the
treatment to which the sections have been subjected is clearly shown
by an examination of sections made from the endosperms of barley,
taken from the fields at different stages of development, when starch
is still being actively deposited within the cells.     In the early stages
of development the saliva-treatment gives sections in which normal
and well-defined nuclei exist, but as the grain approaches maturity
there is a corresponding senescence of the nucleus, resulting in the
appearances just described.
   It is interesting to trace the progress of this nuclear senescence,
which first commences in the more deeply seated and older cells of
the endosperm, gradually extending towards the periphery as the
period of maturation approaches.
   Just before complete ripening, the only well-formed nuclei which can
be recognised are those of the last row of starch-bearing cells imme
diately under the
                          " aleurone-layer."    Ultimately, unless some
unfavourable circumstances arise to prevent complete maturation,
these nuclei to a great extent share the fate of those of the more
deeply seated cells, but they are generally deformed to a less
degree.
   We shall at     a future time have more to say on this question as
regards other seeds and its connection with the particular nature of
the reserve products.       The point to which we now particularly wish
to draw attention is that the cytological observations indicate the
existence of a very marked difference between the nuclei of the
" aleurone-cells " and those of the amyliferous cells. There can be
no doubt about the functionating power of the former, whereas it
seems difficult to admit that the starch-bearing         cells can exercise
their full powers as living units after complete maturation, although
the destruction of their nuclei may not precludo all possibilities in
this direction.
   Nothing short of actual trial, however, can determine whether the
starch-containing cells of the endosperm retain sufficient vitality to
have any actiou on their own cell-membrane or cell-contents, and,
 with this object in view, we have conducted a number of experi
ments on large fragments of endosperm deprived completely of their
                                "
adherent " aleurone-layer after being steeped for twenty-four hours,
and placed under the usual favourable conditions for the rapid out
ward diffusion of any products of change.           For purposes of com
parison we also employed other similar fragments which had been
treated with chloroform-water for a sufficiently long period to effec
tually destroy any residual vitality, the chloroform being removed

io.   the same manner as described              previously when treating of   the in
tact endosperm.
  The results were in no sense doubtful. No risible changes of any
kind took place until micro-organisms had established themselves,
when dissolution of the cell-membrane       commenced.      Moreover,
there was the strictest possible parallelism, at all stages, between
     " dead " and the "          "
the                       living   endospermous fragments, using these
terms to express the state, at the commencement of the experiments,
of those fragments which had or had not been previously put under
conditions for extinguishing any residual vitality which their cells
possessed.    In this respect our later experiments have fully borne
out the statement of one of us in 1890* that the starch-containing
portions    the endosperm are unable to originate any visible changes
             of
in the reserves which they contain.
   Thus we must conclude that          to the influence of the "aleurone-
                                           it   is

well-marked changes which undoubtedly take place in the endo
sperm when this         separated from its embryo and placed under
                          is

important experiment of the 1890 paper, which at the time seemed
absolutely conclusive against the view that the "aleurone-layer"
 has any power of modifying the endosperm-contents.          Whilst in

20       Messrs. Brown and Escombe.                   On the Depletion     of  the
embryos on artificial nutrients, it was found, as we have already
stated, that it is possible to " graft
                                                 " the
                                                         embryo from one grain on
to the endosperm of another, and to obtain such close apposition of
the two surfaces, by means of binding with a loop of thin silver or
                                 "        "
platinum wire, that the graft develops into a young plant almost
as   readily as if it were still nursed by its own endosperm.                 This fact
afforded an opportunity of more closely studying the relative parts
played by the embryo and endosperm in producing the initial
changes in the reserve materials ; for it is evident that if a degermed
endosperm is subjected to some process which will with certainty
kill its tissue, and a living embryo "grafted" on this endosperm
will bring about in the reserve substances of the latter all the
changes incidental to normal germination, then the whole idea of
residual vitality in the endosperm-cells being a necessary condition
of germination would become superfluous.                       Experiments in this
direction were in the first place made by treating grains of barley
with chloroform-vapour for twenty-four hours, a course of treatment
which we now know must have been insufficient to have killed the
resting protoplasts ; it is, therefore, not to be wondered at that
             "            "
embryo3         grafted on ondosperms so treated should have grown
perfectly.      In a further set of experiments, also described in the
1890 paper, grains of barley were soaked in absolute alcohol for six
months, and after diying off the alcohol, soaking well in water,
and degerming, fresh embryos applied to the endosperms were
found to produce in them all the ordinary visible signs which
accompany germination.               This experiment was deemed to con
clusively prove that the degradation of the reserve products is con
ditioned by the embryo itself, and that the endosperm-cells do not
take part in it.
    We have now, however, every reason to believe that the " aleu-
rone-layer" was not killed by this drastic treatment with alcohol,
for we have found that these cells are much more resistant to in
jurious influences than the tissue of the embryo itself, and we have
seen cases in which even the embryo will sprout after the grain has
been immersed in alcohol for about four months.*
    We have recently found, in repeating and varying these experi
ments, that when the grain is immersed in a dry state in chloroform-
water (i.e., a saturated aqueous solution) a few hours suffice to

the resistance of seeds to absolute alcohol is very considerable, and that those of
Hordeum, although killed very quickly by alcohol of 50 per cent., require submersion
in  absolute alcohol for seven weeks before all germinating power is lost.      It will be
seen, from what has been said above      in the text, that the embryos of some grains of

clusions.
     In the following remarks we shall refer to those endosperms which
have       been thus treated with chloroform -water as "dead," whilst
those which have been merely soaked in water after degermatiou
 we shall regard as
                            " living."
              "              "
      When graftings of embryos are made on living and dead endo
 sperms respectively, and these are placed under favourable conditions
 for germination, very strongly marked differences are observable within
 a few days, both in the rapidity of growth and general appearance
of the two sets of embryos, and in the nature and extent of the
 concurrent changes in the endosperms.
      On the "living" endosperm the axial organs of the young
 plant develop freely, healthy rootlets are protruded, and the freely
 growing plumula has all the appearances of tnrgidity and firmness
 incidental to good nutrition.             Simultaneously with this development
 cytohydrolysis       commences         under   the " alourone-layer,"    and, whilst
                    "  depleted layer," progresses peripherally and distally
 attacking the
 along the usual path in the endosperm.                At the same time a distinct
 and sometimes considerable amount of starch-erosion                    is noticeable
 in the amyliferous cells immediately in contact with the " aleurone-
 layer" of the proximal end of the grain, but this is entirely of a
  "                   "'

       The phenomena presented by the                  grafting
 endosperms       are, on tho other hand, of a very different character.
  Here the embryo is evidently             under much less favourable conditions
  for healthy      growth,      since   the  young plant is much smaller, the
  tissues of its axial organs are flaccid, and there is very poor root-
  development. At the same time it is also clear that the embryo is
  deriving some nutriment from the dead endosperm and is increasing
  in weight, a fact which can readily be proved by a comparison with
  the development of excised embryos in water-culture on a porous tile.
       The internal changes which the dead endosperm itself undergoes
   when    in contact with the living embryo are very instructive, and a
  careful study of them enables us, with certainty, to distinguish and
  delimit the autonomous changes of the endosperm from those induced
   hy the embryo      itself.     Even after eight or ten days the dead endo
   sperms under these conditions            exhibit no softening or cytohydrolysis
   uf the tissues immediately                                "

    tliis layer remains firmly attached to the subjacent amyliferous cells.

We can in this      case    only detect a small amount of disintegration
                              " grafted "
immediately under the                     embryo, and even after eight or
ten days this is not found to proceed for more than 0'5 to 1 mm. from
the " depleted layer." There is a partial but very incomplete cyto-
                                                               "
hydrolysis of the cell-membranes constituting the depleted layer,"
and a similar imperfect action can be traced microscopically in the
amyliferous cells as far as the disintegration has proceeded. The
starch-grains of the amyliferous cells immediately underlying the
" depleted layer " show unmistakable signs of attack
                                                                   by normal sub-
           "          "
scutellar pitting without any admixture of that particular form of
erosion which is characteristic of the action of the "aleurone-layer."
    There can be no doubt that we here have further proof that the
embryo, by means of the secretion of enzymes from its scntellar
epithelium, is able to attack starch, and to assimilate the products of
its hydrolysis. Abundant proof of this fact was brought forward in
the 1890 paper, in which were described many experiments on the
artificial nutrition of excised embryos, and this fact has been amply
confirmed by Griiss in a series of very careful experiments he lias
recently described.*
    It will be remembered         that when embryos were cultivated on
gelatine in which starch-granules had been suspended, it was found
that a secretion of diastatic enzyme took place from the epithelial
cells of the scutellum, which manifested itself by erosion of the
starch, and that this erosion gradually extended to a relatively con
 siderable depth in the gelatine medium.             That this action does not
                                            " dead    "
proceed with the same rapidity in                       endosperms, on which
embryos have been grafted, is due to a great extent to the fact that
in this latter case the starch-grains are locked up in cell-membranes
which retard the diffusion of the highly colloidal diastase.                 Until
these cell-membranes        are broken down we have not the most favour
 able conditions for a rapid formation of soluble nutriment from the
 reserve materials, especially as the amyliferous cells appear to be
 devoid of any power of initiating such changes autonomously.                 One
of us was originally     of the  opiuionf  that  the   necessary cytohydroly tic
function resided in the embryo itself, and that it was manifested by
 the same epithelial cells as those which produce a very active form
 of diastase, but our more recent experiments have clearly shown that
this power of the embryo was much overrated, and that the greater
 part of the cytohydrol) tic process preliminary to the amylohydro-
lytic is due to the cells of the "aleurone-layer," the treatment to
which the grain was subjected in 1890 not having been sufficient to
completely destroy the vitality of these cells.
    This layer is the only part of the endosperm which can be recog-

nised as     taking part in the preparation of the food-material for the
embryo,      since   no evidence can be obtained of any changes being
initiated     by  the   starch-containing cells themselves ; in fact, the
highly disintegrated appearance of the nuclei of these cells would in
itself suggest they had ceased to function.
    If we were to limit ourselves to the observations on degermed
endosperms       in water-culture, we should conclude that the diastatic
                                            " is
function of the " aleurone-layer                   very small indeed, and this is
also apparently confirmed by the impossibility of demonstrating                    the
                                              "                    "
existence of such a function in the              aleurone-layer      when  we  employ
the methods which have been so successful in this direction in the
case of preparations of the scutellum.
    When the integuments with tho "aleurone-layer" attached are
perfectly freed from the starch-containing cells, and are placed face
downwards on starch-gelatine, we have never been able to obtain
 any evidence of action on the starch, and even when the preparation
 was made so as to       include a   layer of the amyliferous cells, which were
 kept moist on gelatine, no influence was exerted on the contained
 starch. Under these circumstances, however, there is an entire
 absence of cytohydrolytic as well as of amylohydrolytic action, and
 since    the former      is so well marked           in degermed endosperms in
 water-culture, we can only conclude                that   the separated " aleurone-
 layer" for some reason or other will not exercise its normal function
 in the same manner as the scutellar epithelium placed under similar
 conditions.
     It is also to be remembered          that in those cases where the endo
 sperm is in actnal contact with the embryo, either as in natural
                                        "              "
 germination, or as in the                 grafting       experiments, the special
                                    "               "
 changes induced by the               aleuronic         layer proceed much more
 rapidly than in isolated endosperms in water-culture, and this accele
 rated action is much more evident in the case of the diastatic than
 of the    cytohydrolytic action.
     It would appear, therefore, that although              one of the principal func
  tions of the
                   " aleurone-cells
                                      "  is to break     down   the cell-membrane of
  the amyliferous       endosperm, these cells also share with the scutellnm
  the power of eroding starch-granules.
      Owing to the different method of attack on the starch, it now
  becomes possible, for the first time, to discriminate one form of action
  from the other, but it is very difficult to apportion the part played by
  scutellum and "aleurone-layer"                respectively, for the amount of
  action of either depends          not     only on the enzymic intensity for
  equal areas of the two tissues, but also on the total areas facing
  the endosperm-contents in each case.
      Since the total area of the
                                              " aleurone-layer " is

   greater than that of the scutellar epithelium, the influence of the

  former may be as great or even greater than that of the scutellura
  in the early stages of germination, even if its specific enzymic in
  tensity is very much less.
                                                                            "
      There is another probable function of the " aleurone-layer which
  may indirectly be of great value to the seed.                 These cells, which
  undoubtedly contain living        elements,    constitute the outermost peri
  pheral layer of an otherwise dead endosperm, which, were it not for
  this protective sheathing of living cells, would be much more liable
  to the attacks of any of the micro-organisms              of the soil which suc
  ceeded in penetrating      the seed-envelopes.          It  is a noteworthy fact
  that the " aleuronic " cells are much more fully developed over
  those parts of the seed which may be regarded as devoid of life, and
  become very much more attenuated where they come into proximity
  with the embryo whose cells, owing to their activity, do not require
  an equal amount of protection.           In the case of barley the threefold

  stitutes a triple line of defence, which must be of some value in
  protecting the amyliferous cells against the hordes of external

                                     Addendum.
      Since writing the above we have for the first time seen the fall
  and expanded account which Puriewitsch has given of his work iu
  Pringsheim's ' Jahrbuch,' vol. 31, 1897, p. 1.
      His observations on the self-depletion           of  tho   endosperm    of the
  Graminex take account only of the erosion and dissolution of                    the
  reserve siarch.      He does not call attention to the equally                 im
  portant    and   necessary antecedent phenomena of cytohydrolysis,
  which admit of a determination of the " aleuronic " or peripheral
  origin of the autonomous changes and their mode of progression in
  the    endosperm.    Puriewitsch, in fact, regards every cell of the
  endosperm as capable of functioning as a depletive agent, whereas
  our own work points strongly to the conclusion that when an endo
  sperm is deprived of its embryo the subsequent chemical changes
  within it are initiated by the "aleurone-layer" only.
     It is correctly stated that such action commences near the scutellar
  surface, and extends peripherally under the "aleurone-layer";                  but
  the author explains this by the observations of Brown and Morris,
  and Griiss,* that the proximal half of the endosperm contains more

   Soon after Professor Zeeman announced his important discovery
that the spectral lines become sensibly'altered in appearance and con
stitution when the source of light is placed in a strong magnetic field,
I  determined to examine if the spectra of different substances are
equally or similarly affected, and also if the various lines in the
spectrum of a single snbstance are equally or differently affected by
the action of the magnetic field.     The investigation of these matters
was undertaken also with the ulterior object of determining if the
phenomenon, for the discovery of which we have to thank Professor
Zeeman, could be made to afford any new information, concerning
the corresponding     sets of lines in homologous      spectra or in the
spectra of substances belonging to the same group of chemical
elements — in fact, to determine if any new information could be
gleaned concerning those atomic or molecular vibrations which give
rise to the light emitted by incandescent matter, and thence to
approach more closely to a knowledge of the ultimate constitution of
atomic and molecular structures.
   For the purpose of this inquiry      I  availed myself gladly of the
opportunity afforded me of using the excellent Rowland's concave
grating mounted in the physical laboratory of the Royal University
of Ireland.    This instrument is of the usual type, having a radius of
21-5 feet, and  ruled with about 14,438 lines to the inch. It is fitted
with a camera box which takes a photographic plate 20 inches long and
2^ inches broad, so that a length of the spectrum equal to 19 inches
can be photographed       at a single exposure.      As a consequence    I
naturally decided to study the effect of the magnetic field on the
spectral lines by photography, rather than by eye observation, for the
latter, besides being applicable to the visible part alone, is more
liable to lend itself to the personal bias or the previously formed
opinions of the observer.       The photographic plate, on the other
hand, does not lend itself to the imagination of the observer, but
 gives a faithful record of the phenomena as they actually exist in
 the image focussed upon it ; besides it enables one to compare the
effects produced on a large number of lines under identical circum
 stances, a point of great importance.
    In the case of a phenomenon which exhibits itself as a very small
effect, and one which it is difficult to obtain and observe, it is natural

       and other Substances radiating in a strong Magnetic Field.              27
that some doubt should exist at       first as to what      it is that actnally is
presented to the observer     ; and that discrepancies should occur in the
statements    of different   observers    regarding the phenomenon now
 under consideration     is  not   surprising.      Thus while Zeeman dis
 tinctly states that he obtained a tripling of the spectral lines when
 the soarce of light is viewed across the lines of magnetic force, and
 a doubling when it is viewed along the lines of force ; yet these
 effects were obtained only after the theory of the phenomena pointed
 in this direction, and other reliable observers investigating the same
 lines have given expression to the opinion that when viewed across
the lines of force a doubling (like a reversal) or a broadening              com
bined with a doubling occurred.               So   far   as   I  am aware    most
 observers have failed to obtain distinct triplets when the light is
viewed across the lines of force, that is, they have not succeeded in
 separating the constituents sufficiently to enable them to decide what
 the exact composition of the modified spectral line is.             By placing a
 nicol's prism in the path of the light it has been determined that
 the central part of the modified line is plane polarised, and that the
 edges are also plane polarised, bat in a plane at right angles to the
plane of polarisation of the middle part.           Thus with the nicol in one
position tbe middle may be cut out, leaving the two border lines, and
with the nicol turned through a right angle the two border lines may
 be removed, leaving the middle portion alone.              It is to be remarked,,
however,     that observations of this nature, although they are in
accordance     with the supposition that the modified line is a triplet,
yet they do not absolutely prove tripling pure and simple.                For this
purpose it is necessary to obtain a magnetic field strong enough to
separate completely the constituent parts of the modified line, so that
each can be observed separately, without the complications               attending
 the overlapping of the others.
    By way of illustration and explanation of the foregoing remarks it
should be mentioned here that the observations which I have made
in a general survey of the spectra of several substances indicate the
existence of four types of effect,* which, although they easily har
monise as particular cases of one general type of effect, yet deserve
to be    noted, inasmuch     as they are the results        actually presented to
observation.     Thus when the source of light is viewed across the
lines of magnetic force some of the spectral lines are resolved into
sharp triplets, in which the constituent lines are distinctly separated
by clear spaces on the photographic plate.             In these the middle line
of the triplet is stronger than the side lines, and agrees with the
expectation that it should contain as much light as the two side lines
combined.      On the other hand, some lines are not resolved into
    •
      These matters are treated in fuller r'eJail in a paper communicated to the
 Hoyal Dublin Society in December,  1896.
                                                                        D  2

28    Mr. T. Preston.     On the Modifications    of the Spectra  of Iron
distinct triplets, but into what one may provisionally terra "quartets."
In  these the two side lines contain nearly all the light, while the two
middle lines are weak, but still very distinctly marked.         It may be
that these arise from a partial reversal of the middle line of the
triplet, and that they would consequently show as triplets but for
such reversal.     The middle line, of course, is the one which would
naturally suffer reversal in the layers of colder vapour, as it belongs
to the period of vibration which is uninfluenced by the magnetic
field — yet the appearance of the weak middle pair is not that which
one usually observes in the cases of reversal, nor in any case do the
photographs of the line free from the magnetic field show any sign
of reversal.
   It is interesting to notice in passing that the lines to which
attention has been chiefly directed by other observers, namely, the
D sodium lines and the blue line of cadmium of wave-length 4800,
belong to this latter class, and no doubt the difficulty of deciding as to
what really takes place, and the difference of opinion which has existed
are to be attributed to this cause. These lines do not resolve themselves
into sharp triplets, and if one wishes to observe a distinct and well-
defined triplet the violet line of cadmium 4678 or the violet line of zinc
4680 should be chosen.         Further, some lines show as doublets, or,
if we wish to state it so, as triplets from which the middle line has
completely disappeared — the source of light being still viewed across
the lines of force. Whether this is due to complete absorption of the
middle line in the outside vapour of the spark, or not, remains for
further investigation.    The observation of it, however, led me to the
subject of this communication,         namely, the investigation     of the
spectrum of    iron.   Finally, there are spectral lines   which   are only
slightly broadened, and others which are scarcely affected by the
magnetic field, even when this is strong enough to resolve other lines
of the same substance into triplets, of which the side lines are more
than half a millimetre apart, and visibly resolved on the photographic

    Viewed from the theoretical       standpoint, we have no reason to
demand     that all, or indeed necessarily any, of the spectral lines
should be resolved into sharp triplets when the source of light is
viewed across the lines of magnetic force.           For, in order that a
spectral line should exhibit itself as a characteristic triplet under
the influence of the magnetic field, it is necessary that the freedom
of vibration should be equal in all directions, and in this case the
intensity of each rectangular component will be the same.             Hence
the middle line of the triplet will contain as much light as the two
side lines taken together.     If, however, the vibrations are not equally
free in all directions the foregoing result will not hold, and it
becomes possible to have a triplet with a weak middle line or with

      and other Substances radiating in a strong Magnetic Field.         29
ont a   middle line, in -which case it shows as a doublet. For example,
if the  vibration is restricted to one plane, and if this plane sets itself
at right angles to the lines of magnetic force under the inflnence of
the magnetic field, then the component of the vibration in the direc
tion of the lines of force will be zero, and the middle line will vanish
from the triplet.     If, on the other hand, the whole vibration should
set itself parallel to the lines of force, then the side lines of the
triplet would vanish, or, in other words, the spectral line would be
unaffected by the magnetic field.         It is clear, therefore, that the
study   of the way   in  which the spectral lines are affected by the mag
netic field is likely to throw light on the character of the molecular
vibrations.
   The substance which one would expect to present peculiarities in
this way is iron, which, if it retains any of its magnetic properties at
the high temperature of spark produced between the terminals of
an induction coil, should exhibit some characteristic      behaviour in the
magnetic field.     I  was led to expect, indeed, that many, if not all, of
the   iron lines would be resolved into doublets rather than triplets
when the spark is viewed across the field.       I found it no easy matter,
however, with the magnetic field at my disposal to resolve the iron
lines into anything; in the first place, because the effect is much
smaller (about one-half) for iron than for the 4678 line of cadmium
or zinc, and, in the second place, because it is not possible to work
with the pole pieces of the magnet so close together when the spark
is passed from a solution of a salt as when it is passed between small
 metal electrodes.      But in the case of a highly magnetic substance
like iron the metal becomes almost unmanageable in a powerful mag
 netic field, and so it happened that in my first attempts I was not
 successful in resolving the iron lines into eitber doublets or triplets ;
yet even at this Btage I observed two or three lines converted into
 what I considered doublets.       Finally, I succeeded in resolving the
 vast majority of the lines of iron by enclosing pieces of iron wire in
 small glass tubes so that the ends of the wire protruded slightly from
 the glass where the spark occurred.           The pole pieces were then
 pushed up to touch the glass jackets, and the spark was thus obtained
 in a very strong field, in fact in a field strong enough to resolve the
 majority of the iron lines into distinct triplets, showing that these
 vibrations possess freedom in the magnetic field (at the temperature
 of the spark) ; but, in addition to this, other lines are observed as
 distinct doublets, and the appearance of these doublets is not that
 usually associated with a reversal.       In addition there are other lines
 in the spectrum of iron which are scarcely affected, if at all.
    It is important to remark that these differences of effect by the
 same magnetic field on the different lines of the spectrum of the same
  substance   are not shown     in any particular ascending or descending

order in the spectrum.   They may all exist in a single group of lines
of nearly the same wave-length, and the magnitude of effect, even in
the case of the lines which triple, cannot at present be stated to
follow any law. Such a law, if one exists, can be discovered only by
a complete survey of the spectra of various substances with a very
powerful magnetic field capable of wide limits of variation. Snch a
field I hope to possess in an electromagnet which is being built for
the purposes of further inquiry in this direction.
   In the meantime it may be taken as thoroughly determined that it
is untrue to assume that there is any such law as that the effect is
uniform for the various spectral lines of any substance, or that the
effect varies as the wave-length or as the square of the wave-length.
No doubt it may be possible in the future to divide the spectral
lines into groups such that the members of each group are similarly
affected ; and it may be that a certain homology may be found to
exist between the groups of one substance and those of other sub
stances, and hence the effect produced by the magnetic field may be
brought into line with those chemical and physical properties of the
elements which have already thrown them into periodic groups.
  I  am at present very hopeful that some law will be obtained in
this department for the phenomena attending the action of a mag
netic field on the radiation from a source placed in it, for the results
which I have already obtained show certain correspondences in the
effects produced on the spectra of allied elements as well as certain
recurrences of the same effect in the spectrum of the same substance.
   The amount of ground so far covered has not, however, been suffi
cient, nor indeed has my magnetic field been sufficiently strong, to
enable me to lay hold of any general principle controlling the
observed effects ; nevertheless a useful purpose will be served in pub-
lishing this preliminary statement, as it will, at least to some extent,
clear the ground for those who are at present considering the pheno
mena from a purely theoretical standpoint, and it may also to some
extent serve a perhaps equally useful purpose iu diverting a useless
expenditure of energy on the part of those who may be engaged in
formulating the laws of the phenomena without sufficient knowledge
of the facts.
   In conclusion I may mention that the spectral lines of air and
hydrogen are rendered diffuse by the action of the magnetic field.
The broadening here is not of the character exhibited by spectral
lines of metals in which the lines remain sharp though easily broadened,
but it is more of the character of a broadening produced by increase
of pressure of the gas.
   I may also add that the magnetic effect does not appear to be in
any way parallel with the pressure effect, that    is,
                                                     the displacement of
the lines caused by increase of pressure    in the gas surrounding the

   The photographs referred to in this communication were taken
with a spark source of light placed between the pole pieces of a good

this magnet        I
               was able to obtain a field of about 25,000 C.Gr.S. units,
and this separated the side lines of the triplets in the violet line 4678
of  cadmium to a distance of 0'56 mm. apart.     The same separation
takes place in the triplet given by the violet line 4680 of zinc, so
that in the case of these lines we may infer in round Dumbers that a
magnetic field of 20,000 C.G.S. units strength produces a difference
of wave-length of one Angstrom unit between the side lines of the
triplet, i.e., a separation equal to one-sixth the difference of wave
length between the two         D lines of sodium.         For iron the separation
is about       half this amount in the   case of several lines.

   Plane of Polarisation and the Zeeman Change of Frequency

   The rotation of the plane of polarisation of light in a magnetic
field is due to the velocity of propagation of light circularly
polarised in one direction being different from that of light circu
larly polarised in the opposite direction.  The Zeeman effect is due
to a difference   in the frequency of vibration of these circularly
polarised waves.    What is required is to connect the frequency of
vibration       with the velocity of propagation.*
     All modern theories of dispersion
                                     connect these two quantities.
The velocity of propagation of light in transparent media is now
universally considered to be determined in part by what may be

Ust year, 1 understand him to view the Faraday effect as due to a carrying round
of the light vibrations by matter rotations.  This is quite in accordance with the
view sometimes held as to refraction, namely, that it is due to the waves being pro
pagated through the molecules more slowly than through the ether. The dynamical
theory of these views is difficult on account of the smallness of the molecules
in comparison with the length of the waves.       M. Becquerel's view, as I under
stand    it,
          makes the Faraday effect depend on    achange of frequency of rotation of
the waves in matter rather than on their velocity of propagation,       and    conse

 quently quite at variance both with the commonly received theory and with the one
 pot forward in this note.

   called the syntony of the matter and light vibration8, and is conse
   quently dependent on the frequency of the matter vibrations. In
   most substances the dispersion is controlled within the visible
   spectrum by a great absorption band in the ultra-violet, this band
   representing a possible frequency of vibration of the molecules, i.e., of
   that part of the molecules which affects the ether, be it electrons or
   something which simulates the actions ascribed to electrons.           If
   owing to any cause this absorption band be changed in position, i.e.,
   the frequency of the molecular vibrations be altered, the dispersion
  of the medium will be changed, and with it the velocity of propaga
  tion of light within the visible spectrum.     Now Zeeman has shown
  that in a magnetic field the frequency of vibration of molecules
 producing light circularly polarised in one direction is different from
  that of molecules producing light circularly polarised in the opposite
  direction, and that consequently the absorption bands for molecules
  in a magnetic field for oppositely circularly polarised waves will
  differ.   Hence we conclude that the velocity of propagation of
 oppositely polarised waves within the visible spectrum will differ,
 and that is the Faraday effect. Hence these two phenomena are
 directly connected with one another, independently of any other than
 general     dispersion  theory, i.e., independently   of any theory of
 electrons, such as Lorentz has shown will explain the Zeeman
 effect.   If we introduce such a theory, and use it to explain the
 Faraday effect upon the lines now laid down, we arrive at the inter
 esting   conclusion that before the Zeeman effect was observed the
 Faraday effect would have shown that in the majority of substances
 we must assume the ether vibrations to be due to the motion of a
 negative electron.     In substances with a negative Faraday effect,
 such as some magnetic bodies, we may conclude either {a) the ether
 vibrations are due to a positive electron, or (b) the absorption band
 controlling the dispersion is in the ultra-red, or (c) the causo of the
 Faraday effect may be due rather to a difference of intensity of the
 absorption band for oppositely circularly polarised vibrations than
 to a difference of frequency.   This latter alternative is in some ways
 the most consonant with the usual theory as to the difference
 between paramagnetic and diamagnetic bodies.
     If we proceed to calculate what amount of Faraday effect might
 be expected from the observed value of the Zeeman effect, we are
 met by the difficulty of obtaining data. We require to know, for
some one or more substances, the amount of the Zeeman effect, the
amount of the Faraday effect, and the ordinary dispersion of the
substance for light.      The only gas (and it is only in gases that the
Zeeman      effect has been observed) for which the dispersion and
Faraday effect are well ascertained, is air, and for it the amount of
the Zeeman effect has not been published. In preparation, however,

tions which, upon Lorentz's theory as to the cause of the Zeeman
effect and Larmor's theory as to dispersion,     we may expect to
hold*
   Assuming, then, that the electric displacement in the medium is
partly due to the electric force and partly to the displacement of
electrons, we may write for its components in the wave face sup

These enable us to calculate the dispersion of the substance in terms
of the difference of velocity of propagation of waves of oppositely
circularly polarised light.
   To get approximate formulae in terms of quantities that can be
observed, we have the refractive index p = V0/V, when V0 is the
velocity in vacuo and p = 2?rV/X. Assuming that         is small, ie.,
that the dispersion is due to an absorption band far up in the ultra
violet, we get, writing p for ejm,
The second term on the right-hand side of this equation gives the
ordinary dispersion, while the third term gives the Faraday rotation.
The first term /i0 is given by
and   is,as Mr. Larmor has pointed out, composed of two parts, the
first being essentially refraction and the second dispersion.

   The discrepancy may be due to the fact that p is not the

get an accurate result by assuming that the Zeeman effect in zinc
can be used in calculating the Faraday effect in oxygen.                On the
whole    I think the calculation shows that what must be          a vera causa
for a   Faraday    effect  is  the  whole  cause  of it.   From  the mere fact
that rotatory polarisation is approximately inversely as the square of
the wave-length and consequently vanishes for long waves, it follows
that  it is essentially a dispersion phenomenon.

yellow flowers seem various shades of green, and purple flowers look
violet.    The same mistakes are made in sorting Holmgren's wools as
by the red-blind.
   Temporary violet blindness may be brought about by using a tank
of ammonio-sulphate         of copper.     While it lasts, violet wools look
black and purple flowers crimson, but the green foliage appears of a
richer tint than nsual.         The recovery from violet blindness is very
slow.
   Green blindness may be brought about by exposing the eye to
light through three thicknesses of green glass. The colour-scheme
of the landscape during this condition is that of a picture painted
with vermilion, flake-white, and ultramarine, variously blended.
   Purple     bliudness   may be      produced   by a combination      of films
stained     with magenta and aniline violet, by which the green is
absorbed.      During purple blindness the vision is practically mono
chromatic, no colour being visible but green.
   If one eye is rendered purple-blind and the other green-blind, the
observer sees all objects in their natural colours but with a curiously
exaggerated perspective           due to the difficulty of combining the
 images perceived by      one   eye with those visible to the other.

      General Appearance of the Spectrum during Temporary Colour
                                 Blindness.
   A large spectroscope, in -which only about a tenth part of the
spectrum is visible at once, is directed to the sun, and the slit opened
till the illumination is as intense as can be borne. After the eye has
been sufficiently fatigued the results are observed in a single-prism
spectroscope in which the entire spectrum is visible.
   The following parts of the spectrum, namely, the red from A to B,
the green from the neighbourhood           of E, the blue about half-way
between     F and  G, and   the violet  at  and beyond H, produce well-
defined and characteristic results, whereas the intermediate portions
of the spectrum produce resnlts intermediate in character.
    That is to say, while exposnre to red light causes changes affecting
the red, aud exposure to green light produces corresponding changes
in the green, yellow light, instead of causing corresponding changes
in the yellow, affects the whole of the red and the whole of the
green, the total change being equal to the sum of the changes due to
excitation by red light and by green light separately.
   The effects produced by each of the four above-mentioned colours
differ in degree but not in kind.
    (1) In each case all direct sensation of the colour used for
fatiguing the eye is lost.
    (2) There is produced a positive after-effect of the same colour by
which the hue of all other colours is modified if they are relatively
weak, but which is unnoticed if they are bright.
    (3) The temporary abolition of any one colour sensation is with
out effect on the intensity of the remaining colour sensations.
    (4) Any two or any three of these four colour sensations can be
simultaneously or successively exhausted.
    (5) The positive after-effect of red is very transient ; that of
green lasts longer and is more noticeable ; that of blue is still more
powerful and persistent ; and that of violet is strongest and lasts a
long while. As the positive after-effect subsides the colour sensa
tion returns, but the positive after-effect becomes unnoticeable long
before the colour sensation is restored to its full strength.
    (6) During the process of dazzling the eye the observer is con
scious of the progress of the change, but only realises the extent of
his colour blindness on attempting to examine a less brilliantly
illuminated spectrum.
    The positive after-effect does not in these experiments pass through,
cyclic changes of tint as after-images appear to do under other con
ditions.

                  On  artificial temporary Colour-blindness.                    87
  Examination    of the Phenomena with a Spectroscope          of Wide Dispersion.
     Green blindness was produced        by the spectroscopic method already
  described.    When the exposure was complete the slit was closed
  until the Fraunhofer lines were sharply defined.                All sensation to
  green was lost, the red appearing         to meet the bine in the centre of
  the field.   The position of the junction of these two colours could be
  varied considerably by exposing          the eye to strong red or strong
  bine light, thus showing that the red and blue overlap.                But violet
  light had no effect upon the position of the junction                of red with
 bine.
     Similarly, during blue-blindness, the green and violet were seen to
 overlap, exposure to green light shifting the junction towards the
 green and vice versa.        Red light had no effect on the position of
 the  junction of green with violet during blue-blindness.
     The phenomenon of flickering* visible between the red and the
 green of a highly magnified spectrum, is also seen at the junction of
 red   with blue during green-blindness, and of green with violet during
 blae-blindness,    as well as at the junctions of green with blue and of
 bine   with violet under normal conditions.
     The   author has succeeded by an exposure               of three minutes to
 light from between H and K in blinding the eye to violet without
 affecting the blue, the real hue of which is thus seen, unaccompanied
 by any    other colour sensation.
     These   experiments lead to the conclusion that no one colour-
sensation     is related to any other in the sense indicated by Hering.
 Each may be exhausted without either weakening or strengthening
 the others.     The observed facts are, in the author's opinion, more
 in accordance with the Young-Helmholtz theory, but they imply the
existence    of a fourth colour sensation, namely, blue.
             Examination of    the Colour Sensations      of 109 Fersone.
    The tests employed were Holmgren's wools, supplemented by gela
tine   films stained with various colours, Hering's method of coloured
shadows, and the author's spectroscopic method, which was applied
to   seventy normal cases in the       following manner.
    Using the large spectroscope        referred to, with the slit narrow so as
to give a comfortable         degree    of illumination, the observer selects
those portions of the spectrum          at which he sees a marked change of
hue.      He then looks at the red between A and B for thirty seconds,
and at a given signal traverses the spectrum rapidly, stopping at the
first  of these changes.
    Next he looks at the green for thirty seconds before turning to the
                         • ' Physiol. Soc. Proc.,* June, 1897.

second change of hne. Again, after looking at bine for thirty seconds
he seeks the third change of hue. The next step is to trace the
violet to its limits. After this he works through the spectrum back
again, fatiguing the eye with violet before finding the blue, and so
on, ending with the determination of the limits of the red.                 The
degree   of fatigue  is so  slight  that  he  is quite unconscious  of it.
   The seventy cases examined in this way agree as to the number
and mean position of the changes of hue, but they may be divided
broadly into those whose colour sensations overlap and those whose
colour sensations do not overlap, i.e., those who find the changes of
tint occur in the same place when working from red to violet as when
returning from violet to red.
   The first class includes persons both educated and uneducated
whose avocations require them to compare colours.              The second com
prises all who fail with the closer shades of Holmgren's wools.
Details are given of some in whom the green and violet are so far
extended into each other that they see practically no pure blue, and
it is suggested that these, and other differences in the relative
intensity and extent of the colour sensations may account for the
divergence of opinions among writers on the subject.                 The paper
concludes with an account of five cases of red-blindness.
"On the Connection between the Electrical Properties                       and
      the Chemical Composition of different kinds of Glass."
      By Professor Andrew Gray, LL.D., F.R.S., and Professor
      J. J. Dobbie, M.A., D.Sc. Received February 7, — Read

   The experiments and results described in the following paper are
a first instalment of work we have undertaken with a view to finally
determining,     if possible, the circumstances which affect the con
ductivity and specific inductive capacity of glass. It appeared from
some experiments which were carried out by Professor T. Gray and
ourselves some years ago,* that it might be of interest to have a
number of glasses specially made up with a view to testing some of
the conclusions then arrived at.
   A result previously obtained by Professor T. Gray had shown             that
potash and soda lime glasses have a higher conductivity than                flint
glasses  ; this result had also been arrived at by Dr. Hopkinson.              In
particular   it seemed    desirable  to  ascertain   whether  by increasing  the
amount of lead oxide and diminishing the amount of soda, the con
ductivity would go on diminishing.                We have experienced great

             Electrical Properties and Chemical Composition.             33
difficulty in getting glasses made according to our own specifications.
We endeavoured to make the glasses ourselves, and several experi
ments were made accordingly, both in the laboratories here and at
the Ogwen      Tile Works, where a large furnace had been erected for
the construction     of tiles from slate dust. Some success was achieved,
but it was found impossible, without the expenditure of far more
time than could be spared, to obtain the glasses in a condition suit
able for the experiments we wished to carry out.
   Through the kindness, however, of Messrs. Schott & Co., of Jena,
and of Messrs. Powell & Sons, Whitefriars, London, we have recently
obtained a number of specimens of glass all richer in lead than the
specimens formerly available, and, further, in some cases practically
free from soda.      We have also had made to order by Messrs. Schott
specimens of their own glass, used, we believe, chiefly in the con
struction of thermometers, as well as of a barium crown glass,
which have not hitherto, so far as we are aware, been experimented
with.
   Determination of Conductivity. — The method of experimenting
followed was practically the same as that described in the paper
already referred to, but its natnre may perhaps here be indicated.
   Owing to the large percentage of lead oxide in some of the glasses
prepared for us by Messrs. Schott, it was found impossible to blow
them into flasks, and they were therefore cast into plates ; the
arrangements therefore required some modification for their case.
   The specimens which were in the form of flasks were filled up
with mercury to the bottom of the stem (which in most cases was
about 8 or 9 inches long), and the flask thus filled was sunk in a
bath also    containing mercury, so that the mercury was at the same
level   inside and outside.       One terminal of a circuit containing a
battery of about thirty secondary cells and a very sensitive galvano
meter was connected to the mercury within the flask by a wire pass
ing down the neck, while the other terminal was connected to the
mercury    in the bath.
   The galvanometer was the instrument formerly used and described
in ' Roy. Soc. Proc.,' vol. 36, p. 287.      It was carefully insulated, as
 was  also the reversing key, and all necessary precautions were taken
to make sure that the current passing through the galvanometer
was that passing through the walls of the flask between the mercury
coatings.     Thus   it  was always verified that no deflection took place
when the wire was withdrawn from the flask and placed round the
outside of the neck.           This test obviated the possibility of the
 existence   of any disturbing film of moisture on the surface of the
 glass.    The bath could be heated to any temperature required in
 the experiments.
    The conductivity was calculated from deflection of the galvano

   meter produced by the current through the glass, the area and thick
   ness of part of the specimen in which the current             flowed, as
   described in the former paper.
      In the capacity measurements the plate or flask, as the case might
   be, was supported as described above.      A quadrant electrometer was
   kept connected    to  the plates of one of Lord Kelvin's air leydens.
    This was charged with twelve secondary cells, and therefore to a
   difference of potential of about 21 volts.   After the battery had been
   removed a reading was taken of the electrometer deflection, and
   then the specimen was connected for a very short interval of time aa
   a condenser in parallel with the leyden.
      This connection was made by means of a myograph pendulum
   which, when freed, swung over a considerable arc to a catch which
   prevented it from returning. At its lowest point a metal piece pro
  jecting below the bob touched the top of a tongue projecting upwards
   from a hinge at its lower end, and leaning against the point of an
   adjustable screw.    The connection between the two condensers thus
  only   endured   while  the three pieces, the screw, tongue, and bob,
  were in contact.     This was only the interval of time required for a
  pulse of flexure to travel about a centimetre in a bar of steel about
  half a centimetre thick, and about a centimetre broad. The interval
  was reckoned as at most about 1/30,000 of a second.
      The plates were originally rather over a quarter of an inch thick,
  and after some observations of capacity had been made on some of
  them, and it had appeared that their resistance was too great to be
  measurable, thoy were cut down on a turning-table used for cutting
  slates, to a thickness of about 3 mm. ; they were then fixed on a bed
  of pitch, and ground down by hand to a thickness of about 0-24 cm.
  They were polished and properly cleaned, and then covered on both
  sides with a dense and thoroughly adherent coating of silver. This
  was cut away for a space of about half an inch round the edges.
  Great care was taken to remove every trace of silver, and to make
 the edge thoroughly clean.
     While being experimented on, the glass plate was laid with one
 coating of silver resting on a plate of copper at the bottom of an
 iron bath. Another plate of copper was laid on the upper coating
 of silver, and kept down with a weight, and the connections of the
 battery circuit, described above, were made with the copper plates.
 The iron bath was placed within a larger bath partly filled with
sand, so that the temperature could be raised by heating the outer
bath from below.
     The results of the experiments are exhibited in the table which
follows.     We have there given the density, specific resistance,
specific inductive capacity, and chemical composition of each speci
men experimented on.

42     Prof's. A. Gray and     J. J. Dobbie.     Connection between
   The resistance was taken after five minutes' electrification in each
case.    The "Jena" glass (XXIV of the table), in both resistance
and capacity       experiments, showed very considerable           effects of
dielectric polarisation, which were a very long time in disappearing,
though the conducting coatings of the flask were kept short-circuited.
The dielectric polarisation of the lead glass made by Messrs. Powell
was also considerable.
   On the other hand      it is very remarkable that the barium glasses
XXIII,     in the capacity experiments, showed little or no sign of
polarisation effects ; and we propose to make some further investi
gations of the physical properties of this glass.
   In our previous paper the results obtained with eight different
samples of lead glass were compared, and it was shown that the
electrical conductivity fell off almost quite regularly as the amount
of lead oxide increased, and increased with an increase in the amount
of soda.     The glass which possessed the highest speciBc resistance
 (8400 x    10'" ohms) contained 40'5 per cent, of lead oxide, 7'5 per
cent, of potassium oxide, and 21 per cent, of sodium oxide.              Both
of the lead glasses dealt with in this paper contained a still higher
percentage of lead oxide, and were almost free from soda, and the
electrical resistance was so great as not to be measurable.          It is, of
course, impossible    to say how   far this result is due  to the increase of
lead oxide, and how far to the elimination of soda. With the view
of definitely settling this point, Messrs. Powell and Sons have kindly
undertaken to prepare for us a glass exactly similar to XXI, but
having the potash replaced as nearly as possible by the equivalent
amount of soda. It should be noticed that the amount of foreign
matter (i.e., of ingredients other than silica, lead oxide, and alkali)
present in glasses XXI and XXII is very small, and is less than one-
 fourth of the amount present in the purest glass previously tested,
 which was also, it may be mentioned, the glass possessing the high
est resistance.
    It is noteworthy that the barium glass         XXIII    has a very high
 resistance, and in this respect behaves more like lead than lime
 glasses, which have usually a low resistance.        It is impossible, how
 ever, in view of the somewhat complicated composition of this glass,
to say how far the high resistance is due to the presence of the
 barium, and how far it may be influenced by other ingredients,
 especially the boric acid, which was not present in any of the glasses
 previously examined by ourselves or others.
    The " Jena" glass XXIV has a low resistance, as was to be anti
cipated, from its high percentage of soda and complex composition.
    The chemical composition of glass XXI is capable of being
expressed with tolerable accuracy by a simple chemical formula, and
this is also in accord with previous experience, which pointed to the

                Electrical Properties and Chemical Composition.             43
   conclusion   that a glass, which approaches in composition to a definite
   chemical compound,      has a high resistance.
      Our knowledge of the chemistry of glasses is still very imperfect,
  and we cannot say in what way the silica is distributed amongst the
  bases.    We give, therefore, merely the relative number of formula
   weights of each oxide present, calculated from the analytical num
   bers, after allowing for the elimination of traces of foreign matter.

     This glass is essentially a lead potash glass mixed with a very
  small quantity of a lead soda glass.        Allowing for the small quan
 tity of manganese oxide, arsenions            oxide, and other impurities
  present, and eliminating the soda and a corresponding            quantity of
  silica, calculated on the assumption that each formula weight of soda
 is in combination with three of silica, we obtain as an expression for
 the composition of the lead potash glass

"On    the Magnetic Deformation of Nickel" By E. TAYLOR
      Jones, D.Sc. Communicated by Professor Andrew Gray,
      F.R.S. Received February 8,— Read February 17, 1898.
   On a former occasion a paper -was communicated to the Royal
Society* containing an account of some measurements of the mag
netic contraction of a nickel wire, and a comparison of these with
the values deduced from Kirchhoff's theory.                  It was there shown
that the most important      term    in   the   calculated   value of the elonga
tion of a long wire of soft magnetic metal is represented                        by
£H(eI/£P), where H is the magnetising                field and   61 the increase of
magnetisation produced by a small increase of longitudinal tension
£P per unit area.     The results showed that the observed contraction
in nickel was much greater than the calculated value.                  It was then
sought to establish an empirical equation which might represent the
observed effects, and it was found that the difference between the
observed and calculated contraction was approximately proportional
to the fourth power of the magnetisation.
   It was suggested to me at the time that this result should                     be
tested by repeating the experiments under different conditions                    in
order to find out whether it was generally true.

                   On the Magnetic Deformation     of Nickel.             45
    In offering the following       results, I wish again to say that the
 measurements were made         in the Physical Laboratory of the Univer
 sity College of North Wales,         and that I am greatly indebted to
 Professor A. Gray for providing me with the apparatus, and allow
 ing me the time necessary for the experiments, and for many valuable
 suggestions.
    Preliminary experiments were first made to find the nature of the
 influence of temperature       on the magnetic contraction.      The appa
 ratus was essentially the same as described in the former paper,
 with the addition of a spiral tube and burner for heating the water
just   before   it entered the coil.     The temperature of the water on
 entering and     leaving the coil was indicated by two thermometers
inserted in capsules through which the water flowed.              When the
 water was warmed         and allowed to flow for some time, the two
 thermometers indicated steady temperatures differing generally by
 about 2° C.
    The change     of length was magnified by the same lever arrange
ment as    before, and observed by a telescope, scale, and mirror. A
few   trials showed that it would be impossible to make any measure
ments when      the water was warmed unless precautions were taken to
remove    air dissolved in the water, for this, on being liberated in the
heater,   ascended in bubbles through the coil and disturbed the appa
ratus so much that no readings could be taken.          To prevent this, the
water was made to flow into a vessel through a pipe near the top,
and escape by a pipe near the bottom,          whence it proceeded to the
spiral heater.      A tall glass tube projected upwards from the vessel,
and   the vessel   was heated by a Bunsen flame.        The dissolved gases
were thus liberated in this vessel, and, collecting at the top, escaped
at intervals up the glass tube.         By this means the apparatus was
rendered     steady enough     to admit of readings at moderately high
temperatures.       Further, by regulating the supply the water could be
made    to stand    at any level in the glass tube.       Thus the flow of
water through the coil, and hence the temperature of the coil could
he controlled.
   The glass tube was about 6 feet long, and by raising the level of
water   in it through   1  foot the temperature    of the coil was lowered
byaboutl°C.
   Observations of the change of length were always made at night,
generally    between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m., the apparatus never being
sufficiently steady in the daytime.
   The nickel wire was the same as that used in the former experi
ments, of length 83'4 cm. between the terminal brass pieces, and
mean diameter T65 mm.             This was re-annealed before the present
measurements.
   A number of observations        were then mad9 of the change of length

and corresponding field strength on several nights in July and August,
1897, the temperature        indicated by the coil thermometers being
about 20° C. As before, the temporary and residual contractions
were measured separately, the total contraction corresponding to any
field strength being obtained as the sum of the temporary effect
(observed as an elongation when the current was broken), and the
residual effect observed by first demagnetising the wire by reversals,
then quickly making and breaking the current. It was found that
the curves thus obtained were not the same on different nights, but
showed a continnal diminution of contraction as time went on. This
is probably due to a slow hardening of the metal which seems to go
on for some time after the wire has been annealed.                 The effect of
this change can be seen by comparing Tables               I (column 2) and     III
(column 4), which contain values of the contraction of the wire in
millionths of its length for a series of fields, observed about the
middle of August, 1897, and at the end of December, 1897, respec
tively.* The wire was annealed on July 3, 1897.
   In order to observe the effect of a change of temperature on the
magnetic contraction at any field strength it was necessary to take
readings at two temperatures immediately after one another, so that
the results would not be affected by the above-mentioned time effect.
This was done on several nights and with several field strengths, the
two temperatures used being about 20° C. and 55° C. The results
showed that at low'fields (up to about 90 C.G.S.) this rise of tempera
ture of 35° C. caused an increase, at higher fields a diminution, of
contraction ; and if the temperature was then lowered back to 20° C.
the contraction returned to its former value.
    Table 1 contains values of the change of length in millionths and
corresponding field strength at the two temperatures, determined on
two successive nights, the effect at both temperatures being observed
at the lower fields on one night, and at the higher fields on the next.
Each field was reversed several times before readings were taken,
and the wire was demagnetised on each night while the tempera
ture was being changed.           The curves representing these results
 (contraction, field) have the same general form as was described in
 the former paper, but the temporary contraction is here considerably
 greater, though the residual contraction is much the same as before.
 The effect of temperature is chiefly seen in the temporary contrac
tion : the residual effect, however, appears to be slightly less at the
 higher temperature at all fields.
    On referring to Professor Ewing's 'Magnetic Induction in Iron
 and other Metals ' (§ 114, p. 169),        I   find that rise of temperature
 causes increase of magnetisation in nickel at low fields and diminu-
   * The temperatures on the two  occasions  differed by ahout 10* C, but the effect
 of this would be comparatively small.

tion    at high fields. Change of temperature, therefore, seems to have
similar effects on the magnetisation and contraction curves.               Of
course this comparatively small difference of temperature,            35° C,
would have hut a small effect on the magnetisation curve, but as the
contraction seems to depend on rather high powers of the magnetisa
tion, it might be expected that the effect would be more noticeable
in the change of length than in the magnetisation.
     Measurements were next made of the magnetisation and the effect
of change of tension on the magnetisation, in order to calculate the
quantity
                         0 123     0 00587         el
                         lb^-I+-lbT-IH+*H5P
 which was        shown   in the former paper to be the value of the
elongation, till, of the wire deduced from Kirchhoff's theory.            For
these measurements a coil of 611 turns of No. 40 double silk-covered
 and shellacked copper wire was wound en the nickel wire near the
 middle, and connected in series with a ballistic galvanometer, and
 with the secondary of a standardising solenoid.         The magnetisation
was determined by reversing a measured magnetising current, and the
 galvanometer standardised by reversing a current in the solenoid,
 the deflections being observed in the two cases.        The galvanometer
 was standardised before and after each set of readings.
     Since the resistance in circuit with the galvanometer changed
 when the temperature of the coil on the nickel wire changed, care was
 taken that the temperature indicated by the coil thermometers was
 the same in the magnetisation         and standardising experiments.      By
 using a series of different enrrents in the standardising       coil, it was
 verified that the
                         "                         "
                           quantity of electricity    flowing through the
 galvanometer was proportional to the sine of half the deflection of
  the needle.      The deflections were observed by a telescope and scale
  at a distance of 124 cm.
     In observing the influence of tension on magnetisation, galvano
   meter readings     were taken first with a load of 1'4 kg. on the wire,
  then after an additional weight of 7 kg. was applied.           The mag
  netising current was reversed several times and the load ap
  plied and     removed several times before readings were taken. This
  was    repeated for various field strengths, ranging between 30 and
  320 C.G.S., and with the coil at 10° C. and 55° C.          Then the mag
  netisation    curve of increasing reversals was determined for the
  mean     load 4-9 kg. at both temperatures, after which the coil was
  removed from the nickel wire, and observations            made with load
   4'9  kg., and at the same two temperatures, of the magnetic contrac
   tion   at a number of increasing field strengths, each field being
   reversed several times before readings were taken.

48                           Dr. E. Taylor Jones.
    In order to make allowance for the slow time-change in the pro
perties of the wire, the determinations          of magnetisation and effect
of change of tension on magnetisation              were then repeated, the
nickel wire being rewound         with  the  same  number  of turns of insu
lated copper wire.
    Finally, the contraction     of the wiro was onco more determined      at
the temperature 10° C.
    Values of the expression       (1) were calculated from both sets of
magnetisation      observations,  and the mean of the two sets compared
¦with the actual contraction     observed between them.
    The results are shown in Tables II, III, IV, V, VI, in which values
of all the quantities (obtained from the corresponding curves) are
given for the same set of field strengths.
    In Tables II, IV, the first column contains values of the field
strength H, the second the magnetisation I at load 4 9 kg., the third
the change of magnetisation          el accompanying an increase of load
of 7 kg., the fourth the corresponding values of expression (1), t'.e.,
the calculated value of Hjl. The numbers in the second, third,
and fourth columns were determined in November, 1897.              The fifth,
sixth, and seventh columns contain values of I, £1, and Sl/l, deter
mined in January, 1898.
    Tables   III  and V contain values of the field, the mean values of     I
and fljl calculated from Tables           II  and IV, the actual change of
length a in      millionths,  observed about the end of December, 1897,
 and the difference    (a—cljl) between the observed and mean calculated
elongations.
     Finally, in Table VI are given the values of I and eZ/Z, measured in
 January ; the mean a of the actual changes of length observed in
 December and in January, the latter being determined after the
 second set of magnetisation           measurements;    and the difference,
  (a— tl/l), representing the corrected elongation at the time when the
 second set of measurements of I and el/eP was made.
     Tables  II  and IV show the nature of the slow time-change in the
 magnetic behaviour of the nickel wire, the magnetisation at any
 field and load being less in January than in November.
     The effect of this change on el/eP is very marked at low fields,
 though slight at higher fields ; el/eP appeal's to diminish rapidly at
 low fields, as time goes on. This is remarkable, because the magnetic
 contraction at low fields seemed to change but slowly with time, and
 more rapidly at higher fields.
     The change of length observed in January was nearly the same as
 in December (about four week3 earlier). At medium fields it was
 rather greater, but this may be due to a slight annealing caused by
 the repeated warming and cooling during the determinations of the
 magnetisation earlier in January.

                                                and V, shows again the
nature of the influence of temperature on magnetisation and contrac
tion, but as the measurements at the two temperatures were not
made quite at the same time, the results probably do not accurately
represent this influence.
   If the results given here are compared with those given in the
former paper, it will be seen that the magnetic contraction at any
field observed in December, 1897 (Table III), is practically identical
with the former value, but that the magnetisation curve is very
different from the former one. The present magnetisation is much
greater at low and medium fields, but about the same as before at
higher fields.   Further, the calculated value of the contraction                       is,
especially  at medium   and high fields, considerably less than before.
Hence the "corrected" contraction —         — cljl) cannot now be the
                                                    (at.

more nearly proportional to I6, as the last two columns of Tables III,
V,    and    VI      show.
     It is           to say how much this discrepancy
             impossible                                     due to the   is
slow change which appears to be always going on in the magnetic
properties of the nickel wire.    In the former experiments the mag
netisation was  determined first, and a short time after the elongation
was observed, but no allowance was made for any change of magnet
isation which might have taken place in the meantime.         Still,               it   is
improbable that that would entirely account for the discrepancy.
   Some of the above results are shown graphically in figs.                   1,   2,   3.

 " Upon the Structure and Development of the Enamel of
        Elasmobranch Fishes."                   By Charles S. Tomes, M.A.,
        F.R.S. Received February 7,— Read February 17, 1898.
                                        (Abstract.)
    The nature of the hard polished outer layer of the teeth of this
 group of fishes has been from time to time a subject of discussion,
some authors holding that it is enamel, whilst others deny its claim
to be so styled.
    The author describes            its physical, chemical, and histological
peculiarities,    calling attention        to its hardness, its optical properties,
its almost entire solubility in weak acids, and to its tubularity, in all
of which respects it resembles unquestionably an enamel.
    But it contains lacunar spaces, and presents a very distinct lami
nation, parallel, or nearly so, with its surface, in which respect it is
unlike an enamel.
    Still upon the balance of its characters it has much more in
common with enamel than with dentine, from which it is sharply
marked off by the entire absence of any collagen basis.
    It is also shown that the tubular structure, which may be regarded
as typical in these fish, passes by insensible gradations into a simple
tissue differing but little from an ordinary enamel ; this is especially
the case where the whole layer is thin, as in the Rays.                     But the
study of    its development      raises     the difficulty   afresh.

                   of the Enamel of      Elasmobrcutch  Fishes.             55
    Each dentine papilla forms upon its surface a specialised layer
which     is derived from spindle-shaped cells, sending out immensely
elongated      processes   which run nearly parallel with the surface.
There is a large amount of        intercellular substance formed so that the
cell processes     ultimately become inconspicuous, and a lamination or
fibrillation of this layer only remains ; in this stage it is exceedingly
resistant to staining.
    The layer is also permeated by cell processes which run through
it at right angles to its surface, and these persist.         It is found that
this layer is the site of the so-called enamel formation, the first
named cell processes       giving rise to its lamination, and the last men
tioned cell processes giving rise to the tube system which per
meates it.                                                 i
    In all mammals dentine calcification commences at the very out
side of the dentine papilla, and nothing at all corresponding to this
specialised layer exists at any period.
    But in the Elasmobranch fishes the calcification of the dentine,
whether it be an osteodentine as in Lamna or a fine-tubed dentine as
in most others, does not take place at the outer surface of the entire
dentinal papilla, but along the deeper side of the specialised layer,
thus soon cutting it off from any free communication with the body
of the pulp.
    This layer, in the extent to which it is developed, bears a ratio to
the thickness of the ultimate
                                       " enamel."   Over it lie the columnar
epithelial cells of the enamel organ, which present several peculiari
ties; they are found to grow to three or four times their original
size   quite suddenly ; that is to say, on one tooth germ they are small,
on the     very next they are enormous, and this is the tooth germ in
which the specialised layer has attained to its maximum.               Then on
the   next older germ the ameloblasts have fallen to their original size,
and have lost      their distinctness of outline.
    The great growth of these cells just at one particular stage of tooth
development, their subsequent immediate atrophy, and the fact that
their length bears also a direct ratio to the thickness of the enamel
 formed, renders      it impossible to suppose that they can      be function-
 less, and it is suggested        that  they  furnish  the lime salts for the
 calcification of the specialised layer of the dentine papilla before
 alluded to, there being difficulties in the way of supposing that the
 dentine papilla does so.
     In that case the disputed enamel layer of the finished tooth does
 not correspond precisely either to the enamel or to the dentine of the
 completed mammalian tooth, but is a joint product of the epiblastic
 enamel organ and the mesoblastic dentine papilla.
     The general conclusion arrived at is that, just as the whole teeth
 of the Elasmobranchs present the simplest known form of tooth

56              Mr. W. H. Lang.      On Apogamy and the
development, so do they also present the first introduction of enamel
as a separate tissue.
   In its first introduction it was a joint product, made under circum
stances which almost precluded any slow and gradual formation of
 an outer layer upon the teeth ; but in the further specialisation of
 teeth in reptiles and mammals the tooth germs sink more deeply into
 the submucous tissue, and are protected for a much longer time.
    The enamel organs become more specialised, and finally take upon
 themselves the enlire work of enamel building, manufacturing both
the organic matrix and furnishing it with lime salts, as unquestion
ably happens in mammal.';.
   And if these conclusions be correct, it would be quite justifiable to
call it enamel, even tbongh the dentine papilla has had a share in its
production.

   The two most important deviations from the normal life-history
of ferns, apogamy and apospory, are of interest in themselves, but
acquire a more general importance from the possibility that their
study may throw light on the nature of alternation of generations
in archegoniate plants.     They have been considered from this point
of view by Pringsheim, and by those who, following him, regard the
two generations as homologous with one another in the sense that
the sporophyte arose by the gradual modification of individuals
originally resembling the sexual plant. Celnkovsky and Bower, on
the other hand, maintain the view that the sporophyte, as an inter
polated stage in the life-history arising by elaboration of the zygote,
is not the homologue of the gametophyte, and is only represented in
a few thallophytes.     In the light of the theory of antithetic alterna
tion no weight is attached to apogamy and apospory for phyloge-
netic purposes.
   In the paper of which this is an abstract the results obtained by
caltivating the prothalli of a number of species of ferns under
conditions slightly different from the natural ones are described, and

    In addition to the species mentioned in the tahle above, cultures
 were made of crested and nncrested forms of Nephrodium Filix-mat,
 Rich., representing the three sub-species, which are sometimes
 distinguished        in this country.       Some of these (both crested and
 normal)     behaved     in  a   similar manner     to the species referred to in
 the table, though only one instance of apogamy induced by long
cultivation has         as  yet been found.        Others (crested and normal
forms) produced a single bnd on the under side of the prothallus
which did not bear afchegonia.
    Connecting this latter type of apogamy, which agrees with the
 description of De Bary and Kny, with the more normal prothalli,                     was
one variety, the archegonia of which developed into typical arche

              Development    of Sporangia   upon Fern Prothalli.           59
gonial     projections.   In the place of the projection nearest to the
apex a     vegetative bud arose.
    It is possible to draw some general conclusions from this series of
cultures.      It is a striking fact that in every one of the species,
 prothalli, which under normal conditions would have produced
normal embryos, became, after a longer or shorter period, apo-
gamous.       Further there was a general similarity in the changes of
form     end structure    of the prothallus, which preceded this result.
This form of apogamy, occurring after prolonged cultivation of
normal prothalli under special conditions, may be distinguished            as
induced apogamy, in contradistinction to direct apogamy, by which is
 meant the immediate production of vegetative buds by prothalli,
 which are usually incapable of being fertilised.        Both forms occur
in Nephrodium Filix-mas.
   The causes which appeared to induce apogamy in these prothalli
 were the prevention       of contact with fluid water which rendered
fertilisation impossible, and the exposure to direct sunlight.           Pos
sibly the temperature also had some effect. The case         of Nephrodium
Filir-mas shows that the variable condition of the sporophyte, as
indicated by cresting, &c, though possibly predisposing                to the
changes which lead to apogamy, does not stand in any necessary
connection with the phenomenon.
   That different degrees of apogamy are distinguishable was also
shown by these cultures.         The cylindrical process, arising from the
apex    of  the  prothallus, or from  its under surface, is to be regarded
simply as a modification in form and structure of the gametophyte
dependent on the altered conditions, and possibly a direct adapta
tion to these. The next stage is seen in cylindrical processes,
which, while bearing sexual organs, also produce isolated members
of a sporophyte (roots, ramenta, sporangia).          It is to be borne in
mind, however, that tissue differing from the re6t of the process
always occurred beneath the last-named structures.          The final stage
is the production of a vegetative bud capable of further growth as a
 typical sporophyte.       In this a series, leading from the bud arising
 by transformation      of the tip of a cylindrical prooess, to buds pro
duced on or in the place of archegonial projections, and from this to
 bnds situated on the under surface of the prothallus          itself, can be
 recognised.
   The readiness with which the intermediate form between gameto
phyte and sporophyte          and the early stages of vegetative buds
reassume the prothalloid form, is worthy of note, as bearing on some
 cases  of apospory.
    These    departures from the normal development of the prothallus
 are not regarded as reversions in the ordinary seuse, but as indica
 tions of the capability of direct response to altered conditions
                                                                  f  2

60    Apogamy and Development        of Sporangia  upon  Fern Prothalli.
possessed by the gametophyte.       Their possible importance in relation
to the theory of homologous alternation appears to the writer to be
of this nature. If that theory be true, the sporophyte and gameto-
phyte are modifications of a similar form.       The gametophyte, espe
cially the simple free-living prothallus of the Ferns, has departed
less widely from that form.       Such an organism as a fern prothallus
would therefore appear to be suitable for experimental work, in the
hope that its behaviour under altered conditions would afford hints
as to the sort of changes which, in the original algal form, led to
the evolution of the sporophyte.         The altered conditions in this
series of experiments are of a similar kind to those which are
assumed by Professor Bower to have occurred on the spread of
algal forms    to the land, and to have conduced       to antithetic alter
nation.
    The results may now be used in picturing the manner in which
alternation of generations might have come about by the modifica
tion of originally similar individuals into gametophyte and sporo
phyte.    It is assumed for this purpose that the sporophyte of the
vascular cryptogams did not arise by the elaboration of a structure
resembling     a bryophytic sporogonium.       It is recognised that the
theory of antithetic alternation, as elaborated by Professor Bower,
affords a consistent and satisfactory explanation, if the assumptions
necessitated by the theory are granted.       The present theory, which
is put forward merely as a provisional hypothesis, is founded on
another class of facts.
    With the spread of algal organisms to the land, where in the
absence of any vegetation affording shade, some at least would be
exposed to more intense illumination, the flattened form would
probably be assumed. Prolonged drought and the influence of direct
 sunlight, inducing direotly a change of form into a cylindrical
body, might be accompanied by the substitution of a reproductive
organ forming dry reproductive cells (spores) for those adapted to
 an aquatic existence.     The acquisition of more highly developed
 absorbent organs (primitive roots) would further the existence and
 growth of this modified gametophyte.        This spore-producing stage
 would at first follow the sexual stage in any individual exposed to
 dry conditions.    It is possible to imagine, however, how the asso
 ciation of the asexual with the sexual individual might come about.
 Absence of fluid water would prevent the liberation of motile spores
 from the zygote.     The latter would be obliged to germinate t'w situ,
 and the fact that it did so under dry conditions would tend to the
 shortening of the sexual stage, and the speedy assumption of the
sporophytic form and mode of reproduction. Prom the spore, which
would always separate from the parent, a sexual individual would
arise, since germination could only take place in a damp spot.          Aa

      Degenerative Changes in Sensory       End Organs of Muscles.      61
soon as,   with the increase in size and complexity of the spore-hearing
plant, a vegetation     capable of affording shade came into existence,
the conditions    suitable for the persistence of the more primitive,
alga-like, sexual stage in the life history would be present.          The
latter has, of course, also been modified in various ways.
   In the concluding portion of this paper, the theories of antithetic
and homologous alternation arc compared by considering the expla
nations they afford of the facts.      The general conclusion reached is
that, while both afford a possible explanation      of the facts of alter
nation   in archegoniate plants, any  evidence  which  would render one
or the other untenable is wanting.       The reasons on which either is
considered more probable      depend on the views held as to the lines
of descent which have been followed, and the degree to which the
different groups of archegoniate plants have had a common origin,
or represent actual steps in the process of evolution of the sporo-
phyte.     Under these circumstances the question must be regarded
as  an open one    until the available lines of evidence have been more
fully investigated.

Laboratory of the Royal Gardens, Kew, and subsequently carried on

  Experimental Observations on the early Degenerative Changes
       in the Sensory End Organs of Muscles." By F. E. Batten,
       M.D. Communicated by Professor Victor Horslet, F.R.S.
       Received February 17, — Read March 3, 1898.
                                (Abstract.)
   The    experiments described in the following paper were under
taken in     order to show, firstly, that degeneration occurred in the
first place in that part of the neuron most remote from the cell, and
secondly, to reproduce     within the muscle-spindle, if possible, certain
changes    which  had  been shown by the author to be present in the
case of tabes dorsalis in man.
    The method of experiment was as follows : —Dogs were selected,
 and the mixed roots of the 5th cervical to the 1st dorsal inclusive
 were divided, and the animals killed at the following periods after
 section of the nerve, viz., 24, 48, 72, 96, 120 hours, and 7 and 14
days.
    From the biceps muscle after being treated by Si tiler's method
 muscle-spindles were teased out ; some of these were mounted with
 out further staining, others were treated by Marchi's method, others
 were   stained by the Marchi-Pal    method.

62    degenerative   Changes in Sensory   End Organs of Muscles.
    The normal niuscle-spindle showed the existence of a spiral form
of nerve termination in connection with the large nerve fibre that
passes to the equatorial region of the spindle, this spiral nerve
termination is shown to wind round a muscle fibre, which at this
point contains large cells, at one point completely filling the muscle
fibre and interrupting the striation, but tailing off in either direc
tion so that the cells come to lie in the centre of the muscle fibre.
It is then shown that in twenty-four hours after section of the nerve
changes may be seen in this spiral termination, and that in forty-
eight hours after section of the nerve the spiral is no longer recognis
able, oval and elongated granular cells now making their appearance.
Changes then appear in the large intramuscular cells. The musculo-
spiral nerve was then examined in three parts of its course, (1) in
the muscle, (2) at its entrance into the muscle, (3) near its origin, at
various periods after section of the nerve.   No obvious change could
ba found in the nerve till between the fifth and seventh day after
section of the nerve, and at that time degeneration was as marked
in the central portion of the nerve as in the peripheral (Marchi and
Marchi-Pal methods were used).
   The existence of a spiral form of nerve termination has already
been described     by Ruffini as encircling a muscle fibre, and other
authors refer to a spiral within the muscle-spindle; but it has not, I
believe, been shown that the spiral encircles the largo intramuscular
cells first described by Kiihne.
   Early degeneration was first described by Cattaneo in the nerve
termination in the musculo-tendon organ twenty hours after section
of the nerve.       Both these investigators used the gold-chloride
method, in the present research Sihler's method has been used.
   The results of the research have been to show —
   (1) That within the muscle-spindle a spiral form of nerve ter
mination exists suiTounding a fine muscular fibre, in the centre -of
which are large, clear, non-nucleated cells.
   (2) That changes take place in the spiral in twenty-four hours
after section of the nerve, and that such changes become marked in
forty-eight hours.
   (3) That degeneration of the medullated sheath of the nerve takes
place in the whole course of the nerve at the same time after section
of the nerve.
   (4) That no fatty change could bo demonstrated in the intra
muscular cells by the Marchi method similar to those found in the
case of tabes dorsalis in man.

                                 (Second Paper.)
     In  a paper communicated       to the Royal Society in the year 1879,
and printed in the Philosophical Transactions for 1880, I com
                          '                               '
pared the diurnal range of magnetic declination               and horizontal
force, as observed     at   the Royal Observatory,    Greenwich,  during the
 years    1841  to 1877,    ¦with  the corresponding numbers of sun-spot
 frequency    as determined    by  the late Dr. Rudolf Wolf, of Zurich. As
 I then said, I conceived that the long series of Greenwich observa
 tions, made throughout on the same general plan and with instru
 ments of the same kind, might be applied as a valuable independent
 test of the reality of the relation generally understood to exist
 between the phenomena in question.            And the comparison appeared
 to be distinctly confirmatory thereof.          For it was to be observed
  that, although the sun-spot period, commonly called the eleven-
  year period,    varied in length to the extent of several years, the
  corresponding magnetic periods varied in a similar manner. Still,
  in a case of this kind, in which the cause of the phenomena
  ohserved    has 'not been determined        or ascertained, it becomes im
  portant indisputably to prove the accuracy of the observed facts and
  of the inferenoe to which they lead. And if further observation
  shows that the phenomena continue to progress collaterally, the
  circumstance must eventually be accepted as indicating that between
  the two phenomena there exists a more or less direct relation which,
   in any theoretical consideration of the subject, could not he ignored.
   The previous paper, as mentioned, includes results to the year 1877,
   but the material since . accumulated, available now to 1896, happens
   to be especially interesting, and, contrasting in some respects with
   the earlier portion, is worthy of being made known, the series
   as a whole formiug one continuous chain of evidence that much
   strengthens the argument for relation. Apart, however, from any
    individual opinion on the matter, it is well that, so long as the
    phenomena observed remain without explanation, the facts thereof
    should be carefully set forth. I propose, therefore, to discuss the
    question anew for the whole period 1841 to 1896.
       It is unnecessary to say anything in explanation of the results
    given in the previous paper. I will therefore proceed to describe
    the new work, extending from 1878 to 1896.            As before, the mean

    Magnetic Declination and       Horizontal Force and Solar Spots.         65
  diurnal range of declination in each individual month is taken to
 represent     (relatively to other months) the magnetic energy of the
 month,     and similarly for horizontal force.         By the mean diurnal
 range is to be understood a number formed as follows.               Means of
  the indications at each separate hour of the day being taken through
 a month,      (omitting days of extreme disturbance)           the difference
 between the     leasl and the greatest of the twenty-four mean values is
 the monthly mean diurnal range.           The numbers are obtained from
 the Greenwich        annual volumes, but those for the years 1895 and
 1896 not having been yet published, the Astronomer Royal has
 kindly allowed me to use them as necessary for the purposes of this
 paper. The very small correction for temperature required by the
 horizontal force results from 1878 to 1882 as printed, has been duly
 applied : beginning with 1883, the values are printed corrected for
 temperature.
    Thns     is obtained, both for declination and horizontal force,
results   strictly comparable with those of the previous paper, giving
 in all a series of results for fifty-six years.      In any graphical repre
 sentation of unexplained phenomena,             it is most important that
there should be ready reference to the numerical data on which it is
founded, to enable those who might wish to test the work the means
of so doing       withont great inconvenience, otherwise the graphical
representation alone can carry no proper conviction.             The numbers
for the years 1841 to 1877 are to be found in the previous paper; it
is therefore necessary to give here only the corresponding           numbers
 from 1878 to 1896.        These are contained in Table I. The numbers
for horizontal force are given, as in the previous paper, in parts of
the whole horizontal force taken as unity.            The relation in magni-
tade of the westerly force (declination) to the northerly force (hori
zontal force) will be understood by considering that one minute of
arc of declination corresponds        to 0-00029, that is 29 of the hori
zontal force unit of Table I.          Examining now this table, it will
be seen that there is an annual inequality in the magnitude             of the
diornal range, the summer          numbers   being much greater than the
wititer   numbers.        In  order,  therefore,    to estimate progressive
change,     it is convenient to form    a number for each month thst shall
 be free  of annual inequality, to allow the progressive change better
to appear.       Assuming the different months to be of the same length
this is done, as before, by taking the mean of each twelve consecu
tive monthly numbers, beginning successively with each individual
month,     first, say, with January, next with February, and so on,
taking   afterwards      the mean of each two consecutive numbers so
found, thus producing animal values free of annual inequality,
which may be presumed           to apply to the middle     of each successive
month.        The process is equivalent,     suppose     for the number for
                                                                   0  2

    66         Mi\ W. Ellis.    Relation   between  Diurnal Range of
    January, to adding together half the sum of the numbers for the
    preceding and following July, and the sum of the numbers for the
    intervening eleven months, August to June, and dividing the whole
    by twelve.    These new monthly numbers, each expressing an annual
    mean, are given in Table II, both for declination and horizontal
    force, and they are used with those of Table        II of the previous paper
    to form the two lower curves of the accompanying plate. I remarked
    in my previous paper that the indications of vertical force were for
   the present purpose not very manageable; several different instru
    ments had been employed, and the results presented anomalies.
    Certain beneficial alterations were, however, made in 1882, in the
   instrument still in use, since which time it has worked better.            It
   showed a maximum diurnal range in 1883, the descent to a minimum
   in 1889, and the subsequent rise to a maximum, although there
   remains still some degree of irregularity of action.
      As regards sun-spot frequency, Dr. Wolf's monthly values, as
   derived directly from observation, are given for the years 1841 to
   1877, in Table VI of my previous paper.            Those for the years fol
  lowing 1878 to 1896 are to be found in different numbers of his
  '
     Astronomische Mittheilungen,' the values in the later years, after
  the death of Dr. Wolf, in 1893, having been similarly prepared by
  Professor Wolfer, his successor at Zurich. I am not aware that
  these have been before given in a collected form; they will be found
  in the annexed Table III. For the purpose of smoothing the acci
  dental irregularities of these observed sun-spot numbers, Dr. Wolf
  treated them in the same way as the numbers of our Table I (expressing
  magnetic range) were dealt with to form those of Table II. Though
  the process was here employed for a reason different to that which
 rendered its application necessary in the case of magnetic range, the
 similarity of treatment happily makes the resulting numbers strictly
 comparable with the magnetic numbers.                The smoothed sun-spot
 numbers, from 1841 to 1876, June, are to be found in a table con
 tained in Dr. Wolf's paper,
                                     " Memoire sur la Periode commune a la
 Frequence des Taches Solaires et a la Variation de la Declinaison
 Magnetique."*         Those from 1876, July, to 1896, added in our
 Table III, have been in part taken from the ' Astronomische Mit
                '
 theilungen and in part calculated from the observed numbers con
 tained in the same table.       These smoothed values, with those of the
preceding series taken from the paper above mentioned, are used to
form the upper curve in the diagram of collected sun-spot and
magnetic curves.         It may be asked why the Greenwich magnetic
variations are not compared with the Greenwich sun-spot record.
But this record having been maintained only for some twenty years,
it was deemed better to adhere throughout to the long Wolf series

    Examination of the collected curves will, I think, show that the
extension of the period previously employed by inclusion of the new
resnlts, extending from 1878 to 1896, has produced curves that offer
striking points of interest.          Selecting the extreme points of the

The thick line shows the variation in length of the interval between successive sun-
      Bpot epochs, and the thin line that between successive magnetic epochs.  1 to 2,
      3 to 4, 4c, indicate intervals from minimum to maximum, and 2 to 3, 4 to 5,
      Ac, those from maximum to minimum.
    These numbers are represented in a graphical form in fig. 1. They
run so closely together that it became necessary, in the figure, to
diminish the magnetic intervals by one hour, otherwise much of the
magnetic curve would have fallen so near to the sun-spot curve as to
 become obliterated thereby.            The general similarity of the variations
 in length of successive magnetic and sun-spot intervals, alternately
 from minimum epoch to maximum epoch, and from maximum epoch
 to minimum epoch, is thus very clearly seen.                  When the variation
 of the magnetic interval is large, that of the sun-spot interval is also
 large, and -when the one is Bmall, the other is also small.
    The mean of the five intervals from minimum epoch to maximum
 epoch is for the magnetic effect 4"31y, and for the sun-spot effect
 4,18y; the mean of the four intervals from maximum epoch to
 minimum epoch is for the magnetic effect 7'15y, and for the sun-spot
 effect 7'40y. Whole period, for magnetic effect ll-46y, and for sun-

The thick line shows the variation in length of successive sun-spot periods, and the
      thin line that between successive magnetic periods. Odd numbers indicate
      periods from minimum to minimum, and even numbers periods from maximum
      to maximum.
magnetic and sun-spot periods, amounting to above three years, is
here well brought out.              Mean magnetic period ll'42y. Mean sun-
spot period W'bly.              These values differ slightly from those above
given, owing to the numbers becoming here combined in a little
different way. Fig. 2 suggests a suspicion that the period decreases
in length through several periods, then increases for several periods,
and so on.           But what may be the order of such variations is a
question to which at present it does not seem possible to give any
 reliable answer.
    Examining further the collected curves, it is seen that the maximum
points of the curves have at            different epochs very different degrees of
 intensity. If for each curve we arrange the epochs of maximum in
 order, with reference thereto, we find as follows : —

    In each curve the greatest and least maxima are those of 1870 and
1884    respectively, and the order in each case is similar excepting
for the epochs of 1848 and I860, which in horizontal force are
reversed in position, although otherwise falling in with the general
order of the other curves.      The horizontal force observations have to
be corrected for the effect of temperature (a correction not reqnired
for declination), and in the years 1848 and I860 the magnets were in
the original upper magnet room, in which the diurnal range of tem
perature was considerable, rendering difficult the determination of
the actual temperature of the magnet (a bar 2 feet in length), and
this may possibly account for the apparent displacement of the 1848
and 1860 epochs of maximum in horizontal force. In 1864 an under
ground basement was specially constructed for the magnets, in
which the variation of temperature         is small, and in this apartment
the magnets have since remained.          As regards the minimum points
of the curves, the sun-spots at the epochs of 1856, 1867, 1879, and
 1890 practically disappear, bnt not so at that of 1843, at which epoch
 ths most elevated of the magnetic minima, both in declination and
 horizontal force, occurs, being    so far in harmony with what has been
 pointed   out  as to the behaviour at maximum.
     Considering that the irregularities in the length of the snn-spot
 period    so  entirely synchronise with similar irregularities in the
 magnetic period, and also that the elevation or depression of the
 maximum points of the sun-spot curve is accompanied by similar
 elevations and depressions in the two magnetic curves, it would
 seem, in the face of such evidence, that the supposition that such
 agreement is probably only accidental coincidence can scarcely be
 maintained, and there would appear to be no escape from the conclu
 sion that such close correspondence, both in period and activity,
 indicates a more or less direct relation between the two phenomena,
or otherwise the existence of some common cause producing both.
 The sharp rise from minimum epoch to maximum epoch, and the
 more gradual fall from maximum epoch to minimum epoch, may be
 pointed out as a characteristic of all three curves.      The similarity of

  Magnetic Declination and Horizontal Force and Solar Spots.            71
the  little drop shown in all the carves in        1882  and 1883 is also
striking.
   Observation has been supposed to indicate that the magnetic effect
follows the sun-spot effect, so that a retardation, or what has been
called a " lagging," of the magnetic effect exists, but the evidence for
this has never appeared to me to be quite satisfactory.        The fewer
comparisons of sun-spot and magnetic epochs given in my first paper
seemed to give      support to such supposition.    But taking the more
extended comparison contained in the preceding table of epochs, it is
seen that the declination epoch is on the whole retarded by 0'18y (frac
tion of year), whilst that of horizontal force is accelerated by 0'05y.
Mean retardation = 0'06y. Looking at the irregularities in the num
bers on which these means are founded, it seems doubtful whether,
without a yet more extended comparison, any real difference or
definite lagging can be said to exist.     Two things, however, may be
noted.     One is, that the differences in the early part of the table are
inclined to positive, and in the later portion to negative values.
What    will happen when further results are included     ?  Considering,
however,    the strength of the evidence for some form of relation that
has been shown by what has preceded to exist, it seems in every way
probable that the individual differences of epoch represent in great
part accidental residuals.       Rather, indeed, is it not likely that to
some extent small differences or irregularities may be expected to
appear, when     it is remembered that we are comparing together solar
and  terrestrial phenomena, to us probably only incomplete manifest
ations of involved actions, abont which little is known and of which
the cause is obscure.       Especially, too, when, as regards the terres
trial effect, the magnetic variations are deduced from the observa
tions at a single station, Greenwich.        Consider also the composite
character of the sun-spot phenomena at about the time of minimum
epoch.     After a maximum, as the following minimum epoch is
approached, sun-spots become in successive years fewer in number
and smaller in magnitude, the regions north and south of the solar
equator in which spots appear tending, as the spots become less
nnmerous, more and more towards the equator, until at the minimum
epoch the spots disappear.       At the same time, spots of, as it were, a
new cycle come into view in high latitudes, and become rapidly more
numerous and important until another maximum is passed, after
which the spots become again less numerous, the regions in which
they appear approaching        as before the solar equator, until at the
following   minimum      again the Rpots disappear.    Thus the curve at
the minimum epoch seems to be produced by the junction of an
 expiring cycle with a new outburst becoming rapidly active.
   In tabulating the magnetic records at Greenwich, it has been the
 practice to include all days (except those of extreme disturbance),

72         Mr. W. Ellis.   Relation between   Diurnal Range of
consequently    on many that are retained considerable disturbance
exists.     Now abnormal disturbance is more frequent, as well as
greater    in  magnitude,   towards the epochs of maximum sun-
spot frequency, and tends almost to disappear at the epochs of
minimum frequency.        For instance,   the sun-spot  minima of 1856
and 1879 were both remarkable for little irregular disturbance,
especially the latter, whilst at the sun-spot maximum of 1870, dis
turbance was unusually frequent and considerable in amount, the
difference in this respect being very striking, as a mere inspec
tion of the photographic records for the epochs mentioned would
abundantly show.       Iu preparing the former paper the question,
therefore, did arise whether and to what extent the increased diurnal
magnetic range, about the periods of sun-spot maximum, might be
due to the greater prevalence at such periods of abnormal disturb
ance, but I then satisfied myself, by examination of the records, that
this circumstance exercised no important influence on the results.
Now, however, I can substantiate that conclusion by numerical data.
    It is known to those acquainted with magnetic work that in order
the better and more readily to compare together the diurnal magnetic
inequalities for different places it has been the practice, since the
year 1889, to tabulate the records at British observatories for five
 selected quiet days in each month, the selection of days being made
 by the Astronomer Royal. These quiet day results, unaffected by
 magnetic disturbance, show only the solar diurnal variation, and are
now available for Greenwich, from 1889 to 1896.             Mean hourly
 values being formed in each month from the indications on the five
quiet days, the diurnal range of declination and horizontal force was
 found in the same way as before described for the full monthly
 values, the resulting numbers being given in Table IV.       These were
 further treated for removal of the annual inequality, in the same way
                              I
 that the numbers of Table were treated to form those of Table II.
 The values so found are contained in Table V, and are those repre
 sented graphically in fig. 3, adding thereto the graphical representa
 tion of the sun-spot and magnetic phenomena, for the corresponding
 years from the long series 1841 — 1896, in which all days (excepting
 those of extreme disturbance) were included.
    The thick line in declination and horizontal force (fig. 3) shows the
 dinrnal magnetic range as found from employing all days, including
 many of magnetic disturbance.          The thin line, formed from five
 selected qniet days in each month indicates the true solar diurnal
 range.    Two things thus appear.       Firstly, that the solar diurnal
 range (thin line), in which the influence of irregular magnetic dis
 turbance has no part, is itself really affected with a periodical varia
 tion similar to that of sun spots. And secondly, that the effect of
 including disturbed days (thick line) alters the solar diurnal range

                                                horizontal force respectively ;
                                                the thick line is that resulting
                                                from the employment of all
                                                days, and the thin line that
                                                found from five selected    quiet
                                                days in each month.
(thin line) in a small degree only as compared with its variation
with sun spots, from which it follows that the diurnal range as found
from employing all days (thick line), as in the 1841 — 1896 series, may
be taken to represent the solar diurnal range (thin line) the varia
tion of the former being essentially that of the solar diurnal range.
   The explanation of the circumstance that the difference in the
amplitude of the magnetic range, as found from five selected quiet
days, and from all days, is so small as compared with the variation
in amplitude of both with variation of snn spots, would seem to be
that the effect of irregular magnetic disturbance is such as sometimes
to increase the value of the magnetic           element and sometimes to de
crease  it, these opposite effects combining to neutralise each other to
such an extent as to influence the solar diurnal range in an unim
portant degree only, as compared with its considerable                     variation
 with that of sun spots, which is the point that is here material.
   Although the change produced in the character of the diurnal
magnetic movement by including disturbed days is not a matter that
possesses     significance as regards the purposes of this paper, it be
comes in other respects one for consideration.                 It is, however, a
question related toothers that would be better discussed in a separate
communication.

    On the    Relative Retardation    between the Components of a
       Stream of    Light produced by the Passage of the Stream
       through a Crystalline Plate cut in any Direction with
       respect to the Faces of the Crystal." By James Walker,
       M.A. Communicated by Professor R. B. CLIFTON, F.R.S.
       Received February 29— Read March 10, 1898.
    The relative retardation between the components of a stream of
 light produced   by the passage through a crystalline plate can, as is
 well known, only be determined in finite terms in a limited number
of special cases.     Tn general it is necessary to be content with art
approximate solution, and those hithei-to published have, as far as       I
 iiave ascertained, never been carried beyond terms of the second
order   with respect to the sine of the angle of incidenco of the light,
 while they do not readily lend themselves to a further approxima
tion.    The following method of dealing with the problem, which,
except for the labour of calculation,      can easily be extended to
terms of any order, may then be of practical use, and, as leading to
an interesting     relation between the corresponding terms in the
development of the roots of a certain biquadratic equation, of some
interest.
    1. Let the plane of the paper represent the plane of incidence, OT
represent the   normal to the front of the incident plane wave, OP and
OP' the normals to the fronts of the two corresponding          refracted
waves ; then if OM, ON, and ON' represent the                these  waves
                                                      spaces
would traverse in unit time, planes through M, N, and N' perpendi
cular to OT, OP, and OP' respectively will represent the positions
that the fronts of the waves would
                                      occupy in unit time after leaving
0, and these planes will,
                                 by Huygens' principle, intersect the
surface of the crystalline plate in one straight line, projected on the
plane of the figure in the point C.
    Let OT, OP, and OP' meet the second surface of the plate in the
    vol. lxici.

80     Mr.  J.   Walker.     Relative Retardation      between   Components
points T,     P, and P' respectively, and through P and P' draw PE,
P'E' perpendicular to OT, meeting it in the points E and E' ; through
E' draw E'T' parallel to the surface of the plate, meeting PE in T'.
   Draw OD normal to the plate, meeting the second surface in D,
and let the wave fronts CN and CN' meet this normal in the points
Q and Q'.
    Then the triangles OPD, CON, CQO are similar, as are also the
triangles OP'D, CON', CQ'O, and the triangles T'E'E, COM.
    The relative retardation, measured in time, of the two waves after
both have traversed the plate, is represented by
  rOP     OE-|
                    TOP'

    Hence   if the  axis of Z be normal to the plate, and
              ZX +  mY+»,Z =        1             ZX+wiY+njZ =        1
are the equations of the refracted waves in unit time after passing
through 0, their relative retardation, measured in length in air, after
both have traversed the plate is
                                 A = cTCn.-n,),
where   v  is the propagational       speed in air, and  T is the thickness of
the plate.
    Also i being the angle of incidence, and w the azimuth                 of the
plane of incidence with respect to that of XZ,
                I = sin  i cos w/v,              m  ¦= sin t sin wjv.
    2. In applying this result to the case of a plate cut in any manner
from a biaxal crystal, let the surface of the plate on which the light
is incident be taken as the plane of XT, the plate lying on the side of
 Z positive, and let the plane of XZ be taken so as to contain the
 least axis of elasticity of the crystal.
    Let Oa;, Oy, Oz bo the axes of elasticity, and the angle yoY = 0,
 the angle zoZ = x, then the transformation from the axes of elasti
city to the new axes may be effected by the following successive
 transformations, each in one plane : —
    (1) Through an angle 0, in the plane of xy, from                  Oa*, Oy to
             Oa;,, Oy.
    (2) Through an angle x. ™ tfle plane txu from            Oz, 0xx to OZ,  OX.

         of a Stream of Light passing through a Crystalline Plate.                      81
      The formulffi for these transformations are —
            x =  xx cos 0— Y sin 0,                  y   =   X\  sin 0+ Y  cos 0,
          Xi  = X   cos x+Z   sin x»                 «  = —X sin x+Z         cos x»
from      which we obtain
                   x =  X cos  0  cos x- Y sin 0+ Z cos 0 sin x,
                   y = X sin 0cos x + Y        cos 0+Z sin 0 sin x,
                   « = —X sin x + Z      cos x-
     Now the equation       to the wave surface              referred   to the axes of
elasticity is
                             o'x5

 'i, b, c  being the principal wave velocities, and the condition that the
plane

should be a tangent plane to          it, is obtained by eliminating^ between
the equations

 Hence      the condition that      in the new system of co-ordinates                 the

    The    result of this elimination is a biquadratic in n, which, from
the    nature of the problem, has two real positive and two real nega-
tire roots, and if n,,        are the positive roots of the biquadratic, the
relative retardation required is

which a* =   fit,2. When this occurs, the two refracted waves, corre
sponding to normal incidence of the light, traverse the plate with the

'¦An     Extension of Maxwell's Electro-magnetic Theory of
       Light to include Dispersion, Metallic Reflection, and Allied
       Phenomena."          By Edwin Edser, A.R.C.S. Communicated

                                    (Abstract.)
    A dielectric, like an electrolyte, is assumed to consist of molecules,
 each   comprising, in the simplest case, two oppositely charged atoms
 at a   definite distance apart. In a homogeneous medium, when not
 subjected to electric strain, these molecules will be arranged in such
 a manner that any element            of volume will possess no resultant
 electric moment.        If  a definite  potential difference be maintained
 oetween any two         parallel planes in the medium, the positively
 oharged    atoms   will   move to points of lower, and the negatively
 charged atoms to points of higher, potential.           Thus two kinds of
 molecular strain are produced: firstly, a molecular rotation; and
 secondly, a separation in the molecule of the constituent atoms.
 Let P be the actual electromotive intensity at any point in the
 medium, and D be the electric displacement other than that pro
 duced by the atomic charges.         Then
                               P(l + 4wM)     = 4irD,
  where  M is   a constant depending     on the nature of the medium.    The
  quantity   1 + 4VM represents the specific inductive capacity of the
  medium.     The actual linear displacement of the atoms is shown to bo
  6mall when compared with molecular magnitudes.
     Maxwell's equation, expressing that the line integral of the electro
  motive intensity round a closed circuit is equal to the rate of
  decrease of the magnetic induction through the circuit, needs no
  modification when the propagation of disturbances             through the
  above medium is considered.           Maxwell's second equation is modi
  fied by adding to the total displacement          current at any point the
  expression 2qvx, where q is the atomic charge, vx is the velocity of
  that charge in the direction considered, and 2 denotes summation
   for unit volume.
      Subsidiary equations for the atomic vibrations (rotational and
   separational) are given, and the refractive index is finally deter
   mined in the form

 92    Extension of Maxwell's Electro-magnetic Theory of Light.
         is found to be equal to the specific inductive capacity of the
 medium, as previously determined.
    For a medium which might                be compressed without altering the
 period of     vibration    of    the   constituent      molecules, Gladstone and
 Dale's law, in the modified form                loc density, would follow.
    Double refraction, in case of a uniaxial crystal, is explained on the
 assumption that the molecules are arranged with their axes parallel
 to a certain direction. Electrical disturbances perpendicular to this
 direction will produce a molecular rotation, whilst those parallel to
 this direction will produce an inter-atomic separation.                 The doubly
 refracting nature of a dielectric when subjected to electric strain is
 thus explained ; and it is pointed out that Lord Kelvin was led to
 postulate a crystalline structure similar to the above to account for
 the pyro-electric properties of tourmaline, &c.
    For infinitely quick vibrations the refractive index of the above
 medium will be equal to unity, a result possibly explaining the
action of material bodies on Rontgen radiations.
    Assuming a metallic or quasi-metallic substance to have a struc
ture essentially similar to that described above, with the addition
that a viscous term is included in the equation for the atomic vibra
tion, the refractive index of a metal is found in the form of a
 complex quantity, the imaginary part of which is essentially positive.
The ordinary laws of metallic reflection, as deduced by Cauchy and
others, will therefore hold. It is shown that for those metals in
which the real part of the square of the refractive index is a* large
negative quantity, the velocity of propagation of light will be in
versely proportional to the molecular viscosity. Since Mr. Tomlin-
son has shown that for those metals which he had examined the
order of magnitude of the specific electrical resistances was the same
as that of the molecular             viscosities, a connection is established
between the velocity        of    light    and the* electrical conductivity of a
metal, agreeing with that obtained experimentally by Kundt.
   The initial assumptions in the above investigation are similar to
those made by Helmholtz in his papers on the
                                                                 "

Theory of Dispersion."*             Some doubt has been expressed as to
whether Helmholtz's developments are in consonance with Maxwell's
theory .f In the present case the principle of Least Action is not
used. The dispersion formula obtained differs from that of Helm

his modification of Helmholtz's theory.              J    A more definite physical
significance is, however, given          to  the  various  constants introduced.

            Significance   of Functional Metabolism in   the Plant.      93
CBOONIAN        LECTURE. — " The Nature and Significance of Func
       tional Metabolism in the Plant" (Das Wesen und die
        Bedeutung      des  Betriebsstoffwechsels  in der Pflanze).     By

                      (Translation of Author's Abstract.)
    The fact that a mould fungus will thrive in a solntion, from
which, with the exception of certain inorganic acids, it can obtain
nothing but sugar, affords proof that the elaboration of these food
substances in metabolism not only provides the numerous carbon com
pounds which are concerned in the construction of the plant, but also
serves as a sufficient source of energy for the performance of its func
tions.     For in the plant, as in the animal, vital activity comes to
a standstill if the conditions and the energy necessary for the discharge
of its functions are not constantly provided by means of profound
chemical decompositions.           Just as in animals, a great amount of
internal and external work has to be accomplished, in order to carry
<jii and maintain the        action of the organism.    Hence the greater
part, and in the mature plant even the whole, of the food absorbed
is devoted to this functional metabolism, so that only a certain
fraction of the sugar which has disappeared from the solution is
to be found in the resulting crop of fungi, in the form of various
carbon compounds.          The rest of the sugar has been burnt up to form
carbonic acid and water; that is to say, it has been sacrificed to the
 physiological combustion, which in these, as in most plants, is
 indispensable for gaining an adequate amount of kinetic energy.
    But, jnst as man is able to obtain driving power, not only from the
combustion of wood and coal, but also from the explosion of gunpowder
or dynamite, so there are certain of the lower plants which gain
 their whole kinetic energy by means of chemical transformations and
 decompositions, which go on without the participation of freo
 oxygen.      Although the careful consideration of such organisms is
 indispensable for any correct estimate of functional metabolism, yet
 we may, in the first instance, limit our attention     to oxygen-respira
 tion, i.e., to the functional metabolism of aerobic organisms.
     In any case it is only after elaboration that food acquires its
 significance    for the construction and working of the organism.
 With respect to the utilisation of the food, it is of no consequence
  whence it comes, or by what means the organism obtains it.
  Obvious as this consideration is, yet confusion between the elabora
  tion of food in structural and functional metabolism on the one

 94               Prof. W. Pfeffer.     The Nature and
 hand, and the operations adapted to the acquisition and absorption
 of organic nutriment on the other, has led to a grave error, namely,
to the assumption that a difference in principle exists between the
metabolism of plants and that of animals.           The simple reflection
 that an immense number of plants exist which are destitute of
chlorophyll, might at once have taught that the function of the chloro
phyll apparatus — the production of food from carbonic acid and water
 — only serves to provide nutriment for further elaboration, and to
introduce it in a peculiar and highly characteristic manner inte the
 organism.    For the structural ar.d functional metabolism of green
 plants, however, the sugar prepared in the plant's own factory has
exactly the same significance as the sugar which a fungus obtains
from outside. In like manner it makes no difference to the utilisa
tion and importance of sugar in the metabolism of man, whether a
sugar-baker obtains it from his own factory or another man has to
buy it at second or third hand.
   Again, only those plants can dispense with a supply of albumin
ous food substances which construct these bodies synthetically from
simpler compounds.       In all plants, however, in close analogy with
the animal organism, albuminous          substances not only serve as
permanent constituents of the body,,but are in part again disinte
grated in metabolism. Yet this process does not as a rule result in an
excretion of the nitrogenous products of decomposition, for the latter
are usually at once re-employed for the regeneration of albuminons
substances.    This, however, cannot take place to a sufficient extent
in cases where a mould fungus is provided with protein substances
as its only food, so as to increase the transformation of albuminoids
and at the same time to restrict their regeneration.          Under these
circumstances a large amount of ammonium carbonate is actually
excreted, in other words, the same final product which also arises in the
animal body, but which there at onco undergoes condensation to form
urea.    By this latter process the injurious effect which would result
from an accumulation of ammonium carbonate is avoided. In the case
of fungi such an injurious accumulation does not usually occur under
normal conditions of growth, while these plants also to some extent
possess the power of guarding against its deleterious influence by
neutralisation, owing to the fact that in the presence of alkaline
compounds oxalic acid is produced in increased quantity.
   It constantly happens that all those processes which do not
form an essential part of the indispensable functional metabolism,
are regulated in such a manner as to be wholly or partly brought to
a standstill without impairing other functions.            Any excessive
accumulation of products always     has this result, so that, for example,
the further formation of sugar or of protein bodies ceases, when
these substances have collected in the cell up to a certain limited

          Significance   of Functional Metabolism in    the   Plant.       95
amount.     On the other hand, the inevitable final products of the
general functional metabolism most be continually formed, for it is
npon this chemical process that the maintenance         of vital activity*
depends,   and  these final products, in so  far  as they are not again
made use of, must also be constantly secreted and removed, for their
accumulation would render further activity impossible.          In many
aerobic organisms, for reasons already indicated, only the excretion
of carbonic acid and water is in question.   In tho case of many fungi,
and some other plants, we find, however, in addition to these sab-
stances, organic acids, and other non-volatile final products, which are
secreted in great variety and amount, especially in the case of many
aerobic and anaerobic fermentations.
    In order to avoid an accumulation in the cell, the final products
which are    continually arising, as well as the food to be assimilated,
 must necessarily    be soluble and capable of diosmosis.         Hence the
 ejection of the undigested remains of food is usually impossible,
 though, where it is possible, we find it in plants as well as in
 animals, as, for example, in the Myxomycetes.         Extracellular diges
 tion, which is employed on an extensive scale even in the vegetable
 kingdom, is, broadly speaking, only a means by which substances
 are rendered      available for absorption      and elaboration      by the
 living  elements,  but  is no more  an integral  part  of the  actual  func
tional metabolism than is the digestion in the stomach of animals.
 The same holds good with reference to respiratory movements, and to
all those operations and adaptations which provide for the access of
 oxygen and the removal of carbonic acid.        In plants, it is true, there
are no special active respiratory movements, but in all the larger plants
an extensive     system of aeration serves to maintain, adequately,
the gaseous interchange of the internal cells.         A loose combination
of oxygen, such as is found in the hemoglobin of the blood, is not
of general occurrence among plants, though present and efficient in
certain chromogenic bacteria.
    If we leave out of consideration all subsidiary and preliminary
processes, there is no doubt that the true aerobic functional meta
bolism is the same, in principle, in plants and in animals ; in fact
even from a formal point of view, no difference exists,       if,as isfitting,
we select the lowest animal and vegetable beings for comparison.
    In plants, which like animals perform a large amount of work,
vigorous respiration also takes place     ;   in specially active plants    it
may even be actually greater than in warm-blooded            animals.      For
while in man, the carbonic acid produced in twenty-four hours amounts
to about 1*2 per cent., in many mould-fungi      it  exceeds  6  per cent, of
the weight of the body    ;   in very active bacteria the consumption of
oxygen, referred to the same      standard,   may reach an amount          200
times as great as in man.

                    Prof. W. Pfeffer.'     TU   Nature and
     Although such energetic physiological combustion involved a very
 considerable production of heat, yet in consequence of the extensive
radiating surface, only a slight rise of temperature usually ensues.
 The functional metabolism, in fact, as in poecilothermic organisms,
 does not provide for th.6 regulative maintenance of a definite body-
 temperature.     At the same time the plant is adapted to accom
  modate   itself to temperatures, ranging for example, from 2° to
  40°  C, and to bear such oscillations of the body-temperature with
 out injury. Manifestly it is altogether expedient that, when the tem
 perature rises, the activity of growth and respiration should be simul
  taneously accelerated.    On the other hand, the fact that when the
  optimum    temperature   for growth has been exceeded, substances are
  burnt up by respiration, in an ever increasing degree, while the pro
 cesses of growth and movement are retarded or altogether            stopped,
 is a non-adaptive     phenomenon,    determined    only by   the absence   of
 any regulative check.
     As long as the external conditions remain constant, however, respi
 ration is always regulated by the plant, and is in general increased,
 as the activity of the whole organism automatically rises.               This
 happens,   for example,  when   a plant  begins  to grow  again, after  com
 pleting the winter's rest, or' when a traumatic reaction is called
 forth in consequence of injury.        Thus, if we cut a potato in pieces,
 the production    of carbonic  acid gradually increases nine- or ten-fold,
 in the course of twenty-four hours, owing to the respiratory process,
 and then gradually diminishes again as the traumatic reaction passes
 off. Here the plant falls as it were into a state of fever, for simul
 taneously with respiration, the production of heat is very considerably
 augmented.
     If we bear in mind that the essential office of functional metabo
 lism, consists in providing, by means of chemical transformations,
 the necessary energy for vital action, we cannot be surprised that
 this end is not always attained in the same way.            Apart from the
 fact that different carbon-compounds      are consumed   in respiration, and
 that not only carbonic acid, but in certain plnnts oxalic acid, acetic
 acid, citric acid, &c, arise as the final products of physiological
 combustion, there exist even aerobic organisms in which kinetic
 energy is no longer obtained by the oxidation of any carbon compounds
  whatever.    Among these are the nitrobacteria, some of which oxidise
 ammonia to nitrous acid, while others oxidise nitrous to nitric acid ;
  these remarkable organisms, with the help of the energy thus gained,
 are at the    same   time  capable of constructing their organic food
 synthetically from carbonic acid. AgaiD, in the respiratory process
  of the sulphur-bacteria, the sulphuretted hydrogen undergoes com-
  bust:on, sulphur being first set free, and then oxidized to form sul
 phuric acid. Thus, in these organisms, sulphuric acid is secreted as

 the final product of physiological combustion, while in the nitro
bacteria the same is the case with nitrous or with nitric acid.     There
can be no question that as time goes on, yet other specific peculiarities
 Fill be discovered.     Thus it is conceivable that certain micro
organisms may gain their chemical kinetic energy by the oxidation
of ferrous oxide, and others perhaps," by the oxidation of hydrogen
or  of the gaseous hydrocarbons.
   Considered from the general point of view of energy, it is by no
 means   necessary that physiological combustion         should proceed
along the same lines in all organisms.       Indeed it was only in con-:
sequence   of an unjustifiable generalisation from observations on the
higher animal and vegetable organisms, that the belief arose that
organic life is impossible without the agency of free oxygen, i.e.,
 without oxygen-respiration.      Just, however, as man is able to
employ driving power, derived from such reactions as the explosion
of gunpowder or dynamite in a space free from oxygen, so must it
appear a priori possible, that organisms have been evolved on our
earth, in adaptation to special conditions and necessities of life, which
are able to live without making use of free oxygen.
   As a matter of fact numerous anaerobic micro-organisms are now
known.     Their existence, indeed, was established as long ago as
1861, by the investigations   of Pasteur, and it was only the deeply
rooted belief in the absolute indispensability of oxygen-respiration
which caused the majority of the learned to remain sceptical, or to
endeavour to save the dogma of the necessity of oxygen by forced,
and often, frivolous interpretations.
   Much, it is true, remains to be explained as to the details of meta
bolism, both in aerobic and anaerobic organisms ; meanwhile this
at least is certain, that even in anaerobes, kinetic energy is gained
by means of a great variety of chemical transformations.        This fact
is at once indicated by the various final products of functional meta
bolism, in one organism consisting chiefly of alcohol and carbonic
acid, in another of butyric acid, lactic acid, or butyl-alcohol,
or of other' yery various volatile and non-volatile compounds,
which, however, often owe their origin in part to secondary pro
cesses; considered from the standpoint of energy it is not neces
sary that any gaseous products should arise, or even that oxygen
atoms should be transposed,      or carbon compounds disintegrated.
It is true that the latter assumption holds good in all cases which
have as yet been minutely studied, but it is quite conceivable that
kinetic energy may be obtained by some other reaction (for example,
by the reaction between potassium nitrate and sulphur).
   The anaerobia are, however, of great importance iu the economy
of nature, for by their agency decomposition is carried on in the
interior of the cadaver, and generally in places where the conditions

98                 Prof. W. Pfeffer.    The Nature and
for oxygen-respiration are absent.         Thus, in   the case of facul
 tative anaerobes, in proportion as oxygen becomes deficient, aerobic
 becomes replaced by anaerobic metabolism, while the obligatory
 anaerobes now for the first time begin their growth and multiplica
 tion. This is correlated with the fact, that oxygen, even at low
 tension, acts as a poison to them, and when air is so much com
 pressed that the oxygen is twenty or thirty times as dense as in
the atmosphere, all plants perish. All gradations of sensitiveness
 towards oxygen occur, from the most resistant organisms down
 wards, and there are even obligatory aerobes, such as the sulphnr-
 bacteria, which can only exist when oxygen is of very low density.
    Thus the different types are connected by intermediate links. For
 any facultative anaerobe it is possible to prepare a nutritive sub
 stratum on which it can flourish only when able to respire free
 oxygen.    If, however, the oxygen be presented in sufficient dilution
 it  does not hinder the growth of the anaerobic organism, which,
 under these circumstances, constantly draws the free oxygen into its
functional metabolism, and thus gradually consumes it in considerable
quantities.     Further, a variable density of the free oxygen may be
endured by the same organism in accordance with the cultural condi
tions under which it is placed.    It has in fact been found possible, by
means of special nutrition, to cultivate the strictly anaerobic Bacillus
of symptomatic anthrax (B. carbonis) as an aerobe.       The habits of the
nitrogen-assimilating Clostridium Pasteurianum are also evidently
modified by certain bacteria which usually live associated with it,
for in such symbiosis Clostridium endnres the free access of air,
while in the isolated condition it can only live anaiirobically.
    Even in the case of typical aerobes, however, the withdrawal of
oxygen does not bring the metabolic activity entirely to a standstill.
At first carbonic acid is still given off, being derived from the
intramolecular respiration, i.e., from chemico-physiological   processes,
which in most plants further result in the formation of alcohol and
other products.       This intramolecular respiration is thus a vital
action which is of importance for the maintenance of life even in
aerobes, but which in the latter does not suffice to maintain the whole
working of the organism after oxygen has been withdrawn. In the
anaerobes this capacity has been fully developed, but of course only
comes into play when suitable nutrition is provided. For, when differ
ently fed, even the facultative anaerobe can only grow if fully supplied
with air, and behaves, when oxygen is withdrawn, just like a typi
cally aerobic plant, for it then ceases to grow, and, sooner or later,
perishes altogether.      By means of an appropriate food-mixture,
however, we can ensure that the facultative anaerobe continues its
growth and movements, but only for a certain time and to a certain
extent, thus appearing as a temporarily anaerobic organism.          Sucb

             Significance  of Functional Metabolism in    the  Plant.        99
an organism, for example, is yeast (Saccharomyee3          cerevisice), which,
under the nutritive conditions hitherto tested, cannot live without an
occasional supply of oxygen, whereas certain         bacteria are capable of
an unlimited anaerobic life.
   It follows directly from what has been said, that among aerobes
life is maintained for a limited time by the action of intramole
cular respiration. For it is only when intramolecular respiration
fails that the plant suffers in an atmosphere free from oxygen ;
the strictly aerobic mould-fungi keep alive much longer without
oxygen, when their aerobic respiratory activity is intensified by pro
viding them with sugar. Thus there is every gradation and transi
tion between those organisms which require free oxygen, and those
in which the anaerobic metabolic activity, which is exercised to a
certain degree in all organisms, is so far developed and utilised that
the functional metabolism suffices for a life without oxygen.             Even
in aerobes a number of partial functions are carried on for a certain
time after the withdrawal of oxygen.           Among these functions intra
molecular respiration itself is included, as well as all the metabolic
changes with which it is linked. There are also certain processes of
growth and movement which are not at once brought to a standstill
when oxygen is withdrawn.             Thus we know that nuclear division,
when     it   has   once begun, still goes on in the absence of oxygen, and
under the same conditions tho tentacles of the insectivorous Sundew
still carry ont their movements when stimulated.               The muscle of
animals can also be caused to contract when deprived of oxygen.
    The relations of the organism to its conditions of life can be
demonstrated and understood, even though we do not possess any
deeper insight into the causes and the exact processes of functional
 metabolism.         "We  may also regard it as certain that functional
metabolism is indispensable to vital activity, on which in its turn it
depends and by which it is regulated, so that metabolism is at once
extinguished when death ensues. Thus the realisation of functional
 metabolism ensures the continuity of metabolism in general, just as
 a blazing fire, by heating the wood, constantly creates and maintains
 the conditions necessary for the continuance of combustion.
    It is also certain that functional metabolism runs its course within
 the living protoplasm, not merely on its surface or in particular portions
 of it, but in and between all its constituent parts, as must necessarily
 be the case in order that vital activity may be maintained.           This can
 be seen at once from the fact     that those movements    in the  protoplasm,
 or in any separate fragment of the protoplast, which are dependent
 on aerobic respiration, come to an end on the withdrawal of oxygen,
 even when the adjoining cells have access to oxygen and are in a
 state of   full activity.
     From the dependence of functional metabolism on vital activity           it

100                Prof. W. Pfeffer.     The Nature and
directly follows that the consumption of the material to he elaborated,
 as well as the absorption of free oxygen by the organism, is regu
 lated in accordance with its requirements.           Consequently, when
these requirements are fnlly satisfied, an increased supply of food
material or of oxygen results in no essential acceleration of the func
tional metabolism.      For this reason plants do not breathe any more
vigorously in pure oxygen than in ordinary air, for even in the latter
much more oxygen penetrates into the cell than is consumed in
normal respiration.
    If, however, the supply is not sufficient to fully satisfy the demand,
then the functional metabolism, and with it the whole activity of the
organism, is unavoidably reduced, just as a fire can no longer burn
properly when insufficiently supplied with fuel or with oxygen.
Most plants, however, can completely meet their demand for oxygen
in an atmosphere in which the proportion of oxygen (at ordinary
atmospheric pressure) is reduced to 5 — 8 per cent., so that on the
highest mountains vegetable organisms find a more than sufficient
density of oxygen.       If its density be still further diminished, then,
after a transient disturbance, the respiration and the total activity of
the plant are depressed, so that in an atmosphere containing only 2 — 4
per cent, of oxygen the plant, though it survives, breathes and
works in a diminished degree.
    Since functional metabolism depends on the vital activities, a satis-1-
factory causal explanation of the former will only be possible after
we have gained a sufficient insight into the latter. In general, how
ever, we may 6ay that the same processes which effect intramolecular
respiration also develop thoso affinities, by means of which free
oxygen, when supplied,          is drawn into metabolism.        For intra
molecular respiration is at once stopped on access of oxygen, and
after the withdrawal of oxygen is immediately resumed. In much
the same way as the development of the spontaneously inflammable
phosphuretted     hydrogen brings about the fixation of a certain
amount of oxygen, may physiological combustion be determined
and regulated       through     the   continual formation of a single
autoxydable body.       In respiration, however, we have evidently to do
with complicated reactions and reciprocal changes, which come into
play between the constituent parts of the protoplasmic body.           And
further, the respiratory process must take a somewhat different fonri
when, instead of a carbon compound, ammonia or ammonium nitrite,
sulphuretted hydrogen or sulphur, forms the material for physiolo
gical combustion.
    We may be sure, however, that in the plant passive oxygen is
drawn into metabolism, and that oxygen is not brought into the
active state in order to accomplish physiological oxidation.        For we
can prove with complete certainty that at no time does any snch

           Significance of Functional Metabolism      in the Mant.       101
process of oxidation occur in the interior of vitally active protoplasm
(including the nucleus), as is brought about by even the feeblest
form of active oxygen (hydrogen peroxide).           This still holds good
even    if the reactions  of active oxygen are obtained in the expressed
sap, i.e.,  after mixing bodies which in the plant are separate. If,
however, active oxygen ever plays any part at all, it is at most to be
regarded as one only of the means of which the organism avails
itself, and not as revealing the true and essential cause of functional
metabolism.
   Side by side with the general process of functional metabolism,
many other chemical operations must necessarily come into play, in
order to provide the various compounds which are formed in the
organism, in order to build np its tissues, or otherwise.         Although
these processes are not of necessity in continuous action, it is difficult
to separate them from the general functional metabolism.            We are
placed with regard to the plant, somewhat in the position of a man
who, while he can control the raw material introduced into a factory
and the finished products turned out from it, is not permitted to
inspect the internal working.        Unless the observer has a knowledge
of this from other sources, it is simply impossible for him to say
what is the nature of all the manifold operations carried on in a
chemical factory, whether simultaneously or successively, jointly or
separately.      At the same time the observer may be quite aware that-
all work in the factory is impossible if the fire be not bnrning under
the boiler, or if the driving power in general be not available, and he
may    also know that the gaseous products of combustion, the ashes
and    the slag, must be got rid of, simply in order to make room for
the work to go on.       In the factory, however, just as in the plant, the
general driving power is not always utilised for the same purposes or
with equal efficiency.      Indeed, when the steam-engine is at work but
the rest, of the machinery is out of gear, the whole driving power is
wasted.      No less is it true, in the case of the plant, that the relation
between the available kinetic energy and its utilisation for various
purposes, or in other words the economic coefficient, may vary
within very wide limits according to the stage of development and
the external conditions.

102      Dr. W.  J. Russell.      On the Action exerted by certain
Bakerian Lecture. — "Further Experiments on the Action
       exerted by certain Metals and other Bodies on a Photo
       graphic Plate." By W. J. Russell, Ph.D., V.P.R.S. Re
       ceived February 10, — Read March 24, 1898.
    In  a paper read  before    this Society in June last* it was stated
that certain metals, alloys, and other snbstances such as picture
copal, printing ink, straw board, &c, were able to act even at a
distance on a sensitive photographic plate, producing effects similar
in appearance and developed in the same way as plates which had
been acted on by ordinary light.            At that time sufficient experi
mental evidence had not been obtained to determine the nature of
this action, or even to clearly indicate its general character, whether
in fact the action arose from vapour given off by the active body,
or whether phosphorescence was produced which acted on the plate.
That bodies so slightly volatile as zinc, aluminium, nickel, &c,
should be able to give off at ordinary temperatures in a few days
sufficient vaponr to act strongly on a photographic plate, and that
such vapour should be able to pass rapidly through media, such as
gelatin, celluloid, collodion, &c, seemed difficult to realise, although
many of the earlier experiments appeared to indicate that this was
the kind of action which took place.             Later experiments confirm
the view that a vapour is given off, which is the cause of the action
on the plate.
    Certain organic bodies, as well as metals, have been shown to act
on the photographic plate, and in endeavouring to ascertain the
nature of this action experiments with organic bodies were first
undertaken, as the results which they yield are more easily and
 rapidly obtained than those with the metals, and if their mode of
 action was determined      it would probably throw light on the action
 exerted by the metals.       In the former communication it was stated
 that printing ink and copal varnish are active substances, both when
 in direct contact with a photographic plate and when at a distance
 from it. Further it was found that the action which they exerted
 was able to pass through different media.             Although printing inks
 and copal varnishes may vary considerably in composition, the
 main constituents are constant, hence it was easy to determine that
 boiled oil and turpentine were the bodies to which they owed their
 activity, and that these bodies separately behaved in the same
 way as did printing ink and copal varnish.                  Boiled oil — that is,
 linseed oil which has been heated with oxide of lead — is an active
substance, and most of the following experiments have been made
                      • «

with the      pale drying oil which is prepared by Messrs. Winsor
and   Newton. Pure turpentine is also a very active substance, and,
owing to its volatility, in many experiments very useful.                    These
bodies can be used either as liquids in small dishes or by saturat
ing Bristol board or other neutral and porous bodies, such as ignited
pnmice stone, Ac., with them.            In the case of the drying oil it can
be painted on glass or cardboard and allowed to harden.
   The experiments described in the former communication have been
repeated under the same and under slightly different conditions and
m another laboratory ; the results obtained with one exception con
firm the previous statements.            Glass, selenite, mica, even in very
thin layers, are absolutely opaque to the action, whereas gelatin,
celluloid, collodion, guttapercha tissue, tracing paper, parchment,
and paper are more or less transparent.              Linseed oil and turpentine
may fairly be taken as typical examples of active organic bodies.
This property of acting on the photographic plate is far from
belonging to all volatile organic bodies; for instance, although vege
table oils have the power of acting, mineral oils, so far as they have
been tried, have not the power.           Benzene, carbon disulphide, chloro
form, &c, also are without this power of acting on the photographic
plate ; but the question of what substances are and what are not
active will be dealt with on another occasion ; at present it is simply
to consider the conditions under which linseed oil and turpentine act
on the photographic plate.            The picture copal varnish which was
much used in the former experiments obviously owes its activity to
the turpentine and the oil it contains.            Warm the varnish for some
length of time, these bodies are driven off and an inactive gum
remains.      This experiment obviously suggests           a vapour as the cause
of the    action ; at the same time would such a vapour pass through
bodies    such as gelatin, celluloid, &c. ? With regard, for instance, to
the thin-sheet gelatin, it appears to offer but very slight obstruction
to the action of these oiganic bodies ; if the thickness of the gelatin
be increased still the action takes place, only the time of exposure
has to be considerably longer.*           Another striking fact with regard
 to this emanation       from these active bodies is that it gives an accu
 rate picture of the surface from which it has come.                A hard copal
 surface on glass will give a picture showing every brush mark,
 nnevenness, and scratch          on the surface, and   if the action take place
through     a thin sheet of gelatin, or even as many as six or more
sheets,    still the picture of the scratches is distinct. The following
experiments are apparently strong evidence that the action on tho
 photographic plate is dne to the vapour given off from these organic
 bodies.

104      Dr. W.   J. Russell.      On the Action exerted by certain
orlnss painted with it or with picture copal, is placed on the bottom
of an ordinary plate box and a photographic plate larger than the
active body ia suspended above it with the film upwards ; light is
excluded from the box, and the arrangement is left for, say, a fort
night, then the plate when developed will be found to have been,
acted on irregularly round its edge, at some parts considerably more
than'at others, bnt everywhere shading off and evidently in the way
which would occur if a vapour had rolled round the edge. Another
experiment which showed this kind of action very satisfactorily waa
earried out as follows : — A circular piece of the Bristol board was
saturated with drying oil, and at a little distance above it a smaller
circle of mica, which is perfectly opaque to the action, was placed,
and again above this was another piece of mica with a circular hole
smaller than the circular mica plate, and then the photographic
plate was placed above. By this arrangement no direct action could
take place between the drying oil and the sensitive plate, but a
vapour could work its way between the mica plates and thus reach
the photographic plate; and this it did, for after an exposure of
three days, on developing the plate there was a dark ring formed
shading off towards tho centre. Another and very simple experi
ment illustrating this same point is to place a small circular glass
dish, with some drying oil in it, in the middle of a photographic plate,
and leave it there for a week.         On developing the plate it will be
found that no action has taken place where the dish stood, but that
immediately beyond the outside of the dish much action has occurred,
and that tho darkening gradually fades away.           There is still another
way   in which  the  action  of  these organic  bodies  has been tested, and
that is by transferring tho active power of these bodies to a neutral
substance.    If vapour be the immediate cause of the darkening of
the photographic plate, then it would be possible, if a piece of Bristol
board were suspended above drying oil, for instance, for the inactive
board to take up those vapours and become photographically active.
This was found to take place. Bristol board of good quality is a
very useful substance in all these experiments, both as a screen and
as an absorbent.      It is in itself an inactive body, and may be heated
in a water bath before using, to prevent the accidental presence of
any substance which might act on the plate.               If a piece of tho
Bristol board be suspended above drying oil, in the liquid or solid
state, or turpentine or picture copal for two or three days, or even
less, it becomes strongly active, and when placed in contact with a
photographic plate quickly darkens it. This action of the Bristol
board is well shown if a pattern be stamped upon it, which is easily
done by pressing against it a piece of white net (black net must not
be used as it is slightly active), then the charged Bristol board will
give an unmistakable        picture.    If turpentine be the active sub

           Metals and other Bodies      on a  Photographic Plate.        105
stance used to charge the Bristol board the exposure need only be for
a few hours, but if after this charging it be exposed to the air for a
day or two, its activity will be found to have gone. There is
obviously no visible indication of this activity of the Bristol board,
and consequently     if a device be cut out on a screen which is placed in
front of a sheet of cardboard, or any inactive paper, and it is exposed
to turpentine or to oil, or if the vapour of these bodies be in any
other way brought in contact with the paper, a dark picture of such
device, which is not visible, may be prodnced. Some unexpected and
curious cases of ghostly pictures thus formed have been met with, they
are, however, all produced in this way, and need not be described now.
The above experiments have been made at ordinary temperatures, but
if the temperature be increased the activity of these organic bodies is
also greatly increased. High temperatures cannot, of course, be used,
but a temperature of 55° C. does not appear to alter the photographic
plate.    With drying oil — which is one of the most active substances
that has been used — it is easy to obtain a picture in thirty minutes at
the above temperature.       The interesting pictures which in the former
communication      it was shown could be produced simply by laying a
piece of dry wood or the section of the branch of a tree on a plate
are produced by the volatile matter contained in the wood.             These
pictures appear at first sight very accurate and complete, but this is
not really so, for some parts of the structure of the wood are not
 shown and other parts are too strongly developed, depending on the
 amount of volatile substance present in the different parts.           It is,
 however, very remarkable that so small a quantity of the volatile
 body as exists in a piece of dry wood should be able to produce a
 picture ; the activity of the wood is increased by the presence of
 moisture.    This property of acting on the photographic plate, pos
 sessed by the linseed oil, belongs apparently to the vapour and not to
 the oil itself, for if a sheet of thin gelatin be placed on a photo
 graphic plate, and on it a thick glass ring nearly filled with oil, and
 over the top of the ring another sheet of gelatin, not in contact with
 the oil, and another sensitive plate, it will be found that after a
 week's exposure no action has taken place below the oil, but that a
 large amount has occurred above it where the vapour has penetrated
 the upper sheet of gelatin.        A similar result is also obtained by
 simply floating a piece of the thin gelatin on a dish of oil and placing
 a sensitive plate above.     At the sides where the vapour can form and
 get away   there is  action on  the plate ; in the centre there is none.
    In addition to glass, mica, and bodies of that kind, the action does
 not take place through a layer, except it be very thin, of either gum
 arabic or of paraffin.      If a pieco of Bristol board or a glass plate
 has hardened drying oil on it, and be painted over with a strong
 solution of gum arabic which is allowed to dry, then the delicate

cracking which occurs can        be very well shown on a photographic
plate.
    Pure water   does not act on the plate, neither does pnre alcohol or
pure ether,  but   the ordinary commercial specimens of the last two
bodies do, and often to a considerable extent.          Alcohol which pro
duces a dark picture will, after digestion with lime and careful dis
tillation, be entirely inactive, and ether after careful purification also
becomes inactive.      Moisture, if present, does not affect this result;
thus   the presence   of certain impurities, and they appear to be some
of the most common ones, can be readily photographed, and approxi
mately their amount determined by the darkness of the picture formed,
so that by this means can be determined whether, for instance, a
purification process is working well and whether it has completely
done its work.      The pictures are easily obtained by placing some of
the liquid to be tested in a small glass dish, and a sensitive plate
above it. Obviously it is only certain impurities which will be indi
cated in this way, but the reaction is otherwise of considerable,
importance, for it gives a simple method of determining what bodies
soluble in these liquids, are capable of acting on a sensitive piate.
This matter will be treated of in a separate communication.
    That the vapour given off by these organic bodies is the imme
diate cause of the action on the sensitive plate the above experiments
Seem to show.      At the same time it is remarkable that such a vapour
should readily pass through media such as gelatin, celluloid, etc., and
not by mere absorption, but in such a way as to produce a picture of
the surface from which it emanated.                                        •
    Passing on to the action which certain metals exert on a photo
graphic plate, results have been obtained which are strikingly similar
to those just described.     Substitute a piece of polished zinc for a piece
of Bristol board saturated with linseed oil, and similar effects ar«
produced on a photographic plate ; the time of exposure must, how
ever, be longer.       Although both magnesium and cadmium are
slightly more active than zinc, this last metal is the most convenient
one to experiment with, and has been used in most of the following
experiments.      In addition to the above three metals, nickel, alumi
nium, lead, and bismuth have the same property, but not so strongly
developed, of acting, both when in contact and when at a distance, on
a photographic plate.      Cobalt, tin, and antimony can also act in the
same way, but their action is considerably feebler, and undoubtedly
other metals can act in the same way, but require muoh longer
exposure.     Mercury, which in the former paper was stated to be the
most active of all the metals which had been tried, is now found to be
quite inactive; the metal used in the former experiments was impure.
This matter will be explained further on.
    As so strong a similarity exists between the effects produced by

           Metals and other Bodies on a Photographic Plate.           107
 the  above-mentioned    organic bodies   and tbe metals, the question
 which naturally presents itself is, do- they also give off a vapour
 ¦which directly or indirectly acts xm the photographic     plate ?   The
 following experiments show that such an aetion does probably occur.
 Zinc which has been long exposed to the air is inactive. An expo
sure out of doors for only three or four days diminishes very con
siderably its activity, but covered up in doors after three weeks it
will still give a tolerably dark picture.   If it has a bright but per
 fectly smooth surface it is active, but not strongly so ; rub the zine
 with coarse sand or emery paper, and it is then obtained in its state
of greatest activity ; the same applies to all the metals.   If, when in
this condition, any of the active metals be placed in contact with a
photographic plate, a beautifully sharp picture of the scratched sur
 face is obtained.    The great increase of the fresh metallic surface
produced by     the rubbing may account for the increase of activity
 which the scratching produces.      If the zinc plate be raised only
slightly above the photographic plate, a sharp picture of the scratches
is still obtained, and of course  as the distance is increased, so is the
indistinctness of the picture increased, and at last it fades into a
general cloudiness, and in this form the zinc plate can easily be made
to act through the distance of an inch or more.
   This action of the metals passes through the same media as do the
vapours from the organic bodies, and clear pictures can be obtained
through sheets of thin gelatin, &c. ; in fact what has already been
said with regard to the transmission of the activity of the organic
bodies applies to the metals ; gelatin, both thin and thick, allows tbe
action of the metal to pass through it ; celluloid and collodion do the
same, and so does gold-beaters skin and tracing paper.        Reasoning,
then, from this strong analogy betweon the action of the organie
and the metallic bodies, it must be assumed that the above-mentioned
metals from a clean surface and at ordinary temperatures give off
vapour, and this vapour apparently acts when under the same circum
stances in a like manner to the vapour given off by the drying oil. It
gives a clear picture of the metal surface from which it arose, and it
can permeate the same media as the organic vapours.         The remark
ably clear pictures of, for instance, a zinc surface, which can be
produced through a sheet, or even several sheets, of the thin gelatin
proves that the action is not one of mere absorption.
    To gain further knowledge on this point and test the porosity of
these different media, the power of hydrogen to diffuse through them
 was tried by cementing specimens of the different substances on
glass tubes, which were filled with hydrogen and placed over water.
The action is somewhat remarkable, but requires further confirma
tion.    With the thin gelatin ordinary diffusion does not occur,
and a hardly, if any, perceptible rise of the water in the tuhe

108     Dr. W.   J. Russell.    On the Action exerted by certain
occurs on starting the experiment ; bnt on standing for some length
of time, two or three days, the water begins to rise, and after
a week or more it will stand at a height of four or more inches
above the level in the vessel, and there it remains at least for a
month or more.      With the thick gelatin there is no evidence of any
diffusion occurring.     Celluloid acts much in the same way as the
thin gelatin, a column of water gradually rises and remains there.
The action of the guttapercha tissue is to absorb the hydrogen ; the
diffusion tube completely fills up with water and remains full withont
showing any tendency to fall for a couple of months, and then the
experiment was stopped.        With tracing paper diffusion occurs in
the ordinary manner, and the same happened in the single experi
ment tried with gold-beater's skin.        That the rise of the water
in the diffusion tubes is not owing to a mere absorption of the
hydrogen by the gelatin or guttapercha has been proved by placing
a considerable quantity of these bodies in a tube sealed up at one
end, filled with hydrogen and inverted over water ; after several
weeks no rise of the water in the tube occurred.        The above experi
ments have been repeated with the same results, but further trials
are being made. Possibly the metallic vapour is in a still finer
molecular state than ordinary hydrogen, and thus is able easily to
permeate a medium which hydrogen can only slowly get through,
and air cannot get through. At all events, this may be looked upon
for the moment as a working hypothesis.
   That the action of the metals like that of the organic bodies is
due to a vapour can be demonstrated by experiments exactly similar
to those already described.     For instance, it' the thin mica plates be
arranged above a zinc plate, in the way already mentioned, so as to
cut off all direct action between the zinc and sensitive plate, a ring
of action is produced which can only be accounted for by supposing
a vapour present, which has worked its way between the sheets of
mica and thus gained access to the photographic plate.           Again, a
piece of Bristol board can be made active by contact with, or mere
proximity to, a piece of polished zinc.       A striking instance of this
arose in the following way : a piece of perforated zinc had lain
on the bottom of an ordinary plate box for a considerable length of
time, probably about two months ; the zinc was then taken away,
and a sensitive plate dropped into its place. On developing this
plate, a picture of the perforated zinc was obtained.       Other experi
ments of a similar kind have been made.           If the Bristol board be
not in direct contact with the zinc ; if a screen, with holes cut out in
it, be interposed, it will be found that the Bristol board where
exposed to the direct action of the zinc will become active, and will
give an exact picture of the holes or whatever design it may be
which has been cut out on the screen.         To produce this effect the

             Metals and other Bodies on a Photographic Plate.          109
cardboard has to be exposed to the zinc for fully six weeks. This
changing of the Bristol board does not take place satisfactorily
above    ordinary temperatures.       With other metals than zinc, these
changing effects have not as yet been obtained.
   Another experiment, which illustrates the way in which the
metals can act, is to take a piece of ordinary perforated zinc, polish
one side, and lay this polished side against a plate of plain glass in
a printing frame, then place the photographic plate against the dull
side of the perforated zinc, and leave it in the dark for three or four
days; then, on developing the plate, a reversed picture is obtained,
that is, the holes in the zinc will be represented by dark spaces, and
the zinc itself by light ones.      If the holes in the perforated zinc are
large,  they  are  represented by shaded circles, so that these pictures
are produced by the vapour emitted by the polished zinc which has
crept into the open spaces and thus gained access to the photo
graphic plate.       It has already been shown that the action exerted
by zinc passes more readily down a glass than down a paper tube of
 the same size ; this has been strikingly confirmed         by taking two
pieces of glass tubing 1 inch long £ inch in diameter ; inside one
a single coil of inactive paper was placed, and both tubes stood on
 a sheet of polished zinc, and a photographic plate rested on the
top of them.      They were then left for a week, and on developing the
plate, a black patch appeared above the tube without the paper,
 and no action was visible above the one with the paper.           Without
 removing    the  paper,  it was  painted  over  with  melted  paraffin, and
 again a photographic plate put on the top of the two tubes ; now
 two circular dark patches were produced of equal intensity.
    If the activity of the zinc depends on a vapour which it emits, it
 seemed possible that it could be carried along by a stream of air.
 In order to^try whether this was the case, a tube a foot long was
 packed with zinc turnings which had been amalgamated, and a
 stream of pure air pent through it.      The end of the tube was fixed
 into the side of a dark box and a sensitive plate with a screen upon
 it suspended above        thus no direct action could be exerted by the
                            it,
 amalgamated     zinc  on the plate.   The experiment was continued for
 four days, then, on developing the plate, a picture of the screen
 above where the tube entered the box was obtained, but at the other
end of the plate there was no action.
  The presence of mercury in this experiment was unsatisfactory,
and might account     for the result obtained, therefore an exactly
similar experiment was made, and zinc turnings alone were used and
a   plate   without   a    The experiment was carried on for a week,
                          screen.
and   itwas then found that   black patch had been produced imme
                                    a
diately above the end of the tube.   To be suro that this darkening
did not arise from the action of the air, the whole of the zinc was

   110     Dr. W.   J.  Russell.      On the   Action exerted    by certain
  removed from the tube and again the air sent through it for a,
  week, the sensitive plate showed no signs of any action, having taken
  place.
      To try whfcther any accumulation of the vapour, and hence an
  increase of action could be brought about by an increase of zinc
  surface, two small circular glass dishes were taken, about 1^ inches
  in diameter and      i  inch in depth ; into one a single disc of bright
  zinc foil was placed, and in the other twenty similar discs, then on
  the top of both vessels a photographic plate was placed.              The single
  disc was raised   on   a piece of  glass, so  both end  discs  were at  the same
  distance from the plate.         The discs were a little smaller than the
  glass  vessels, and,    owing   to  their not being quite flat, there was a
  space between each one. In two experiments there was no marked
  difference between the density of the pictures produced, the single
  disc produced as much effect as the twenty. A more direct way for.
 the passing off of the vapour was then made by catting a circular hole
 § inch in diameter through the centre of all the zinc discs, and now
 a very black central spot was formed by the twenty zincs, and of
 course there was a white spot with the single disc, so that the
 vapour accumulated to a considerable extent in this central space.
     It has already been mentioned that the statement in the former
 paper that mercury was the most active of the metals is incorrect.
 The error arose from not suspecting that a trace of any impurity
 would affect the activity of the mercury, and, consequently, not
 taking special precautions to insure its perfect purity. On repeat
 ing the former experiments with another sample of mercury it was
 found that no action occurred, which seemed very remarkable ;
 moisture was added, the temperature was increased, but still no
action took place ; the addition of a little zinc to the mercury was
 then tried, and it was found that this made the mercury excessively
active.     The presence of a very small quantity of zino is able to
effect   this  change, certainly less than l/300th per cent.                 It is
 very remarkable that so small an amount of the metal can cause so
strong an action on the photographic plate, for the exposure to the
vapour given off by such an amalgam need not, even at ordinary
temperature, be longer than two to three days.                   If othor active
metals    are dissolved     in pure mercury they      act  in  the  same way, at
all events, this applies to magnesium and to lead. If silver, on the
contrary, be added it does not render mercury active, nor does
sodium.      This action of mercury, which contains zinc or lead, the
most common impurities, is so readily recognised that it becomes a
valuable test for its purity, and a very interesting means of follow
ing the effect produced by any purifying process. A specimen of
mercury containing not more than 1/S00th per cent, of zino gave a
very dark picture ; this mercury was then treated first with sulph-

            Metals and other Bodies     On  a Photographic Plate.        J. 11
 uric acid and    afterwards, for three days, with nitric acid, and the
picture it then gave was very faint, and on repeating this purifying
process no picture at all was produced.        Again, a sample of mercury
containing     zinc  was carefully distilled.   The distillate gave a very
faint but very distinct picture.     Another sample of distilled mercury
also gave a faint picture.
    Temperature, as might he expected, affects greatly this activity
of the metals ; at 4° or 5° C. zinc has but little action on a photo
graphic plate.      Most of the foregoing experiments have be6n made
at about 17° or 18° C, and some, as specially noted, at 55° C.           The
Ilford special rapid plates have been used.
   It appears, then, from the above experiments that certain metals
have the property of giving         off, even at ordinary temperatures,
vapour which affects a sensitive photographic plate, that this vapour
can be carried along by a current of air, and that it has the power of
passing through thin sheets of such bodies as gelatin, celluloid,
collodion, &c, in fact, so transparent are theso bodies to the vapour
that, even after it has passed through them, it is able to produce clear
pictures of the surface of the metal from which it came. That much
remains     to discover with regard to this action of the metals is
obvious,   the   most active metals are not the most volatile.      Nickel is
very active, cobalt only very slightly so, copper and iron are practically
inactive.     I  hope before long to be able to bring before the Society
further developments of these curious actions, both of metals and
organic bodies.
   The foregoing experiments have been made in the Davy-Faraday
laboratory, and     I beg to thank the managers of the Royal Institu
tion for having allowed me to work in their laboratory.           My thanks
are  also due to my assistant, Mr. Block, for the very careful           and
intelligent way in which he has aided me with the experiments.
   March 24, 1898. — Additional      experiments    have been made with
active  organic substances,     in order to determine      to what class of
bodies   they    belong.    As already stated, linseed oil and turpen
tine were the     two substances first found to be very active organic
bodies, and following out these results it has been proved that
vegetable    oils in general have more or less this property of acting on
a  photographic plate.      Linseed oil, for instance, is very active, olive
                               Even samples of " pure
oil only very slightly so.                                "
                                                             linseed oil ob
tained  from the different artists' colourmen vary considerably in the
amount of action which they exert.         The boiled, or drying linseed oil,
has, at ordinary temperatures,       the same activity as the ordinary
oil, but under other conditions it appears there is some difference in
their action.      Another class of bodies, also called oils, namely the
 essential   oils, have been found to be very active substances.

112     Action of certain Metals,     §c,  on a   Photographic Plate.
Samples of commercial specimens of the following essential oils
have been tried : — Peppermint, lemons, pine, juniper, bergamot.
•winter   green, lavender, cloves, eucalyptus,           cajepnt, and cedrat,
and were all found to be active, and not only when used by
themselves, but also when dissolved in a large amount of pure
alcohol.     It is well known that the active substances in the essential
oils are bodies known as terpenes, and I have to thank Dr. Tilden for
supplying me with pure specimens of these bodies ; they are all of
them remarkably active.         Paraldehyde and benzaldehyde are also-
very active bodies.      Ordinary aldehyde and formaldehyde, as they
have been at present applied, are only slightly active.             Guaiacum,
both when in powder and in alcoholic solution, is active, and so are
powdered cinnamon, sweet spirits of nitre, and eau de cologne.
Brandy is slightly so. Now the important property belonging to all
these bodies is their reducing or oxygen-absorbing power, hence the
conclusion that it is this property which enables them to act on the
photographic plate.         The mineral oils, purified petroleum spirit,
aloohol, ether, the esters, such as ethyl acetate, benzene, nitrobenzene,
are all, when pure, unable to produce any effect on a sensitive plate,
and even oxidised bodies nearly related to the terpenes, such as ter-
pinol and camphor, are not active, neither is thymol. Terebene is
an exceedingly active body.        The difference of activity of the ordi
nary oils seems to follow their oxygen-absorbing power, at all events it
is so with regard to linseed and olive oils, for the former is the most
active of the oils, and 1 gram of it is said to be capable of absorbing
 186 c.c. of oxygen, while the same weight of olive oil can absorb
only 8-2 c.c. It is also interesting to note that, at least with some of
these active bodies, results can be obtained which correspond to
what photographers term solarisation or reversal, the action, when
modified, giving a black picture, when carried to its full extent a
white one.
    It has   already been stated that a mere trace of zinc makes mer
cury active, but it is certainly equally curious and unexpected that
a trace of zinc should make alcohol active.        It is only necessary to take
pure   alcohol    and place  in it some  strips  of  bright zinc foil, leaving
the metal in for three or four days.          It will then be found that the
alcohol can act strongly on a photographic plate.            The same happens
with ether and with ethylacetate, bnt not with benzene. In addition
to zinc, cadmium, magnesium, aluminium, and fusible metal can act
 in the same way, whereas lead, nickel, tin, silver, sodium, and, as far
as experiments have gone, all the inactive metals, have no such
power.     This reaction is still being investigated, but certain it is
that careful filtration does not remove this activity from alcohol, nor
 does  distillation entirely destroy it.

    § 1.   The experimental investigation described in this communica
tion had      as its primary object the elucidation and measurement of
the variations of Volta contact electricity of a pair of conductors, due
to changes         in the state of that portion of the surface of each
conductor which was separated from the other conductor by an insulating
medium.
    § 2.   The discovery of contact electricity of dry metals in air by
Volta at     the beginning of the present century, extended a quarter of
a century later by Pfaff to dry varnished metals in other gases, has
been confirmed          by many subsequent experimenters.                The reality of
the electrostatic       force in air near an interface between copper and
zinc, inferred as an obvions consequence from it by Lord Kelvin, was
experimentally demonstrated by him in 1861*.                    In the next twenty
Tears many investigations were made, the more important being
those of Hankel, Gerland, Clifton, Ayrton and Perry, and von Zahn.
In 1881 a paper of great importance was published by M. Pellat,t
and as tho present communication                   is, in some respects, only an
amplification       and    extension    of  his work,  it may be of advantage to
give a short resume of it before going further.
    M. Pellat's most important results appear to be (1) his demonstra
tion of the influence of the physical condition of the metallic surfaces
 on their Volta-potential ; thus he found that a sharply scratched
 plate is positive to a more smoothly polished one of the same metal,
 the metals being washed with alcohol after polishing in both cases
 and allowed to dry before the measurement                  of their potential ; (2)

 his measurements       of the temporary variations of potential due to
 change of temperature of a copper, iron, or zino plate ; and (3) his
experiments which prove the smallness of the changes produced in
 the potential-difference     of copper and zinc by varying either the
 pressure or the nature of the gas surrounding them.
    § 2a.   I shall now give a short summary of the results detailed in
 the present paper : —
    (a) Metals covered       with non-conducting solid films of wax or
 glass, except   at their point of contact, give nearly the same potential
 as the bare metals in air.       The substitution of wax for air next the
 metal only causes a small change which may be in the same direction
 and of approximately equal amounts for metals whose potentials in air
 are very different ; e.g., the Volta-potential-difference between zinc and
copper when both are coated with solid paraffin wax is very nearly
the same as that between bare zinc and copper.            In this connection
I may mention that I have measured the potential of sodium coated
with wax and glass, and find it to be about 3"56 volts positive to a
standard gold plate.
    (b) A metal cleaned by careful polishing and scratching with
emery-paper or glass is less positive when its surface is in a sharply
scratched condition than when smoothed or burnished, the difference
frequently amounting to 0-2 or 0-3 of a volt.
   This result is not in opposition to. that of M. Pellat mentioned
above (§ 2 (1)), for the conditions were different, as his plates were
washed with alcohol after polishing, while mine were not (see
Chap.    Ill, and also §§ 39 et seq.).
    (e)  The  temperature variations, between 15° C. and 60° C, of the
Volta-potential of many metals have been determined, both for clean
dry metals in air and for metals coated with liquid or non-conducting
solid films ; and it has been found that they are of considerable
magnitude in both cases.         The curves representing the variation of
potential   with  temperature    appear as if they should meet at a point
below —200° C, at a potential about 04 volt positive to a standard
gold plate at 16° C. ; this suggests that Volta-potential-differences
may possibly vanish at a very low temperature (see Chap. IX).
    (<i) A liquid film, even if of extreme thinness, may cause a consider
able change in the potential of a dry polished plate, which continues
permanent for many hours and even days after the disappearance of
the film.
   Two films of the same liquid opposed to one another on the surfaces
of two plates of different metals do not usually give zero potential-
difference, as solid conducting films of one material would do, but
give nearly the same potential-difference as the dry metals on which
they lie (see Chaps. VI and VII).
   (e) A very thin film of oxide on a metal           produces only a very

                        On Contact Electricity-   of Metals.                  115
small change      in the potential, and every increase in thickness of the
film  is attended       by a further change in potential until a limiting
value    is   reached, which is that of a mass of the oxide (see
Chap.    TV).                             >
   (/) Exposure to the atmosphere at ordinary temperatures does
not, as a rule, produce any rapid change in Volta-potential, especially
if the air be comparatively dry and free from dust.                           The
ultimate change is usually in the negative direction (see Chap. V).
   (g)   I  have extended Lord Kelvin's experiments on the effect of
temporary immersion of a metal in a gas to the cases of copper, zinc,
tin, and silver in oxygen, and find that copper, zinc, and silver
become temporarily positive, while tin becomes negative in consequence
of this treatment (see Chap. VIII).
   The research, suggested by Lord Kelvin, was carried out in the
Natural Philosophy Laboratory of Glasgow University during the
Sessions 1893-94-95, and during 1895-96 in the Cavendish Laboratory
of Cambridge University.             My thanks are due to Lord Kelvin for
many suggestions          and much valuable advice, both in regard to
experiments       and    to  the discussion of results, and to Professor
J. J. Thomson for similar kindnesses during my work in the
Cavendish Laboratory.           A small portion of this investigation, on the
effect of Rontgen         s-rays on the contact electricity of metals, was

published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society for March, 1896.
   I have also to thank Professor James Holm, M.A.* and Mr.
George E. Allan, B.Sc, for the part they took in the earlier portion
of the work.
                            II. Method of Experiment.
    § 3.   The measurement of the natural potential-difference between
any pair of conductors was usually made, in air, by the null method
described very briefly by Lord Kelvin in the Report of the British
Association for 1880, p. 494. To make clear the exact circumstances
in which the potentials were measured it will be advantageous to
describe the apparatus        and general method of experiment in detail.
    § 4.   A circular     disc of one of the metals, usually about 9 cm.
in diameter and 0'2 cm. thickness,            is insulated and in permanent
connection with the insulated pair of quadrants of an electrometer.
 A similar plate of the other metal placed parallel to the first, at a
 distance    of a few millimetres from it, is uninsulated and in connection
 with the uninsulated pair of quadrants.           While in this position they
 are temporarily connected with one another through a simple form
 of potential-divider in which a slope of potential is maintained by a
    *

 Professor of Applied Mathematics in the South   African College,  Cape Town.  He
 died in October.                 --   •- ¦ -      '- ' - ' •   .<     J-

   Dauiell cell in the direction opposite to that given by the experi
   mental plates.    The temporary connection is now broken and the
  plates  are separated.  In doing so the capacity of the condenser is
  reduced, hence if there be any electric charge on them it will be
  indicated by a further deflection of the electrometer.   This operation
  is repeated with different values of the counterpotential until separa
  tion of the plates produces no change in the deflection of the
  electrometer.    Since it has annulled the charge, the counter-
  potential must now be equal and opposite to the natural potential-
  difference.
     § 5. During most of the experiments a piece of apparatus made
  by Lord Kelvin in or about 1861 was used. In it the plates were
  surrounded by a cylindrical zinc case.    This was made in two parts
  for convenience in manipulation, the lower fixed to a heavy cast-iron
  base plate, while the upper stood upon small brackets attached to
  the top edge of the lower part, its position being regulated by a
  hole-slot-and-plane arrangement.       Openings in the sides of the
  upper part facilitated the adjustment of the experimental plates, but
 these were closed by a sliding cover during a measurement of
  potential.
     The lower plate was supported by an insulating glass stem which
 was kept dry by means of pumice and sulphuric acid.        On the top of
 this stem was a brass cap screwed to fit the sockets which were
 soldered to the backs of the plates, and from the brass cap a stiff
 wire passed out through a hole in the case and formed the connection
 between the insulated plate and the electrometer.
     A piece of platinum foil was soldered round a part of this wire to
 give a clean contact for the temporary connection between the plates
 through the potential-divider, and the wire from the divider had
 likewise a platinum end piece.
     The upper plate hung, by a ring at the centre of its back, on a
 hook at the lower end of a vertical metal rod, which could be drawn
 up so as to increase the distance between the plates.      A small disc
 fixed on the rod at right angles to it just above the hook had three
 screws passed through it and pressed against the plate, holding it
firmly in the hook ; by this means the upper plate can be set parallel
 to the lower one in a very short time.    This apparatus, which is the
same as that used by Lord Kelvin in his experiments many years
ago, was found to be very convenient, the arrangements enabling ns
to take out and replace a plate very rapidly, a matter of great
importance when observing temporary variations, while at the same
time both plates were firmly attached to their supports when in
position.
    § 6. The divider, whose total resistance was about 2400 ohms,
was made to divide the potential-difference between its outer

                      On Contact Electricity   of Metals.                  117
terminals      into 100     equal   parts.   The potential     applied    -was
usually that given by      a Daniell cell of Lord Kelvin's     gravity type,
and was tested frequently by comparison with a standard Clark cell,
or by means of a standard resistance and a current balance.
   § 7. The permanent connections were as follows :
                                                           — (1) The lower
plate to the insulated pair of quadrants of the electrometer ; (2)
the terminals of the Daniell cell to the ends of the divider (there
was a reversing plug in this circuit) ; (3) one end of the divider to
the upper plate and uninsulated quadrants of the electrometer.
   The temporary connection (§ 5) was from the sliding contact piece
of the divider to the lower plate.
   § 8. Each experiment was as a rule begun by polishing a metal
plate on clean glass-paper        or emery cloth. Its contact potential
with a standard plate, generally of electrolytically deposited gold
washed some hoars previously with alcohol, as used by M. Pellat,
was then measured.        The plate was next subjected to some particular
treatment ; for instance it was filed, or burnished, or polished .on
leather or paper, or washed with water, alcohol, or turpentine, or
heated in air and oxidized, or not oxidized, or exposed to steam, or
oxygen, or fumes of iodine or hydrogen sulphide, or simply left to
alter under the influences of the atmosphere and its own molecular
forces.     Its potential with the same standard plate was again
measured,      and the change due to the treatment its surface had
undergone noted.
   § 9. The metal which requires to be joined to the zinc end of the
battery, in order to effect a balance, will be called positive. Thus
aluminium is positive to zinc and zinc positive to copper.               Also,
when a plate becomes more positive its potential will be said to rise ;
when more negative, to fall. When the " potential
                                                            " of a
                                                                      plate is
mentioned, without other qualification,     its contact potential-difference
with a standard plate (§ 8) is meant.
   § 10. The results given are not in the order in which they were
obtained, but are classified in such a way as to show more clearly
their true import, and those of many experiments, which are not
mentioned in the text, will be found in the tables.
   III.  Effects of different Methods of Cleansing the Metallic Surfaces.
    §  11. It  seems  probable that the very conflicting results obtained
 by different experimenters     for the potential-difference of any given
 pair  of  metals, in air, must be due, to a large extent, to differences
 in the methods by which the surfaces have been prepared.            In order
 to obtain a metallic surface as free as possible from all contamination
 it is clear that a hard polishing agent, such as a clean steel file, or
 emery-cloth, or glass-paper, must be used, as a softer material leaves

                                  '
more of itself on the plate.        A liquid is quite unsuitable, since every
particle of the metal probably retains particles of the liquid adhering
to it.   Thus the smell of a liquid remains long after the plate appears
to be quite dry ; and it has been found that such a film as must exist
to cause the odour is quite sufficient to alter the potential very
                       ¦
eonsiderably.
   § 12. In order to obtain uniformity of action the clean glass-paper
or emery-cloth nsed to polish' a plate was fixed on a wooden roller
made to revolve -with circumferential velocity of about 100 cm.
per second. Care was taken to hold the plate so that the scratches,
caused by the polisher, should all be parallel.            Thus little or no grit
could lodge in the suvface, which would have occurred had the
scratches crossed one another.            A record was kept of the nature of
the polishing agent in every case.            A piece of glass-paper, or other
polisher,  was  seldom    used    more    than   once or twice, and was never
used for any different metal.
   §, 13. M. Pellat found that every change in the smoothness of a
surface is accompanied by a change in its contact potential ; but as
his experiments were limited to metals washed with alcohol, it was
of interest to extend them to more general cases.                 Thus a plate of
zinc which had been polished on clean glass-paper, and had therefore
a surface sharply scratched in parallel lines, was found to be
                                "
                                     0-70 volt
positive to the standard gold plate.           It   was next burnished with a
tool of hardened steel, and with the          same standard    plate it now gave
                                     0- 94 volt.
Two hours later the same plate gave
                                     0 92   volt,     ,
showing that      the1 effect 'is nearly permanent.          By burnishing the
plate again a   finer  polish was obtained.          With the same standard the
potential' is now .

still further burnishing giving
                                     102 volt.     .
If  the zinc be now polished on glass-paper it returns to its original
potential.    Now steel, oE which the burnisher was made, is negative
to zinc ; hence this rise cannot have been due to particles of steel on
the zinc, but must have been caused by some change involved in the
smoothing process to which the zinc had been subjected,              possibly by
a hardening of the surface layer.

   § 14. Intermediate states of polish give intermediate               values of
potential.     For instance, if a zinc plate 'be filed it will iot be so
sharply scratched as it would be by glass-paper, and of course not so
smooth as if burnished.           Its potential is also found to be between
those of scratched and burnished zinc.              Each polishing, (with any
material, was nsnally sufficiently thorough to efface the effects of all
previous polishings : the potential observed thus depended only on
the state of surface produced by the polisher used just pefore the
observation.     The results of experiments           show that the Smoother
the surface the more positive        it becomes.
   § 15. The generalization given in § 14 is supported by the results
of over 100 similar experiments, with a number                    of! metals.
The actual results are given in Table I ; it will be well,! however,
to discuss some of these in, greater detail1 than is possible in tabular

Thus, smoothing by mutual friction made both more positive.                  The
amount of the change is not great, either •in potential or in smooth
ness, as it is very difficult to polish copper on copper, but the direction
of change is the same as previously found, namely, a smooth surface
is more positive than a sharply scratched one.

material of the polishing agent is eliminated by nsing the same tool
to produce different states of surface.     Thus a copper plate was
scratched very roughly with a steel tool, and gave
                                          -0 07   volt
with the standard plate, then burnished slightly with the                     same   tool
it gave
                                          -0 02   volt.
  It  had thus risen 0"05 volt on account of the alteration produced
in smoothing its surface. Thus these results also confirm the con
clusion given in § 14.
      § 18.   It    should   be     noticed           individual results
                                               that although
occasionally appear to conflict, the average value of the potential of
any given metal when polished with a certain agent is almost always
in proportion to the smoothness of the surface produced.        However
much one may try, it is impossible to get exactly the same state of
surface over again, but by taking the average of a considerable
number of experiments with one polishing agent, a general value is
got which represents the potential given by the plate in a certain
state of polish.   It is so arranged that the sharply scratched surfaces
come at the head of the table, and each succeeding polishing agent
in the list produces a smoother surface.
    § 19. It should be observed that with soft metals such as tin,
different polishers produce but little change in the contact potential.
This, though at first sight apparently contrary to the results for
harder metals, is really in accordance with them, for different
polishers do not produce appreciably different states of polish on a
soft metal.    This remark applies equally to the fact that a smaller
variation was observed with " high conductivity " copper than with
the old copper plate, as the old plate was found to be considerably
harder than the purer "high conductivity " copper.
     § 20. It is probable that the; variation described in this chapter
is not directly due to roughness or smoothness, but rather to altera
tion, either by change in the outer layer of the metal, or in the film
of condensed air which no doubt exists on                 it,

changes due to films of oxide of different thicknesses were studied                    ;
indeed this was the primary object of investigation suggested by
Lord Kelvin. But constant difficulties and ambiguities presented
themselves,  hindering the interpretation of even the simplest

research in order to remove or explain them.
     § 22. The experiments detailed below are among the most definite
of those carried out.           They show large changes in potential on
account of very thin films of oxide, and prove that the amonnt of
change is, dependent on the thickness of the film when below a
certain   limit.                                                        ., .     . . ..-

and heated on the back by means of a              very small blowpipe flame. Its
face   became slightly blistered, but not much discoloured, and when
cold   it gave with the other, which had not been altered in any
way,

the  " minus "      indicating that the upper is now negative.            This shows
a  permanent fall of 0*46 volt. due to heating in air.
     § 24. A plate of rolled zinc, which gave
                                       —0-04 volt
with another plate of the same material, was heated as in the last
experiment, but to a higher temperature, very nearly to its melting
point.      Its face became a streaky yellowish-brown, slightly purple
towards the centre (the brown parts turn purple if moistened).
 When compared, cold, with the clean plate it now gave
                                 '
                                       -0-79 Volt,            ...
a  fall of 0-75 volt. Thns this oxidized zinc plate has practically the
 stme potential as copper.           This great fall of potential does not take
 p'ace by exposure to the atmosphere at ordinary temperatures, unless
 possibly after the lapse of many years, for the potential of zinc
 plates which have been left unpolished for many months is only two
 or three tenths of a volt below that of clean zinc (see § 34).
     § 25. Similar experiments were made with copper.                   The film of
 oxide was gradually increased in thickness by repeatedly heating the
 plate, and the potential measured in each stage of oxidation, the plate
 being cold.       There was a change of about 0*03 volt . in the negative
 direction before the oxide-film became visible, and further increase in
 the thickness of the film was judged by the gradual change of colour,
 until the well-known dull purplish -black of massive copper oxide
 was attained.         The potential, measured each time when the plate
 was cold, gradually fell un^i I it reached a limit of about 0'30 volt

negative to a standard gold plate, which valne may therefore be
taken as the potential of a mass of copper oxide at 15° C. It may
be remarked that there are good reasons, which will be given in
Chapter IX, for supposing that oxidation does not commence in air
unless the temperature    of the plate be raised above 80° C.
    § 26. A plate of copper which had been polished on glass paper
and then on wash-leather gave
                                + 0-20 volt,
with a standard gold plate, and was next held in iodine vapour for a
short time. It looked moist at first, but quickly became dry.        In
this state it gave
                                -0-34 volt,
with the same standard, a change of 0'54 volt in the negative
direction.    The surface had a dull colour with a whitish " bloom "
on it, the tint resembling that of clean copper, though rather darker.
Exposure to iodine vapour thus makes the surface of copper
nearly as negative as continued exposure to the atmosphere at a
high temperature.
   § 27. The potential of a clean zinc plate fell about 0*12 volt when
it had been exposed to iodine vapour.
   § 28. The iodine compounds formed on the metallic surfaces were
not stable, as the appearance and potential of the plates altered con
siderably during twenty hours' exposure to the atmosphere.
   § 29. The effects of sulphur fumes, hydrogen sulphide, Ac., were
tried, but though in most cases considerable changes were observed,
the results obtained were not satisfactory.
                    V.  Atmospheric or Time Effects.
   § 30. A small variation of the potential is usually found to take
place during a short time after the plate has been polished, and before
it has settled down to a more or less permanent value. This is partly
due to the fact that the plate has been slightly warmed during
polishing, and takes some time to come to the atmospheric temperature
(see Chap. IX).     As regards changes which are not due to variation
of temperature, I shall give some typical experiments in the following
sections of this chapter.
   § 31. Two plates of "high conductivity" copper were polished on
fine glass-paper, and several experiments by burnishing them by
mutual friction were then made (see § 16).          Forty-seven minutes
after the original polishing, their potentials with the standard plate
were
                            (a) +0-035 volt.

                    On Contact Electricity      of Metals.                 125
The plate (a) was left in the apparatus all night, that is to say, in a
position sheltered from dust, and in air partially dried by the
sulphuric acid in the lower part of the case; the potential next
morning, 20 hours 3 mins. after the measurements given above, was
                               + 0 045 volt
with same standard plate. It was thus nearly constant.              The plate
(i) was left in a rack in the laboratory without special protection,
with the result that next morning the potential, owing to exposure to
the air of the room for about 20 hours, had fallen to
                               -0 056     volt,
a change of — 0-001 volt.     The plate (6) was now placed             in the
apparatus, and remained nearly constant for 2 hours at least.            Plate
(a)  was  left  in the rack, and  its  potential  fell 0'065 volt  in about   2
hours.    It is thus evident that   at  ordinary temperatures     in  a rather
dry atmosphere, and in a place protected from dust and light, the rate
of variation of the contact-potential      of copper is very small ; in an
exposed place, however, it is no means negligible.
   § 32. A plate of block tin was polished on glass-paper.                  Its
potential varied with time as follows, the time being counted from
the completion of the polishing : —

The plate was kept in the apparatus all the time and its potential
taken with a standard gold plate.
   § 33. In another experiment a tin plate polished on the finest
glass-paper gave, after 0 hours 15 mins.,
                               + 0-525 volt.
After  23 hours 30 mins. it gave
                               + 0-535 volt.
   This experiment     was made in       June, while the previous oncjwas
 made in December.      Hence probably the greater rate of variation in
 the former was due to a moister and less pure atmosphere.

            the earlier experiments
          39.                          was found that, as rule, copper

polished on glass-paper or emery-cloth was about O20 volt negative to
the standard alcohol-washed gold plate.
   On comparing this value with M. Pellat's resnlts* found that his           I
value for copper was abont 0-20 positive to the same standard.      at                                       1

a copper plate was carefully polished on glass-paper.   It gave, with

   § 42. The results of many -similar experiments made with -alcohol
and other liquids on gold, silver, zinc, copper, iron, tin, lead, and
aluminium will       be found in Table   II.    It is notable  that . in almost
every case the contact-potential of a metal which has been polished
on a hard dry material rises at least O'lo volt in consequence
                                                                              o^
alcohol washing, and that this change is nearly permanent for many
hours after the plate appears to be quite dry.
    § 43. It may be remarked that, as M. Pellat appears to have
invariably washed the metal with alcohol before making a measure
ment of its potential, his results do not apply directly to metals which
have been cleaned by means of a hard dry agent only.              Even in the
experiment which he gives on pp. 79 — 80 of his paper as a proof thai
alcohol-washiDg does not permanently alter the potential of a clean
gold plate, he appears to have used a plate which had already been
 washed      with alcohol ; his result, therefore, does not prove that
alcohol-washing       makes no change in the con tact- potential of a clean
plate, but only that subsequent washings do not alter the state of
 surface, i.e., that the effect is nearly permanent.          This agrees with
 the results given above and in Table II.
     § 44. The alcohol film, whether in combination with the metal or
 not, must in any case displace the air from the surface of the plate.
 Other liquids seem to leave films in much the same way, though the
 change of potential is different for each liquid ; in some cases, e.g.
 turpentine on zinc and copper, it is in the positive direction for the
 positive metal and in the negative for the other.

sufficient to retain it if its depth were not more than 0'3. or 0"4 cm.
In other cases a shallow metal dish was used. The behaviour of
water puzzled me for some time, and made me realize the extreme
difficulty of obtaining a clean liquid surface. After some preliminary
experiments      I found that distilled water which has not been exposed
to the atmosphere gives fairly constant results when lying to a depth
of 0"2 cm. on one of the standard gold plates. When water on gold
formed the one plate and a dry standard gold plate (see § 8) the
other, the value found was O'lO volt, the water being negative. Thus
clean water in contact with gold is about O'lO volt negative to it.
The value found is quite different if the water has been exposed to the
air for some time, and is usually positive instead of negative to tho
standard plate.
   § 46. Air expelled from the lungs produces a very marked change
in the contact-potential of water.                 By blowing through a fine glass

 tube  which dipped under the surface of a layer of distilled water on a
 gold  plate, the potential was changed from
                                  -010    volt
 with  the standard plate to
                                  + 016 volt,
 and  remained at this latter value for more than half an hour, showing
 that the change was not due to a rise in temperature.          The curious
 point is that the change seems to be only in the surface of the liquid ;
 for when most of it was shaken off the potential fell to
                                  —0   05 volt,
 although the plate      was still wet all over.     This appears as if the
 alteration   were due to a surface film of oily or dusty matter on the
 water.    It was   found that distilled water which had been exposed to
 the  air of the room for   some time gave the same value as water which
 had  been breathed through.
    § 47. A lead plate and a flat circular leaden dish were scraped
 clean   with    a knife, and next morning, when compared with          each
other, they gave
                                  + 0-10 volt,
 the  plate being positive to the dish.     Water was now poured into the
dish until it was nearly full, 0'4 cm. deep, the potential remaining
 the same ; i.e., the lead plate gave with the water in the leaden dish,
                                   +0-10 volt,
 water   in leaden dish being negative.
    § 48.  The plate and dish were again scraped, and this time they
gave
                                   + 0-05 volt,
the plate     being positive.    Water was      next poured   into the dish,
which gave, with the dry lead plate,
                                   + 0-09 volt,
the water in the dish being negative as before.            The dish was now
removed, and a standard gold plate put in its place; with this the
lead plate gave
                                   + 0-52 volt,
the lead being positive.      Thus water in contact with lead is about
0-9 volt negative to dry lead.

And with both zinc and copper wet about
                                     1- 20   volts.
Their potential difference increased somewhat as the turpentine
dried up ; and when apparently quite dry its value was still at least
                                     1-20    volts,
the plates, however, smelt strongly of turpentine, showing that an
invisible layer remained on their surfaces.
   § 50. A. crystal of copper sulphate gave, with a standard gold
plate
                                     +0   02 volt,
copper sulphate positive.  This result was obtained in connection
with some  experiments on the contact-potential of an aqueous solu
tion of copper sulphate.  It was found that such a solution in a
copper dish gave abont + 0"07 volt with a dry standard gold plate,
the solution being positive.  Blotting-paper saturated with copper
sulphate gave about + 0*10 volt with the same standard plate.  As
no special precautions     were taken in these experiments to obtain
a perfectly pure liquid surface, one cannot, especially in view of the
changes described in § 46, be quite certain that they represent the
true potential of copper coated with a solution of its sulphate. They
agree, however, with Professors Ayrton and Perry's values for satu
rated and non-saturated solutions.
   § 51. One of the standard gold plates which had been polished
with Hollis's plate powder used dry gave, with a similar plate which
had a layer of alcohol on    it,
                                     -013     volt.
When the alcohol had dried up the value was
                                     -0-05 volt,
the polished plate being negative as before.
  §  52. The conclusion which     draw from the experiments described
                                      1
in this and the preceding chapter and in the tables is, that a layer of
liquid on    ametallic surface does not give, with     ametal separated
from     by air, definite potential-difference of its own, as in similar
        it         a
circumstances a solid conducting film would do, but merely adds       a

                      On Contact Electricity    of Metah.                   131
certain amount to that      of the plate on which it lies. Thns two differ
ent metals coated with layers of the same liquid do not, as a rule in
air, give zero potential-difference,     but usually give nearly the same
potential-difference    as the  dry metals. For instance, the potential of
lead with an alcohol layer O'l cm. deep on it is abont 0'13 volt higher
than that of dry lead, while that of wet copper is about the same
amount higher than the average value for dry copper.               There is no
tendency shown for a liquid film to take up a definite potential inde
pendent of that of the metal on which it lies, with any metal sepa
rated from it by a dielectric, as a solid conducting film would do.
This seems to be the most important distinction between solid and
liquid conductors, and it is in accord with what is known of voltaic
cells; for if the potential-differences      in the chain copper-water-zinc
were equal and opposite to that of zinc-copper, as copper-iron-zinc is
to zinc-copper, we should have no electromotive           force in the circuit,
when the materials are all at one temperature.                 In most of my
experiments     the type is copper- water-noncondnctor (air) -water-zinc,
and not copper-water-zinc        ; the members of the first and last pairs
are in contact, while a non-conduotor intervenes between the two free
water surfaces, these being able to take up their natural contact-
potential-differences with the metals they touch ; but the sum of the
potentials, copper-water and water-zinc, is not equal to copper-zinc,
thas proving that the two free surfaces of water are not at the same
potential.     This is directly demonstrated by the experiments of
 Professors Ayrton and Perry, and by the results given in Chaps. VI,
VII, and X of this communication.
    If the intervening layers of non-conductor be removed by joining
the liquid surfaces so that there is but one mass of liquid between
the plates, conduction at once tends to reduce the whole liquid to the
same potential,      leaving   the contact-potential     differences,   now  un
balanced     by the removal of the non-conducting medium which was
capable of sustaining the stress, to act as external electromotive
force.     This then shows the connection between contact-potentials,
measured electrostatically by the method described in this paper, and
the electromotive force of a voltaic cell.
    § 53. The contact-potential       of a liquid with a metal is clearly, if
the air-potentials be neglected, the difference between the potential
of the dry metal and that of the metal when wet with the liquid; the
 same standard plate being used as zero of potential in both cases.
 The results given in the tables must no doubt be in some cases com
plicated by the formation of solid compounds in the interface between
 liquid and metal, so that the liquid is no longer in contact with clean
 metal, and the liquid must also displace any film of condensed air
 which may exist on the metal.          The latter influence will be discussed
 in   Chaps.  VIII  and  X.

    § 54.    The potential of a metal is usually altered by soaking the
plate   in   a gas other than air.          If the gas be oxygen, this alteration
is as a rule only temporary, and apparently depends on the formation
of a surface film, or rather on a change in the film which doubtless
already exists.        It will be shown that the change of potential of zinc

 doe to    soaking in oxygen is nearly equal to that of copper ; hence
the  film of oxygen acts like a liquid film (Chap. VII), but its effect
is less permanent.        Previons experimenters, except Lord Kelvin,
appear to have neglected the existence of these films, and to have
looked only to the nature of the body of gas between the plates.               Of
course   I  do not here allude to the          "
                                                 double-layer
                                                               " which has been
offered as an explanation          of the phenomenon, bat to a layer in
mechanical and electrical contact with the metal.                 If the contact-
potential of two metals immersed in a gas were the sum of the
potential-differences between each metal and a skin of gas close to it,
we should have no slope of potential in the body of the gas between
the plates.      That a slope does exist, however, is proved by Lord
Kelvin's earliest experiments with the divided ring of copper and
zinc.     In this connection Dr. Bottomley's research on contact-
electricity in high vacua * is of great importance as showing that
the volta-potential of metals is not sensibly different in different
gases so long as the metals are not chemically affected, and is not
sensibly altered by a great rednction of pressure.               The body of the
gas may possibly have some influence, but the variations which have
frequently been attributed to it may usually be more satisfactorily
explained as being due to change in the film in contact with the
metallic surface.       In the case of a gas which acts vigorously on the
metal at ordinary temperatures,               the film is permanent, and is
probably a solid compound ; in other cases it is not permanent, and
hence probably not sclid.
   § 55. In 'Nature' for 1881, Lord Kelvin describes some very
important experiments on this subject.                As these appear to be but
little known      I  shall   give some extracts from his paper before
describing my own results.             Under the date November 23, 1880,
Lord Kelvin says : — " I have found that a dry platinum disc, kept
for some time in dry hydrogen gas, and then put into its position in
dry atmospheric air in the Volta-condenser,                  becomes  positive to
another platinum disc which had not been so treated, but had simply
been left undisturbed in the apparatus.                The positive quality thus
produced by      the  hydrogen        diminishes     gradually, and becomes in
sensible after two or three days.                 —
                                            P.S. On December 24, 1880, one
of the platinum plates in the Volta-condenser was taken out ; placed
in dried oxygen gas for forty-five minutes ; taken out, carried by
hand, and replaced in the Volta-condenser at 12.30 on that day.                 It
was then found to be negative to the platinum plate, which had been
left undisturbed.      The amount of the difference was about 0-33 of a
volt.     The plates were left undisturbed for seventeen minutes in the
condenser, and were tested again, and the difference was found to
have fallen to 0 29 of a volt. At noon on the 25th they were again

tested,  and the difference fonnd to be 0P18.        The difference had been
tested from time to time since that day, the plates having been left
in the condenser undisturbed in the intervals. The following table

   After detailing some experiments in which the plates were coated
with the gases by electrolysis, Lord Kelvin concludes : " Thus in the
case of polarization by oxygen, as well as in the case of polarization
by hydrogen, the effect of exposure to the dry gas was considerably
greater than the effect of electroplating the platinum with the gas by
the electromotive force of one volt."
   The large effects on contact-potential produced by films formed
from gases are clearly shown in these experiments of Lord Kelvin's.
It is well known that platinum and other metals have the property
of occluding large quantities of gas in their surface layers, and that
the condensed gas is possibly in the liquid state, which would account
for the similarity between the effects of liquids and of gases on
metals.
   §  5C.  Tho plates with which my first experiments on this subject
                                                "
 were   made   were of " high conductivity         copper.     They had. been
polished on fine glass-paper 5 hours before, and their mutual
potential had remained constant at
                                  0-02  volt
for 4 hours.    The lower plate was then put into a glass vessel, into
which oxygen gas was admitted from a cylinder, and the oxygen,
 which was of Messrs. Brin's manufacture, guaranteed 93 — 95 per cent,
oxygen (nitrogen is usually the only impurity), was allowed to stream
through the glass vessel containing the plate for some minutes, and
the exit and inlet of the vessel were then closed. Forty-five minutes
later the plate was taken out and its potential again measured with
the other plate, which had remained in air during the interval.
 Counting time from the moment at which the plate was taken out of

Thus the effect of increasing the proportion           of oxygen in the surface
film was to make the copper more positive.
    § 57.   This variation is in the opposite direction to that found by
Lord Kelvin for platinum which has been soaked in oxygen.                     In
order to make sure that this difference was not the effect of some
imparity in the oxygen,         I  repeated his experiment, obtaining the
same result as he had obtained.              This shows that the result given
above was not likely to be due to an impurity which had influenced
the action of the oxygen.
    § 58. Without any further treatment the same copper plate was
placed     in the bell-jar and the oxygen admitted.                   After 45
minutes it was taken out and its potential again measured by com
parison with the other plate.         The results are given in the following
table, time being counted from the moment the plate was taken out of
the oxygen : —
                             Time.          Contact-potential.

                           0      29               0 06
    The experiment was discontinued before the plate had returned to
its original value ; bnt it would no doubt have done so in a few hours,
for the amount of change, and its rate, are almost exactly the same as
in   the former experiment (see § 56).
    § 59.  In the following experiment         the conditions were somewhat
varied.     A copper plate was polished on glass-paper.           It gave, with
a standard copper plate,
                                    -0-05 volt.
 A jet of oxygen was now              sent against its surface for      2  or  3
 minutes,   and with the same standard plate         it now gave
                                    -0-06 volt.
 It   was then   left in oxygen for 25 minutes, and on being taken out
 gave

which shows that its immersion had raised its potential 0-12 volt. I
now warmed      it with a soldering-bolt applied to its back. When
about 47° C. (see Chap. IX) it gave
                           Time.           Contact-potential.

its potential thus coming back to very nearly the original value.
    This experiment shows : (1) that the change requires considerable
time; for even a fairly strong jet of oxygen playing on the plate for
2 or 3 minutes produces no appreciable effect, while 25 minutes
in still oxvgen causes a rise of 0-20 volt; (2) that gentle heating
does not produce a rise, as it would do with clean unoxygenized copper
 (see Chap. IX), but it must be remembered that the copper was,
when heat was applied, already above the potential to which heat
alone would have raised it; hence this experiment does not show any
connection between temperature-variation and density of oxygen
 film, as might at first sight be supposed.
    § 60. A zinc plate which had been polished on glass-paper gave
with a standard copper plate
                           0"81   volt, zinc positive.
 It was then put into oxygen and left for 15 minutes. After being
 taken out, its potential was again measured with the same standard
 plate, and was as follows : —
                             Time.          Contact-potential.
                        Hrs.    Mins.             Volt.

                           4      35               0 85
 This shows that zinc also is more positive after immersion in oxygen.
     § 61. The same zinc plate was again polished on glass-paper and

                                    +070 volt.
It was now put into oxygen for              10 minutes, and       after being taken

a copper plate

tin being positive.      Fifteen minntes later the potential of the plates
had not altered.       I now put the         tin into the bell-jar and turned on
the oxygen.    After  it  had  soaked for 47 minutes it was taken out and
compared with the same copper plate.               It gave
                            Time.             Contact- potential.

                           0    35      .,
Thus the variation of tin appears to be            in the negative direction, like
that of platinum.

and remained constant      during an hour. It was then put into oxygen
for 15 minutes, and when taken out its potential was fonud to be

After it had been 24 minutes in oxygen it gave in air
                                 + 0 015 volt,
and 12 minutes later
                                 +0  010 volt,
showing that the pptential had in 24 minutes in oxygen become O'llO
more positive.
   § 65. It is noticeable that the amount of change in these experiments
on silver is to some extent proportionate to the time of exposure to
oxygen.     Thus, in § 63, 15 minutes in oxygen caused a rise of 0'06
volt; while, in § 64, 24 minutes in oxygen caused a rise of O'll volt,
bat there is no doubt a limit to the change.
   § 66. In searching      for an explanation       of the temperature-
variations described in Chapter IX, I compared them with those given
above. In the case of copper, the oxygen-film variation is in the same
direction as the temperature-variation of copper in air, which suggests
the possibility of the latter being caused by an increase of the pro
portion of oxygen in the film at higher temperatnres on account of a
greater attraction between the elements.        The same reasoning holds
as regards zinc and tin, but the results for silver are in direct
opposition ; while the farther experiments described in Chapter X,
 which show that the temperature-variations       exist in cases where air
is entirely excluded from the metallic surface, render such an ex
planation very doubtful.          Probably, therefore, the temperature-
variation is the more general of the two, it being a change in contact-
potential of the metals, which, if they are exposed to a gas, may be
complicated by alteration of the surface-film.
                       IX.   Temperature Variations.
   § 67. A large number of determinations were made of the variation
of contact- electricity with the temperature of the conductor.        This
was done by heating one plate while the other was kept cool, and
their potential-difference    was measured from time to time as the
warm plate was cooling, their temperatures being observed at the
same time.      In the diagrams, the absciss© represent temperature
and the ordinates potential ; each curve, therefore, shows the tem
perature-variation of the contact-potential of        a  particular metal.
For instance, the potential represented by the point which corre
sponds to 16° C. on the gold line is called zero in this and the other
chapters of the present communication.         Thus a standard gold plate
(see § 8) at 40° C. is 0"04 volt negative to one at 16° C, and an
aluminium plate at 40° C. is 0'10 volt, positive to aluminium at 16° C,
or 1'20 volts positive to a gold plate at 16° C.
   It must be remembered that unless stated otherwise these varia

                        On Contact     Electricity of Metals.
tions are     for metals in air. In the experiments described in Chapt er
X, however, the metallic surfaces were protected by solid non
conducting films, and were not in contact with the atmosphere ;
nevertheless, temperature-variations            were found, which in the case
of silver were actually larger than those which took place in air.
    § 68. One of the copper plates used was hollow and conld be
filled with water and a thermometer               inserted, but with the other
plates   other methods of measuring temperature had to be adopted.
In some cases the temperature              was measured thermo-electrically,
while in others a simpler and more rapid mode of measurement was
tued,    which, though not very accurate, is quite reliable within
certain    limits.
    § 69.   By touching the back of the plate I found that its tempera
ture could be judged as "tepid," "slightly warm," "warm," "very
warm," and so on.            It was found experimentally that these terms
correspond to constant temperatures ; or rather that each term
denotes a small range of temperature,              the middle point of which
may     be   taken as corresponding to the term.            In determining the
ralnes   of these terms a plate was used in which a thermometer was
inserted.        One observer touched the plate with the tips of the
first and       second fingers and judged its state, naming it by one
of the   terms, "warm," "tepid," Ac; the other observed the ther
mometer, and the temperatures found to correspond to each term are
as  follows    : —
             Cold                                                   16° C.

    This method       of measuring      temperature    is rough and ready, but
since the     possible errors are within limits of a very few degrees, one
only requires to take the average of a considerable number of results
m order to arrive at a very fair approximation to the true values.
In experiments on contact electricity in air there are so many possible
causes     of disturbance that extremely accurate measurement of the
temperature is       of little  use, especially if it require that much time be
 spent   over each reading.

   § 70. As a rale the upper plate was heated, in order that the
lower plate might not be affected by draughts of hot air, as would
have been the case if the lower had been hot and the upper cold.
Sometimes, during the time of cooling, the upper part of the
apparatus, including of course the upper plate, was removed after
each observation and was replaced only the moment before the next.
In other experiments the upper plate was merely drawn up as far as
possible (about 10 cm.) to prevent its warming the lower one. The
temperature of the lower plate was also observed, but as a rule it
varied only a very few degrees.
   § 71. At first I used to apply a hot soldering bolt to the back of
the plate in order to heat          it,
                              but latterly heated two or three small
                                                   I
blocks of tinned copper and placed them on the back of the
upper plate. By this second method        was possible to observe the
                                                 it
variation of the potential during the rise as well as the fall of
temperature.
  §   72.    In attempting              the temperature-coefficient
                               to determine                          of
copper we were long baffled by cnrions anomalies. Sometimes the plate
was positive when hot, other times negative, and occasionally       did   it
not vary at all. The clue to this was found in observing that during
one experiment while the copper was cooling      was at first positive,
                                                        it
then negative, and then    gradually becamo positive again, though
                               it
never quite reaching its original value.
  Now      had been found that copper oxide
            it                                 negative to copper,
                                                            is
and that     became temporarily more negative when hot hence
                 it                                                   ;        it
was guessed that the successively positive and negative variation
must be due to hot clean copper being positive to cold copper, but
that  had finally become oxidized and therefore negative whether
      it
hot or cold, the small permanent change being due to the thiu
coating of oxide formed.
  §  73. The copper was heated much      more gently next time, and
gave the expected result that clean copper becomes rapidly more
positive as its temperature rises, and that, on cooling, its potential
returns to its original value unless the temperature has exceeded a
certain limit. If this limit has been exceeded its potential rapidly
becomes   negative and does not return to its original value.
 §    74. At ordinary atmospheric temperatures the surface of clean
copper remains     for a long time almost analtered either visibly or
electrically (seo    31), and the film which ultimately forms on the
                        §
surface cannot be pure copper oxide, because the potential of tarnished
copper      higher than that of copper oxide obtained by heating in
            is
air.  If, however, the temperature of the copper         raised to about
                                                                 is
80° C. it immediately begins to oxidize, though heating to a tempera
ture below this limit does not rapidly produce any permanent change.
Thus there      asis,  were, an ignition point for copper and oxygen in

 §   75. Ishall now give a specimen experiment. The two standard
gold plates gave

heated the upper when

It                                                     (57° C.) and gave
                                  —0 06 volt.
                                   " tepid"
When         had cooled down to             (35° C),
        it                                              it   gave
                                  -0 04 volt.
When     "cool" (28° C),
                                  -0-03 volt.
Some hours later, when both plates were cold, they gave as at               first
                                  -0-02 volt.
  Hence the potential of gold which has been washed with alcohol
and  allowed to dry falls temporarily about 0"0016 volt per degree
centigrade rise of temperature.
 §   76. Most of the temperature   experiments on copper were made
with the hollow plate previously mentioned, which was filled with
hot water in which the bulb of   thermometer was placed.
                                    a                      In many
of   the experimentson zinc, and also on aluminium, a thermo-electric
arrangement was used, and the results obtained with       do not differ
materially from those obtained by the above method         69).(§ it

and other details are noted on the diagram.
 §   77. The diagram gives the temperature-variations    of all the sub
stances studied.   The curves in     are plotted by taking the results
                                        it
for each metal    of those experiments which are most free from all
complication   or cause of doubt.     If the curves be prolonged in the
direction of lower temperature they appear to meet somewhere below
—200° C, and probably asymptotically to the line representing 0'4
volt positive to standard plate at 16° C.      Within their range they
show contact-potential-differences     diminishing with lowered tem
perature.    The only apparent exceptions are clean copper, and
silver coated with glass     ;but both their curves are distinctly bent
between 16° C. and 50° C, so that probably they are directed towards
the same point as the others at lower temperatures.     Thus    appearsit

 X.   Elimination of Metal-Air Potentials by Solid Non-conducting Films
                                  on the Metallic Surfaces.
    §   79. As very great differences of opinion seemed to exist as to
 the   part played by the layer of air which is close to the metallic
 surface,     I devised a method in which it should be removed and a film
 of solid non-conducting          material of a very different chemical nature put
 in its   place.      A  copper plate which had been polished on glass-paper
 »&9 filed with a clean dry file which had not been used for any other
 metal.       Its potential with the standard gold plate being
                                         + 0-045 volt.
     A   zinc plate was prepared          in an exactly similar way, and with the
  copper plate gave
                                          + 0-655 volt.

 144                       Dr.   J.  Erskin e-Mu n-ay .
 The copper plate was now gently heated with a bolt until it was hot
 enough to melt paraffin-wax ; the temperature, about 50° C, l-equired
 for this is not sufficient to cause sudden permanent change of the
 copper surface (see § 74).          Paraffin-wax was then poured on, and
 the plate was filed with its own file while covered with molten wax.
 Thus the fresh surface exposed by the filing came directly into
 contact with the wax. More wax was poured on and the filings
 drained off, the platfe remaining well covered with wax all the while.
 It was then allowed to cool, and gave with the bare zinc plate
                                    +0-555 volt,
 zinc being positive as before.        Thus the change due to substituting
 paraffin-wax for air next the copper is not more than + O'lOO volt.
 I now waxed the zinc in exactly the same way. When it was quite
 cool it gave with the waxed copper
                                    + 0-602 volt,
showing that waxing the zinc had raised its potential
                                   +0-047 volt.
 So, on the whole, the substitution cf wax for air on both copper and
zinc had only decreased their mutual potential by
                                   +0   053 volt
and the potential of the waxed plates remained nearly constant for
several hours.     The changes due to waxing the plates as given above
were confirmed by the independent comparison of each plate with the
standard gold plate.      It does not follow that even the small changes
which did occur were due solely to the substitution of wax for air, for
they may have been caused by slight changes in the surface on account
of the filing.
   § 80. An aluminium plate was coated with wax in the way
described in § 79, a knife being used to scrape the surface under the
molten wax.      When cold, this waxed plate gave with a bare zinc one
                                    + 0 36 volt,
which is about the usual value for bare aluminium and zinc.           The
removal of the air had therefore not appreciably altered the potential.
   § 81.   I now warmed the waxed aluminium slightly.         Its potential
with the zinc varied    as  follows : —
                     47° C                     +0  41 volt.

This gives   a variation of about

which is nearly the          same as       the   temperature-variation of bare
alamininm in air.
   § 82.    A  plate of silvered glass used with the glass side facing a
standard plate gave almost the same potential              as clean silver in air.
This plate,     which was practically silver coated with glass, gave a
temperature-variation lirger than that of silver in air.               In this case
we have glass in contact with the silver surface instead of air, but
the change does not alter the potential.             It may be mentioned that
the   back of the silver film was painted black, and not coated with
glass; but this is of small consequence, since it has been proved by
experiment that the condition of the back of a plate does not sensibly
affect the volta contact-potential        ; or, more generally,    that if parts of
a plate be    in different conditions, the potential observed will be the
mean   of the potentials of the different parts, the importance of each
part being     proportional to its capacity.
   § 83.    On account of the great attraction of sodium for oxygen, it
seemed of interest to measure its potential              in circumstances which
excluded that gas from the surface of the metal.                In order to effect
this two pieces of thin sheet-glass, each about 6 cm. square, were put
into a   dish of melted paraffin-wax together with some clean sodium,
and a   large drop of the sodium was put between the plates of glass
and squeezed out into a small plate of 2 or 3 square cm. area.                  The
glass plates, with sodium between them, were taken out of the melted
wax and allowed to cool.             Since the glass plates were of much
larger    diameter    than the sodium, the edges of the latter were pro
tected by the wax        which filled up the space between the plates not
occupied by sodium.          The flat faces of the sodium were apparently
in contact with the glass.         The sodium was connected to the elec
trometer     by a fine copper wire.            The greater part of the sodium
surface was bright or only slightly tarnished, and it remained in
almost the same condition for many days, being protected by the
glass   plates and by the wax which filled the space between them
unoccupied      by sodium.     The first measurements gave sodium
                                     2- 86  volts
positive to a tarnished      zinc plate, i.e., about
                                    3- 56   volts
positive    to the standard      gold    plate.    This potential   gradually    de
creased.
   § 84. Experiments were made to make sure that the result was
not due to temporary electrification            of the glass.      For instance    I
breathed     on the glass, causing a conducting         layer of impure water to
form on    its surface.     Repeated       measurements, made by the usual
method, showed        that the potential at      once  fell to a small  fraction of
   VOL.  lxiii.                                                            M

a volt, bat slowly rose again to nearly its original value as the film
evaporated.        This shows that the electrification was not a temporary
one of the glass surface, for that would not have returned to a
definite value.        Heating the plate by radiation or washing the glass
with benzol caused the potential to rise further, but in no case was
the potential quite so high as when the plate was first formed.             An
even more convincing proof that the potential measured was really
that of the sodium, was found in the fact that the sensibility of the
apparatus was such as would be given by a plate the siae of the
sodium.        If the electrification had been on the whole surface of the
glass, the sensibility, on account of the larger surface, would have
been at least ten times as great as that observed.
     § 85. The experiments described in this chapter show that (i)
when two metals are coated with the same non-conductor, such as
wax or glass, their potential is not sensibly different from that of the
bare metals in air ; (ii) that temperature-variation still takes place,
though air be excluded.           These results seem to prove that gaseous
films play no essential part in the phenomenon.

         F.R.S. Received February 14,— Read March 10, 1898.
     In my previous papers* I have given accounts of the double
 refraction and polarisation of electric waves produced by various
 crystals and other substances, and also by strained dielectrics.            An
 account was there given of the polarisation apparatus with which
 the effects were studied. In the present investigation effects had
 to be studied which were exceedingly feeble.                The apparatus had,
 therefore, to be made of extreme sensitiveness ; but the secondary
 •disturbances became at the same time more prominent, and the great
 difficulty experienced was in getting rid of these disturbances.
      In one of my communications I alluded to the fact that these
 secondary disturbances are to a great extent reduced when the radia
  tors are made small.        The advantage of a large radiator is the com
  parative ease with which the receiver can be adjusted to respond to
  the waves, but this advantage is more than counterbalanced by the
  increased     difficulty with   the  stray radiation and other disturbances.

 On   the other    hand, with small radiators, the difficulty is in the
 proper   adjustment    of the receiver. It then becomes necessary to
 have very exact       adjustments of the receiver, both as regards the
 pressure to which the sensitive spirals are subjected and the E.M.F.
 acting on. the circuit.       It is only after some practice that the
 peculiarity  of each receiver is properly understood, when it becomes
 easy  to  make     the necessary adjustments by which the receiver
 becomes    quite certain in action.    For various reasons the radiations
 emitted   by small radiators are more favourable for work requiring
great   delicacy.
   In order that the surface of the radiator should be little affected
 by the disintegrating action of the sparks, I use a single spark for
producing a flash of radiation.          There used to be, however, some
uncertainty     from a discharge occasionally failing to be oscillatory.
The cause    of this uncertainty is ascribed to the deposit of dust on the
sparking surface.        For greater certainty of action some observers
immerse the radiator in oil.         The use of oil is under any circum
stances troublesome.        This is specially so in polarisation experiments,
when the radiator has to be placed in different azimuths.           I have for
these reasons avoided the oil-immersion arrangement, and have tried
to secure certainty of oscillatory discharge without this expedient.
Attention was specially paid to the coil and the primary break.
A radiator has also been constructed         which is found to be extremely
efficient.   It consists of two platinum beads, each 2 mm. in diameter,
separated by 0-3 mm. spark-gap.           There is no interposed third ball.
This radiator, though kept exposed for days without any protecting
cover, was yet found to give rise to a succession of effective
discharges without a single failure.         I even went so far as to pour a
stream of dost on the radiator, in spite of which severe treatment,
the sparks were found to be quite effective in giving rise to electric
oscillation.
   The receiver, too, is perfectly certain in its action, and various
degrees of sensitiveness        may be given to it.         In the following
experiments, the sensitiveness had to be very greatly enhanced, and
this, as alluded to above, was secured by proper adjustments.             The
secondary disturbances were got rid of by careful screening.              But
one serious difficulty was encountered           at the very outset, in the
failure of the polariser to produce complete polarisation.         In my first
experiments on polarisation (the receiver then used not having been
very sensitive), polarisers made of wire gratings were found effective.
But in my later experiments with still more sensitive receivers,
I found that, owing probably to the want of strict parallelism of the
wires and the difficulty of exactly crossing the analyser and polariser,
it was impossible to produce total extinction of the field.             I then
made a polariser and analyser by cutting parallel slits out of two

148          Px-of.   J. C. Bose.         On the Rotation      of Plane of
square pieces of thick copper.            When the square pieces were adjusted
with coincident edges, the analyser and polariser were either exactly
 parallel or exactly crossed. This improvement enabled me to carry
 out successfully some of the more delicate experiments.                        In the
 present course of investigation the sensitiveness of the receiver had
to be raised to a still higher extent, and it was found that the
polariser hitherto found efficient failed to produce complete polarisa
tion, so that even when the polariser and the analyser were exactly
crossed the non-polarised portion of radiation was of sufficient
intensity to produce strong action on the receiver.
   In the paper " On the Selective Conductivity exhibited by some
Polarising Substances "* I described a book-form of polariser, when
an ordinary book was shown to produce polarisation of the trans
mitted beam, the vibrations parallel to the pages being absorbed, and
those at right angles transmitted in a polarised condition.                       The
advantage of this form of polariser was that the extent to which the
rays were polarised depends on the thickness of the polarising
medium.       Tho rays could thus be completely polarised by giving the
medium a sufficient thickness, this thickness being determined by the
intensity of the radiation used and the sensitiveness of the receiver.
The necessary thickness of the book-polariser may be materially
 decreased by making the book consist of alternate leaves of paper and
tinfoil. The book being then strongly compressed, blocks of suitable
size are cut out to form the polariser and the analyser.                Each of these
blocks is then enclosed in a brass cell, with two circular openings on
opposite sides for the passage of radiation. The size of the polariser
 I use is 6 x 6 cm., with a thickness of 4"5 cm. ; the aperture is
4 cm. in diameter.         These polarising cells I find to be quite efficient ;
when two such cells are crossed, the field is completely extin
guished.

    The diagram explains the general arrangement of         the apparatus,
 mounted     on an optical bench.      The spark gap of    the radiator is
 horizontal.    The polariser, with the leaves vertical,    is placed on a
 shelf attached to a screen of thick brass plate 35 x      35 cm.    In the
 centre of the plate     there is a circular opening 4 cm. in diameter ;
 this aperture may be varied by a series of diaphragms.          There is a
 second similar screen with a shelf for the analyser, which is placed
 with the leaves horizontal. Behind the analyser is the receiver.
    In the space between the brass plates is placed the substance to be
 examined.      Previous tests are made to see whether all disturbing
 causes   have been removed.        The sensitiveness of the receiver is
 occasionally   tested  by interposing one's fingers at 45° between the
 crossed polariser and analyser; this should, by partially restoring
 the field, produce strong action, provided the receiver is in a fairly
 sensitive   condition.
    Care should be taken that there are no metallic masses between
 the screens, as reflection from metals is fonnd to produce
                                                                 "
                                                                   depolari-
 sation," the rays being then elliptically polarised.    The substance to
 be   examined should hot, for very delicate experiments, be held by the
 hand, owing to the disturbing action of the fingers.      It is preferable
 to have   the substances     supported on stirrups made of thin paper.
 The above are some      of the main precautions to be taken in carrying
  out  the following experiments, where the effects to be detected are
 very   small and therefore likely to be masked unless all disturbing
 causes are carefully excluded.
    I  have in a previous     communication made mention of the double
 refracting property     of  fibrous substances like jute.     The field is
 restored when a bundle of jute is placed at 45° between the crossed
 polariser and analyser.       There is, however, no depolarisation effect
 when the axis of the bundle is parallel to the direction of the ray.
    I now took three similar bundles, A, B, and C, of parallel fibres of
jute 10 cm. in length and 4'5 cm. in diameter.       No change was made
in the bundle A, which was kept as a test one.        The bundles B and
C were then twisted, B in a right-handed direction and U in a left-
handed direction.
    The interposition of the untwisted bundle A between the crossed
polariser and analyser did not produce any effect, but strong
action was produced in the receiver when the bundles, twisted to the
right or to the left, were so interposed.       It thus appeared as if the
twisted structures produced an optical twist of the plane of polari
sation.
    The further experiments to be described below may be of some
interest in connection with the optical rotation produced by liquids.
Here two different classes of phenomena may be distinguished : —
    (1) The rotation induced by magnetic field; this rotation among

150            Prof.  J. G. Bose.      On   the  Rotation of Plane of
other    things is dependent          on the direction and intensity of the
magnetic      field, and  is doubled   when the ray is reflected back.
    (2) The rotation produced by saccharine and other solutions,
when the rotation is equal in all directions and simply proportional
to the quantity of active substance traversed by the ray ; the rota
tion in this case is neutralised when the ray is reflected back.
    The difficulties in the way of explaining the rotation produced by
liquids are summarised in the following extract.
    " It is, perhaps, not     surprising that crystalline substances should,
on account of some special molecular arrangement, possess rotatory
power, and affect the propagation of light within the mass in a
manner depending on the direction of transmission.                  The loss of this
power when the crystalline structure is destroyed, as when quartz is
fused, is consequently an event which would be naturally expected,
but the possessiou of it in all directions by fluids and solutions, in
which there can not be any special internal arrangement of the mass
of the nature of a crystalline structure, is not a thing which one
would have been led to expect beforehand.                 To Faraday it appeared
to be a matter of no ordinary difficulty, and I am not aware that any
 explanation of it has ever been suggested.                It is just possible that
 the light, in traversing a solution in which the molecules are free to
 move, may, on account of some peculiarity of structure, cause the
 molecules to take up some special arrangement, so that the fluid
 becomes as it were polarised by the transmission of the light, in a
 manner somewhat analogous to that in which a fluid dielectric is
 polarised in a field of electrostatic force."*
    In order to imitate the rotation produced by liquids like sugar
 solutions, I made small elements or
                                                " molecules " of twisted jute, of
 two varieties, one kind being twisted to the right (positive) and the
 other twisted to the left (negative).            I now interposed a number of,
 say,  the   positive variety,   end    to  end,  between the crossed polariser
 and analyser ; this produced a restoration of the field.             The same was
 the case with the negative variety.               I now mixed equal numbers of
 the   two    varieties, and there was now no restoration of the field, the
 rotation    produced     by one variety being counteracted by the opposite
 rotation produced by the other.
     To get complete neutralisation, it is necessary that the element
 should be of the same size, and that the two varieties should be
 twisted (in opposite directions) to the same amount.                   The experi
 ment was repeated in the following order, to avoid any uncertainty
  due to the possible variation of the sensitiveness of the receiver.
  The receiver is adjusted to a particular sensitiveness, and as long as
 it is not disturbed by the action of radiation, the sensitiveness re
 mains constant.         A mixture of opposite elements is first interposed,

the receiver   continniug to remain unaffected.       From the mixture of
positive   and  negativo varieties, one set, say the negative, is now
rapidly withdrawn, and an equal number of positive substituted.
The receiver which has not been disturbed since its first adjustment
is now found to respond, all the elements conspiring to produce
rotation in the same direction.      It will bo seen that the two experi
ments are carried out under identical conditions.
   In the above,   we have electro-optio     analogues of two varieties of
sugar — dextrose    and levulose.     There   is also the production of an
apparently inactive variety by the mixture of two aotive ones.

                                 2. — ute elements.
   It is to be noted that there is no polarity in the elements, in the
sense we use the term in reference to, say, magnetic molecules.
There is nothing to distinguish one end of the jute element from, the
other end; indeed a right-handed element would appear right-handed
when looked at from either end. It thus happens that if the rotation is
determined by the direction of the twist, two molecules of the same
variety will always conspire, whether they are arranged as ab, cd,
or, to take the extrome     case,   as ab,   dc  (with the second molecule
reversed).      The assumption of any particular arrangement             of
molecules is thus not necessary in explaining the rotation.            The
average effect produced by a large number of active elements inter
spersed in an inactive medium will thus be the same in all directions,
and proportional to the number of molecules traversed by the ray.
As there is no polarity in the molecule, a right-handed element will
always produce the same kind of rotation, say, to the right of an
observer travelling with the ray.         The rotation produced when the
ray is reversed by reflection will thus be in an opposite direction, and
the two rotations will neutralise each other.
   But if the molecules exhibit any polarity, that is to say, if the
effects produced by the two ends of the same molecule are opposite,
the resultant effect produced by a number of such molecules arranged
in haphazard directions, will be zero. In order that the effects pro
duced by the molecules may conspire, it is necessary that they should

       D.Sc, Professor of Physical Science, Presidency College,

       Received February 14, — Read March 10, lb98.
    A circular   piece of chilled glass when interposed between crossed
nicols     produces a dark cross. A similar effect is produced by
 crystals like salicine where there is a radial disposition of the
principal planes.
    I  have been    able to detect a similar phenomenon in the field of
 electric radiation by the interposition           of an artificial structure
between the crossed polariser and analyser.
    I have in a previous communication described the polarisation
 produced by the leaves of a book.          For the following experiment,   a
 long strip of paper was rolled into        a disc.   A roll of Morse's tape
 serves the purpose very well.         The   diameter of the disc is 14 cm.
and its thickness 2 cm. It will be           observed that here we have a
single     axis passing   through the centre, and that all planes passing
through the centre      are principal planes.
    The effect produced by the interposition of the structure may be
studied by keeping the disc fixed and exploring the different parts ot
the field by means of the detector; or the detector may be kept
fixed   (opposite   the analyser)    and the disc may bo moved about so
that the different parts of the field may successively be brought to
act on the detector.        This latter plan was adopted as being simpler
in practice.
    The arrangement of the apparatus is the same as in fig. 1 of my
paper
          " On the Rotation of Plane of Polarisation of Electric Waves
by a Twisted Structure." The polariser is vertical and the analyser
horizontal. The paper disc is interposed between the screens with
its plane at right angles to the direction of the ray.
    The receiver is fixed on the prolongation of the line (which I shall
call the axis), joining the centres of the polariser and the analyser.
    On the supposition that the interposition of the disc produces a
dark cross, the arms of the cross (with the particular arrangement

              Cross" in     the   Field of Electro-magnetic      Radiation.          153
  of the   polariser and the analyser) will lie in the projections of the
  vertical    and the horizontal diameters of the disc, and will move in
  space   with   the movements of the disc. When the centre of the disc
  is on the axis the intersection of the cross will be superposed on the
 receiver, and there should then be no action.                If  the disc be moved
  up   and down,        the centre remaining in          the vertical line passing
 through      the axis, the vertical arm of the cross will slide over the
 receiver.       If the disc be moved laterally, with its centre in the
 horizontal line passing through the axis, the horizontal arm of the
 cross    will slide over the receiver.         In  this, as in the last case, there
 should     be no action on the receiver.            But if the disc be displaced
 so   that the centre does not lie in either the horizontal or the vertical
 line passing through the axis (the axis now cutting the disc at points
 snch    as a, b, c,     or d), the arms of the cross will not fall on the
 receiver, and there should be a response             in the receiver.
     The experiments were now arranged as follows : — The disc was at
 first placed with its centre on the axis, the plane of the disc being

perpendicnlar to the axis.            There was now no action on the receiver;
but as soon as the disc was tilted, however slightly, an action was
 immediately produced on the receiver.
    The disc was now mounted on a stand, between the two screens.
By means of sliding arrangements                   the disc could be raised or
lowered, or moved laterally.
    Id the next experiment, the centre of the disc was first adjusted
on the    axis, and the disc moved vertically up and down.                    No effect
was produced wheu this was being done.
    The centre        of the axis was again adjusted on the axis, and the
disc moved        laterally on the horizontal slide. In this case, too, there
was no     action.
    By adjusting the vertical sliding rod the centre of the disc was
next placed        vertically above or below the axis. The disc was then
moved laterally either to the right or to the left                   In this way the

field   could be displaced, and the quadrants a, 6, c, or d (see fig. 1)
placed opposite to the receiver.        In all these cases, even with small
displacements, very strong action was produced on the receiver.
    From experiments carried out in the manner described above, the
outline of a dark cross projected in space was distinctly made out.
    A disc of wood, with concentric rings, would probably show the
effect equally well.    I shall in a fnture paper send an account of the
action of crystals cut perpendicular to the axis placed in convergent
or divergent beams of electric radiation.
    Some of the investigations on the rotation Of the plane of polar
isation will, perhaps, be facilitated by an observation of the rotation
of the cross. By a modification of this method              I   am at present
trying to detect the rotation produced in a maguetic field.
                     Addendum, 16th March, 1898.
    The production of a dark cross can also be demonstrated by in
terposing between the crossed polariser and analyser concentric
rings of tin-foil mounted on a thin sheet of mica.                 But greater
interest is attached to the exhibition of the phenomenon by double
refracting substances, where the axes of elasticity are disposed in
radial directions.     From the peculiar sti-esses present, I surmised
that woody stems with concentric rings would exhibit the phenome
non above described.      Through the kindness of Dr. Prain, I obtained
from the Government Botanical Gardens, Sibpore, stems of Pinus
longifolia, Surietenia mahogani, Araucaria Gunning hamii, Mangifera
indica,    Casuarina   equisetifolia,    Gupressus  torulosa and Dalbergia
siisoo.   The ring systems present in some of these were very regular,

I was,   however, at first disappointed in failing to obtain the results
anticipated.    But this failure, I subsequently found, was due to the
general opacity of the wood which was freshly cut, and whichi
though apparently dry, contained large quantities of sap in the
interior.   I then carefully dried some of the specimens, when the
stresses present became quite apparent by numerous cracks starting
in radial directions. The results obtained with these dried specimens
were quite satisfactory.
    Inow tried to devise some experiments strictly analogous to the
optical experiments with chilled glass.    For this purpose I cast a
cylinder of paraffin wax in a metallic mould surrounded by a freezing
mixture.    Owing to the great contraction produced by solidification,
a hollow depression was formed in the centre, and this produced a
distortion of symmetry.      It would, therefore, be better to build up a
cylinder by successive dippings, the deposited molten layer contract
ing on the solid core. I obtained, however, extremely good results
with a cylinder of cast ebonite, in which the stresses present are
exactly similar to those in a circular piece of unannealed glass.
   The next series of experiments were undertaken with mineral
specimens. I here acknowledge with thanks, the kind help I received
from Mr. Hayden, B.A., and Mr. Blyth, of the Geological Depart
ment, in obtaining suitable specimens for my experiments.             One
very interesting specimen obtained from Egypt was formed by ringed
concretion of flint round a central nodule.     This specimen exhibited
the cross with great distinctness.    I also obtained fairly satisfactory
results with stalactite.   The concretion of calcium carbonate formed
inside a pipe by deposits from temporarily hard water flowing through
it, would also be found to exhibit this phenomenon.

  The object of this research was to determine how the nitrogenous
matter excreted by marine animals into the water      removed, andis
what parts the various forms of vegetable life play in the process.
Thus this subject is of interest from its practical bearing on ques
tions relating to the efficient maintenance of marine aquaria, as well

156          Mr. H. M. Vernon.        The Relations  between
as from the theoretical standpoint of the chaDges taking place under
natural conditions in the open sea.
   The method of investigation was a triple one, viz., chemical, physio
logical, and bacteriological.    The chemical procedure consisted in
carefully determining the free and albuminoid ammonia present in
the various specimens of water by means of the well-known method of
Wanklyn, Chapman and Smith.            In certain cases also the nitrites
were determined by the metaphenylenediamine         reaction.  The water
was tested physiologically by allowing the fertilised ova of the sea-
urchin, Strongylocentrotus lividus, to develop in it, and by determining
the change produced in the size of the larva) after eight days'
growth under various conditions.          The larvse were in each case
measured under the microscope in groups of fifty. In addition also
the proportion of ova arriving at the eight days' larval stage was
always determined.      The bacterial quality of the water was tested by
counting the number of colonies obtained by gelatin plate culture.
   With reference to the purifying effects of vegetable life on the water,
it was found that green weeds such as Ulva, will, when placed in
Aquarium tank water, rapidly remove the free ammonia present,
though they slowly increase the albuminoid ammonia.           Thus in one
case 62 per cent, of the free ammonia was removed after two days,
and 95 per cent, after ten days, whilst the albuminoid ammonia was
increased by respectively 22 per cent, and 27 per cent. If the water
be in addition exposed to sunlight, the free ammonia is removed loss
rapidly than before, but the albuminoid ammonia increased more
rapidly. Sea-urchin larvse grown in water thus purified are, as a rule,
increased in size, this increase being in one case 14'4 per cent. Larvae
allowed to develop in direct contact with the alga were, as a rule,
found to be slightly diminished in size, although analyses of the
water made at the end of the experiments showed that the albuminoid
ammonia had been appreciably          diminished, as well as the free
ammonia.     It would seem, therefore, that the alga is able to absorb
the albuminoid ammonia when it is present in considerable amount.
The proportion of fertilized ova developing to the full larval stage
was considerably greater in these experiments than when no alga had
been added to the water, hence the effect of the weed would seem on
the whole to have been a favourable one.
   Red weeds, such as Oelideum, when kept in Aquarium water, cause
a considerable increase in the albuminoid ammonia, and as a rule
also increase the free ammonia.      Larvee grown in water thus treated
are diminished in size, but when allowed to develop in direct contact
with smaller quantities of the weed, may be increased in size. Small
quantities of red and green weeds combined cause an increased
number of the ova to reach the larval stage, and may also cause an
increase in the size of the larvro.

                  Marine A nimal and     Vegetable  Life.             157
   On filtration of water through sand which had been taken from
one of the tanks in the Aquarium, it was found that 94 per cent, of the
free, and 18 per cent, of the albuminoid, ammonia had been removed.
This great purification was due to the thin layer of alg» and diatoms
with which the grains of sand were covered, for on heating some of
this sand to 70° C, and subsequently washing it to remove the vege
table  debris, the ammonia in the water filtered through it was con
siderably increased in amount.     Also on filtering water continuously
for some weeks through a layer of sand 16 cm. deep, which contained
small quantities of vegetable matter, a half the free and an eighth
of the albuminoid ammonia were at first removed.            After a week,
however, 58 per cent, of the free and 21 per cent, of the albuminoid
ammonia were absorbed, and after a fortnight respectively 96 per cent,
and 51 per cent. This marked increase of purification was due to the
deposition in the sand of the small quantities of alg» and diatoms in
suspension in the water, and to their subsequent multiplication.
   This vegetable filter was found to act most efficiently with the
water flowing through at its maximum rate.          This, in the present
experiment, was at 1 litre in three minutes through a superficial
area of sand of 177 sq. cm.     "When, by clamping the exit tube, the
rate of flow was diminished to a litre in fifty minutes or more, there
was no longer any purification, but the amount of free ammonia in
the water was increased some threefold,           whilst the albuminoid
ammonia remained practically unaltered.           Also, on discontinuing
the current of water through the filter for twenty-four hours and
then renewing it, its pnrifying efficiency was greatly diminished in
respect of the albuminoid ammonia, only 9 per cent, of this being
now absorbed.      In the course of a few days, however, the purifying
power began to increase again. The filter was then covered up so
as to totally exclude the light, and thereby kill off the chlorophyll-
containing organisms.      About 90 per cent, of the free ammonia was
still absorbed, but never more than 20 per cent, of the albuminoid
ammonia, even after twenty-five days more of continuous filtration.
This purification must have been due to bacterial agency.          Such a
" bacterial " sand filter reacts to             in the rate of flow of the
                                      changes
water quite differently to the chlorophyll-containing oue. Thus the
purification remained practically as great on diminishing the rate of
flow to 1 litre in two hours fifty minutes, and the water flowing
through immediately after the current had been entirely stopped for
ten hours had 93 per cent, of its free ammonia removed.
   In another experiment, sand which at first contained do vegetable
matter at all was found to have practically no purifying power.
On allowing a current of water to flow throngh it continuously,
however, this gradually developed and increased in amount as in
the above experiment.

   158          Mr. H. M. Veruon.            The Relations between
     Larvae grown in water purified by this filtration through Band are
  increased in size some 4'2 per cent., whilst as a rule the percentage
  of ova reaching the full larval stage is considerably increased.
     On keeping sea water in diffuse light the free ammonia soon begins
  to disappear, owing to the multiplication of the small quantities of
  alga and diatoms in suspension in the water. Thus, in one instance,
  after ten days 40 per cent, of the free ammonia had disappeared, and
  after twenty-five days 92 per cent. ; the albuminoid ammonia had,
  on the other hand, increased by respectively 28 and 101 per cent.
  Larva grown in water thus purified were on an average increased in
  size by 13-4 per cent.
     On keeping water in direct sunlight for some days, the free
  ammonia is somewhat diminished, and the albuminoid ammonia
 considerably increased, probably owing to the formation of vegetable
 growth.      Larvae grown in water which had been exposed four or
 more days to the sun and air in a covered glass jar were on an
 average unaffected in size, though only 11 per cent, of the fertilized
 ova employed reached the larval stage.              On the other hand, with
 water exposed      four  or   five days  to the sun  in a flask, whereby very
 little surface was open to the air, nearly the normal number (i.e.,
 66'6 per cent.) of ova developed to larvae, and these larvos were no
 loss than 16-7 per cent, larger than the normal.                   Bacteriological
 examination failed to establish any constant differences in the number
 of germs in these two different kinds of water, but they confirmed
 the germicidal action of sunlight on the water.                    It was found,
 however, that water in which most of the germs had been killed
by several days' exposure to sunlight, contained very many more
germs      than were originally present, if it were subsequently
kept in diffuse light.            Thus in the subjoined experiment, the
water was exposed ten and a half days to direct sunlight, the
number of colonies developing after forty-eight hours' incubation
being reduced to 70 per c.c.            After two days' exposure to diffuse
light, however, the number had enormously increased.                    It will be
noticed   that the   number      also increased  between   the   first and  fourth
days of exposure.       This was owing to the fact that there was very
little direct sunlight at fhe time.

   On keeping    Aquarium water in darkness for three or more weeks,
it undergoes great purification.     Thus in one case after twenty-five
days  there  remained   only per
                             2     cent,  of the free and 48 per cent, of
the albuminoid ammonia originally present.          There was no further
purification on keeping an additional twenty-nine days. This purifi
cation is due to bacterial action, as it is greatly delayed if the water
be previously heated to 100°, and is stopped by adding corrosive
Bublimato to the water.        The amounts of free and albuminoid
ammonia present after this purification are in some cases no greater
than those found in pure open sea water. The physiological purity is
not so great, however, as larvae grown in open sea water are increased
in size by 16-0 per cent., and those grown in water kept in darkness
by, on an average, 7'5 per cent.        Also with this latter water the
percentage of ova reaching the full larval stage is slightly smaller
than the normal.       Water kept in darkness contains considerably
fewer germs than normal water, and the longer the water is kept the
smaller is the number.
    A very considerable purification of the Aquarium water is effected by
the  layer of bacterial slime coating the inside of the pipes which con
duct the water    from the reservoirs to the rooms. Thus water drawn
off at the rate of a litre in ten seconds contained 26 per cent, less
free, and 25 per cent, less albuminoid,       ammonia than the reservoir
water, and that drawn off at a litre in two hours and forty minutes
respectively 82 per cent, and 16 per cent. less.     Larvte grown in such
water were, moreover, some 7'8 per cent, larger than the normal.
    On filtering water through asbestos, the albuminoid ammonia is
somewhat increased, but larvaa grown in the filtered water are some
 12'6 per cent, larger than the normal.
    Larvae grown in water previously heated to 50°, 76°, or 100° are
increased in size by some 6-2 per cent., and the proportion of ova
reaching the larval stage is also increased.      This is probably due to
the removal of bacteria and other forms of life from the water,
though after the first day or two the water contains more bacteria
than unheated water.
    Ordinary tank water gave about 1500 colonies per c.c. after
 twenty-four hours' incubation at 25°, and about 3000 after forty-
 eight hours. Filtration through sand at first diminished the number
 of germs, but when this became impregnated with vegetable growth
 they were largely increased.      Through sand kept in darkness, very
 slow filtration increases the number of germs, but a fairly fast one
 diminishes them.      The addition of algae to the water increases the
 number of germs.
    Larvae grown in water previously fouled by fish, crabs, molluscs,
 and Holothurians are increased in size on an average by 4-l per cent.,
  but with water fouled by sea-anemones and mednsre are slightly

  160     Relations   between    Marine Animal and          Vegetable Life.
  diminished in size.      The increase in size appears to depend roughlv
 on the amount of contamination of the water.             Fish and crabs appear
 to effect about ten times as much contamination as molluscs and
  Holothnrians.
     On the other hand,     if the water be previously fouled by the sea-
 urchins    Stronglyocentrntus, Spharechinue, and Echinus, a decrease
 amounting on an average to 6'9 per cent, is effected ; but with
 Arbacia and Darocidaris there is on an average an increase of 3 per
 cent. There is indeed considerable evidence to show that an organism
 exerts a special adverse influence on the members of its own species.
 The fouling products do not seem to be of the nature of ptomaines,
 as larvre grown in water fouled by dead sea-urchins                were in some
 cases increased in size, though on an average they were slightly
 diminished.    These dead sea-urchins were found to effect about ten
 times as much contamination of the water as did the various living
 animals examined.       In connection with these results, reference may
 be made to some previous experiments," in which it was found that
 the addition of small quantities of uric acid and urea to the water
 caused an increase in the size of the larvre, this increase amounting
 in one instance to 12'2 per cent. Also it was found that the addition
 of considerable quantities of C02 to the water excited a positive
rather than a negative effect on the size of the larvre.
    Larvre grown in water in which another batch of larvre had already
developed were on an average diminished by 6'9 per cent.
    The evidence as to whether a plutens reacts more to its own pro
ducts of metabolism than to those of other species of plntei was too
variable to afford a definite conclusion either way. With water fouled
by plutei, the proportion of fertilised ova reaching the full larval stage
is as a rule considerably less than the normal ; with that fouled by
living Echinoids it is slightly less ; with that fouled by various other
animals about the same, and witb that fouled by dead Echinoids
it is greater than the normal.
    Ammonium chloride exerts a very fatal action on larval growth.
Thus with water containing 1 part in 25,400 of the salt, the larvre
were diminished 19'0 per cent, in size, and only 28 per cent, of the
ova reached the larval stage.        Potassium nitrite, if kept below about
0-3 gram per litre, and potassium nitrate, if kept below 1 gram, have
practically no action.
    Larvre grown in sea water which had been aerated by prolonged
agitation were on an average increased by 0'65 per cent.                The bac
terial quality   of  the   water    seemed    practically    unaffected   by the
aeration.
   After keeping water several weeks in darkness the nitrites origin
ally present are much diminished, or disappear altogether.                  After

filtration through sand impregnated with vegetable growth, and after
adding algae to the water, the nitrites are increased.           The growth of
larvae in a water is as a mle accompanied by an increase of nitrites,
though the nitrification does not seem to be increased on the addition
of either ammonium salts or nitrates to the water, or on fouling the
water by animal excretions.
   The arm-lengths of the Larva? are not specially affected by vege
table growth, though by water filtered through sand impregnated
with   algsB and diatoms         they are somewhat diminished.         They are
considerably      increased   on  development of  the larva?  in  water  purified
by being kept in darkness, and in aerated water.              They are greatly
diminished in water previously heated to 100°, but not           in that heated
to from 50° to 77°.           In water exposed to sunlight        they are also
diminished. They are increased in water fouled by                  most animals
and by dead Echinoids, but in that fouled by living               Echinoids are
diminished.
   During a period of seven months               the specific gravity of the
Aquarium       water was found to vary from T02859 to T02964 at
15-56° C.        The specific gravity was on an average about 0'00040
greater than that of the open sea water.            The free ammonia varied
from 0-185 to 0"350 milligram per litre, and the albuminoid from
0111 to 0182 milligram.

 filtration through sand impregnated with vegetable growth, and after
adding algse to the water, the nitrites are increased. The growth of
 larva in    a water is as a rule accompanied by an increase of nitrites,
 though the nitrification does not seem to be increased ou the addition
of either ammonium salts or nitrates to the water, or on fouling the
 water by animal excretions.
     The arm-lengths of the larva? are not specially affected by vege
 table growth, though by water filtered through sand impregnated
 with alg® and diatoms they are somewhat diminished.                They are
 considerably    increased  on  development  of  the larva? in water   purified
 by being kept in darkness, and in aerated water.           They are greatly
 diminished in water previously heated to 100°, but not in that heated
 to from 50° io 77°. In water exposed to sunlight they are also
diminished.       They are increased in water fouled by most animals
and by dead Echinoids, but in that fouled by living Echinoids are
 diminished.
     During a period of seven months the specific gravity of tho
Aquarium water was found to vary from 1*02859 to T02964 at
 15-56° C.      The specific gravity was on an average about O00040
greater    than  that of the open sea water. The free ammonia varied
from 0185 to 0350 milligram per litre, aud the albuminoid from
01 11 to 0182 milligram.
  Report of the Kew Observatory Committee for the Year
                      ending December 31, 1897.
    The operations of The Kew Observatory, in the Old Deer Park,
Richmond, Surrey, are controlled by the Kew Observatory Committee,
which is constituted as follows : —
                         Mr. F. Galton, Chairman.

162             Report  of   the  Kew Observatory     Committee.
    The work at the Observatory            may be considered     under the fol
lowing heads: —
    1st.   Magnetic observations.
    2nd. Meteorological observations.
    3rd. Solar observations.
    4th. Experiments and Researches           in connexion     with any of the
departments.
    5th. Verification of instruments.
    6th. Rating of Watches and Marine Chronometers.
    7th. Miscellaneous.
                         I. Magnetic Observations.
    The Magnetographs have been in constant operation throughout
 the year, and the usual determinations of the Scale Values were made
 in January.
    The ordinates of the various photographic curves representing
 Declination, Horizontal Force, and Vertical Force were then found
 to be as follows : —
            Declinometer   :  1  inch =   0° 22' 04.  1 cm.  =  0° 8'7.
    Bifilar, January  20, 1897,    for 1 inch 6H = 0-0280 foot grain unit.
                                     „ 1  cm. „ = 0 00051 C.G.S. unit.
    Balance, January 21, 1897,     for 1 inch eV= 0-0274 foot grain unit.
                                    „ 1 cm. „ = 0-00050 C.G.S. unit.
    During the past year the magnetic curves have been free from any
 very large fluctuations.       The principal variations that were recorded
 took place on the following days : —
    January 2; February 4, 25—27; March 9—10; April 2, 20,
 23—24 ; May 17 ; June 16—17 ; July 31 ; October 1—2, 28 ; Novem
 ber 17; December 11, 20—21.
     The hourly means and diurnal inequalities of the magnetic elements
 for 1897, for the quiet days selected by the Astronomer Royal, will
  be found   in Appendix I.
     In  the present year a correction has been applied for the diurnal
  variation of temperature, use being made of the records from a
  Richard thermograph as well as the eye observations of a thermo
  meter placed under the Vertical Force shade.
     The mean values at the noons preceding and succeeding the selected
  quiet days are also given, but these of course are not employed in
  calculating the daily means or inequalities.
     The following are the mean results for the entire year : —
        Mean Westerly Declination                    17° 6'-4.
        Mean Horizontal Force                        018342 C.G.S. unit.
         Mean Inclination                            67° 19' 6.
         Mean Vertical Force                         0 43906   C.G.S. unit.

                  Report  of  the Kew Observatory  Committee.          163
       Observations  of Absolute Declination, Horizontal Intensity, and
   Inclination have been made weekly, as a rule.
      As in 1896, a table of recent values of the Magnetic Elements at
  the Observatories whose publications are received at Kew was con
  tributed to ' Science Progress,' and appeared in the August number.
  A similar table, but containing more recent data, will be found in
  Appendix Ia to the present Report.
      In July, M. Moureaux, of the Pare Saint-Maur Observatory, near
  Paris, paid a visit, and a comparison was made of his and the Kew
  magnetic instruments, a detailed report of which has been drawn up
  by the Superintendent, and published in the Royal Society's Pro
  ceedings, vol. 62, p. 156.
      The magnetic instruments lent to the Jackson-Harmsworth Polar
  Expedition have been returned, and in October some observations
  were taken with them by Mr. Albert Armitage, the Magnetic
  Observer in the expedition, and the Observatory Staff, with a view
 to standardizing the Arctic Observations.
     Dr. van Rijckevorsel spent some time at the Observatory, in
 March and April, comparing his magnetic instruments with the Kew
 unifilar and dip circle.
     Information on matters relating to various magnetic data have
  been supplied to Dr. E. Atkinson, Professor Arnold Lupton, and
 Captain Schiick, and the latter gentleman compared his instruments
 with the Observatory standards.
                      II. Meteorological   Observations.
    The several self-recording instruments for the continuous registra
 tion    of Atmospheric Pressure, Temperature of Air and Wet-bulb,
Wind (direction and velocity), Bright Sunshine, and Rain, have been
maintained       in regular operation throughout the year, and the
standard eye observations for the control of the automatic records
duly registered.
    The tabulations of the meteorological traces have been regularly
made, and these, as well as copies of the eye observations, with
notes of weather, cloud, and sunshine, have been transmitted, as usual,
to the Meteorological     Office.
    With the sanction of the Meteorological       Council, data have been
supplied    to the Council of the     Royal Meteorological Society, the
Institute of Mining Engineers, and the editor of ' Symons' Monthly
Meteorological     Magazine.'
    On June 21, observations with the Campbell sunshine recorder, of
the original wooden bowl pattern, were suspended, by direction of the
Meteorological Council.
    Electrograph. — The auxiliary battery of 60 chloride of silver cells
                                                                N

1G4             Report of   the Keio Observatory    Committee.
used with this instrument was received           back from the makers     on
January 11.
     Before restarting the instrument, the Clifton Quadrant Electro
meter was taken entirely to pieces, all parts thoroughly cleaned and
dried, and new sulphuric acid put in the inner jar.
     The battery was tested, each row of cells being examined and the
voltage determined.
     The electrograph was started on January 19, and has been in con
 stant operation since, with the exception of one or two short stoppages
 due to freezing of the water jet, or other accidental causes. Owing
presumably to the changes introduced last year, there has been a
great improvement in the behaviour of the apparatus.              There are
still, however, one or two directions in which further improvement is
 desirable.
     On September 29, one-third of the cells in the battery were taken
 off, to make a corresponding contraction in the scale values, which
 was expedient in view of the high potentials usually recorded during
 the winter months.
     Notwithstanding     this, several hours' record have been lost owing
 to the trace being off the sheet.     It is difficult at present to see how
 such loss can be avoided, without either duplicating part at least of
 the apparatus, so as to get two curves, one showing ordinary and the
 other extraordinary potentials (positive and negative), or else by
 risking possible loss of negative trace by shifting the position, on
 the sheet, of the zero line.
     The scale value was determined, by direct comparison with the
 Portable Electrometer, White, No. 53, on January 19, May 4, and on
  September 29, before and after the change above referred to.
     The comparisons showed that up to the date of the change the
 scale value had remained practically constant.
     Inspections. — In compliance with the request of the Meteorological
  Council, the following Observatories and Anemograph Stations have
  been    visited and inspected : — Fleetwood, Stonyhurst, Armagh,
  Dublin, Valencia, Falmouth, and St. Mary's (Scilly Isles), by
  Mr. Baker; Radcliffe Observatory            (Oxford), Yarmouth, North
  Shields, Alnwick Castle, Fort William, Glasgow, Aberdeen, and
  Deerness (Orkney), by Mr. Constable.
                           III.  Solar Observations.
      Sun-spots. — Sketches of Sun-spots have been made on 165 days, and
  the groups numbered, after Schwabe's method.
      Particulars will be found in Appendix II, Table IVT.
      Taking into consideration the elaborate photographic work now
   clone elsewhere, the Committee consulted the Solar Physics Com

               Report of   the Kew Observatory   Committee.         1 G5
mittee and other eminent astronomers on the subject, with the result
that they decided that the eye observations should cease at the end of
1897.
                        IV. Experimental Work.
    Fog and Mist. — The observations of a series of distant objects,
referred to in previous Reports, have been continued. A note is taken
of the most distant of the selected objects which is visible at each
observation hour.
    Atmospheric Electricity.— -The comparisons of the potential, at the
point where the jet from the water-dropper breaks up, and at a fixed
station on the observatory lawn, mentioned in last year's Report,
have    been continued, and the observations    have been taken  nearly
every month.
    A  comparison of these observations with the corresponding results
from the electrograms encourages the belief that there has been no
progressive change of insulation in the electrograph, snch as was met
 with prior to the late alterations and improvements.
    Advantage was taken of the occurrence of some very thick fogs in
 November, to carry out six sets of observations of the potential at
 various heights from the ground to 70 feet above.
    Aneroid Barometers. — The experiments referred to last year have
 been continued, and a considerable number of interesting conclusions
have been arrived at. It is hoped that the results will be ready for
 publication in the course of the present year.
    Platinum Thermometry. — In accordance with the arrangement
 alluded to in last year's Report, Dr. J. A. Harker came to the
 Observatory in January to do some work in platinum thermometry.
 The authorities of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures
 at Sevres having consented with the greatest readiness and courtesy
 to a comparison by Dr. Harker, in their laboratories, of the scales of
 the hydrogen and platinum thermometers, the Committee decided
 to do all in their power to make the scheme successful.    It had been
 from the first the hope of the Committee that platinum thermometry
 would prove a valuable auxiliary in direct comparison of mercury
 thermometers,    especially at temperatures outside the range 0° to
 100° C, and the opportunity of a comparison with the standard gas
 thermometer of the Bureau International thus occurred very oppor
 tunely.
    After Dr. Harker's arrival at Kew it was found that somewhat
 extensive alterations would be required to fit the existing resistance
 box for the work at Sevres, and it also appeared undesirable that
 the Observatory   should be deprived for some months of the means of
 using platinum thermometers.     A new resistance box was accordingly
 ordered from Messrs. Crompton & Co., embodying the alterations

  166           Report of  the  Kew Observatory    Committee.
  suggested by the experience of Dr. Harker and the Observatory staff.
  On its completion, this box was taken to Sevres by Dr. Harker in
  July, together with two or three of the platinum thermometers pre
 viously in use at the Observatory, and some new ones of higher
 resistance.    Since then Dr. Harker has been engaged on the proposed
 research    in co-operation with Dr. Chappuis of the International
  Bnreau.     It is expected that the investigation, so far as practicable
 at present, will be concluded in a few months.
     The inconsistencies in the behaviour of the Callendar-Griffiths
 resistance box, referred to last year, having been proved to arise prin
 cipally from the uncertainties of the plugs, it was sent to the makers
  (the Cambridge Scientific Instrument Company) for readjustment.
 They made use of the opportunity to introduce, at their own expense,
 a new system of plugs.      In it the plugs are isolated, so that manipu
lating one leaves the tightness of the others unaffected.          Another
 source of trouble proved to be thermo-electric         currents generated
in the patent thermo-electric key ; the key accordingly has been
enclosed, at the suggestion of Mr. W. N. Shaw, in a box, and the
 defect though still existent appears much reduced.
    Experiments have been continued on the fixity of zero of platinum
 thermometers and the degree of consistency in the results obtained
 with them. Further attention has also been given to the comparison
 of platinum and mercury thermometers at high temperatures.            This
 is a subject of increasing urgency in view of repeated requests for
 direct high temperature verifications which cannot as yet be satis
factorily dealt with.
    Mercury Thermometry. — To assist in perfecting a method of high
temperature verifications, some high range thermometers of the Jena
glasses 16m and 591" have been ordered from Berlin.             They are to
be verified at the Reichsanstalt before delivery.
    At the request of Messrs. Powell & Sons, Whitefriars, experiments
are being made as to the thermometric properties of different kinds
of glaBS.      Particulars of the chemical composition of the glass
will be published, with the results obtained, when the experiments are
completed.
    An apparatus for the comparison of meteorological maximum and
minimum thermometers in the horizontal position has been designed
by Mr. Casella, and is at present under construction.

   Two Standard Thermometers               Lave been constructed       during the
year.
   There were at the end of the year in the Observatory undergoing
verification      12 Barometers,        680 Thermometers,        24 Sextants, 12
Telescopes,       10    Binoculars,   20  Hydrometers,     and    3 Sunshine Re
corders.
                VI.     Rating of Watches and Chronometers.
   The high standard of excellence to which attention was drawn in
last year's Report has been maintained.              Although the number of
marks obtained by the watch standing first on the list is slightly
lower than last year, yet the general average is as good, and no less
than 108 movements have obtained the highest possible form of
certificate (the class A especially good), which involves the attain
ment of 80 per cent, of the total marks.
   The 680 watches received were entered for trial as below : —
   For class A, 492 ; class B, 144 ; class C, 16 ; and 28 for the subsi
diary trial. Of these 17 passed the subsidiary test, 161 failed from
various      causes to gain any certificate ; 7 were awarded class C
certificates,    109 class B, and 386 class A.
    In Appendix       III    will be found a table giving the results of trial
of the first 51 watches which gained the highest number of marks
during the year. The highest place was taken by Messrs. Usher and
Co'p, of London, with a keyless going-barrel, Karrusel lever-watch,
No. 29,106, which obtained 88'4 marks out of a maximum of 100.
    The class C trial having been of late years but little called for.
 the Committee decided early in the year to suspend the farther issue
 of class C certificates, and this rule came into operation on April 1.
    The number of watches obtaining the class A certificate "espe
                "
 cially good having during the past few years largely increased, con
 siderations of space forbid the publication of the rates and marks of
 all of them. Attention was drawn to this proposed change in the
 Report for 1896.
    Appendix       III   embraces watches gaining 82'5 marks and upwards,
 the remaining 57, which obtained the distinction "especially good,"
 ranging from 82'3 to 80-0 marks.
    Various representations            having been made that changes are

desirable in the system of marks and in the dating of certificates,
a circular has been issued to ascertain the general opinion of watch
manufacturers and others interested in the matter.
   Marine Chronometers.      — During the year, 65 chronometers have been
entered for the Kew A and B trials ; of these 49 gained certificates,
and 16 failed to pass.
   The present box for the          " cold " test of chronometers
                                                                    proving
inadequate,    it  is intended   during   tho winter  of 1897-98 to fit up a
larger and mnch improved chamber to hold a considerable number
of movements.         This, it is expected, will remove much of the diffi
culty  and   expense of maintaining the low temperature of 45° during
the summer months.

                                    having proved rather uncertain in its
action during the latter part of May, it was decided to have the
entire   apparatus      overhauled.     This was carried out in June by
Messrs. E. Dent & Co., and an improved relay and new armatures
were fitted.     It has since performed well. During the interval tho
time signals were recorded on a galvanometer (P.O. pattern).

   Paper. — Prepared photographic paper has been supplied to the
Observatories at Hong Kong, Mauritius, St. Petersburg, Toronto,
Oxford (Radcliffe), and Stonyhnrst, and through the Meteorological
Office to Aberdeen, Batavia, fort William, and Valencia.
   Anemograph and Sunshine Sheets have also been sent to Hong Kong
and   Mauritius, and papier Saxe to Coimbra, and a number of Campbell-
Stokes sunshine recorders to St. Petersburg. At the request of the
India Office, a drum chronograph with best frictional governors, to
be used for astronomical         and transit work, was made by Messrs.
Thomas Cook and Sons, of York, and, after erection and examination
at Kew, was forwarded to the Colaba Observatory, Bombay.
   Exhibition at the Crystal Palace. — Specimens of the curves from
the various self-recording apparatus and cloud photographs were
lent for exhibition at the Crystal Palace and safely returned.
    Ships' Compasses. — With the kind assistance of Captain E. W.
 Creak, R.N., F.R.S., regulations have been laid down for the separate
verification of old or additional cards for compass bowls previously
 tested.
    Travellers' Azimuth Compasses. — After the conclusion of the special
 experiments mentioned last year, a report was submitted to tho
 Royal Geographical       Society.

Government      Grant Committee.       The instrument has been ordered
from Mr. R. Munro, bat has not yet been delivered.
   National Physical Laboratory Committee. — A committee having
been appointed by Government          " to consider and report upon the
desirability of establishing a National Physical Laboratory for the
testing and verification of instruments for physical investigation,
for the construction and preservation of standards of measurement,
and for the systematic determination of physical constant and
numerical data useful for scientific and industrial purposes ; and to
report whether the work of such an institution, if established, could
bo associated with any testing or standardising work already per
formed wholly or partly at the public cost," the Chairman and the
Superintendent gave evidence before it.
   It is also proposed that the National Physical Laboratory Com-
mitttee should visit Kew Observatory at an early date.
   Library. — During the year the library has received publications
from
    21  Scientific Societies and Institutions of Great Britain and
         Ireland,
   102 Foreign and Colonial Scientific Establishments, as well as
         from several private individuals.
   The card catalogue has been proceeded with.
   Audit, 8fc. — The accounts for 1897 have been audited by Mr. W. B.
Keen, Chartered Accountant, on behalf of the Royal Society, and

                 Magnetical Observations,          1897.
Made at the Kew Observatory,               Old Deer Park, Rich
   mond, Lat. 51° 28' 6" N. and Long.             0h lm 15s   ! W.
   The results given in the following tables are deduced from tho
magnetograph curves which have been standardised by observations
of deflection and vibration.   These were made with the Collimator
Magnet K.C. I. and the Declinometer Magnet marked K.O. 90 in tho
9-inch Unifilar Magnetometer by Jones.
   The Inclination was observed with the Inclinometer by Barrow,
No. 33, and needles 1 and 2, which are 3£ inches in length.
   The Declination and Force values given in Tables I to VIII are
prepared in accordance with the suggestions made in the fifth report
of the Committee of the British Association on comparing and
reducing Magnetic Observations.
   The following is a list of the days daring the year 1897 which
were selected by the Astronomer Royal, as suitable for the deter
mination of the magnetic diurnal inequalities, and which have been
employed in the preparation of the magnetic tables : —

       § 1.    In measuring electrical resistance by the method of Lorenz we
have to determine the coefficient of mutual induction of a helix of
wire and the circumferenco of a rotating circular disc placed ooaxi-
ally with         it,
               the mean planes of the helix and the disc being
coincident.  In a paper presented to the Physical Society in
November, 1888,    gave a method of calculating this coefficient
                         I                                       but                     ;
subsequent consideration of the problem in connection with the
Lorenz apparatus recently made for the McGill University, Montreal,
has led me both    to a simplification of the method previously des
cribed, and also to a more general solution.

    We may now proceed in two ways — either by expanding the
logarithmic expression in powers of xfa, which leads to a series of
limited application since it is convergent only so long as x < A — a ;
or by integration by parts which leads to an expression applicable'
for all valnes of x.

Mr. Rhodes under the direction of Prof. Ayrton in the Physical
Laboratory of the Central Institution, in which the Lorenz apparatus
of the McGill University was tested by Prof. Ayrton and myself
(Appendix to the Report of the Electrical Standards Committee
of the British Association, 1897). The calculation was made by the
somewhat laborious method indicated in my paper " On the Deter
mination of the Specific Resistance                  of Mercury in Absolute
Measure." * It was checked by Mr. Mather, and subsequently I
calculated Me afresh by the method given here.
   § 7. It is important in practice to determine the change in Me con
sequent on small changes in A, a, and x, both for the calculation of
the effect on Me of small errors of measurement, and because from
time to time the disc of any Lorenz apparatus needs to be re-groand
in place, and possibly the coil, owing to a breakdown in insulation,
may sometimes need to be re-wound.

Me, and Me, being expressed by equation (2), and noting that
yi, = 2trp7 where 7 is the current per unit length of the helix measured
parallel to the axis, we see that the potential energy of the circle and
coaxial helix is identically the same as the potential energy of the
circle and a uniform coaxial circular cylindrical current sheet of the
same radial and axial dimensions as the helix, if the currents per
unit length in helix and sheet be the same.*

coefficient of mutual induction in the case of two coaxial helices we are
brought face to face with functions which indeed deserve the attention
of mathematicians,          but do not at present lend themselves to
calculation.
    For many practical purposes, however, it will be equally useful to
calculate the potential energy of a helix and a, coaxial uniform
circular cylindrical current sheet, or of two coaxial uniform circular
cylindrical enrrent sheets ; and this potential energy is expressible
in terms of elliptic integrals.

where M2 = coeffieient of mutual induction of the helix and one                of
                   the circular ends of the sheet,
and      Mi = coefficient of mntnal induction of the helix and the
                   other circular end of the sheet.
    M3 and  M,  may be calculated as described in the previous articles
of this paper.
    § 15. Equation (11) is clearly      a  particular   case  of a more  general
theorem.
    Take any cylindrical sheet developed by the rectilinear translation
of a given closed curve, and let the sheet be the seat of a uniformly
distributed current, the current lines being successive positions of the
given curve as by its translation it developes the sheet. Let the
current per unit length of the sheet be 7. Further, let M, be the
coefficient of mutual induction of the given curve in its first position
and any second fixed curve, and M2 the coefficient of mutual induction
of the given curve in its last position and the second curve ; and let
-/a be the current in the second curve.
    Then the force between the current sheet and the second enrve
resolved parallel to the direction of translation of the given curve as
it developes the sheet is given by the formula —
                               F = W(M,-M,).
    For let the direction of translation       be taken as the axis of a- ; and
let   Mj be the coefficient  of mutual      induction of the given curve in
any intermediate position defined by the co-ordinate as, i.e., of an
element of the current sheet, and the second curve.               Then the force
resolved parallel to ;r between the element of the current sheet and
the second enrve
                              =  70 . -/dx  ¦ dltlzjdx,
and the total force so resolved         between      the current sheet and the
second curve

  As special                           (11) reducing the calculation of
                       cases, we have equation
the force between a circular cylindrical uniform current sheet and a
coaxial helical current to the calculation of the coefficients of mutual
induction of the helix and the circular ends of the sheet; and the
simpler case of the force between a circular cylindrical uniform
current sheet and       circular current, which

calculations of the coefficients of mutual induction of the circle and
the circular ends of the sheet.
I    hope that equation (11) may be of service in the accurate calcu
lation of the constants of current weighing apparatus.    My attention
was drawn to the matter from this point of view in consequence of

                              (Translation.)
    In 1892   I brought before the British Association, met in Edin
burgh, a project which my scientific cruises in the North Atlantic
had suggested and preliminary experiments have matured.              The
importance of meteorological observations is now universally recog
nised, and a continually increasing number of centres of observation
are being created in order to assist the progress of this science.
    I proposed to establish on the Azores an advanced post, whose
mission should be : 1st, to observe the birth of certain atmospheric
 disturbances, which appear to be formed in this region of the
 Atlantic ; 2nd, to correct the path of certain others which appear to
 threaten the coasts of Europe and which are announced from
America at too great a distance of time and space for there to be an
assurance that more or less considerable modifications may not take
place which will affect their strength, their direction, and the date of
their arrival on the European coasts.
   We should then have, on a point situated almost in the middle of

            On the Meteorological    Observatories   of   the   Azores.              207
the Atlantic, an observatory, the work of which would also include
the study of seismic phenomena, and this with great advantage,
because, in certain circumstances, the earthquakes felt in Europe
have, in the first instance, affected the volcanic massif of the Azores.
   It is hardly necessary to say that those interested in the study of
terrestrial magnetism will view with pleasure tho opening of an
observatory which is to render useful services in this department of
science.   Many countries will profit directly by the observations
made on the Azores, because they interest all branches of the
nautical profession as well as the populations of all the western
coasts of Europe.    The navigator approaching the end of a long
voyage in a sailing vessel will here find the means of regnlating his
chronometers at the time when it is most wanted, namely, before
making the continental land.
   Since the first mention of my project in 1892, an event, which                      I
awaited with much impatience, has arrived to help                 it,
                                                         namely, the
telegraphic connection  of the Azores with Europe.   Soon afterwards
the Portuguese Government gave effect to my views by creating on
the Island of St. Miguel, and under the direction of Captain Chaves,
a regular meteorological    station, although  fitted with the most
modest means.
   Finally, last year Captain Chaves was commissioned to establish
on the Island of Flores, the most westerly of the Azores,     second         a
meteorological station, the observations at which will be most useful
for supplementing those of San Miguel. Unfortunately, its means
are even more modest than those of the preceding one, and the
telegraph cable has not yet reached it.
   In   spite of the insufficient   means of observation actually existing
 in the Azores, the results which they already furnish towards estab
lishing the paths of the depressions which cross the Atlantic, enable                  a
presentiment to be formed of the part which they will play when
their outfit   more complete.
               is
   In order that science may the sooner profit by the advantages
promised by the observatory of the Azores and in order to guarantee
                                                ;
it against all the dangers which might cause an interruption of its
functions,  I propose to give       constitution founded on the prin
                                    it   a
ciple of an international guarantee, which would be secured by the
pecuniary contributions of the countries interested.   It principally   is
to expose this idea that      I have come to-day to speak of these
observatories to the Royal Society.
    Portugal, accepting the principle of the international regime, has
commissioned     Captain Chaves to invite the maritime nations in
terested  to  give their adhesion to my project and to associate them
 selves in the organisation   of the above-mentioned meteorological
 service.
                                                                             Q   2

208                          Mr. A. E. Tutton.
   It may therefore be hoped that in the near future an understand
ing will  be arrived at on the importance of the development to be
given to the obaervatory of the Azores, and I ask the Royal Society,
whose influence is so great in the domain of science, to support, by
its concurrence, the accession of England to the ideas which I uphold
for the common interest.
" A Compensated Interference Dilatometer."                   By A. E. Tutton,
      Assoc.  R.C.S.     Communicated by Captain Abney, C.B.,
      F.R.S.   Received March 8,— Read April 28, 1898.
                                   (Abstract.)
   The author describes a form of Fizean interference dilatometer
which he considers combines the best features of the apparatus
described by Benoit, and belonging to the Bureau International des-
Poids et Mesures, in Paris,* and that described by Pulfrich'f con
structed according to the modifications introduced into the method
by Abbe.    Moreover, besides other improvements, a new principle,,
that of compensation for the expansion of the screws of the Fizeau
tripod which supports the object, is introduced, which enhances the
sensitiveness of the method so highly as to render it applicable
to the determination of the expansion of crystals in general, includ
ing those of chemical preparations.         Hitherto the application of the
Fizeau method has been confined to such crystals as could be obtained
large   enough to furnish a homogeneous block at least a centimetre
thick. A block only 5 mm. thick is ample for use with the author's-
compensated dilatometer.          The principle of the compensation de
pends upon the fact that aluminium expands 2 6 times as much as
platinum-iridium for the same increment of temperature. The author-
therefore employs, like Fizeau and Benoit, a tripod of platinum-
iridium, and places upon its transverse table, through which pass
the three screws, a disc of aluminium whose thickness is l/2"6ths of
the length of the screws.          The space between the lower surface of
the glass plate which is laid upon the upper ends of the screws to
assist in producing the interference, and the upper surface of the
aluminium, then remains constant for all temperatures under obser
vation, and if a crystal is laid upon the aluminium compensator the
whole amount of its expansion by rise of temperature is available
for measurement by the interference method. Hence the method is
no longer a merely relative one, affording the difference of expansion
between the tripod and the substance investigated,                 but affords-
directly absolute measurements of the expansion.

                A  Compensated Interference   Dilatometer.          209
    The instrument consists of two independently mounted portions,
¦which   the author terms respectively the expansion apparatus and the
illuminating and observing apparatus.        For the purposos of pre
liminary adjustment the two portions are arranged at close quarters,
while during the observations they stand at opposite ends of the slate
table, 6 feet in length, upon which they are mounted, the expansion
apparatus resting on a separate and movable cloth-lined slab for the
purpose of effecting the transfer from one position to the other.
Hence the optical measuring apparatus is far removed during obser
vations from the heated atmosphere of the chamber containing the
tripod.
    The illuminating and observing apparatus consists of a telescope
arranged with a side tube for auto-collimation. It is mounted on a
stout pedestal provided with three legs and levelling screws, and its
height can be varied by the vertical rack and pinion movement of a
stout inner column. At the common focus of the lens of the side tube
and of the telescope objective a small totally-reflecting prism is
placed, half closing the aperture of a diaphragm placed on the
objective side of the prism in the main optical tube ; the prism is so
arranged that the light from the illuminating lens is reflected
through the diaphragm to the objective. It passes thence, as parallel
rays, across the intervening space to the expansion apparatus, at the
summit of which it meets with one of two interchangeable deflecting
arrangements which direct the rays vertically down the tube of the
expansion apparatus into the interference chamber containing the
tripod. One of the two is a large totally-reflecting prism ; this is
used when white light or a sodium flame is the source of light
placed before the illuminating lens, the former for adjusting pur
poses and the latter for generating the bands.      The other is a train
of two refracting prisms whose total minimum deviation averages
90° ; this is used when a hydrogen and mercury Geissler tube is the
source of light; the dispersion being then adequate to effectively
separate the red C from the greenish-blue F radiations, or both from
the mercury green radiation, when it is desired to generate bands in
C or F hydrogen light, or that corresponding to the green mercury
 line as recommended by Pulfrich.
    The expansion apparatus is suspended from an arm carried by a
pedestal provided with rack and pinion vertical adjustment as in the
case of the observing apparatus.       Below the deflecting prism or
 prisms the short metal tube passes into a longer one of porcelain,
which at its lower end is fitted into a further short metal tube carry
 ing below the interference chamber within which the tripod is
 placed.    On passing down the tube from the deflecting apparatus the
 rays pass first through a slightly tilted, thick glass disc held in a
 diaphragm and forming the roof of the interference chamber.       They

210                        Mr. A. E. Tutton.
then pass through the large cover-disc laid on the tripod screws,
the under surface of which is one of the two surfaces the reflections
from which are to be made to interfere ; the other of the two relevant
surfaces is the upper surface of the crystal supported on the com
pensator, or in the case of a badly reflecting crystal, of a small disc
of black glass, polished above and ground below, which the author
lays upon it. The large cover-disc and the glass roof-disc are slightly
wedge-shaped to the extent of 3.V, and are arranged complementarily
so as to counteract the dispersion produced by each other ; by using a
wedge-shaped cover-disc the undesired reflection from the upper
surface can be deflected out of the field of the telescope, and the
tilt of the roof-wedge is given for a similar reason. After reflec
tion from the two surfaces relevant to the interference, the rays
re-traverse their path, but instead of doing so absolutely are made
to pass through the clear half of the telescope diaphragm to the
observing lens arrangement.        An iris diaphragm is placed against
the main diaphragm to assist in further excluding undesirable
radiations, and the illuminated surface of the small reflecting prism
can be more or less curtailed by suitable rectangular signal-stops.
   There are two observing lens arrangements : one a simple eye
piece and the other a micrometer combination of three lenses.       The
first enables the observer to properly adjust the images of the signal
stop in white light reflected from the two relevant surfaces of the
interference apparatus, so as to cover each other to the extent
required to produce interference bands of requisite width.         The
micrometer combination converts the observing apparatus into a
 microscope wherewith to view the bands. The spider-lines of the
micrometer are simultaneously visible.       The reference point of the
interference apparatus is the centre of a minute silver ring on the
under surface of the cover-wedge, and the two vertical spider-lines
 can be adjusted by a special drum to such a separation as enables the
inner circle of the ring to be brought symmetrical to them, showing
 equal suitable arcs outside each ; this separation is also convenient
for the width of band generally employed, which corresponds to
 100 drum divisions of the other drum which moves both spider-lines
simultaneously.
    The interference  chamber    is provided with an adjusting table of
 non-conducting material, and is quite open to the heated air of the
 bath, being provided with large windows, which are also very useful
 for the adjustment of the tripod.        The heating bath is a doable
 air bath of copper snitably screened in every direction by asbestos
 millboard. It is provided with a thermostat in the outer bath and
 two thermometers in the inner bath. The expansion apparatus is
 immersed in the latter up to a third of the porcelain tube.        The
actual temperature of the tripod is ascertained by a third thermo

               A   Compensated Interference    Dilalometer.           211
 meter,   bent  so that    the bulb lies within the chamber in contact
 with the tripod itself ; this has been found to be a point of the
 first importance.   With the aid of the thermostat and a graduated
 gas tap a constant temperature can readily be attained.
     The author determines the position of the bands at about 10° C,
 again near 70°, and once more about 120°, in order that not only
 the mean coefficient, but the absolute coefficient at any temperature
 and the increment per degree may be ascertained.          The transit of
 each band is followed and recorded permanently by means of a
specially   constructed     tape-puncturing recorder.    This method is
found more satisfactory than relying exclusively on the Abbe
method of mere observation of the initial and final positions of the
bands for light of two wave-lengths.
    The results of numerous determinations of the expansion of the
platinum-iridium of the tripod are given, carried out with the sur
face of the tripod table and the cover-wedge separated at the long
interval of 12 mm., by the aid of green mercury light. The mean
value is very similar to that of Benoit, and is
                           a = 10-9(8600+   4-56<) .
    The result of several determinations in red hydrogen light of the
expansion of the pure aluminium used for the series of compensa
tors, carried out by the Fizeau relative method with a block 12 mm.
thick, is
                          a  = 10-8(2204 + 2-120.
    Similar determinations    for the black glass of the crystal-covering
plates afford the value  :
                         a = 10-»(7257 + 10-4*).
    In  a subsequent memoir the author intends to present the results
of determinations of the expansion of the sulphates and selenates of
potassium, rubidium, and caesium.

    The object in view was to observe simultaneously and compara
tively the effects of certain anaesthetics (carbon dioxide, ether, and
•chloroform) npon vegetable and upon animal protoplasm.
    Two gas chambers in series, through which anaesthetic and other
 vapours can be passed, contain : the first, a leaf of Elodea Canadensis
under the microscope ( X 300) ; the second, a sciatic nerve of Bana
 temporaria connected with an inductorium and galvanometer (or
 upon occasion a galvanograph).*
    The actual movements of chlorophyll bodies in a cell of the leaf
 were observed and measured by one of us, while the other observer
 took readings of the galvanometric deflections in response to excita
 tion of the nerve. To establish comparison between the two classes
 of effects, we took as measures : — the number of chlorophyll bodies
 that crossed a cobweb in the eye-piece during each successive minute,
and the magnitude of galvanometric deflections at intervals of one
 minute, before, during, and after the action of the vapour.                           The
 number      of   bodies passing per minute gives measure of the rate of
 movement in the vegetable protoplasm, while the magnitude of succes
sive galvanometric deflections gives measure of the mobility of the
animal protoplasm.
     Our results will be most briefly presented by the records of some
representative       observations.

   The results obtained from a study of Chara and Elodea were quite
consistent,   but owing to the greater ease in making a quantitative
determination, the latter plant was used for the more exact compara
tive experiments.
   The action of carbon dioxide was to produce an initial slight
acceleration, followed speedily by a complete cessation of movement.
After disconnecting the C02 apparatus and aspirating air through
the chamber the protoplasm, after the lapse of two or three minutes,
began to show signs of recovery.            Fitful movements of the granules
first occurred, and then they soon resumed their processional motion
around the cell.    At first very slow, the movement rapidly became
accelerated and considerably exceeded the normal rate. This accele
ration was not of long duration, and was followed by a slowing down
to the ordinary speed.

216          On the Action    of Ancesthetics on Protoplasm.
   The norve showed itself, under the conditions of the experiment,
less sensitive to the action of C02 than was Elodea, and the latter
was less sensitive than an active Myxomycete plasmodium (of Bad-
hamia) similarly treated.
   Ether vapour in air passed over the plant for two minutes caused a
speedy arrest of all movement, and the quiescent condition persisted
for some minutes longer.        Recovery then ensued and the normal
rate of movement was slowly regained.          With dilute ether vapour
(below 10 per   cent, in air) insufficient to anaesthetise the nerve, the
protoplasmic circulation was unaffected.
               — The action of chloroform proved to be far more
   Chloroform.
deadly than that of ether.       Movement was arrested in less than a
minute, and two minutes' exposure to the full action of its vapour
caused  the death of the cell.
   When a more diluted vapour (about 2 per cent, in air) was passed
over the cell for two minutes recovery ultimately occnrred.
   The action of ether and chloroform, especially the latter, was very
marked in causing many of the chlorophyll granules, which had pre
viously been almost restricted to the lateral walls, and hence had
presented their edges to the incident light, to become dispersed over
the surface of the cell, where they were fully exposed, over their
largest area to the light.     The action of carbon dioxide as observed
in these experiments was not nearly so pronounced.         This phenome
non is such as might have been anticipated as a result of the paralysis,
temporary or permanent, of the protoplasm.

                       1.  Origin and Method of Experiments.
    I have    frequently had to mount in water, for examination with the
microscope, the powder of various rocks.                      Certain of the slides,,
when accidentally dried, exhibited rather interesting forms.                     These
I  showed to Professor Bonney, who encouraged me to try for further
results, so the experiments wore continued with various powdered
substances —many pigments (vermilion, indigo, sepia, &c), chalk
and other more or less friable rocks.                   At first, ordinary microscope
slides were used, but afterwards, larger pieces of glass, in each case,
generally with a cover-glass placed over the mud.                          The results-
seem to be worth describing, as affording familiar, almost homely
illustrations which may throw some light on the origin of certain
minor structures in rocks.
                               2. Classification      of Forms.
    The chief effects produced may be shortly described.                     One form
shown by the dried powder is that of a winding network (Plate 2, fig. 1),
which is formed of bent stems, fairly uniform in thickness, giving
rise to short branches in different directions, but generally at high
angles.       The whole makes a kind of maze in which the broader
winding spaces often average from -j-1, inch to                     \  inch in width.
This form arises from desiccation of                a  fairly dense* mass. Where
it is densest, a coarser maze is developed and the coarser part is
earlier formedf (fig. 1 towards a and 6).
   •  I  use this term for a mass where the water is distinctly "muddy," i.e., where
the proportion of the suspended particles to the water is relatively high.
   + Sometimes      the denser mud has been carried forward apparently by the
squeezing along of more suspended material (fig. 1). Sometimes a greater amount
of the solid substance has been left behind, while a less dense mass was pressed
forward.     In slides left to dry in a tilted position, gravitation carried the g'eater
amount of particles towards the lower end.

 218        Miss C. A. Raisin.          On certai?i Structures tormed
    The    meshes   in the network may be occupied by a finer deposit
 arranged    in  successive     curves.     Within a coarser maze, the curves
 are closer, and the finer material forms a more conspicuous pattern.
    In other examples, the thick streaks become less bent (c/. fig. 4 ;
 also fig. 2), and finally straight, sometimes with a terminal knob,
 sometimes forked or branched, generally at a rather acute angle.
 From these axes, finer pattern-marks seem to diverge on either
side. Certain materials usually formed straight axes* — these were
also developed in other substances under certain conditions, e.g.,
when the mud was thin, or when its boundary was within the edge
•of the cover glass, or when a corner of the cover was upraised to
allow quicker escape of the moisture.              Thus the straight axes seem
to be the result of a more ready retreat of the rim generally due to
a freer evaporation.            While, if the cover was sealed down with
Canada balsam, or        if deuser mud had spread beyond the              edge   and
•caked, so as to check evaporation^           a maze was produced.
    A  fine pattern may be formed either in connection with the thicker
aggregates, or where these are wanting. It generally arises from a
sorting of the material — the finer feathers and tufts are built of small
grains, the thick coarse axes of larger.              The fine particles may be
spread almost continuously           (e.g., ivory black, light red), the deposit
then becoming more concentrated towards a series of curving lines.
Similar wave patterns may become fan-like from development of
crossing radial curves^ (fig. 3).
    Transverse bars, also curved, extend between straight axes, where
these are near together, and where the fine material is abundant in
somewhat granular substances§ (fig. 2).                  The predominance of
radial or of concentric or wave pattern is mainly due to the form of
the area and mode of retreat, since they are shown in the same
material.      Feather forms are developed within confined areas, as in
ovoid bubbles which are contained in the margin of a deposit of van-
dyke brown (fig. 4).
    This example (fig. 4) also illustrates other forms. The mud dried,
or partially dried, along part of the edge and water from the
included mass then tried to escape. Thus, bubbles were formed,
generally elliptical or ovoid, and elongated transversely                    to the
   * Gamboge, Ppper Headon marl, boulder clay, pipe-clay, some slides of chalk,
a tendency in Tandyke brown, sepia, vermilion, &c.
   t This was shown in one slide of tandyke brown. In another slide of that
material the cover was not scaled, and although the mud caked at part of the edge
(the part figured in fig. 4), the water escaped along most of the eides, and straight
axes were produced.

edge,     like vesicles towards the surface of an igneous sheet or
dyke. Still more interesting are tapering pointed canals, some of
which radiate from the bubbles or from a central point. Others are
generally branched, often slightly curved, and have a central granu
lar streak. Near the sealed edge, canals are numerous and vesicles
are large and few ; while beyond this part, the canals diminish in
number and finally almost entirely give place to numerous but small
vesicles.      The intervening mud exhibits various contraction cracks
which originated in drying.
   Thus, the structures may be classified as : —
    1st. Those of coarser threads,
    (1) where these form a maze ;
    (2) where they produce straight axes usually with terminal (or
initial) knobs      ;
   2nd, the finer pattern,
    (3) consisting of concentric or wave-lines          ;
    (4) forming feathery or fan-shaped tufts ;
   3rd (5) vesicular structures, including rounded vesicles, or taper
ing canals     ;
   4th (6) contraction structures, cracks.
   This classification is somewhat artificial and intended to indicate
the chief types, between which gradations may be found ; and by
combination and aggregation of different forms numerous varieties
arise, as may be seen in the few figures reproduced.
                     3. Conditions    and Causes of Formation.
    It is not always easy to desci'ibe concisely the exact conditions that
govern the formations since they include at least three variables.
First, the nature of the material, its specific gravity, adhesive
character, and the size of the grains ; second, the relative amount of
the material, i.e. the muddiness of the fluid mass; third, the form of
the area occnpied and the direction of retroat during subsequent
drying. As an example of the influence of the last-named condition :
in one case, when indigo was carried in by a current, the coarser
particles were deposited over a triangular or semicircular area,
while the finer material spread over the whole space.* Further, any
pressure or force acting upon the mass during drying may influence
the form assumed ; thus bubbles sometimes exercise a resistance on
the part surrounding,       f
   Materials which consist of grains too large and heavy to be easily
moved may give rise to a rude attempt at a pattern.                Thus, ordinary
fine sand exhibited a dendritic form, a deep channel or gutter extend -
   * The corner of the   cover-glass was propped up with a few bristle*.
   t  Included   bubbles sometimes   are surrounded by concentric bands of the finer
material, as if the bubble favoured a uniform evaporation.

  220        Miss C. A. Raisin.      On certain Structures formed
  ing   as   an   axis,  and   shallower    narrower  farrows  forming    the
  branches.
     In materials which consist of very finely divided particles, the
  variation in the size of the grains is too slight to produce any effect
  and the result is a uniform pattern.         Thus indigo generally forms a
  typical example of a maze. If, however, the material is smooth and
  oily, like gamboge, it is very slow in drying, and the general form
  which it assumes is that of knobbed straight axes.
     In powders of medium grain the difference in the size of the
 particles causes marked effects (e.g., chalk, prussian blue, sepia, &c.)
 If the mud is dense, drying uniformly, a mazy network is usually
 formed.      A thinner mixture may produce knobbed straight axes.
 An intermediate condition in the drying mass gives rise to feathery
 or fan shapes, or to parallel generally curving bars.
     The mode of formation can be understood by tracing successive-
 stages, and by comparing different examples. When the water begins
 to evaporate, the retreating edge of the film drags back the coarser
particles, leaving behind some of the finer material in a moist con
 dition. This afterwards dries, not however quite uniformly, so that
 it is ranged in wave-like lines, between which clear spaces or uniform
 thinner material may intervene.           If the bonndary is wide the lines
 will be almost straight, if the margin is narrow they will curve with
 smaller radius. The film of finer material, after retreating, some
times advances again in a slightly different direction as was seen in
 watching it, and two sets of curving lines are thus formed, which
partly cross one another.
    Meanwhile as the thick film retreats, its rim becomes concave
between certain points.         Then the boundaries of adjacent concavities
approach, and        in  this  way the intervening material is gradually
reduced to a streak.          Inequalities, however, exist within the film,
and, where coarser grains occur, or a clot adheres closer to the glass,
these scrape away the finer material, thus clearing paths and leaving
intervening streaks, which are radial, often curved and transverse to
wave-lines.        The clearer furrows may terminate at a knot of coarser
grains, when the force no longer suffices to move these back, so that
they remain isolated or form the initial knob of a thick stem. This
may extend as a straight axis, or, if the film of air broadens as it
indents and pushes back the muddy fluid, the curving margin may
form the beginning of a maze or network, such as was described
above.
    Between      the thick axes fine stuff is distributed on similar prin
ciples    to  those which caused the forms nenr the edge. The two
dominant       structures are the nearly parallel or concentric wave-lines
and     the   radial streaks.     But in this case the finer material is
deposited     within limited areas by which the forms are modified.        If

                       the radial streaks are the dominant feature they
                    bars   ;
form radiating curves or feathery or fan structures.      A thick mass
in its final desiccation may show cracking like the hexagonal flakes
of mud at the edge of a pond, or the thick axes of a slowly drying
material (like vermilion) may be jointed transversely. Sometimes
stellate cracks may form within a mass, as in the example already
described (fig. 4).
                                          4. Possible Applications.
   We have now to consider the possible applications of these simple
experiments to structures which occur in Nature. Water, carrying
fine suspended material, will often penetrate into rocks along a plane
of discontinuity, and drying may then give rise to a " pattern." *
   lstly. Dendritic forms upon joint or other surfaces are generally
regarded as the results of crystallisation, and this undoubtedly is
often the case, as frost spreads on a window pane.          But if the
formation takes place under the constraint of a narrow space, it may
be caused simply by desiccation in the way described above. It will
not be easy in all cases to infer which has been the exact mode of
origin ; sometimes the angle at which the branches diverge in the
dendritic structure will prove that the formation was governed by
crystallising forces ; but it is clear that both conditions often may
co-ope rate.f
  2ndly. If no cavity exists along the plane of weakness, and the
coarser axes are adherent and imbedded within the mass, they might
appear  to represent tubular structures — to be, as it were, flattened
cylinders. In course of time the molecular and the mineral charac
ter might be changed, and crystallisation even might take place
either in the original or the replacing substance. Is it not possible
that this may be the explanation of certain pazzling structures
sometimes placed as doubtfully organic, such as some of the so-called
"fucoid " markings, or the peculiar forms in certain limestones ?                             J
  3rdly. These last speculations lead us to consider the possibility of
similar contractions taking place in space of three dimensions, as wo
may call    instead of two — in the mass of a rock, instead of along its
               it,
surface.  Thus the principle governing the formation of the land
scape marble, as described by Mr. B. Thompson,           presents some   §

    The deposit of an opaline layer with cusped points around a cavity
 might be caused by the uniform drying of a smooth, homogeneous
material.        Modified by crystallisation, it might help in the formation
of agates and chalcedonic deposits.*
    Igneous rocks have formed from a molten mass which may gene
rally be considered (as pointed out by Lagorio) like a solution of the
less fusible in the more fusible constituents, or in some cases may
consist actually of two magmas imperfectly mixed.                        As it becomes
solid the two parts may mutually react in a manner analogous to
the phenomena already discussed. The forms shown in the secondary
silicification of certain rocks {e.g., cherts, silicified rhyolites, &c.)
perhaps afford another illustration.                Though this process is not
exactly comparable with the deposits of sediment described above,
yet colloid silica might penetrate in different                       directions,   and
encountering constant obstacles, give rise to an irregular, almost
felsitic structure.
     4thly. In the specimens which show cracking and expansion of
cracks to canalst or bubbles, we may see a resemblance to other
forms in igneous rocks (fig. 4). Some of the stellate or cruciform
cracks remind us of the kind of contraction which, in a semi-solidified
pyromeride, develops fissures and inlets, afterwards filled by chal
cedonic or other deposits.             Further, the grouping of cracks and
bnbbles in the drying film of mud, imitating roughly some of those
found within spherulites, would suggest that in certain of these a
crust may be formed before their complete development.                       This would
accord      with  the  view   which  Professor     Bonney     has  often  advanced,   in
conversation with me, for certain Boulay Bay pyromerides,J and
with the hypothesis which seemed to be suggested by certain Welsh
pyromerides and variolites : § that the spherulito sometimes follows,
as it were, an initial formation of a nodule which has arisen by flow-
brecciation,      or other process.
    Thus it      seems possible    that in several points the simple forms              I

and processes in rocks.                       Applying the principles we have noticed
 here, we might anticipate (even where crystallising materials are
 present)        —
     lstly. That mutual interactions may give rise to wriggling or
mazy forms.
     2ndly. That greater freedom of molecular motion                                        might cause
more rectilinear forms.
     3rdly. That the relative                      ease    of transmission in different sub
stances or conditions of a substance may govern the forms developed,
as the difference between the coarser and finer sediment.
     4thly. That the form of the external boundary influences the
structures developed, so that streaks normal to a rectilinear figure,
or radial within a sphere, are caused.
     5thly. That much depends on the relative permeability of the
surrounding magma; and the solidification in a molten mass, first
of an external crust, would act similarly to a more impenetrable
environment.

     To have fully discussed experiments in which any effect of crystal
lising forces is shown would have unduly lengthened this papor.
and on that subject some material has been published.* My main
object is to call attention to the results of mere mechanical rearrange
ment, on which I think no distinct notice is available.                                       But I may
briefly refer to a few results of crystallisation.                                      I  experimented
with solutions of various salts, mixed with gelatin, with " muds "
of vermilion, &c, and in other combinations.
     When solutions of calcium sulphate and of gelatin were mixed
in varying proportions, if the solution was weak, crystallisation
generally seemed to start at many scattered points.                                       At these thero
formed          small     crystals     or  ovoid      grains     (like potato       starch-grains,    often
compound) or clusters, frequently spherulitic. In the intervals was
 a gelatinous-looking deposit, which had no effect on polarised light.

224         Miss C. A. Raisin.          On certain Structures formed
As we add      a  larger nmount of the salt solution, the following effects
were     produced    : first, the crystallised          bodies all became larger ;
more crystal-shaped grains formed,                instead    of the rounded blebs,*
and then, beyond an irregular, clear space around each, the ground
was occupied by a more distinctly dendritic deposit, which faintly
depolarised.       In a more watery medium, the ovoid grains are more
marked.       From a mixture of vermilion in a solution of the salt, the
results are similar, but the vermilion is in clots or lumps, or scat
tered granules, with intervening, irregularly shaped spaces.                     In one
slide the clear spaces are             rather     definitely shaped      and   angular,
almost as if dominated by crystallising force, yet the crystallising salt
has formed only small, ovoid grains, clustered rather more thickly
near the central part of the space.
    The formation of spherulitic structures has been described by
several authors.        Good examples were obtained in these experiments
with sodium phosphate mixed with gelatin. A weak solution, or a
solntion of the 6alt without the gelatin, gave spherulitic structures,
though those were small and scattered.                      From a stronger mixed
solution the deposit consisted of rounded, gelatinous-looking globules,
more or less aggregated, which, with crossed nicols, showed radiate
structure and a black cross. Radial tufts of acicular crystals of
calcium sulphate are well known among microchemical                             tests; f
these were obtained from pure solutions of the salt, or from mix
tures with " mud," or with gelatin. One small isolated drop Q inch
across) of a mixture of calcium sulphate solntion and vermilion,
which dried on another slide,J exhibited spherulitic spheres or hemi
spheres (their centres being on, or just within, the circumference of
the drop), clustered like those which have been obtained in a sheet of
glass which had been raised to a high temperature and then cooled.§
    In other drops, where definite crystals were formed, the crystals
projected inwards, often with branched, almost dendritic, or skeleton,
growth. || If in certain spherulites a radial ingrowth of crystallites
takes place, as seems probable, it would be somewhat analogous to
this result of shrinkage or skin tension in the drop.
    In certain examples, where a rather concentrated solution was

 mixed with material          in suspension (e.g., calcium sulphate and ver
 milion), a mass of crystalline grains, separated by clear, narrow
 interspaces, occupy a definitely crystal-shaped                 area.    The neigh
 bouring grains are related in form, the spaces between are bent or
 curved, the whole resembling micropegmatitic                 or pegmatitic struc
 ture (fig. 5.)
    In the formation of chiastolite and other secondary minerals, the
matrix is often partly included, but in these experiments the more fluid
medium apparently separated from the vermilion, thrnst it to the edge
of an initial, crystal-shaped area, and within that formed crystalline
grains separated by interspaces.               The grains generally depolarise
uniformly, but occasionally are built up of clustered prisms, and some
times even of slender, tufted needles. Lehmann, in his classic paper,
describes the causes of irregular, or interrupted growth as due
mainly to the viscosity of the medium or the presence of foreign
substance * He points to spherulitic and dendritic forms as results.
The micropegmatite seems to be one more possible developments
This would agree with the hypothesis advanced by Professor Bonney,
that it results in igneous rocks, when the magma is kept at a some
what persistent, but not too high, temperature; so that the material
probably would be in a very viscous or partly solidified condition. J
   While this paper was in progress, I received from Professor
Bonney the following interesting note (drawn up by him some years
ago),§ the more valuable as made upon one of nature's experiments.

a mixture of mechanical sediment and of a crystallising salt, and
the forms in the mud might remain even if the salt were afterwards
dissolved.
   The note is as follows : — " In walking along the pavements during
the late frost, before the sun or the feet of the public had produced
an effect, I was often struck with the forms of the ice crystals.                   The
pavements were dirty ; much fine mud, brought from the roads on
the boots of pedestrians, had been pretty evenly distributed in a
thin film. During the night this had been arranged in rod-like
crystals, often 3 or 4 inches long. These formed groups, spreading
like the sticks of a partly opened fan.                     They were sometimes

 slightly curved,* perhaps about £ inch in diameter, and £ inch at
 thickest.     They differed from the ' frost ferns,' in a mjich greater
 simplicity of structure, being more like little bunches of grass
 arranged along a stem than those exquisite and intricate fabrics of
 the ice-world. They reminded me sometimes of the groups of
 actinolite crystals in certain crystalline schists, as for instance at the
 St. Gothard.         These actinolites, on examination under the microscope,
 prove to be not pure crystals, but much interspersed with granules
 of pre-existing minerals.              It occurred to me that the probable
 reason for the formation of these ice structures was the impediment
 offered by the small grains in the mud to the growth of tiny crystals.
 Only here and there, where circumstances were exceptionally favour
 able, a crystal larger than usual would be developed, which, as it
 advanced, gathered to itself other crystalline molecules.                    Thus
 would be started a bunch of coarse crystals, springing from a common
 centre, growing more easily in the direction of the axis of the
 rhombohedron, just as in the case of frost ferns, but they would be
 simpler, coarser, and arrested by the impediments, instead of delicately
 flexured by the almost imperceptible inequalities of the glass.
    " I obtained on a later morning,
                                                strong confirmation of this view.
 Heavy     rain    fell  all  through   the  preceding day, followed by a clear
 night, with a ground-frost. In many places the pavements had
 been washed very clean.               On the clean paving stones I saw, not
unfrequently, early the next morning, fairly delicate frost ferns
 (though not equal to those on glass).               Where the surface had been
a little dirty, the forms were less intricate and coarser; in some
rather dirty places the old types could be seen.
    "
      Postscript. — What is written here was my impression at the time,
but I have since doubted whether the crystals were not ' muddier '
than the part around.             It was not possible to examine the pavement
very closely     ;  also  I  noticed  on a later occasion that the trampling of
the film of mud (prior to freezing), which produced a kind of con
centration in an irregular network of wavy lines or bands, appeared
to have something to do with the formation of the flowers."
    This note suggests that analogous processes may be traced in
schists, like those of the St. Gothard, and the mode of formation of
certain crystals in schists has been described in papers already pub-
lished.f      On this point, however, it is needless to enlarge, as we may
hope    to receive      more results, since Professor Bonney has communi
cated a paper dealing with this subject to the Geological Society.

coTcred, so that the mud spread out somewhat irregularly.        In other examples
similar results were obtained, after running in material or keeping up a current
for a short time to carry the mud along.

                                           (Abstract.)
  The object of this research was to determine systematically       during
a period of several months' duration, the exact  relationship of structure
and size existing between certain hybrid and parent Echinoid larval
forms. Eight different species of Echinoids were worked with, but
the larger number of observations were confined to three of them,
viz., Strongylocentrotus lividus, Sphcerechinus granulans, and Echinus
tnicrotuberculatus.    The method of procedure was similar to that
described in a former paper.*      It consisted in shaking pieces of the
ovaries and testes of the various Echinoids in small jars of water,
and then mixing portions of the contents. In the cross-fertilisations,
precautions were of course taken to prevent any accidental direct
fertilisation of the ova. After standing an hour, the now fertilised ova
were transferred to large jars of water, holding, as a rule, 2 to 3$
litres. Here they were allowed to develop for eight days, when the
plutei formed were killed, preserved, and examined under the micro
scope. The structure of the hybrids, in relation to that of the parent
forms, was studied ; and all the larva?, both pure and hybrid, were
measured by means of a micrometer eye-piece in respect of their
body length and anal arm length.           Fifty larvae were, as a rule,
measured in each case.      In addition, the ova were examined under
the microscope twenty-four hours after fertilisation, and the numbers
of blastuto and unfertilised ova in a given volume of water counted.
Again, after eight days, the number of plutei surviving was similarly
estimated.
   Upon the cross Sphcerechinus ? Strongylocentrotus     twenty-two              6",
experiments were made. As a rule only about 10 per cent, of the ova
were fertilised, and only per cent, of them reached the eight days
                                     1
plutcus stage. The hybrids were most easily obtained in the summer
months, few or none of the ova being cross-fertilised in the winter,
unless the aids to fertilisation made use of by O. and B. Ilertwig.f
and by Born, were adopted.
              J                  Thus the former observers showed
that  ifthe ova were shaken in water and kept some hours, so that
their vitality became diminished, they underwent cross-fertilisation
                  Phil.

             Hybrid and Parent Forms of Echinoid Larva.               229
much more readily than when freshly shed. Born, on the other hand,
found the cross fertilisation could bo increased by increasing the
amount of sperm added. Both methods, but especially the former,
were found of value       in the present research.
    As regards the structure of the hybrids under discussion, it was
found    that the majority of those obtained in May, June, and July
were of an almost pure Sphcerechinus type, only a third or less of
them being of an intermediate or Strongylocentrotus           type.    In
November, on the other hand, only about a sixth were of the maternal,
and five-sixths of the paternal type.         Finally, in December and
January, all the hybrid larva? were of the paternal type.           These
latter larva in almost all cases showed obvious traces of their hybrid
origin, but they were evidently much more inclined to the Strongy
locentrotus than to the Sphcerechinus type.      Thus the body skeleton   •
was like that of Strongylocentrotus, only it generally had a few
abnormal projections springing from it. It was also, as a rule, about
25 per cent, shorter.      The anal arm skeleton generally consisted of
two rods, but there were very seldom any cross bars joining them,
such as occur in Sphcerechinus larva?.
    On tho reciprocal cross of Strongylocentrotus ¥ and Sphcerechinus $
eighteen experiments were made.          During April, May, and June a
fair number of the ova were cross-fertilised, but no plutei were
obtained.     In July and August some 47 per cent, of the ova were
fertilised, and 29 per cent, of them survived to the eight days pluteus
stage.     In November and December, on the other hand, with one
exception, not only were no plutei obtained, but as a rule not a
single ovum was cross-fertilised. The hybrid larva? themselves were
of the pure Strongylocentrotus type, but in one instance the arms of
the larva? were very much longer than had ever been noticed in any
other case. These hybrids appeared therefore to be of the nature of
sport.
     These extraordinary variations in the capacity for cross-fertilisa
 tion seem to be due to the variations in maturity which the sexual
 products undergo with change of season.            Thus in the summer
 months most of the Strongylocentrotus individuals contain but very
 small quantities of ripe sexual products, or none at all.     Also from
 the fifty different series of observations made on normal Strongy
 locentrotus larva), it appeared that the size of the larva? kept at the
 maximum from the beginning of April till the beginning of May,
 but then began to dwindle down, so that at the beginning of July it
 reached its lowest level. The larva? were now sometimes 30 per cent,
 smaller than the spring larva?.      After the middle of August thoy
  gradually increased again, and by the end of November had attained
  their maximum size. Sphcerechinus larva?, on the other hand, kept at
  about the same size throughout the year, though considerably

  230   Relations    of Hybrid and Parent Forms of Ecliinoid Larvce.
 smaller numbers of the ova reached the plutens stage in the summer
 than in the winter months. We see therefore that the Strongylocen
 trotus T-Spha?rechinus<? hybrid is only formed at the time when the
 Strongylocentrotus ova have reached their minimum of maturity ;
 whilst in the case of the reciprocal hybrid, it follows that as the
 maturity of the Strongylocentrotus sperm increases, it is able to trans
 mute first a portion and then the whole of the hybrid larvce from the
 Spha?rechinns    to  its own type.    In other words, the characteristics of
 the hybrid offspring depend directly on the relative degrees of maturity
 of the sexual products.
    As a result of the ten experiments made on the cross Echinus ? -
 Strongylocentrotus S , it was found that the hybrid larva? were on an
 average about 8 per cent, larger than the pure parental larval forms,
 and, moreover, that even more of the cross-fertilised ova developed to
 plutei than of the directly fertilised ones. The hybrid larvce were of
 a variable, but more or less intermediate, type.         In the reciprocal
 cross, on the other hand, only a small proportion of the ova under
 went fertilisation, and only about 1 per cent, of them reached the
pluteus stage. These plutei were on an average 13'2per cent, smaller
than the pure maternal larva?. In structure they were of a Strongy-
 £ocen<ro<us-intermediate    type.
     Hybrids   between     Sphosrechinus  ? and Echinus 3 were obtained
 on only two occasions.       The larva? were of a very variable Echinus-
 intermediate   type, and were much dwarfed.         In the reciprocal cross,
 hybrids were also obtained only twice, but then about 60 per cent, of
the ova reached the plateus stage.          These hybrids were of the pure
Echinus type.      On   most  other  occasions a small number of the ova
 were cross-fertilised, but failed to develop to plutei.
    Hybrid larva?, of the maternal type, were obtained on crossing
Arbacia ova with Strongylocentrotus and with Echinus sperm, but
with Sphosrechinus sperm only gastrula? resulted.         Hybrids were also
obtained between Arbacia $ and Strongylocentrotus, Sphcer echinus,
and Echinus ? . These hybrids were of the maternal types, but in
some of the Sphosrechinus hybrid larva? the anal arm skeletons were
similar to those in pure Arbacia larva?.
    Hybrid larva? were obtained between Echinocardium cordatum ?
and Strongylocentrotus, Sphosrechinus,        Echinus, and Arbacia        the
larva? being of the maternal type, but somewhat modified by the
nature     of the     sperm.     The hybrids between         Echinocardium
mediterraneum ? and Strongylocentrotus and Echinus £ were of an
intermediate type ; hence, one is afforded a physiological argument
in favour of the specific difference of these two forms, the existence
of which has hitherto been considered rather doubtful.
    Hybrid larva? of the maternal type were obtained on crossing
Strongylocentrotus ? with Vorocidaris $ , but the reciprocal            cross

  Relations of Hybrid and Parent Forms of Echinoid Larva.            231
yielded only gastrulaa.       Finally, hybrids, of a presumably    inter
mediate character, were obtained from the cross Echinus microtuber-
c.ulatus$ and Echinus acutustf. With the ova of Sphcerechinus and
Echinocardium, and the sperm of Echinus acutus, only gastrulas were
obtained.
    On performing cross-fertilisations with the colour varieties of
Sphoer echinus, there was found to be a distinct diminution of fertility.
In the most marked instance, obtained in the experiments made on
June 2, it was found that when white-spined varieties were fertilised
with white-spined, and violet-spined with violet, 98-5 per cent, of
the ora reached the blastula stage, and 73 per cent, the eight days
pluteus stage.     But on cross-fertilising white-spined with violet-
spined individuals, only 68 per cent, of the ova developed to
blastula?, and 15-6 per cent, to plutei. Alao these crossed larvae were
4"5 per cent, smaller than the uncrossed.        Other series of experi
ments    were  made  in July,  November, and  December,  the differential
fertility seeming to gradually diminish with the progress of the season.
Nevertheless, it was always most distinctly present. On crossing the
less definitely marked colour varieties of Strongylocentrotus, a small
amount of infertility seemed to be present in one series of experi
ments, but none at all in another.

 yielded only gastrulee.      Finally, hybrids, of a presumably       inter
 mediate character, were obtained from the cross Echinus microtuber-
 eulatusi and Echinus acutusg. With the ova of Sphcerechinus and
Echinocardium, and the sperm of Echinus acutus, only gastrulte were
obtained.
     On performing cross-fertilisations with the colour varieties of
 Sphcerechinus, there was found to be a distinct diminution of fertility.
In the most marked instance, obtained in the experiments made on
June 2, it was found that when white-spined varieties were fertilised
with white-spined, and violet-spined with violet, 98'5 per cent, of
the ova reached the blastula stage, and 73 per cent, the eight days
platens stage.      But on cross-fertilising white-spined with violet-
spined individuals, only 68 per cent, of the ova developed to
blastnlee, and 15-6 per cent, to plutei. Aloo these crossed larvae were
4'5 per cent, smaller than the uncrossed.          Other series of experi
ments were     made  in July, November, and December, the differential
 fertility seeming to gradually diminish with the progress of the season.
 Nevertheless, it was always most distinctly present. On crossing the
 less definitely marked colour varieties of Strongylocentrotm, a small
 amount of infertility seemed to be present in one series of experi
 ments, but none at all in another.

   A Calorimeter for the Human Body." By William Marcet,
      M.D., F.R.S. Received March 10,— Read April 28, 1898.
         (From the Physiological Laboratory, UniTersity College, London.)
   At   the meeting      of the Physiological Society held at University
College    in  March,   1897, I exhibited and described a calorimeter con
structed for the purpose of determining the heat given out by man.
Several members of the Society, in succession, allowed themselves to
he shut up in the chamber where they experienced no discomfort
whatever.       The instrument was also described the same year to the
Societe   de   Physique et d'Histoire Naturelle of Geneva, but no full
account of it has been published so far.
   The first calorimeter for the investigation of animal heat was made
hy Lavoisier and Laplace,* who enclosed an animal in a chamber
surrounded with ice and determined the heat evolved by measuring
the amount of ice melted. Crawford, in 1788, placed the air chamber
inside a water-jacket, and determined the heat emitted by means of
the increased temperature of the water.                   An objection to this
type of calorimeter is the very small rise in the water temperature,
¦and the difficulty of obtaining an uniform temperature in such a large
volume of water.          J. Bosenthal,t in 1878, introduced a calorimeter
in which the heat given out from a small animal was absorbed by a
fluid with a low boiling point, such as ordinary ether, the amount of
heat was calculated from the volume of the fluid evaporated and ita
known latent heat of vaporization.
    Bosenthal,J at a later date, constructed a calorimeter, which con
sisted of three concentric chambers of sheet copper, and was made
in duplicate ; the two instruments were connected by means of a
U-shaped manometer.            The heat given out by an animal, such as a
•dog,  enclosed   in the   innermost    chamber of one of the instruments,

  ¦was communicated to the middle chamber, and from the position of the
  meniscus   in the manometer, the initial temperature of the experiment
 and the barometric pressure, the heat emitted in a given time was
 indirectly calculated.
    Experiments were made on man with a modified form of this
 instrument by enclosing an arm in one of the two inner chambers.
Hirn* investigated the heat emitted by man by making use of a
 wooden chamber in which he had previonsly ascertained the rate of
loss   of heat through its walls.          This was done by burning a known
volume of hydrogen gas within the chamber until the temperature
became constant, and then determining the heat lost per unit of
time, from the known volume of gas burnt. This method at first
sight commended itself by its simplicity, but was open to two objec
tions — the first that it was an indirect method of inquiry, the second
that the person under          experiment      was unavoidably     subjected to a
high temperature.
    In 1889 Richetf published an elaborate investigation on animal
heat, in which he made use of a calorimeter             constructed in such a
way that the heat emitted by an animal in a closed vessel displaced
by pressure      a volume      of water equal to the expansion of the air in
the calorimeter.
    An ingenious animal-calorimeter was constructed lately by Messrs.
J. S. Haldane, W. Hale White, and J. W. Washbourne.+                         These
gentlemen determined the heat given out from an animal, by com
paring the pressure resulting from the expansion of the air in a
closed     jacketed space surrounding the chamber containing the
animal, with the corresponding expansion produced by the burning
of a known volume of hydrogen gas in another similar vessel.                   The
amount of gas bornt is regulated with a stopcock, so that its heat
should correspond exactly with that produced in the other chamber
as indicated by a differential manometer.            The heat emitted is equal
to that of the combustion of the gas burnt.
   Messrs. W. 0. Atwater and E. B. Rosa, of Connecticut, U.S.,§
have quite recently measured the heat emitted from a person by
placing him in a large calorimeter, where he lived for periods of from
one to twelve days.           The walls of the chamber were donble, and
made of sheet copper and sheet zinc, while the heat generated was

carried away by a stream of water ; according to the authors, tests
showed this calorimeter to be very accurate.
   The construction of the present instrument was suggested from
Berthelot's calorimeter, for the determination of specific heat by
mixtures, in which the heat given out is reflected by bright surfaces
of silvered copper surrounding at a short distance the vessel con
taining the mixture. It was found, however, in experimenting with
the new calorimeter (which was not silvered inside), that all the
heat was not reflected, a certain proportion being absorbed by the
copper, which necessitated an arrangement for determining the
temperature of the metal.
   The instrument (see figure) consists of a wooden chamber lined
internally with a thick padding of cotton wool, and externally with
several thicknesses of felt. Inside this chamber there is another
made entirely of sheet copper, the inner surface of which is main
tained carefully polished ; its height is 145 cm., and its breadth is
69 cm.     The two chambers have between them an annular space
from   4 to 5 cm. in breadth.   The capacity of the copper chamber,
empty, is 810'4 litres, and its weight 62"370 kilograms, therefore an
alteration of 1° C. in the temperature of that mass of copper wonld
be equal to 5832 (small) calories, or would raise 5832 grams of
water 1° C.
   The copper chamber is closed by means of a movable panel also
constructed of copper, which is fixed to a wooden backing ; the edge
of the copper panel is made to press tightly against an india-rubber
cushion carried round the rim of the opening in the copper chamber,
while the edge of the wooden backing is applied against the rim of
the wooden chamber, and the panel is kept in its place firmly with
brass screws.    This movable door is too heavy to be handled easily
by one man, and on that account is fixed to a tackle fastened to a
beam in the roof of the laboratory, by which means no difficulty is
experienced in opening or closing the chamber.
   There is a small window 21 x 15 cm., made of two superposed
panes of very thick glass, and opening into the two chambers ; when
closed, the rim of the inner pane presses against a cushion around
the corresponding opening in the copper chamber; it shuts by a
spring bolt, and should the person under experiment feel uncom
fortable, or wish to communicate with the outside, he can push open
this window at any time.
   Inside the copper chamber there are two ventilators, or perhaps
                 "
more correctly     agitators," in the form of revolving fans, the object
of which is to thoroughly mix the air inside the chamber.        One of
these agitators is fixed high up in the chamber, the other low down
on the opposite side. The upper agitator was found experimentally to
produce a blast of 190 litres per minute— say about 380 litres per

                     A Calorimeter for     the  Human Body.                   235
minute for the two ; nearly the whole of the air in the chamber
would be carried through the two agitators every two minutes.* The
number of revolutions of the fans recorded by counters amounts
together to two or three hundred thousand per hour.
   The motor power for working the fans is obtained from the wires
used for the electric light of the laboratory, and exerted through two
small dynamos — one for each agitator, while the action of either one
or the other can be regulated by a carbon-resistance.
  * The resistance caused by the ice, and a rose jet on the track from the lower
agitator, would probably reduce the draught to some little extent j no doubt, how-
eTer, that the air is very thoroughly mixed inside the chamber.

 236                          Dr. W. Marcet.
    The upper agitator is disposed in such a way as to drive the air of
the chamber through a mass of ice roughly broken up, and held in a
 cylindrical tin vessel open at the top, suspended from the roof of the
 chamber.      The cold air having from its increased density a tendency
 to fall, is taken up by the lower ventilator and driven upwards ; by
 such means a circulation of the air in the chamber is maintained
through the ice-holder.      Should the temperature of the chamber rise
 during the experiment, by increasing the draught through the ice
more ico is melted and the rise is checked ; the reverse holds equally
good.
    The ice used for absorbing the heat emitted by the person under
experiment      delivers its water into a flask holding a thermometer
divided into fiftieths of a degree centigrade ; the flask and ther
mometer are both weighed.           The flask hangs from a hook on the
side of a tube projecting from the bottom of the ice-holder.
   Besides the thermometer in the flask, there are three other ther
mometers all centigrade, also divided into fiftieths of a degree,
connected with the calorimeter ; the bulb of one of them projects
into the copper chamber while its stem is carried outside above the
wooden chamber ; a second has its bulb fastened down to the side of
the copper chamber by means of a strip of copper which covers it
entirely, its stem also projecting outside ; the third thermometer
is passod through the wooden chamber into the annular space, whose
temperature it shows during the experiment.
    The successive stages of an experiment are as follows : — the heat
emitted from the body is first rapidly distributed throughout the
chamber, then it is absorbed by the mass of ice, reappearing in
measurable form as water.       Knowing that 79 calories are required
for melting 1 gram of ice, the total calories corresponding to the
ice melted are easy to calculate.
   Some of the heat emitted falls upon the brightly polished surface
of copper of the chamber, most of it is reflected into the chamber, but
a certain proportion becomes absorbed in the metal, and is determined
by the thermometer attached to the walls of the chamber.         Perhaps
a very small amount passes through the copper walls into the
annular space, it might have been neglected, but has been taken into
account in every experiment.         A number of experiments showed
that the copper was equally heated in every part, or very nearly so,
while the test experiments made with hydrogen gas placed that
question quite at rest.
   The thermometers were generally read and the readings recorded
every ten minutes, the temperature of the copper being used as a
guide towards the maintenance of a constant temperature through
out the instrument.
   It will  be readily understood  that  a difference of as much   as  1°

                   A  Calorimeter    for  the Human Body.                  237
at  the end of the experiment in the temperature of the air of the
copper chamber was not of great moment from the low spe^fic heat
of air ; indeed, such a difference would only yield 214 calories, which
is but trifling on say, 90,000 calories given out in one hour.          On the
other hand, a slight difference in the temperature of the copper
proved of importance on account of the mass of metal.
   There was no difficulty, however, in maintaining the temperature
of the copper within 0-3° or 0-4° of its original reading before the
experiment.      Should it accidentally run up beyond that figure, a
very   rare   occurrence,   this only lasted a minute or two, and by
increasing the blast through the ice, the temperature of the copper
was soon brought down to its initial reading.               A similar remark
applies to falling temperatures of the copper ; by stopping the
draught through the ice they soon rose to the initial reading.               Of
course, constant attention to the temperatures was required during
the whole experiment, which, with but few exceptions, lasted one
hour.
   There remained, however, a serious difficulty to contend with,
owing to the heat produced by the action of the ventilators or
agitators.
   At first the friction of the bearings on which the fans rotate was
thought to be the main cause of this heat ; and, in consequence, their
position was altered so as to be placed entirely outside the wooden
chamber.      This, however, failed to mend matters, and it became
evident that the friction of the revolving blades against the air was
the source of the heat produced.         The only method of overcoming
the difficulty was to determine the heat produced exclusively by the
agitators and subtract it from the total heat obtained in each experi
ment.
   It was now found     necessary to introduce counters registering the
number of revolutions for each of the ventilators up to 1,000,000
turns. The inquiry necessitated by the ventilators (say agitators)
took up a considerable portion of the winter 1896-97.
   These experiments were carried out exactly in the same way as
those made on the living body, with' this difference, that while from
10 to 15 lbs. (4'5 — 6'8 kilograms) of ice were wanted when a human
subject was under experiment, from 500 to 800 grams of ice only
had to be used with the agitator experiments.              The following is the
result of one experiment taken at random amongst a great many
others : —

   Unfortunately the heat produced by the revolving fans was not
found to be exactly proportional to the number of revolutions, or
rather squared revolutions, although the figures approximated to each
other much nearer on the same day than on different days.                 It was
therefore decided to make two* preliminary experiments with the
agitators on the same day as each calorimeter experiment, and to
subtract the agitator calories from the total calories obtained. As
the number of revolutions was not exactly the same in the test
experiments and in calorimeter experiments, the calories for correc
tion were calculated in proportion to the revolutions in the test
experiment, of course previously squaring the revolutions.
   The following table shows in calories the heat produced by the
ventilators during forty minutes from a few experiments, the number
of revolutions is about 230,000, and the calories are calculated for
200,000 :—

    From these experiments the mean error is 218 calories, or on, say,
  70,000  (emitted in forty minutes) = 0'3 per cent.
    I now felt able to rely on the work undertaken with the calori
 meter ; still the instrument had to be tested, and with this object it
 was applied to the determination of the heat lost by a jar holding
 6 or 7 litres of hot water and comparing the heat recovered with the
heat lost by the water ; the calorimeter was also used towards the
estimation of the heat produced by the combustion of a known
volume of pure hydrogen gas, comparing the heat recovered with
that known to be produced by the combination of that volume of gas
with oxygen, and this work I undertook                  in conjunction with
R. B. Floris, F.C.S.
   The first set of experiments with hot water proved very trouble
some.     It was found necessary to mix the layers of water in the jar
before and after the experiment, and to read correctly and quickly a
thermometer registering up to 0-02 of a degree centigrade ; more
over the loss of heat could not be determined while the jar was being
carried to and shut up in the calorimeter ; and a similar difficulty
was experienced on removing the jar from the calorimeter at the end
of an expeiiment.         Notwithstanding these many causes of error, as
will be seen in the following table, the mean of the results approxi
mated very closely to the calories calculated from the loss of heat of
the water.
   If, for instance, the jar contained 6 litres of water or 6000 grams,
and lost 10° of temperature in the calorimeter, say, from 75° to 65° C,
then 60,000 calories, with slight corrections for the specific heat of
water at that temperature, and the thermal capacity of the jar, would
have to be found in the calorimeter.
   These experiments are tabulated as follows : —

    Although there was in one case as much as 8"04 per cent, differ
ence between the calories found and the calories lost from the jar,
still the mean of the eleven experiments differs only by 1*41 per
cent., which is a near resnlt considering the difficulty of the experi
ment.
    The determination of the heat produced by the combustion of
hydrogen was certainly a more satisfactory method than the former
for testing the calorimeter ; hydrogen was prepared for the purpose
in the usual way by the action of sulphuric acid on zinc, the gas
being    purified through solutions of potassium hydrate and cupric
snlphate, and collected over water in a bell-jar carefully graduated.
The receiver was supplied with a gauge, showing the pressure to
which the gas was subjected, and a thermometer ; from 20 to 29 litres
of gas were used in each experiment.
    After making the required preliminary essays with the agitators,
the experiment was proceeded with as follows : —
    First of all it was necessary to find out and to adjust carefully the
speed of the gas delivery, and with that object a weight was placed
on the bell-jar, while the rate of issue of the gas was regulated at
will by means of a screw clamp on the track of the gas tube.* In
that way the speed of the gas delivered was adjusted so as to produce
on burning about the same heat as a person would emit in the calori
meter in a given time.
    The delivery tube led from the bell-jar into the calorimeter
 through a fixed metal tube carried across the walls of the two
 chambers of the calorimeter, its end being connected with a suitable
burner; when lighted, the gas burnt with bnt a very small flame.
    Before commencing the experiment the tube was rinsed out with
 hydrogen and the thermometers were read, together with the pointer
 on the scale of the bell-jar.           Then the gas was turned on and
 lighted, the vessel containing the ice hung in position, the stop
 watch started, the calorimeter closed, and the agitators put in
 motion.     Of course every care was taken to keep the temperature of
 the calorimeter constant, which was done without any difficulty, the
 temperature of the copper varying seldom by more than 0"1° or 0'2° C.
    When forty minutes or an hour had elapsed (mostly forty minutes),
 the temperatures       were read, the gas turned    off, and the agitators
 stopped.      Next the calorimeter was rapidly opened, and the flow of
 water from the ice to the flask arrested ; the temperature of the ice
 water was then read off, these various operations being carried out
 as rapidly as possible.         It was necessary to determine the heat
 absorbed by the burner, which was done by plunging the burner,
 immediately after turning off the gas, into 200 c.c. of water at a
    * The gas was carried as much as possible through glass tubing, in order to
 avoid the loss by diffusion through india-rubber.

known temperature and determining the rise of temperature of the
water; the burner was found to absorb 300 calories during the
experiment. The pointer showed on the scale of the bell-jar the
volume of hydrogen burnt, and the gauge the pressure the gas was
under in millimetres of water, while a thermometer gave the tem
perature of the gas in the bell-jar, and a barometer the atmospheric
pressuro ; the hydrogen gas was of course saturated with water
vapour.       Hence we were in possession of every data for the reduc
tion of the gas to the dry state, to 0° C, and 760 mm. pressure.
   In the early experiments it did not occur to us to analyse the
hydrogen gas in order to ascertain its degree of purity, but we did
so subsequently, using for that purposo the eudiometer constructed
by one of us (W. M.), which for several years has been exclusively
adopted in this laboratory for the determination of oxygen in expired
air ; the analysis of the gas introduced but a very slight correction.
The following table gives the results of the experiments we made on
the heat emitted by the combustion of a given weight of hydrogen
gas.     It might be added that the machine known as "Brunsviga"
was used for the calculations, which saved much time and trouble ;
by this means the whole of the calculations could be completed in
about fifteen minutes.

 difference is only one of 3' 78 per cent., and the mean difference did
 not exceed   34 calories on 34,462, amounting to 0"1 per cent. only.           It
 may therefore be concluded that the present calorimeter has proved
 itself very accnrate for the determination of the heat produced by
  the combustion of a given volume of hydrogen gas ; and, conse
 quently it can be accepted as equally reliable for the correct estima
  tion of the heat radiated      from the human body or from that of a
 fairly large animal.

         (From the Physiological Laboratory of University  College, London.)
     Dr. Marcet's calorimeter having been f nlly described in the previous
 paper, the present conjoint authors now submitted themselves to
 experiment, one of them remaining shot up in the chamber, usually
 for the space of an hour, while the other was engaged outside to
 regulate the temperature of the chamber and note the readings of
 the thermometers.
     When breathing was carried on inside the calorimeter, it might
 be thought that the air of the chamber became too full of COs or too
 deficient in oxygen for the purposes of respiration. Such, however,
 was not the case, and no discomfort whatever was experienced in the
 course of an hour's incarceration. It is easy to calculate from a con
 sumption of, say, 26"488 grams of 0 per hour that supposing the
 calorimeter to be absolutely air-tight, a condition which was not
actually realised, there would be a fall of oxygen, after one hour
 spent in the calorimeter, equal to a redaction of pressure from
 760 mm. to 668 mm., and this would correspond to an elevation of
about 7000 feet (2135 metres) above the sea level.               Such an altitude
 would certainly not be trying to the respiration.
    The experiment was carried out as follows in every instance : —
    Previous to entering the chamber the subject of the experiment
sat down in the laboratory to rest, in many instances taking his
temperature, sublingual, with a clinical thermometer.
    In the meantime a weight of ice varying between 10 lbs. and
15 lbs. (4"5 to 6'8 kilograms), according to circumstances, was cut
into blocks about 2 or 3 inches diameter, and placed in the ice holder,
where the blocks were disposed as much as possible in a position to
allow the air from the agitator to circulate freely between them.               A
temporary receiver for the water from the melting ice was hung to a

          Enquiry into  the Heat given out   by the  Human Body.      243
hook soldered to the tube delivering the ice water, for which receiver
a flask of a capacity of over a litre was substituted on starting the
experiment in the chamber.
    When all was ready, the person under experiment          stepped into
the calorimeter and sat down on a wooden chair.              Immediately
afterwards the ice holder was hung up in the chamber to a strong
hook fastened to the roof ; then the tube from the upper agitator
was connected with the ice holder, and the flask with a thermometer
in it, previously weighed, was substituted for the temporary small
receiver of the melted ice. At that very instant the stop-watch was
started to register the time spent in the chamber, the door was
closed and screwed down, and the two agitators were set in motion.
It might here be observed that the person in the calorimeter felt no
draught, as the air from the lower agitator was driven up behind him
through a rose-jet, and that from the upper agitator fell in front of
him on its exit from the ice holder.      Indeed no sensation of cold was
experienced,    or  any  discomfort   whatever,   the temperature in the
 chamber remaining exactly the same within a few tenths of a degree
centigrade throughout the experiment.           In those cases where the
air expired had to be collected for analysis, this was done by means
 of a face-piece strapped to a cap fitting the back of the head.      The
 face-piece  was supplied   with a  glass tube, which was taken between
 the lips and used for tho expiration, while another tube served for
 the nasal inspiration from the outside of the chamber, without the
 intervention of any valves.      Fresh air was thus inspired through
 the nose and expired through the mouth — a method of breathing
 with which we were familiar.       The inspiratory tube communicated
 with the external air through the walls of the chambers, while the
 expiratory tube was connected at will either with the bell-jars or the
 open air.     The bell-jars were suspended in such a way that the
 person in the chamber never knew when he was breathing into the
 open air or into the air holders.     Three bell-jars were in use, and in
 many cases an india-rubber bag, faced with oil-silk, was pressed into
 service, so as to allow of the collection of an increased volume of ex
 pired air.   The volume of air collected, though only including the air
  expired during from twenty minutes to half an hour, taken at intervals
  through the whole time, certainly gives an accurate estimation of
  the composition of all the air breathed while in the calorimeter,
  considering that the person remains in a perfect state of repose
  during that time, except, perhaps, for a minute on entering the
  chamber.
     On one occasion the whole of the air expired in one hour was
  collected, and in that experiment it was found that the volume
  of air expired in half an hour, taken at different intervals of time,
   was proportional to the volume expired in the whole hour.

  244    Dr. W. Marcet and Mr. R. B. Floris.                 An Experimental
    The observer, whose duty it was to read the thermometers, stood
 up on a stool ready to work the regulators of the dynamos, and by
 constant attention the temperature               of the metal of the copper
 chamber was not allowed to fall or rise beyond abont 0"3° from the
 initial reading.
    After an hour, measured to a second with the stop-watch, a last
 reading of the thermometers was taken while at the same time a signal
 was made to the person in the chamber by showing him a light, and
 he immediately closed the stopcock of the tube letting the melted
 water into the flask.        By this means the water collected was given
out exactly in one hour, the agitators were stopped, and the person
 under experiment finally let out.          As soon as the door was open, the
temperature of the ice water in the flask was recorded.
    The sublingual temperature when required was again taken at
that time, if it had not been determined in the last few minutes of
 the stay in the chamber.
    The next process was to weigh the flask with the ice water and
thermometer, and by subtracting the weight of the empty flask and
thermometer, that of the melted ice was obtained.                      In one hour's
experiment the water from the melted ice amounted to rather over
1000 grams, but its weight varied on each occasion.                     The counters
in connection with the agitators were now read.
    This completed the data for the calculation of the calories re
covered in the chamber.           The calculations very simple one, is illus
trated in the following table, which gives the particulars of one

    The first set of experiments was undertaken in order to ascertain
whether in the course of an hour there is any variation in the heat
given out by the same person, and, with this object in view, the heat
emitted by each of us in turn was determined throughout the first
and second half-hours spent in the calorimeter.             It was found neces
sary to introduce a three-way cock into the tube delivering the water
from the melted ice into the flask ; this three-way cock diverted the
stream at will into one or other of two flasks hanging to the tubes
leading from the ice-holder.
    The results obtained were as follow : —
                   Calories in two half-hours in succession.

   Total for the eleven experiments, 0'75 per cent, increase in second
half-hour. (Calculation from total figures.)
   Therefore,    in the case of W. M., the mean of five experiments gave
a difference of   only 0'42 per cent, in the calories emitted during two suc
cessive half-hours, while, in the case of R. B. F., the mean difference of

           Enquiry into     the  Heat given out by      the Human Body.        247
  six experiments was only by 1*76 percent. The mean difference (from
  total figures) from the two persons in eleven experiments amounted
  to 075 per cent., showing that practically the mean heat emitted was
  the same in each     of two consecutive half-hours. There were, how
  ever, differences, though      usually slight, in each pair of experiments
  — sometimes an increase, sometimes a decrease — the reason of which
  is difficult to assign.
     The calories given out by the various persons experimented upon
 were taken generally between lunch and dinner, say at a mean time
  of about two hours after a full luncheon, and therefore under the
 immediate influence of food.         But towards the end of the inquiry a
  certain number of experiments were made just before lunch, corre
  sponding with others made after lunch, in order to determine in a
  general way the effect of a fnll mid-day meal on the heat-producing
  power of the body.        The mean of seventy-two experiments on four
  persons, aged respectively 15, 27, 28, and 69, gave 102,907 calories
  per hour,* and varied from 80,639 to 137,078. In other words, the
  mean heat given out in one hour was such as would raise 102,907
 grams of water by 1° centigrade (from 0° to 1°).
     The next point we submitted to enquiry was the relation, if any,
 between the oxygen absorbed from the air breathed, and the calories
 omitted at the same time.
     The oxygen absorbed was determined by collecting the air expired
 by the person in the calorimeter, and estimating the COj and O con
 tained in the expired air. This was done by methods fully described
 in previous papers (by W. M.), and need not be further insisted
 upon.     We found the method of breathing for collecting the air
 expired (inspiration through nose and expiration through mouth)
 quite satisfactory in every way, the subjects for these experiments
 being all used to this mode of breathing.
     It is important to observe at the outset that, while there were
great differences between the calories found for each person, the
oxygen absorbed from the air in every individual case did not
exhibit such marked variations ; moreover, except in a very general
way, the oxygen absorbed failed to vary in proportion with the
number of calories emitted.
    * These experiments include the whole number made, most of them under the
influence of a full meal, but a few fasting, or before the mid-day meal.  Of course
thev can only be expected to give a general idea of the mean calories emitted by
man, as the amount of heat emitted varies with every different person, and under
different conditions as to food and many other circumstances.

    These lists include thirty -six experiments on three different persons,
in all of which the oxygen taken from the air, while in the chamber,
was determined.         At the outset a striking similarity is observed
between the means of the calories produced for 1 gram of oxygen
absorbed.
        (Mean of    17 exp.)    With W. M. that figure is          4042

    It is, therefore, obvious that there is a definite relation of cause
to effect in the absorption of oxygen towards the production of
animal heat.       These figures must not be considered as absolutely
 final ; they show that under similar circumstances relating to time
of food, &c, the mean calories produced for 1 gram of oxygen absorbed
 are the same for different persons, at all events as far as can be
 gathered from the three subjects experimented upon ; and, moreover,
 it may be concluded that the true figure closely approximates 4000
 (small calories).       Hirn, from his experiments, gives 5'22 large
 calories for 1 gram of oxygen absorbed, which exceeds our figure
 (4'00) to a marked extent.
    Tf the volume of oxygen absorbed from the air was proportional to
 the calories given out during the same time, then, by placing in a
tabular form the numbers for the calories found, beginning with the

          Enquiry into  the Heat given out hy   the Human Body.        251
highest number and ending with the lowest, and also inscribing
opposite these figures those showing the oxygen absorbed in each
corresponding experiment, it would be expected that the figures for
oxygen absorbed would follow in succession those for the calories
found, beginning with the highest and ending with the lowest.
Such, however, is far from being the case. Therefore, except in a
very general way, as shown by onr means and under similar circum
stances with reference to food, the oxygen taken from the air
does not produce heat in the body in proportion to the amount absorbed.
And this may be taken as a clear indication that the oxygen absorbed
in a given time is not a measure of the heat produced during that
same time.
    Should tables now be made of the calories in numerical order,
                                                              "

1 gram oxygen absorbed         opposite its respective calories, a peculiar
occurrence is observed. It will be seen readily by a consideration of
the foregoing tables that if the calories found in one hour and
those calculated for 1 gram oxygen absorbed be grouped three
by three (or even two by two), the calories for 1 gram oxygen
 absorbed decrease fairly regularly together with the falling for the
 hour-calories (less so when taken two by two), and this takes place
 in the case of three different persons, and therefore cannot possibly
 be accidental.    It follows that 1 gram of oxygen absorbed from the
 air is attended with the emission of either 5031 calories or 3292
 calories, as extremes for one person, and for another person either
 4455 or 3433 calories, and again for a third either 4126 or 3398
  calories. The readiest explanation of this phenomenon is the assump
  tion of a storage of oxygen in the tissues, which is made use of,
  although unaccounted for (as oxygen absorbed) at the time. Still,
  the mean relation of the oxygen absorbed to the heat emitted remains
  the same, being as nearly as possible 4000 calories for 1 gram
 oxygen absorbed under similar conditions.
     This shows that whatever be the mode of action of the absorbed
  oxygen it repeats itself in a general way, if taken at similar periods
  with reference to food, &c.
     There is a circumstance in these experiments which should be
  taken into account concerning the frequent change of temperature
  of our bodies while in the calorimeter, as ascertained by sublingual
  observations with a clinical thermometer.        The cooling reached an
  extreme of 0 45° C, though usually only 015" or 0 2° C, but it
  varied much in different experiments, while on some occasions there
  was no change, and even once or twice a rise was observed.        The fall
  of temperature was thought at first to be due to the proximity of
  the ice in the chamber ; but the same effect was observed by taking
  W. M.'s sublingual temperature while sitting quite quiet for an hour

out of the calorimeter, when a distinct and gradual fall in the sub
lingual temperature occurred to the extent of 0-2° C.
   We looked carefully through the results obtained, in order to
ascertain whether this cooling of the body while under experiment-
had any appreciable influence either on the heat emitted, or on the
oxygen absorbed, but failed to observe any phenomena which might
be ascribed to such a cause ; it must, however, be attended with some
effect.
   A few experiments were made on the influence of food iu a general
way by comparing the heat given out in the calorimeter by the same
individual, shortly before, and one or two hours after the midday
meal, the meal consisting of a full allowance of meat, potato, bread,
and a glass of beer.      The experiments before luncheon are, there
fore, in a comparatively fasting condition, and those after luncheon
may be looked upon as being under the influence of a full meal.

    Therefore out of nineteen experiments only three show a fall iu
the amount of heat emitted after lunch.              Of these three, one (W. M.)
is easily accounted for from the digestion of the person under
experiment being on that day somewhat out of order, and very
little food being taken. In the other instances, in which the labo
ratory boy was in the calorimeter, he acknowledged finding it diffi
cult to sit quiet, and movement may easily account for the irregular
result.
    It follows from these experiments that the rule is an increR.se in
the emission of heat from the body after a full meal.
    Finally it was of interest to ascertain how far the heat emitted by
the body is in proportion to the weight of the body.                The following
table shows clearly that this relation is subject to great variations ;
the lightest person under experiment, also the youngest (being
sixteen years of age), gave out a mean amount of heat per kilo,
weight greatly exceeding all the others.

     When the work connected with this paper was nearly completed,
 it occurred to us that there were two important omissions in the
 enquiry. The first was the neglect to take into account the heat lost
 from the calorimeter by the air expired when it was collected for
 analysis ; * on the other occasions the air was expired into the calo
 rimeter, and therefore there was no loss of heat from that cause.
 We now made a few experiments, taking the temperature of the air
 expired at its exit from the chamber.             The excess of this tempera
 ture over that of the air inspired was used for calculating the heat
 lost, and the correction introduced where necessary.                  This figure
 varied somewhat for each person under experiment.                     The second
 omission was leaving the carbonic acid which might have collected
     * Supposing the air expired was found on its exit from the calorimeter to be
  8° C. higher than the external air, and that this volume of air reduced amounted
  to 112 5 litres in 25 minutes, this would gWe a weight of 145-5 grams of air,
  which multiplied by the specific heat of air (0-2375) and by 8, the excess tem
  perature = 276 4 calories, or for an hour 663 calories.   On a total heat of 95,000
  calories, the heat thus lost would only amount to 07 per cent.

254     Dr. W. Marcet and Mr. R. B. Floris.              An Experimental
in the calorimeter unaccounted for. Some COa must be derived from
the skin, and perhaps some small quantity of air might possibly have
escaped from the face-piece into the chamber.
   The calorimeter was conveniently available for the determination
of the CO,, which might have collected in it, hs the chamber was
perfectly closed, whatever minute openings there were being much
too small to allow of any diffusion out of the chamber.                This was
tested experimentally        in the course of the present enquiry by
expiring air into the bell-jars, while out of the calorimeter ; shortly
afterwards     the same person entered the chamber and breathed in
it for forty minutes or an hour. The mean of eight experiments
gave figures for the COj in and out of the chamber exactly the
same.*
   The determination of the CO, in the air of the chamber while
breathing the external air was made by putting on the face-piece
on entering the calorimeter, and after the door was closed, rinsing a
dry flask (holding about 6 litres) with air from the upper agitator ;
this flask was then stopped with an india-rubber cork, having a tube
with a stopcock inserted through it. After sixty minutes another
large, dry flask, full of fine, dry sand, was suddenly emptied of its con
tents, and closed with a cork similar to that nsed with the other
flask.    The determination of C0t was made in each flask with a
standard solution of barium hydrate, by Pettenkofer's method.               The
 C0a   in  the  chamber     was  obtained      by subtracting  the   weight  (or
volume) of CO, found in the chamber at the very beginning of the
experiment from the weight of the CO, found in the chamber after
the subject had remained an hour in it. This CO, varied somewhat
with the three persons who submitted to experiment ; the mean
value for each of us was used for the correction of the oxygen ab
sorbed ; this correction was, however, but small, varying from about
 1 to 3 per cent.' of the CO, determined in the air collected in the
 bell-jar.

        Enquiry into    the Heat given out by  the Human Body.        255
 tested on two successive   half-hours is found to be the same when the
 means   of the calories are taken, although in each separate experi
 ment the heat emitted may vary to some slight extent.
    2. The heat emitted by the same person varies, and the extent of
 this variation is wider in some subjects thau in others ; thus in
 W. M.'s case the calories emitted in one hour from twenty-six experi
 ments varied from 122,124 to 80,639, or by 33 9 per cent, of the
larger figure. In the twenty-one experiments of R. B. P. they varied
from 106,839 to 80,985, or by 24 2 per cent.       With E. R., in eleven
experiments, from 137,078 to 111,754, or by 18'5 per cent.
   3. As a fact irrespective of theory the mean number of calories
found from three different persons, under similar circumstances of
food, &c, corresponding      to 1 gram of oxygen absorbed from the
air, was the same, and can be stated in round numbers at 4000.
Had more experiments been done fasting, this figure would have
shown a slight tendency to fall.
   4. Although the mean calories per individual for 1 gram oxygen
absorbed under similar circumstances of food, ice., are the same, still
in the experiments taken singly, the number of calories correspond
ing to 1 gram oxygen absorbed, vary, and this in a regular way.
The greater the heat given out, the greater the calories produced for
1 gram oxygen      absorbed, and vice versa.    Therefore, either a given
amount of oxygen absorbed can produce different quantities of heat,
or the oxygen found as absorbed does not represent that to which
the heat is due; this second alternative appears the more probable.
   5. The influence     of a meal, as ascertained on three different
persons, is well marked.         Taking the midday meal, when mixed
food is eaten, generally with a good appetite, the calories emitted
about two hours after lunch show an increase over those given out
about three or four hours after breakfast.         The excess varies in
different persons, and according to the   kind and amount of food taken.
   6. The calories emitted per kilo, weight of the body are subject
to marked variations in different persons.
   A few experiments were made on the influence of clothing on the
heat emitted, but we thought it best to reserve that subject for a
future communication.

" Preliminary     Note on the Liquefaction of Hydrogen and
      Helium:'      By James Dewar, M.A., LL.D., F.R.S., Ful-
      lerian Professor of Chemistry in the Royal Institution-
      Received and read May 12, 1898.
   In a paper entitled " The Liquefaction of Air and Research at
Low Temperatures," read before the Chemical Society, and pub
lished in their ' Proceedings,' No. 158, an account is given of the
history of the hydrogen problem and the result of my own experi
ments np to the end of the year 1895.               The subject is again dis
cussed in a Friday Evening Lecture on " New Researches on
Liquid Air,"* which contains a drawing of the apparatus employed
for the production of a jet of hydrogen containing liquid. It was
shown that such a jet could be used to cool bodies below the tem
perature that could be reached by the use of liquid air, but all
attempts to collect the liquid in vacuum vessels failed.              No other
investigator has so far improved on tbe results described in 1895.
 The type of apparatns used in these experiments worked well, so it
 was resolved to construct a much larger liquid air plant, and to
combine with it circuits and arrangements               for the liquefaction of
hydrogen,    which   will be    described    in   a  subsequent paper.     This
 apparatus, admirably constructed by the engineers, Messrs. Lennox,
Reynolds, and Fyfe, took a year to build up, and many months have
been occupied in testing and making preliminary trials.              The many
failures and defeats need not be detailed.
    On May 10, starting with hydrogen cooled to —205° C, and
under a pressure of 180 atmospheres, escaping continuously from the
nozzle of a coil of pipe at the rate of about 10 cubic feet to 15 cubic
feet per minute, in a vacuum vessel double silvered and of special
construction, all surrounded with a space kept below —200° C,
liquid hydrogen commenced to drop from this vacuum vessel into
 another doubly isolated by being surrounded with a third vacuum
 vessel. In about five minutes, 20 c.c. of liquid hydrogen were col
lected, when the hydrogen jet froze up from the solidification of air
 in the pipes.    The yield of liquid was about 1 per cent, of the gas.
 The hydrogen    in  the liquid condition is clear and colourless, show
 ing no absorption spectrum and the meniscus is as well defined as in
 the case of liquid air.    The liquid has a relatively high refractive
 index and dispersion,       and the density appears to be in excess
 of the theoretical density, viz., 0-18 to 0'12, which we deduce
 respectively from the atomic volume of organic compounds and the
 limiting density found by Amagat for hydrogen gas under infinite

compression.      My old experiments         on the density of hydrogen in
palladium gave a value for the combined body of 0 02, and it will be
interesting to find the real density of the liquid substance at its
boiling point.     Not having arrangements at hand to determine the
boiling point, two experiments were made to prove the excessively
low temperature of the boiling fluid.              In the first place, if a long
piece of glass tubing, sealed at one end and open to the air at the
other, is cooled by immersing the closed end in the liquid hydrogen,
the tube immediately fills, where it is cooled, with solid air. The
second experiment was made with a tube containing helium.
    The ' Cracow Academy Bulletin ' for 1896 contains a paper by
Professor Olszewski, entitled " A Research on the Liquefaction of
Helium," in which he states " as far as my experiments go, helium
remains a permanent gas and apparently is ?nuch more difficult to
liquefy than hydrogen." In a paper of my own in the Proceedings
                                                                   '
of the Chemical Society,' No. 183 (1896-7), in which the separation
of helium from Bath gas was effected by a liquefaction method, the
suggestion was made that the volatility of hydrogen and helium
would probably be found close together just like those of fluorine
 and oxygen.       Having a specimen of helium which had been
 extracted from Bath gas, sealed up in a bulb with a narrow tube
 attached, the latter was placed in liquid hydrogen, when a distinct
liquid was seen to condense. A similar experiment made with the
 use of liquid air under exhaustion in the same helium tube (instead
 of liquid hydrogen) gave no visible condensation.                   From this
 result it would appear that there cannot be any great difference in
 the boiling points of helium and hydrogen.
    All known gases have now been condensed into liquids which can
 be manipulated at their boiling points under atmospheric pressure
 in suitably arranged vacuum vessels. With hydrogen as a cooling
 agent, we shall get within 20° or 30° of the zero of absolute tem
 perature, and its use will open up an entirely new field of scientific
inquiry.     Even as great a man as James Clerk Maxwell had doubts
as to the possibility of ever liquefying hydrogen.*              No one can pre
dict   the properties of matter near the zero of temperature.           Faraday
liquefied chlorine in the year 1823.            Sixty years afterwards Wrob-
 lewski and Olszewski produced liquid air, and now, after a fifteen
 years' interval, the remaining gases, hydrogen and helium, appear as
 static liquids. Considering that the step from the liquefaction of air
 to that of hydrogen is relatively as great in the thermo-dynamic sense
 as that from liquid chlorine to liquid air, the fact that the former
 result has been achieved in one-fourth the time needed to accom
 plish the latter, proves the greatly accelerated rate of scientific
 progress in our time.

258              Mi\ S. R. Roget.          Effects   of prolonged
   The efficient cultivation of this field of research depends npon
combination and assistance of an exceptional kind ; but in the first
instance money mast be available, and the members of the Royal
Institution deserve my especial gratitude for their handsome dona
tions to the conduct of this research.            Unfortunately its prosecution
will demand a further large expenditure.              The handsome contribution
made by the Goldsmiths Company ought also to be mentioned as
very materially helping the progress of the work.
   During the whole course of the low temperature work carried out
at the Royal Institution, the invaluable aid of Mr. Robert Lennox
has been at my disposal ; and it is not too much to say that but for
his engineering skill, manipulative ability, and loyal perseverance,
the present successful issue might have been indefinitely delayed.
 My thanks are also due to Mr. J. W. Heath for valuable assistance
in the conduct of these experiments.
" Effects of Prolonged Heating on the Magnetic Properties of
      Iron." By S. R. Roget, B.A. Communicated by Professor
      Ewinq, F.R.S. Received April 4,— Read May 12, 18H8.
   It has been known for some years that when transformers are
kept in use, their open-circuit loss is liable to increase considerably
 with the lapse of time. This implies a deterioration of the iron core
in regard to magnetic hysteresis.                The subject began to receive
attention in 1894-5, when some curves showing this increase in
hysteresis were published by Mr. G. W. Partridge.*                      The effect
 was first thought to be due to a species of magnetic fatigue, resulting
from repeated reversals of magnetism in the iron, but it was proved by
 Professor Ewing early in 1895 not to be due to this cause ; t and
 was further shown by the experiments of Mr. Blathy and Mr.
 Mordey to be a direct effect of heat and to occur in transformers as a
 consequence of the iron being maintained for long periods at a com
 paratively high temperature.         Continued baking of iron was found
 to produce a similar augmentation of hysteresis.                   The published
 results of Mr. Mordey,J and, later, those of Mr. Parshall,§ deal
 with prolonged heating at temperatures which do not exceed 140° C.
 At the suggestion of Professor Ewing, the author has been carrying
 out, in the laboratory of the Engineering Department of Cambridge
 University, some investigations which deal with a more extended
 range of temperature.          The experiments are still in progress, but

                Healing    on the   Magnetic Properties of Iron.                     259
already results have been obtained which appear to be of sufficient
novelty to warrant publication.
   The hysteresis of the iron was directly measured by means of
Professor Ewing's Hysteresis Tester, in which the work spent on a
specimen rotating in a magnetic field is observed and is compared
with the work spent in rotating standard specimens.*                          In these
experiments the same pair of standards was used throughout for
the calibration of the hysteresis tester. The test specimens were
all cut from the same sheet of metal and were of soft Swedish
transformer plate, having very low initial hysteresis.                      They were
first tested in the annealed state and were then heated in small
ovens which were kept hot by means of incandescent lamps.                            The
temperatures      of  the   ovens   were   observed     in   most  cases by mercury
thermometers,         but those above 200° C. were measured by a
Callendar-Griffiths platinum pyrometer.                  The specimens were taken
out of the ovens from time to time to                 be tested, and all the tests
of hysteresis     were made at atmospheric temperature.                    It was not
found possible       to  keep the temperature         of   each oven very constant,
bat when the ovens were once hot, the variation of temperature
was rarely more than 10 degrees C. in either direction.                       To these
variations may be ascribed certain irregularities which will be
apparent in the observations, but the general character of the
changes due to prolonged heating is sufficiently clear. Each specimen
consisted of a bundle of seven strips 3 inches long, and about                   \  inch
wide, and each strip was annealed separately by heating it to redness
in a Bunsen flame, and allowing it to cool in the air.                  As the effects
of prolonged heating described below were in all cases found to be
completely removed by reannealing, the same samples could be used
over and over again, and this was in fact done in most cases. In all
the experiments the measurement of hysteresis relates to cyclic pro
cesses in which the induction B changes from + 4000 to — 4000
C.G.S. units.
    The effects produced by baking differ widely at different tempera
tures.      Below 40° C. the author has found no evidence of any
change.       Between 40° C. and about 135° C. the hysteresis simply
increases with time, at least during the longest time of heating tried
in these experiments.            The increase of hysteresis is relatively rapid
at first, and becomes slower as times goes on. Curves 1 — 4, fig. 1
show results of this natnre by exhibiting the percentage increase
in hysteresis after various times of baking.                  The absolute values of
the hysteresis at       the  different   stages   are  stated    in Table I in ergs
per cycle per cubic centimetre (for B = 4000) together with the rise
expressed as a percentage of the initial hysteresis to the nearest

2(50            Mr. S. R. Roget.     Effects of prolonged
1  per cent. The curves have been sketched by joining the observed
points instead of drawing smooth curves through them, ns this avoids
confusion of points belonging to different curves.
   It was found however that at higher temperatures, from about
105° C. upwards, a maximum value of the hysteresis was attained
in a comparatively short time, after which continued heating caused
a marked decrease of hysteresis instead of a further increase.    The
initial rise at the higher temperatures is very rapid ; for example,
the hysteresis doubles in a few hours at a temperature of 160° C,
and reaches nearly three times its initial value in a few days.
Curve 5 of fig. 1 exhibits this case, the data for which are given in
Table I. After seven days of heating, the hysteresis of this sample
began to decrease, and in fifteen days it had fallen to 2^ times
its original value. A still more notable decrease occurs at higher

262             Mr. S. K. Roget.        Effects of prolonged
   It appears that there is a temperature        in the neighbourhood of
180°  C, for which    the maximum increase of hysteresis is greatest.
With higher temperatures the hysteresis, although rising more rapidly
at first, does not reach so high a maximum value and begins to fall
sooner and faster, tending apparently to a lower steady state the
higher the temperature.      An example of this is shown in curve 7,
fig. 1 (temperature 260° C), where a fairly low and nearly steady
state is reached in the last days of the heating.        In this instance it
took the iron only about a quarter of an hour to reach its maximum
of hysteresis, which was only 91 per cent, higher than the initial
value.
   Fig.  2 shows the earlier stages of the action for temperatures
of 125° C. and over.     It will be noticed that the peak at which the
hysteresis  reaches its maximum     in each case comes sooner the higher
the temperature, and that its height becomes redoced when the
temperature is high.     The absolute values of the hysteresis in the
experiments to which these curves relate are given in Table II.
   It is probable that the attainment of a maximum value followed
by a decrease is not confined to temperatures above 135° C, and it
                                   Fro.  3.

                  Heating    on the Magnetic          Properties              of Iron.            2(53
is intended to carry out experiments to find                       if this is so, using more
prolonged heating.
    In order to exhibit the character of the change in magnetic
property, supplementary experiments were made by the ballistic
method, using a ring of soft iron formed by coiling up a long strip
of sheet metal. This was first annealed, and tested in the annealed
state.    It  was then baked by heating at 200° C., and cyclic curves
were determined in the usual way after the ring had become cold.
The results are stated in Table III, and are shown in the curves of
fig. 3.     Curve 1 shows the initial state (after annealing), where
the value of the hysteresis is 830 ergs per cycle per cubic centimetre
(B = 4000). Curve 2 shows the state after nineteen hours of baking
at 200° C, when the hysteresis had greatly increased and had
reached a value of 1580 ergs.                   Curve 3 was taken after further
heating at the same temperature for four days, by which time the
decrease of hysteresis is very apparent, its value having diminished
to 1420 ergs. Permeability curves, taken by the method of reversals
after heating during the same periods, are given in fig. 4 and
                                            Fio.   4.

   In order to ascertain whether the effects could be due to the
iron taking up anything from the atmosphere, a couple of specimens
were, at the suggestion of Professor Ewing, sealed up in exhausted
bulbs and heated in the same oven with others exposed to air.
No evidence, however, was found of any difference between the
iron heated in vacuo, and that heated in air.
   There is nothing to show that when baked iron is left for a
long time it recovers from the condition produced by baking.                  But
in all cases the iron is restored to its original state of low
hysteresis   by reannealing.

have been taken, for a ring of the same material, by the ballistic
metbod, up to a magnetic force of 25 C.G.S. units.     A comparison of

of the induction is unchanged by prolonged heating, for although the
earlier part of the curve, as in the case given above, was much
altered, the parts of the curves above a force of 15 C.G.S. units are
practically indistinguishable. — May 15, 1898.]

       Functions."      By E. T. Whittakeu, B.A., Follow of

                               (Abstract.)
    If u and z are variables connected by an algebraic equation, they
are, in general, multiform functions of each other; the multiformity
can be represented by a Riemann surface, to each point of which
corresponds a pair of values of u and z.
    Poincare and Klein have proved that a variable t exists, of which
u and z are uniform automorphic functions ; the existence-theorem,
however, does not connect t analytically with u and z.        When the
genus (genre, Geschlecht) of the algebraic relation is zero or unity, /
can be found by known methods ; the automorphic functions required
are rational functions, and doubly periodic functions, in the two cases
respectively.     But no class of automorphic fuuetions with simply
connected fundamental polygons has been known hitherto, which is
 applicable to the uuiformisation of algebraic functions whose genus
 is greater than unity.
    The present memoir discusses a new class of groups of projective
 substitutions, such that the functions rational on a Riemann surface
of any genus can be expressed as uniform automorphic functions of
 a group of this class.   These groups are sub-groups of groups gene
 rated from substitutions of period two.     Groups are first considered
 which can be generated by a number of real substitutions of period
 two, whose double points are not on the real axis, and whose product
 in a definite order is the identical substitution. These groups are
 found to be discontinuous, and of genus zero. A method is given for

2o8         Algebraic Functions and A utomorphic Functions.
dividing the plane into curvilinear polygons     corresponding to sncEi
a group   ; these polygons are simply-connected,   and cover completely
 the half of the plane which is above the real axis.      Sub-groups of
these groups are found, whose genus is greater than unity, and
which are appropriate for the uniformisation of any algebraic
curves.
    The sides of the polygons, into which the half-plane is divided, are
formed of arcs of circles orthogonal to the real axis.   These may, in
the sense of Lobatehewski's geometry, be regarded as straight lines.
One case, where the construction fails, is shown to correspond to the
limiting ease in which Lobatehewski's geometry becomes Euclidian
geometry; the figure then becomes the division of a plane into
parallelograms, used in the theory of doubly periodic functions, and
is appropriate for the uniformisation of algebraic curves of genus
unity. Thus doubly-periodic functions are a limiting case of the
class of functions considered.
    The automorphic functions of the groups described solve the
problem of conformally representing a plane, regarded as bounded
by a number of finite lines radiating from a point, on a curvilinear
polygon, whose sides are derived from each other in pairs by pro
jective substitutions of period two.       This leads to the conformal
representation of any Riemann surface, at each of whose branch
points only two sheets are connected, on a curvilinear polygon whose
sides are derived from each other in pairs by projective substitutions;
and, as it is known that any algebraic curve can, by biratioual trans
formation, be represented on a Riemann surface whose branch-points
are all simple, it is seen that the uniformisation of algebraic func
tions of any genus can be effected by groups of the kind described.
    The analytical connexion between the variables of the algebraic
form and the uniformising variables is given by a differential
equation of the third order.     A certain number of the constants in
 this equation have to be determined by the condition that the group
of substitutions associated with the equation leaves nnchanged u
certain circle.     When any arbitrary values are given to these con
stants the solution of the differential equation is termed a quasi-uni-
 formising variable.    The: properties of quasi-unifonuising variables,
 nnd their relation to the uuiformising variable, are discussed in the
 last section of the paper.

   The authors record their observations on a year's work in collect
ing phyto-plankton along a track from the Channel                 to Panama
carried oat by Captains Milner and Rudge, and also during one
voyage to    Brazil by Captain Tindall.       They also give the results of
their own observations on living material at sea.        The material was
obtained by the pumping method.
   One of the objects of their work was to determine, if possible, the
nature of the Coccospheres and Rhabdospheres.            They describe the
minute structure of the calcareous plates or coccoliths and rhabdo-
liths, and record the existence in the Coccospheres of a single central
green chromatophore,       separating into two on the division of the cell.
They regard CoccosphoBraceee as a group of Unicellular Algre, and
they define the group, the limits of the genera and species.             The
Coccospheres and Rhabdospheres from the surface are compared with
those   of the deep-sea deposits and their identity established. They are
also compared     with geological coccoliths and rhabdoliths from various
beds, and many objects regarded by geologists as true coccoliths and
rhabdoliths are rejected.       A large number of new Peridiniaccae were
discovered     and  are  formally described and figured.        No specific
diagnoses of marine       Peridiniacea;    have previously been published,
authors of species having depended on figures, and, at most, a few
 words of description.      It is hoped that the present systematic treat
ment of the subject will conduce to greater order in the group.
The authors record the occurrence of all the foi'ms in seven tabular
statements, one for each collecting voyage.
    Observations   of the diatoms and Cyanophycca) were also made, and
 are briefly treated.
    A study was also made of the species of Pyrocystis, of which they
 describe a new one.      The facts they record tend, in their opinion, to
confirm the view originally expressed of it by Dr. John Murray, its
 describer, that it is a unicellular alga, doubts having been entertained
 of the accuracy of this opinion by several biologists.

    The remarkable advance in our knowledge of the constitution of
gases that has marked the latter half of this century has immensely
strengthened a belief in the doctrine of atoms.          It is to this doctrine,
therefore, that we naturally turn to assist us in the study of the
intimate structure of solids. The solid, however, stands at the oppo
site pole to the gas ; in the one the particles are unrestrained, free
to move about any axis, and along paths of comparatively wide

  range, before exerting mutual action on each other ; in the solid, on
 the other hand, they are so closely packed that in many cases the
 abstraction of heat is accompanied by only a very inconsiderable
 approach of the atoms to nearer proximity.          Thus among metals,
 that having one of the highest coefficients of expansion is indium ;
 but this only contracts 0 00004 of its bulk for every degree centi
 grade that it is lowered below the ordinary atmospheric temperature ;
 nor does it continne to contract at this rate, but at a continually
 diminishing one, as its temperature is progressively reduced. A
 metal with a very low coefficient of expansion is iridium, which
 loses only 0 000006 of its volume for every degree that it falls in
 temperature.    Among non-metallic elements we may point to the
 remarkable case of the diamond, which, with the small coefficient of
 000000118, actually ceases to contract at all when cooled below
 42° C.    It may be possible by other means to effect greater reduc
 tions in the volume of solids, but so far as the withdrawal of thermal
 energy is concerned, it evidently accomplishes but very little, at
 least in the case of solids treated at a temperature considerably
 below their fusion points.
    The assumptions made in the study of gases are of the fewest and
simplest kind, but they include one that is of fundamental import
 ance in the investigation of solids, viz., that in some sense an atom
is a body occupying space ; it is only by making this admission that
 deviations from important laws like Boyle's find an explanation.
    The dominion of an atom over a certain region of space endows
 that space with form ; what that form is we do not know, though we
may eventually discover.      In the absence of knowledge it is permis
sible to make some      kind  of assumption, and then to endeavour to
discover how far the consequences of that assumption accord with
ascertained facts.     I  propose to make the simplest assumption
possible, and to regard the volume of space appropriated by an atom
as having the form of a solid of revolution, and very generally of a
sphere. "Within this space there exists    something, the energy of the
atom, or a force of repulsion, or both,   which preserves it from inva
sion by other atoms ; outside it there is something, a pressure or force
of attraction, which drives tho atoms      as close together as possible
withont causing interpenetration.      It will probably be found also
that these influences, pressures, and thrusts, are directed, or that the
atoms are polar.
    Dalton's law of multiple proportions seems to meet with its counter
                                                 " the
part in crystallography in Haiiy's law of              rationality of the
indices," and the conception by which Haiiy sought to explain this
and    other facts relating to the form and structure of crystals
presents singular points of resemblance to Dalton's ideas of atoms.
Hauy's views on crystalline structure appear to me to contain the

     Recent work by     Lord Kelvin, Mr. Tutton, and others, has given

     As Professor Miers tells us, " the three            minerals have almost the
 same form, but differ only in the length of             one crystallographic axis
  (parameter).     The lengths of this . . in            the three minerals are in
 the ratio of 5 : 7 : 9. Thus the addition                of the olivine radicle,

 MgjSiOi, exerts a so-called morphotropic                 action along one definite
 axis, and causes a certain constant increase iu the length of this axis
 (parameter)."      "It  is further a curious fact that the length of this
 (parameter) varies directly as the number of magnesium atoms in
 the compound."      The inference that the magnesium atoms are dis
 posed along this axis would seem to follow naturally.
    Mr. Barlow has lately completed an investigation into the differ
 ent ways in which spherical bodies of different volumes may be
 packed together so as to produce different crystal forms.                       His
method of treatment is general, and many of the arrangements of
atoms, which I am myself led to imagine as existing in certain
crystals, will, no donbt, be found to fall as special cases under his
general laws.      But I do not propose in this communication to merely
suggest    some   way in which atoms regarded as spheres may be built
up into geometrical forms ; my purpose is different, it is to consider
csrtain particular substances, and to endeavour to discover the par
ticular structure which must most rationally be assigned to them.
Further, to avoid misconception, it should be added that the "law of
closest packing," which is so admirably developed by Mr. Barlow,
does not seem to be obeyed by the greater part of the crystals I have
investigated; so far as the cubic system is concerned, there is but
one simple substance in which the atoms are as closely packed as
possible, that is the diamond.
    It is a singular fact that crystals of the cubic system, when com
posed of salts which are diatomic, such as NaCl,KCl, are character
ised by a cubic     cleavage, while those composed of triatomic salts

such    as cuprous oxide (Cu,0), or fluorspar (CaFj), possess an octa-
liedral cleavage.     Let us for the moment follow the hint given by
  Haiiy, and regard the cubic crystals with cubic cleavage as reduced
 by repeated cleavage to a primitive cubelet. How in the case of a
 diatomic compound composed of atoms of different relative sizes, as,
 say in common table salt, can the molecules be arranged together so
 as to produce this cubelet ?
                                   Fig. 1.
    The only satisfactory way that I can discover is to place one mole
cule (NaCl) by the side of another (CINa), as in the diagram (fig. 1),
 so that tangent planes to the pairs of atoms may form a square
 prism, and then to rest on the top of this two more molecules, simi
 larly put together, the chlorine of the upper group resting on the
sodium of the lower, and the sodium of the upper on the chlorine
of the lower ; common tangent planes to the exterior of the spheres
taken in fours will be found to form a cube.
    This is a simple and possible arrangement of the molecules of
common salt, but whether it alone and not some other is the actually
existent arrangement is a question for argument.
    Ever since Kopp formulated his famous laws, the subject of
atomic volumes has possessed great interest for the chemist, though
 the discrepancies which too frequently impair the correspondences
discovered by Kopp have evoked a general feeling of mistrust.
    Nevertheless  I am persuaded that in atomic volumes we possess the
touchstone by which our conjectural arrangements may be brought
to the test.    The study of atomic volumes and crystalline structure
cast mutual light upon each other.
    Kopp obtained his volumes by dividing the molecular weight (m)
of a substance by its density (d), thus mjd = v. Evidently if
atoms have the form of solids of revolution, this volume is a lump
quantity, including not only the volume of the atoms, but of the
interstices between them.      We shall therefore speak of it as the
gross   volume  (V), in contradistinction  to the true relative volume (»)
of the atom.
   The shortest way of explaining our method of investigation will
be to describe at once the process as applied to the haloid compounds
of the alkali metals. Let us commence with common table salt. Its

molecular weight is         58-513 (Na 23-06 + CI 35-453).*                 Its density,
corresponding to the specific gravity, found as the resnlt of very-
careful determinations by Retgers, is 2'167 at 17° C.                         The gross
volume is then 58513/2-167 = 27-0002. If this number be multi
plied by 4, it will give the volume of a primitive cubelet, supposed
to be built up of 4 molecules, as already described.                   The cube root of
this number (108-01) is 47623, and represents the length of an
edge of the cubelet, or the sum of the diameters of the atoms of
sodium and chlorine, by which this edge is determined.                         The next
step is to endeavour to obtain some probable value for the ratio of
these diameters, that of the sodium to that of the chlorine atom.
   It is quite certain if the sodium and chlorine atoms do not both
occupy the same space, that the volume of sodium, and the other alkali
metals, is very different in the free state and in combination.                      This
is a conclusion to which Kopp was led, who found that by assuming
a reduction of the volume in the free state to one-half when the
element entered into combination, he obtained fairly constant dif
ferences on subtracting the half volumes of the metals from the
volumes of the chlorine salts.                    Our investigations Bupport this
opinion of Kopp.        In the following table data for investigation are

    It will   be observed that the difference between the gross volume of
the salts containing the same haloid element and the gross volume of
 the metal they contain is approximately equal in all cases ; thus,
the common difference in the case of the chlorides varies from 14'4
to 15-27 ; in the case of the bromides, from 20-487 to 20-032 ; in that
of the iodides, from 32'23 to 29'299.            It was assumed by Kopp that
these differences corresponded to the volume of the haloid element.
We make the same assumption, and by treating the subject from
another point of view obtain a more consistent agreement between
the differences which represent the volumes of the haloids.
    The system in which lithium bromide crystallises is not known ;
the same is true of lithium iodide, and these salts are in consequence
necessarily excluded from our inquiry. Neglecting them, it will be
seen by inspection that the greater the difference between the gross
volume of metal and the haloid with which it is combined, the
 smaller is the value found for the volume of the haloid ; thus, in the
case of the chlorides,           the smallest value found for chlorine is
14-4, and the disparity between the volumes of lithium and chlo
rine is the greatest in the series.         In the same way the bromine in
sodium      bromide has a less volume than that in the corresponding
potassium salt, and the volumes of sodium and bromine are farther
removed from equality than those of potassium and bromine. This
is a necessary consequence of such an arrangement of spheres as

  276                           Prof. W.     J. Sollas.
  we have imagined to exist             in the   case of common salt, already
  described, for it can readily        be   shown, and will presently appear,
  that the ratio of the volumes         of the eight spheres forming a primi
  tive cubelet to the volume of         the interstices continuously diminishes
  as the spheres approach equality, or, more precisely, the total volume
  of the cubelet, including interstices, is to the volume of the con
  tained spheres as 1*9099 : 1 when the spheres are all equal, and
  diminishes from this down to a limit, of which we shall have more
  to say presently, of 1-7125 when the two kinds of spheres have
 attained the greatest possible degree of inequality consistent with
 the arrangement assigned to them.
     Of the different possible modes of packing in the cubic system,
 the one we have adopted is the only one that gives this result,
 within the limits of difference in size which we are considering; every
 other kind of simple packing leads to an increase in the gross volume
 when the two sets of constituent spheres depart from equality in dimen
 sions.    There is but one exception to this statement, and this does
 not affect our argument, a.s it is true of one particular ratio only,
 and is not applicable to the haloid salts of the alkalies.
     Returning now to the imagined cubelet of common salt, we are
 able to give a value to the diameter of the sodium atom it contains ;
 thus, the gross volume of the sodium is 11/73, one-half of the gross
 volume of sodium in the free state ; suppose eight atoms of sodium
 built up into a cube in the same way that the four molecules of
 sodium chloride were imagined to be built up, one sphere to each
 corner of the cube, then the edge of the cube will be equal in length
 to the sum of the diameters of two sodium atoms. Thus, the gross
 volume of sodium 11-73 X 8 = 93'84, the gross volume of eight atoms,
                 — 4-5443, the
 and                                 length of the edge of the cube ; this
 divided by 2 gives the diameter of a sodium atom as 2-2721.* But
 the length of the edge of a cubelet of sodium chloride was found to
•be 4-7623 ; deducting the diameter of a sodium atom from this, we
 have 4-7623— 2-2721 = 2-4902, the diameter of an atom of chlorine.
     Using the value found for the diameter of an atom of sodium as
 a basis, we may proceed to treat all the haloid salts available for
 examination in the same way as follows : —
                            Diameters of                             Diameters of
                              atoms.

be regarded as the cube circumscribing the sodium sphere ; but      I am anxious to
preserve a parallelism in treating the salts and the elements.

    These results, however, are merely approximate,* for, as Professor
 Miers has pointed out to me, the diameter of the second sphere in a
 cube cannot be obtained by simply subtracting the diameter of the
 other from the edge.            Professor Miers shows that the relation
 between the length of the edge of the cube (A) and of the radius
 of the larger spheres (R) and of the smaller (r) may be expressed
 by the equation      —
                    (R + r)3 = [A-(R+r)P+[v/2(R-r)]=,
 from which he obtains —
                         R = H2r+A±y(8Ar-As)},
or                         r = £{2R + A-V(8Ar- As)}.
    Employing this formula, the diameters of the atoms are found                   to
 be as follows    : —

    There   does not appear to be any sound reason why the volume of
an   element   should remain absolutely constant and independent of the
element with which it is associated, even in a homologous series, and               I

and since    it is improbable that the component atoms of              these salts all
possess   the same        coefficient    of  expansion, it would seem that an
absolute constancy of relative volume is in a high degree impro
bable. It is sufficient, however, for our purposes if it can be shown
that the deviation from constancy is confined to narrow limits, as
indeed, from the results so far obtained, appears to be the case.
   The importance of these results for our inquiry is, however, this,
that they cannot be obtained by any other method of packing; other
methods,     instead of minimising the differences between the gross
volumes, would, on the contrary, exaggerate them.

   It 'will be observed that in every case the ratio is smaller the greater
the difference between the size of the component atoms.
   It may next be pointed ont that there exists a very important
limitation to our power of arranging pairs of atoms or diatomic
molecules in the manner we have suggested ; the two atoms of the
molecule may be equal in size, or they may be unequal, so long as the
inequality does not exceed the value of 1 : 0-7286.*
   I  owe to the kindness of Professor Miers the following method of
finding the value of this limit.                  Let the centres of the spheres
be referred to three edges of              the  cube,    meeting at one corner, as
the    axes x, y, and z. The coordinates for the centre (&) of the
larger sphere are A— R, R, R, and for the centre Ca of the smaller
sphere r, r, r. Then
                         (CC,)2 = (A-R-r)3+2(R-r)2.
   In   the limiting case, when the two larger spheres are in contact,
                                 A = R(2+ ^2),
                  /. (C,C,)J = Ra(5 + 2v/2)-2Rr(3+ ^2)3^.
Also                               (0,0,)* = (R + r)s,

   When the smaller spheres fall below the limiting value 0'729 the
tangent planes to the spheres no longer define a cube, but a figure
which is a hemimorphic form of the rhombohedral or hexagonal
system ; and in all cases that I have yet examined of diatomic salts,
belonging to a homologous series crystallising in the cubic system
with cubic cleavage, I find that directly one of the atomic volumes
falls below this limit the salt passes out of the cubic system and
presents itself under hemimorphic hexagonal forms.                    This is the case
with silver iodide, which is fully discussed in the second part of this
communication.           That the substances to which we have at present
restricted our attention consist of pairs of atoms which lie within
the prescribed limit is shown by the following table, in which the
ratios of the diameters are
  *  If the centres of the spheres he situated on the nodes of a cubic lattice, the
value of this limit will be changed.

    If the  arrangement of the atoms in the crystals under consideration
be, as    I  conceive, the actually existing arrangement, it is certainly
not the one to which views on close packing would have led us.
Nature     does not appear     to have been at all parsimonious of space,
and that atoms should be disposed in such comparatively open order
and yet produce structures            of great rigidity, almost inevitably
suggests the existence of poles or directed forces.             The importance
of the question renders it necessary to probe the matter deeper, and
we may naturally seek for further confirmation of our hypothe
sis. Since the arrangement at which we have arrived is the most
open probable, we may expect if any other arrangements exist
to find evidence of closer packing. We turn, therefore, to the
evidence afforded by solutions.         In a solution the molecules are not,
as a   rule, constrained to oscillate about fixed positions, they are not
built up into a solid architecture, but are free to glide over one
another, and to migrate from place to place. In their case open
packing is not to be expected ; in the absence of arrangement, the
closest packing will prevail.          Closest packing among equal-sized
spheres exists when one is surrounded by twelve others in contact.
It is the arrangement met with in triangular piles of round shot. In
a stack of this kind the ratio of the volume of the balls to the volume
of the pyramid they form, including interstices, is as 1 : l-35.
    On introducing a crystal of common salt into water the crystalline
edifice is destroyed, and the separated molecules become surrounded
by those of the solvent in closest packing.            As the solution is made
very    dilute   the molecules of the salt are resolved into their ions,
which wander about in the solution, still under the influence of
internal pressures, adapting themselves to the law of closest packing.
    Under these circumstances what change of volume is naturally to
be expected when common salt passes into brine ?                   Clearly a con
traction,     and   that  to a considerable amount, such, indeed, as is
always actually observed whenever the haloid salts of the alkalies are
dissolved in water.         This general observation affords strong con
firmation of the truth of our hypothetical arrangement, which
will be still further strengthened if we pursue the subject into
quantitative comparison.          The ideas involved in the expression
atomic volume are less simple in the case of a liquid than in that of
a solid.      In any   case the atomic     volume     must   be regarded     as   an

therefore, only first approximations.
   From the numbers which we have already assigned to the relative
volumes of the atoms the relative density follows from the relation
mjv = d, and by dividing d by the factor 1'85 we obtain the density

closely packed together. Data are given in the following table : —

     Some    of   these numbers are less concordant with the density
  deduced    from the crystalline structure than those obtained with
 stronger solutions, as presented in the preceding table, but it is to be
 remarked that whatever errors exist in the observations are all
 thrown on to the values we have obtained; the numbers given in the
 third column bear all the burden of error arising when dealing with
 very minute quantities.           To show how greatly our results are influ
 enced by slight      variations     in specific gravity, as given in the second
 column of numbers above,               I  have calculated backwards from the
 density   of   the  atoms     to  find    what    specific gravity should give us
 identical values for the density, as calculated from the crystalline
 structure and from solution.             It is not necessary to give the results
 for more      than   two    salts  ;   in  the case of potassium chloride the
 specific gravity of the solution, to accord with theory, should be
 10038 instead of 1-0046 observed, to reduce the density 3-9989 to
2'7668, its value on the assumptions we have made ; in the case of
sodium chloride the specific gravity should be 1'0019 to give a
density of 3'0467, instead of the 1-0038 found.                     Although different
observers do not always give the same specific gravity for the same
solutions of salts, it is certain that the discrepancies between theory
and observation before us are not to be explained away by blaming
the observations ; we have before us an interesting residual pheno
menon, susceptible of more explanations than one.
    It will  be observed that those salts the density of which is in
excess of that predicted,           are those whose volumes are relatively

small.      It is only when the ions possess a volume identical with that
of the molecules of water that exact agreement between theory and
observation can result. The molecular volume of water at 15° is
0'9987/18-006 = 18'083, and if its molecules are closely packed, the
true molecular volume will be obtained by dividing this number by
135; this gives 13'395 ; the diameter of the molecular volume is
2'9465.      Comparing the diameter of the ions with this, taken as
unity, we have : —

    It  will   be seen that the ions of potassium bromide and iodide
make     the   nearest  approach to equality with the atomic volume of
water, and should consequently give the most accordant results with
theory ; this will be found to be the case on reference to the tables,
the differences which appear are well within the limits of experi
mental error.         The chlorides are all characterised by giving to
theory density which is in excess.
          a
    Alternative explanations may be offered ; on the one hand, the
molecular volume of water has been taken as spherical, because its
molecules are most probably in rotation, but it is quite within the
bounds of possibility that the ions in their migrations may roll upon
the constituent atoms of the water molecules, and thus to some
extent invade the boundary of the molecular volume.
    In the case of the smaller ions with relatively small volume this
would lead to a considerable increase in the calculated density, while
in the case of the larger ions it would be scarcely affected. It is
also possible when the commingled spheres of the ions and water
molecules are of a diameter bearing a certain ratio to each other
that closer packing may be brought about, so that the volume of
 interstices we have allotted to the smaller ions would be reduced ;
 this is a question for geometers,
    The crystallographic study of these salts remains for consideration.
There are two ways in which the primitive cubelets may be arranged
in the construction of crystals : they are shown in plan in figs. 2 and
3 ; both give homogeneous assemblages in the cubic system, but
that shown in fig. 3 is holohedral, that in fig. 2 is hemihedral.
    • March 4. — Bat, as Ramsay and Shields hare shown, the     molecule of liquid water
 includes four molecules of the formula H20 ; the difference    between  its dimensions
 and those of the ions is therefore greater than is given here.

When, as until recently, sodium chloride was assigned a holo-
hedral symmetry, it would have been natural to suppose that the
arrangement of its molecules was that of fig. 3 ; but lately it has
been placed among hemihedral crystals with which potassium chlo
ride has long been associated.    The structure of these salts, and
judging by analogy  of  most   of the alkaline haloids, is thus that
represented by fig. 2.
  It is of interest to observe that in the holohedral arrangement
similar atoms are brought into contact; this is not the case with
hemihedral symmetry.    Perhaps in this is to be found an explana
tion of the fact that diatomic     compounds of monads do not possess
holohedral  symmetry.
   A plagiohedral asymmetry is revealed in the structure both of
common salt and potassium chloride by the action of solvents, which

The factors which    determine  the forms  produced by solution are
unknown, but probably include the disposition of the chemical bonds
of the atoms in the molecule, and the relation of the water molecules
to the disposition of the atoms in the crystal.    It is evident, how
ever, both from models and figure that there is a skew in the distri
bution of the chemical bonds of our molecules, and this may be
connected with the skew faces produced by solution.
   Planes can be drawn through the assemblage of fig. 2 parallel to
the faces of the cubelets without crossing any of the molecules;
these may be regarded as planes of cleavage.
   When a cube of rock salt is truncated at two opposite edges,
parallel to planes of a rhombic dodecahedron, and pressure is
exerted on the crystal in a direction normal to these faces, a per
sistent   compression   resultsin the direction of the diagonal, and
accompanying this a doubly refracting stripe appears.           With in
creased pressure   a clean fracture  is produced,  parallel to one of the
rhombic dodecahedral faces to which pressure is applied.
   All this is in complete consistence with the structure hypothetic-
ally assigned to the crystal.    The effect of pressure, as I imagine  it,

is shown in the diagram (fig. 4), the molecules are forced to slide
over each other ; those lying on the diagonal along which pressure
is exerted make a nearer approach to each other ; those at right
angles are driven further apart.         Up to the critical point, compres
 sion   and accompanying anisotropy are produced ; beyond it the
gliding plane becomes a plane of fracture.
    The question of elasticity must be left to elasticians ; but I would
venture to point out the facts elicited by Voigt and Koch ; Voigt
found for the elasticity modulus of rock salt a coefficient of
4170 kilograms per square millimetre parallel to the tetragonal axes
or edges of the cube, 3400 kilograms parallel to the digonal axes or
normal to the rhombic dodecahedral faces (110), and 3180 kilograms
parallel to the trigonal axes or normal to the octahedral faces (111).
Koch found for potassium chloride, 4009 kilograms                parallel to the
tetragonal axes, and 2088 kilograms along the digonal             axes. Voigt
obtained very similar quantities. Looking at the plane           of assemblage
given in the figure (fig. 2), one would suggest that these        results are of
a kind to be expected ; the force exerted along the tetragonal axis is
chiefly effective in producing compression of the atoms, along the
diagonal axis in distorting the structure.          An exact correspondence
is  obtained    by Lord  Kelvin  between      the theoretical  elasticities of a
hypothetical cube and the results obtained by direct measurement of
 potassium chloride, but the correspondence does not extend to the
results of observation for rock salt, and the structure we have assigned
to our crystals is not that considered by Lord Kelvin in his investiga
tion.*
    The hardness of rock salt in different directions has been investi
gated by Exner, who finds that its value is at a maximum parallel to
the edge, and at a minimum parallel to the diagonals, of the face of
a cube. This result was obtained by determining the weight, with

load of one to produce scratching parallel to the edge of a face of the
cube, a load of 1*3 was necessary parallel to a diagonal.      Looked at
broadly, it will be seen by reference to the figure that the effect of a
force acting parallel to a diagonal should be to that acting parallel
to a side, as 1 : </2, i.e., as 1 : T414.   Considering how complicated
the problem actually     is,   this correspondence       is   quite as close as could
possibly be expected.
   By several distinct lines of argument, resting on the study of
molecular volumes, of the density of solutions, of the symmetry and
physical characters of crystals, we have been led to the same result                ;
given the atomic volumes in the ratios we have assigned to them, no
other was possible   ; and we may now with greater confidence
proceed     to the investigation of other diatomic compounds, which
will   be found to throw a surprising light on the molecular tactics of
crystals.

   The haloid compounds of silver offer more points of interest in the
study of crystal tactics than those of the alkalis, especially as they
include that remarkably anomalous substance — iodide of silver.
    Silver itself crystallises in the cubic system, and possesses the
same kind of structure as all other metals which possess cubic
symmetry, i.e., its atoms are arranged on the plan of most open
packing unlike the alkali metals

density has been differently determined by different observers, for
silver heated in vacuo Dumas found 10 512, and Roberts-Austen

weight, 107  938, divided by  10 541, gives 10-233, the gross atomic
volume.   From this the diameter of the atomic sphere    found to be  is
217152, and its volume 5-3616.
   Both the chloride and bromide crystallise in the cubic system,
and are regarded from analogy as possessing the same crystalline
structure and symmetry as the corresponding salts of potassium and
sodium.

   We are now in a position to compare tbo diameter of atoms of
silver in the free state and in combination.             The diameter of chlorine
being taken as 2-4954,- the value found in Part I, and that of

   The results for (a) and (5) correspond to the different specific
gravities (a) and (6) given above, and obtained by different
observers.
   The differences between the diameters (a) of silver in combination
and that it possesses in the free state are not great.
   On comparing the gross volumes of the haloids given above with
their gross volumes in the haloid compounds of the alkalis, it will
be observed that the gross volume of bromine in silver and sodium
bromides is closely correspondent ; this is because the atomic volumes
of sodium and silver have nearly the same relative value.
   Silver iodide, to which we now turn, is one of the most interesting
snbstances we have yet encountered, and most important results
follow from its study.       At ordinary temperatures it does not present
                                                                            t  2

 itself in the cubic system, but in hemimorphic            hexagonal crystals.
 For this reason we cannot, by the method we have previously em
 ployed, calculate the     diameters   of its component atoms, but a refer
 ence to the preceding      table will show that the gross volume of the
 iodine is not greatly    in excess of that which it possesses in sodium
iodide, so that in all     probability its atomic volume is the same, or
 sufficiently similar to serve as basis for argument.        The diameter of
 the silver atom is then 2-1715, that of the iodine 3"1905.          The ratio
 of the diameter of the silver to that of the iodine falls consequently
 below the limiting rates of 0-7286 : TO.             The exact ratio both for
 this  and  the constituents of the other       silver  compounds is given in
 the following list :  —
                                            Ratio of
                                      diameters  of atoms.

                             Ag  : I  = 0-6894     : 1
From this it is evident that while the chloride and bromide are well
within the 0'728 limit, the iodide lies outside it ; and it follows from
our hypothesis that while the two former salts may be, as they are,
cubic, the iodide should not, but might be hexagonal hemimorphic,
as it is.
    When silver iodide is heated it contracts along the vertical axis (c)
and expands in directions normal to this, till at a temperature of
146° C. it passes per saltum into the cubic system, and then with
further rise of temperature expands uniformly.                 The transition
from the cubic to the hexagonal system on cooling is accomplished
almost with explosive violence, fragments of the solid iodide are
projected into the air, and deep clefts extend into its substance.
How on the basis of our reasoning is this curious transformation to
be explained ?      Only on the supposition that the atomic volumes
expand as the temperature of the substance rises ; the mass, as a
whole, may contract, as it certainly does, but this is to be accounted
for by a change in the relative position of the atoms, the atomic
volumes themselves must be conceived as all the time expanding.
But it may be asked, is there any reason why the iodine and silver
should expand at the same rate, and if not, which is the more likely
to possess a higher coefficient of expansion, the iodine or the silver
atom ? The probabilities are all in favour of the iodine.             The co
efficient of expansion of silver in the free state is 0-000037 from 0°
to the melting point, and 0 00002 from 0° to 100° C.              That iodine
has an immensely greater coefficient may be judged from the change
in its specific gravity with rise of temperature, thus at 40'30
its sp. gr. is 4-917 ; at 60°, it is 4'886; at 79-6°, it is 4-857 ; at 107°,
just before it liquefies, it is 4-825 ; after liquefaction, it is 4-004 ;

and at 151°, a point just above the temperature at which the hex
agonal form of silver iodide is exchanged for the cubic, it is 3'866.
   We may fairly therefore attribute the greater expansion to the
iodine, the silver probably undergoing but slight increase in bulk.
In what way does this help us ? If the disparity between the
volumes of the atoms were originally the cause which determined
 the silver iodide to assume hexagonal instead of cubic symmetry,
how, by increasing this disparity, shall we render it cubic? Nothing
can be simpler.       By the time the substance has reached 146° C. the
atomic volume of the iodine has become so great relatively to the
silver that the latter is lost in the interstices, and it is the iodine
alone which is directly operative in supporting the crystalline
edifice.    Here we have a basis for calculation.         If the iodine thus
forms the framework of the crystal, it must be, as we shall show
later, because it is packed on that open system which we have
already described and illustrated in the first part of this communi
cation.    From this the diameter of the iodine spheres can be calcu
lated.
   The volume of silver iodide, as deduced from Rodwell's data, is
40'67, just above 142°, the point which Rodwell gives as the critical
temperature for the change of system.              Supposing, as we have
already stipulated, that the iodine is built up in most open cubic
packing, we find from this volume the number 3-439 as the length
of the diameter of the iodine atom.
   We shall make important use of this number directly, but we
must first endeavour to find a probable strnoture for the silver iodide
when crystallised in the hexagonal system.
   It will  conduce to clearness to avoid discussion at this stage, and
to describe at once the structure which I am led to think is the only
possible one consistent with the crystalline and physical properties
of the compound.         Let us regard the silver and iodine spheres as
directly united together to form molecules of Agl ; conceive these
placed on a horizontal plane with their major axes vertical, and dis
posed in triangular order as in the diagram (fig. 1). The balls must
not be in contact laterally, but separated by definite regular intervals ;
over this first sheet place a second similarly formed, and so related to
the first that the silver atoms rest in the alternate intervals left between
the lower set of iodine balls taken in threes (fig. 2).       The assemblage
so produced    will be  homogeneous, hexagonal,      and  hemiraorphic.    It
represents silver iodide as it exists at ordinary temperatures.         Now,
bearing in mind the fact that every silver atom rests in the interval
between three iodine atoms, let the latter enlarge to a slight extent,
and simultaneously       retreat from each other along the horizontal
plane    to a small    but uniform amount.         This corresponds to the
expansion along the lateral axes on heating.          But as a result of this

expansion the atoms of silver will descend deeper and deeper
 between the atoms of iodine, and the distance between successive
sheets in a vertical direction will diminish.           This corresponds to
contraction along the vertical axes with rise of temperature.              On
 this hypothesis   the anomalous    contraction   of silver iodide  ceases to
 be an anomaly,    but follows as a natural, though by no means neces
 sary, consequence of its crystalline structure.
    At the critical point, when the hexagonal is exchanged for
cubic symmetry, the atoms of iodine possess, as already shown, a
diameter of 3-439.      Let them be represented in plan in the relative
positions they must occupy for open cubical packing.               They are
shown in fig. 4 by a section taken at right angles to a trigonal
axis.
    Measured along the edge of the cube, the intervals between the
atoms from centre to centre must, on this system of packing, be to
the diameters precisely as \/2 : 1.        Find the diameter of a small
sphere that will just fit in between the three spheres as represented
in the section. It is exactly 2-17687.        But we have already found
that the diameter of an atom of silver, both in the free state and in
combination, measures at ordinary temperatures 2,1715, an extra
ordinary coincidence.        The difference between this number and
that just obtained, 21769— 21715 = 00054; again, the difference
between the diameter of the atoms of iodine in the alkaline iodides
at ordinary temperatures and the atoms of iodine in silver iodide at
142° is 3-439— 3-2 = 0 239, and these two numbers (0 0054 and
0-239) probably approximately        represent the change in dimension
of the constituent atoms of silver iodide as the temperature of this
substance is raised through a range of 130°.          Calculating from the
coefficients given by   Fizeau, the expansion    of 0'0054,  which we have
found for the silver, is just twice that which it would experience in
the free state.
   Up to the critical point, when the interval between the iodine
atoms has become large enough to allow the atoms of silver to pass
between them, the atoms of silver have been supported by the atoms
of iodine and have supported iodine in their turn ; all the atoms
have been subject to molecular pressure, but directly the critical
position is attained, the atoms of silver are driven by this internal
pressure into the middle of cubical clusters of atoms of iodine and
partly or wholly released from pressure, the atoms of iodine alone
then sustaining the crystalline fabric.       It is not wonderful under
these circumstances that the spectrum of silver iodide should differ
markedly when observed below and above the critical point.             Thus
Wernicke has observed that at a high temperature the spectrum (of
silver iodide), like that of solid and liquid iodine, contains no blue
nor violet light. In the normal state, below 138° C, silver iodide

                               Prof. W.     J. Sollas.
 gives  a spectrum less bright, but twice as long and particularly
 developed in the blue and violet spectrum.*
    The passage of silver iodide from one form to the other is, as has
 been stated, sudden and abrupt.           This necessarily follows, from the
 geometrical    conditions of the case.        On reference to fig. 5 it will be
 seen by inspection that while a gradual descent of the atoms of
 silver may take place so long as their centres are situated above the
 centres of the atoms of iodine, against which they glide, yet directly
 after they come to lie in the same plane, a sudden descent must take
 place to a definite extent, which is given by the formula DOi — DOs
  = fi+ft — 2ti cos0, or by the eqnivalent \Z(3r,r,J— 4r,s), where rx is
 the radius of the large spheres, r2 of the small spheres, and OiOj the
 distance through which a sudden descent occurs.
    The instantaneous descent of the silver which thus takes place is
 accompanied by a sudden change of volume in the compound itself ;
 as determined by Rodwell, the volume diminishes from 1 '01575 to
 1"0, as the temperature passes above 142°, the maximum density of
 the salt then being attained.           In the collocation of spheres which
 we have imagined, it is possible to compare the bulk before and
 after the critical point is passed very simply. A tetrahedron is
 constructed by joining the centres of three spheres of iodine below,
which are in contact with one of silver lying on the axis above, with
a fourth of iodine, also on the vertical axis and attached to the
single sphere of silver. The ratio of the volnme of this tetrahedron
is directly proportionate to the whole volume of the structure,
whether in the cubic or hexagonal systems, and at the critical point
the volumes are directly proportionate           to the heights of the respec
tive tetrahedra. From this we find that the volume before contraction
is to that after as 114 : 100, amply sufficient, and, it might be
objected, superfluous ; for the contraction, as observed by Rodwell,
 only amounted to from 1016 to 1000. This is a case, however, in
 which theory proves more correct than observation, for Mallard and
 Chatelier have shownf that Rodwell's results are erroneous, owing,
as they remark, to his having deduced the cubical expansion from
the linear extension, as though silver iodide were an isotropic body.
 These observers were able to bring about the transformation from the
hexagonal to the cubic structure by the application of pressure
 (4,000 kilograms to the square centimetre), and they found that
the ratio of the volumes before and after change, was as 116 to 100,
which gives a coefficient ten times as great as that of Rodwell, and
very closely in agreement with that (114) which we have theoretically

from combination.

  deduced.     Under the influence of rising temperature, the change
  ¦was smaller, from 111 to 100, but this value is said to be merely
  approximate. That the change of volume should be smaller is not
  unintelligible ; the direct effect of pressure is to bring about a
  change of configuration,      which is unstable, since the substance
  reverts to its original state directly the pressure is relieved ; the
  direct effect of heat, on the other hand, is to produce an expansion
  of the atomic volumes, and the change of configuration follows only
 as a consequence of this.       In the difference between the value 111
  and 116 we should have a measure of this increase in atomic
 volume, but for the probability that an expansion of atomic volume
 may take place, as a consequence of the change of configuration
 which results from the action of pressure.       It is of interest to note
 that the amount by which the pressure must be reduced to reverse
 the operation and bring back the substance to the original state is
 only one-half of that required to produce the change directly ; the
 reversal also takes place much more rapidly than the direct trans
 formation.
    It is to the beautiful observations of Fizean that we owe our
 knowledge of the change in dimensions of silver iodide measured in
 relation to its crystalline axes. Along the axis c, Fizeau found a
 negative   coefficient of expansion of — 0-00000397; along two rect
 angular axes in a plane normal to c he found a positive coefficient of
 O00000065.      These were for a mean of 40° over an interval of from
 — 10° to 70°; the coefficient of variation Aa/A0 was found to be for
 c — 4-27, for the other axes l-38. Thus for the mean temperature
 the coefficient of contraction is six times that of the coefficient of
expansion.      A very significant relation, but not more so than the
fact that the contraction increases as the temperature rises, and, as
Kodwell's observations      seem   to prove, the increase becomes very
considerable as the temperature rises above 70°.          Every geometer
¦will   perceive at once that these relations are in absolute har
mony with the conception we have framed of the ordering of the
molecules in the crystal. They directly depend on the changing
ratio of the sine and cosine of the angle 0 as the small sphere (Ag)
of the figure (fig. 6) is squeezed out from the three larger spheres
 (I) against which it is pressed (only one of these spheres (I) is
shown in the figure). As the iodine atoms approach each other,
with fall of temperature, the line aC will revolve round a as a
centre, and thus the vertical parameter will expand as the hori
zontal contracts.     From the coefficients given by Fizean, it follows
that at his mean temperature of 40° the angle 0 is 9° 18' ; from the
crystallographic measurements of Zepharovich, made presumably at
the ordinary temperature of the air, and therefore at or about 15°
this angle appears to have become 22° 17', as calculated for me by

294 Prof. W. J    Sollas.

 Professor Miers. The ratio of sine and cosine for this angle is
0-41   : 1"0, which gives the relation that should subsist by hypothesis
 between     the coefficient  of expansion along the axes a and c at
 15° C.     Fizeau's observations fail ns here, and         I  look forward
with interest to fresh determinations          of these constants, which
Mr. Tutton has kindly promised to make for me. It is now
possible to trace out the series of changes which silver iodide un
dergoes as it falls in temperature from 150° downwards ; at 146°
(Mallard and Chatelier) or 142° (Rod well) it possesses cubic symmetry,
because the atoms of iodine are out of all proportion so much
larger than those of silver, that the latter cease to be operative as
elements in the crystalline structure ; the iodine atoms are arranged
to form cubes which we may picture to ourselves as rhombohedra
 with an angle of 90°; every iodine atom is chemically nnited
 with an atom of silver which depends from it into the central space
 within a rhombohedron ; as the iodine atoms become smaller, with
 loss of energy, this space becomes too small to contain the silver
atom which is consequently forced outwards or upwards ; as it passes
out of the rhombohedron of 90° the vertical parameter of the latter
is necessarily lengthened, while its horizontal parameters are
 shortened ; the change in dimension of the vertical parameter,
which occurs as soon as the centre of the atom of silver begins to
move above the plane containing the centres of three surrounding
iodine atoms, is excessive as compared with that of the horizontal
parameter, but the difference is diminished by the diminishing ratio
between the diameters of the two different kinds of atoms ; at 15° the
 difference of the two coefficients is probably nearly as 3 : 1 ; it will dimi
nish rapidly with further cooling, and, before the atoms of silver assume
a position in which the radius vector drawn from them to the iodine
atoms, about which they revolve, makes an angle of 4-5° with the
parameter Oa, the expansion along the vertical axis will cease and
be replaced by contraction, unless, indeed, as this crisis is approached
the diameters of the atoms should fall within the ratio of 1 : 0-729,
when the crystal would once again become cubic.
    In the study of molecular volumes we hold the key which is
destined to unlock the secret of crystal structure so long concealed.
We shall eventually discover by its means, in connection with other
studies, the relative and absolute dimensions of all the elementary
atoms, and probably not only this but also their true forms — for it
is possible that they are not all spheres.

treatment ; these are calcium, magnesium, and stannous oxides. The
metals calcium and magnesium undergo a considerable amount of
condensation on entering into combination ; it will therefore be more
convenient to select stannous oxide as the compound which is to serve
as the basis for obtaining the relative diameter of oxygen ; but this
course is not without its disadvantages, for very different values have
been found by different experimenters for the specific gravity of
stannous oxide, and the same is true of the metal tin itself, which
further has the additional defect of crystallising, not in the cubic,

   The Absorption of Hydrogen by Palladium. — Strong confirmatory
evidence of the existence of the open packing which we have assigned
to the metals crystallising in the cubic system is afforded by the
phenomenon     of solid solution (so called), and particularly by the
absorption of hydrogen by palladium. When similar spheres are
arranged in open cubic order, they form straight rows in contact,
mnning parallel to the edges of the cube they constitute, and corre
sponding to these files of spheres are open galleries, lying between
and running parallel with them.         Through these galleries atoms, if
small enough, might pass from end to end without encountering any
obstacle, and thus     the transpiration of hydrogen through metallic
plates might be explained.         Further, between every set of eight
atoms, forming a primitive cube of the pile, the gallery widens out
into a chamber, in which an atom smaller than that of the metal
might conceivably      lodge.    The diameter of an atom which could
occupy the space     between    eight atoms, forming a primitive cube, of
palladium, can readily be calculated.       The diameter of an atom of
palladium   has  already   been   determined    to be 2-103, the edge of a
cubelet formed of eight atoms is therefore 4'206, and the length of
the trigonal axis of such a cube is 4-206 x          = 7'285 ; and (7-285 —
4-206)/2  = l-538,   the length     of the  diameter of an atom, which
would just occupy the central space. This estimate, however,
requires modification, by virtue of the fact that palladium progres
sively increases in volume as the absorption of hydrogen takes place.
In Dewar's determinations          the expansion was measured by the
change produced    in  the  specific gravity of the palladium ; the lowest
specific gravity which Dewar observed was 10 8033 ; this gives for
the edge of the primitive cube a value of 4'2818. Assuming that
the atoms of palladium have not increased in volume by absorbing
energy, but have simply become more remote from one another, we
may proceed as follows : 4 2818 x           = 7 416, the length of the tri

                  On the Intimate Structure         of Crystals.              299
gonal axis of the primitive cnbe, and thus (7-416— 4-206)/2 = l-605,
the true diameter of an atom which could just occupy the central
interspace of the primitive cnbelet.            The cnbe of this number will
give u s the gross volume        of the atom of occluded hydrogen; it is
4134.     If now we turn to Biicker's address on "The Range of
Molecular Forces," * we find the most probable estimates given for the
volume of hydrogen (H) are as follows : — From K (Boltzman) 4'4,
 (KIemenci6) 4'4; from n (Mascart) 4'65; from b (Van der Waals
and O. Meyer) 4*4. Between these numbers and that we have just
obtained" there is a very remarkable concordance.
    It may further be observed that the number of such interspaces as
we have considered is, to the number of atoms among which they lie,
in the ratio of 1 : 1, so that from purely geometrical considerations
it might be inferred that the limiting value for the absorption of
hydrogen by palladium would be reached with the formation of the
 substance PdaHa. Observation shows that this limit is never ex
 ceeded, never even attained, while that which is reached may fairly
be represented by the formula PdsHa.                 It is obvious that purely
 geometrical   considerations     are  not  all  that   are involved, and to dis
 cuss other factors would be to trespass beyond our province.                There
 is one point in direct connection with onr inquiry which must not,
 however, be disregarded. The value we have found for the diameter of
 hydrogen was obtained on the assumption that all the central spaces
 were occupied by hydrogen, which would only be the case if PdaHa
  were formed ; the observed ratio, Pd3H2, would lead us to believe that
 only two-thirds of the spaces are so occupied.                This renders neces
 sary  a correction   in   our  estimate,  which    would    slightly increase the
 dimensions of the hydrogen atom.               It is not possible, however, to
 introdnce this correction, on account of the absence of information
 regarding the crystalline form assumed by PdsHa. If crystals of
 palladium be capable of taking a charge of hydrogen, there should
 be no difficulty in ascertaining           whether a change in crystalline
  form accompanies occlusion.           On the assumption that the maximum
  expansion  of  palladium     due  to  occlusion is confined to two-thirds of
  the volume of the metal experimented upon, I find that the diameter
  of the hydrogen atom should be 4"395.              Possibly the assumption is
  not defensible, but in any case it would appear that the amount of
  coincidence we have already obtained between the dimensions of the
  hydrogen atom, as calculated from the crystalling structure we have
  assigned to palladium (along with other metals) and the dimensions
  which follow from other modes of inquiry, affords strong confirma
  tion of our hypothesis.
     The absorption of hydrogen by potassium might easily take place
   without producing any marked expansion, i.e., so far as the relative

  dimensions of the atoms are concerned in the matter, for the inter
  space in the centre of a primitive cube of potassium is large enough
  to house an atom of a gross volume exceeding 17.
    In the       case   of iron the central space is notably smaller than       in
  that of palladium  supposing no expansion to occur on absorption,
                           ;
 the largest atom it could contain would have a diameter of l-392,
 corresponding to a volume of 2"697.
    It is probable, however, that a change in crystalline system is
 associated with the absorption of gases by iron and nickel.    This
 is suggested by the curious effect produced on the nature *of these
 metals by repeated absorption of hydrogen, at least in the case of
 nickel, which loses its cohesion and after repeated treatment becomes
 converted into a friable powder.
     The galleries formed by ranges of central spaces present con
  strictions at intervals corresponding to the places where the fonr
 spheres forming the face of a cubelet are most closely approxi
 mate; the ratio of the diameter of a sphere that could just traverse
 one of these constrictions    is to that of a sphere which would just
 occupy    a central space as -/2 : ^3. Hence the passage of an atom
 into the central chamber involves either a displacement of the atoms
 surrounding the entrance or a contraction in the volume of the
 entering guest. Is it possible that the
                                              " singing " of palladium,
 which accompanies the process of occlusion, is connected with vibra
 tory movements of its atoms as they open and close the entrances to
the central chambers ?
   In conclusion it may be pointed out that all the metals which are
known to occlude hydrogen, viz., potassium, sodium, magnesium,
iron, nickel, platinum, and palladium, are paramagnetic, sodium and
magnesium being the only cases of an uncertain nature, while lead
and gold, which offer roomy central spaces for the occupation of
hydrogen,    but do not absorb      it,   are diamagnetic.

   The electrical changes which are evoked in nerve by a single
stimulus have up to the present been but little investigated.    The
examination of the phenomena has been almost entirely limited to
observations upon the galvanometric deSections caused by the summed
effects of   a   rapid succession of excitations, and rheotome methods,

 carried out along these lines by Bernstein, Hermann and others, have
yielded results of great value. It is, however, only on tho assumption
that the aggregate value of the successive electromotive states gives
at any moment a faithful representation of each component member of
the series, that deductions can be drawn from such rheotome observa
tions as to the characters of the single electrical response. Attempts
have been made to obtain indications of the response to a single
stimulus by other methods, but without very satisfactory results.
As far as we know, the only permanent record of such a response is
that obtained by Gotch and Horsley in 1888 with the assistance of
Burch ; the record was that of the photographed excursion of a
sensitive capillary electrometer.*
    For some time the authors have been engaged in endeavouring
to obtain with the capillary electrometer records of the single
response of nerve which should be large enough not merely to
indicate its occurrence but to afford data for determining its chief
characteristics.
    This object has been so far attained that they are now able to
measure the electromotive changes of nerve in response to a single
stimulus, by the application to the photographic records of the
process of analysis introduced by one of them.f (Q. J. B.)
    The electrometer employed, made especially for the purpose by
Burch, is more sensitive and, at the same time, more rapid in its
action than any they have hitherto used. The latter quality, while
essential to success, entails great liability to disturbance by mechanical
 vibrations, and considerable difficulty was met with on this account.
 The following form of support was ultimately adopted.                        A brick
 pillar was built up to the level of the ground upon a concrete founda
 tion at the bottom of a pit 7 feet deep.                       On the pillar was
placed a     stout   box    containing   some    5  cwt.  of clay and upon the box
three cast-iron plates, each weighing 1 cwt. Each plate was sepa-
lated from the one below by three bags of sawdust, the bags forming
supports, so arranged in opposite triangles as to come alternately
 under the nodes and loops of the plates. The electrometer, with its
 accompanying microscope, was fixed to the topmost plate, and was,
 thus efficiently isolated from the rest of the apparatus and from the
 floor of the working room.
     The excursions of the meniscus were recorded by a pendulum
motor.J the image being projected by a Leitz 3 mm. objective upon
the sensitized plate. This was carried by the motor across the optic
axis in a circular arc at a distance of 125 cm. from the lens, giving

   plates     in  the    experiments     now     described      varied between 14 and
   70 cm. per second; it was- determined in every instance by record
   ing npon the plate the vibrations of a tuning fork having a period of
   500 per second.
        The sciatic nerves of large specimens of R. tempararia were used
   in all the experiments, and the present results were obtained during
 i_the winter months, i.e., from October to March.
*-
        The prepared nerve was placed in a moist chamber kept at from
   4° to 6° C. ; the chamber contained non-polarisable electrodes for the
   electrometer        and polarising connections, and a pair of exciting
   electrodes.       In  every case the nerve was excited by a single stimulus
   applied to the sciatic plexus 20 to 30 mm. from the nearest of the
   electrometer contacts.
        The form of stimulus usually employed was a relatively feeble
   induced current caused by the opening of the primaiy circuit of a
   standardised induction coil, which included one Daniell cell ; the
   opening was effected by the pendulum motor and the primary coil
 rcontained no core. Each single stimulus of this type produces a
   movement of the meniscus when the electrometer contacts are
   suitably arranged upon the nerve. The movement is in some cases
    perceptible to the eye when the highly magnified image is projected
    upon a screen, but in many instances is only visible after the develop
  ment of the photographic record.                  That the movement was not due
    to an escape from the exciting circuit is shown as follows: — The
    direction and character of the movement is unchanged whatever the
    direction of the exciting current ; the escape, if present at all, is
    clearly indicated in the record as a rapid displacement of the meniscus,
    preceding by a distinct interval the larger movement which is here
    referred to    ;  such antecedent escape excursions             remain unmodified in
    character under conditions which materially affect both the larger
    movement and the physiological condition of the nerve (polarisation,
     COj, &c.) ; the escape, if present, is increased by augmenting the
     intensity of the exciting induced current, whilst the larger change
    reaches a maximum with a certain intensity of stimulus ; finally, the
     larger movement is obtained by mechanical excitation such as the
    single tap of a light hammer arranged after the method of v. Uexkull.*
         In order to facilitate the description of the excursions obtained,
    selected photographs have been projected upon a screen and the out
     lines of the variation in the level of the meniscus carefully traced ;
    a number of different curves are thus brought into juxta-position.
     A. reduced copy of this is given in fig. 1.            Some of the actual records

      Freshly Prepared Nerve ; both Electrometer Contacts upon   the
                          Uninjured Surface.
  The nerve in these preparations   was dissected out from the spinal
column to the knee, and the muscles below the knee were left attached
to the preparation.   With the electrometer contacts arranged at
distances of 5 and 15 mm.  respectively from the knee end.no resting
difference of potential was perceptible.     A single electrical or
mechanical excitation of the sciatic plexus 45 mm. from the knee
end of the nerve causes no visible displacement in the level of the
mercurial meniscus, but the photographic record shows a rapid
excursion indicating that the contact nearest the seat of excitation
(proximal) is first negative and then positive to that more remote
(distal). The character of the rapid up and down movement is
indicated           (i) fig. 1. If the contacts are placed further
             in curve
apart (25 to 30 mm.) the spike present in the record is more pro
nounced, the ascending and descending limbs being farther apart.

   The contacts were arranged 10 mm. apart, and the well-kflown
resting difference of potential existed between them. This demarca
tion difference caused a downward movement of the level of
the meniscus amounting in some cases to 10 cm. upon the screen-
It was not compensated by the use of any external E.M.P., bat ifhe

marked difference of potential is found to exist between the cross-
section and any point on the surface.
   A single excitation of the plexus rarely produces a displacement
of the image of the meniscus which is visible to the eye, but in the
photographic record such displacement is indicated by a definite
excursion of the character shown in fig. 1 (iii). The form is a spike,
the limbs of which are more widely separated than those of the
uninjured fresh nerve fig. 1 (i).     It indicates that the proximal
electrometer        contact becomes first negative and then positive to the
    distal one, but as the period at which the change of sign occurs is
    later than in the fresh nerve the rate of transmission of the excitatory
    process, of which the electrical change is an index, must be slower in
    the kept than in the fresh nerve.
       If a new cross-section is made at the knee end and the distal
    contact placed upon    it,the resting demarcation change         at once is
    produced causing    a marked  downward    displacement  of the meniscus.

    a portion of nerve profoundly modifies its electromotive conditions.
    During the passage the regions outside the part traversed by the
    polarising current are the seat of changes such that currents of
    similar direction to the polarising one are present in the extrapolar
    regions.
       It has been shown    by Bernstein, Hermann and others that the
    excitatory effects are modified under these conditions, and a consider
    able part of the present investigation has been devoted to the deter
    mination of the character of the change evoked by a single stimulus
    under these circumstances.
      The experiments were arranged along the lines shown in fig.                            2.
    The excitation was restricted as before to the sciatic plexus, but an
    additional pair of non-polarisable contacts was connected with a
    circuit comprising a rheochord and two Daniell cells.            These
    polarising contacts were placed either between the exciting and the

the figure by the broad dark line.              In arrangement A it lies in the
anodic extrapolar region,            and owing to polarisation effects, is
rendered positive to the distal one during the polarising flow ; in B
it is in the cathodic extrapolar region, and is negative to the distal

C are such that the proximal electrometer contact is positive to the
distal. This is particularly the case with arrangement A owing to
the nearer proximity of the contact to the polarised region.
    The persistent extrapolar state is indicated by a downward move
ment of the meniscus which reaches a certain level and is raised by
suitable alteration of pressure to the middle of the optical field.
Each single stimulus applied to the plexus, although in the un polarised
nerve not followed by any displacement visible to the eye, produces
now a visible change.           The records show that the initial rise is
still present, but that it is succeeded by a prolonged effect of similar
character to that obtained in fresh nerve with the distal contact upon
the cross-section.     The curve given in fig. 1 (vii) shows its form.
     (c)   Nerve  kept   in 0"6 per cent. NaCl.       It has been already
stated that after twenty- four hours, the          excised   nerve gives no
difference of potential when the electrometer contacts are placed
npon cross-section      and surface.
    Polarisation may     be produced of such character that the proximal
electrometer     contact (i.e., that nearest the seat of excitation) is posi
tive to the distal one, by arrangement A or C, as in the case of unin
jured nerve. The effect caused by the single stimulus of the plexns
is modified in the same way as in the previous class of observations.
Instead of the spike which characterises the unpolarised nerve, the
 records show that the initial rise is followed by a prolonged effect of
the form shown in fig. 1 (ix).        As in the case of the uninjured nerve,
this is more pronounced when the arrangement is that given in A
than that of C (fig. 2) for the reason previously referred to.
    If   the kept nerve is subjected     to a fresh  cross-section, then the
results of polarisation of this character resemble those described
under (a) as occurring in the fresh nerve with a cross-section.

             Response    of Nerve investigated with Electrometer.                309
    From the foregoing description it will be evident that when the
proximal electrometer contact is relatively positive to the distal one,
 whether owing to the extrapolar changes due to the passage of a
polarising current, or to the presence, in the case of a recent cross-
 section, of the resting demarcation difference, the electrical response
 evoked by a single stimulus has certain definite characteristics ; the
 most conspicuous of these are the increased magnitude of the initial
 movement forming the ascending limb of the spike and the presence
of a more prolonged change of similar sign to this. On the other
 band when the contact proximal to the seat of the stimulus is rela
 tively negative to the distal one and this latter therefore relatively
positive, other characteristics of the response are accentuated ; the
initial movement forming the ascending limb of the spike is quickly
checked and succeeded by one of opposite character, whilst the
prolonged change disappears.
    It would be beyond the scope              of the present communication         to
enter upon any discussion as to tho physiological meaning of the
changes here referred to. It may, however, be pointed out that thu
results fully support        the conclusions arrived at by Hermann from
rheotome      observations, viz., that those portions of the extrapolar
region nearer       the anode are during polarisation capable of a more
pronounced excitatory electrical change than those more remote,
whilst those portions of the cathodic region nearer the cathode are
susceptible of a less pronounced change than those more remote.*
Xew features are, however, brought to light by the present research
aa indicated in the preceding paragraphs.
                     The Electromotive Force of the Changes.
    The records allow of the calculation of the E.M.F. of the jjotential
difference between the contacts.              The table appended to this com
munication gives five examples of the results of the method of
analysis introduced by one of us f (G. J . B.)                     The five examples
selected are the analyses of excursions such as are figured in curves
(i), (ii), (iii), (vii), and (viii) of fig. 1. In addition to the intrinsic
interest which attaches to the estimation of the E.M.F. of the electrical
response to a single stimulus, the analyses present certain features
which may be briefly alluded to.
    The maximum E.M.F. it will be observed may reach as much as
0'032 volt (Table IV), a suggestive fact in relation to the view held
by us as to the nervous origin of the E.M.F. of the response in the
electrical organ of fishes. + This maximum is attained very rapidly

especially in the fresh nerve ; the first indications of its presence in
fresh nerve at 6° C. occur 0 002 second after the stimulation of the
plexus when the seat of this stimulation is 30 mm. from the proxi
mal electrometer contact.                The response is thus propagated from
the seat of stimulation at a rate of from 10 to 15 metres per second
under these conditions.              This is confirmed by the time relations of
the culmination and commencing decline in the change, for in fresh
nerve this begins in about 0-001 second with a distance of 10 mm.
between the proximal and distal contacts.                     In the example of kept

nerve given in the third column, both the commencement and the
culmination of the initial change are retarded, the propagation rate
in this nerve at a temperature of o° C. being slowed to 6 metres per
second.    A comparison of the fourth and fifth columns shows the
retardation in the anodic as compared with the acceleration in the
cathodic extrapolar region. Finally the time relations and the
relative E.M.F. of the prolonged effect present in the instances given
in the second and fourth columns may be compared with those of
 the initial change present in all the examples.   It will be seen that
the change prodncing the prolonged tail of the photographic record
is one which differs from that producing the initial spike in the
following important particulars : it develops slowly, taking from
0-006 to O'Ol second to culminate, its maximum E.M.F. is only one-
tenth of that of the initial change, and it subsides slowly. It is not
 present in the instances given in columns I, III, and V.
    In a more extended communication the authors hope to bring
 forward other features of the response of nerve, particularly the
 characters exhibited by the records of the changes produced by a
 series of stimuli and of those produced during reflex discharge of the
 central nervous system.

  nerve given in the third colamn, both the commencement and the
 culmination of the initial change are retarded, the propagation rate
 in this nerve at a temperature of G3 C. being slowed to 6 metres per
 second. A comparison of the fourth and fifth colamns shows the
 retardation in the anodic as compared with the acceleration in the
 cathodic extrapolar region. Finally the time relations and the
 relative E.M.F. of the prolonged effect present in the instances given
 in the second and fourth columns may be compared with those of
 the initial change present in all the examples.           It will be seen that
 the change producing the prolonged tail of the photographic record
 is one which differs from that producing the initial spike in the
 following important particulars : it develops slowly, taking from
 0'006 to 0-01 second to culminate, its maximum E.M.F. is only one-
 tenth of that of the initial chango, and it subsides slowly. It is not
 present in the instances given in columns I, III, and V.
     In a more extended communication the authors hope to bring
 forward other features of the response of nerve, particularly the
 characters exhibited by the records of the changes produced by a
 series of stimuli and of those produced during reflex discharge of the
 central nervous system.

    In a previous       communication * we have described the initial
investigations     made by us to determine directly the numerical value
of the magnetic permeability of liquid oxygen, and we there indi
cated that we hoped before long to present to the Royal Society the
results of other experiments made by a different physical method
which we anticipated would enable us to state whether liquid oxygen
has a constant magnetic susceptibility, or whether, like a ferro
magnetic substance, its magnetic susceptibility alters when subjected
to different magnetic forces.
   We have recently obtained results              which, though limited to      a
certain range of force, we think afford          fairly trustworthy values of
the magnetic susceptibility of liquid oiygen under magnetising forces
varying from      500 to 2500 C.G.S. units, and place them therefore on
record.

    The method used by us in these last experiments depeuds on the
well-known fact that if a body, either paramagnetic or diamagnetic,
is placed in a magnetic field of variable strength, it is subjected to a
mechanical force tending to displace it in the direction in which the
field varies most rapidly.
    If the susceptibility of the body is so small that it does not
 sensibly disturb the distribution of the field, the measurement of this
 mechanical force may be made to furnish a knowledge of the abso
 lute value of the magnetic susceptibility.
    The necessary conditions are, however, that the volume (V) of the
 body must be of such small magnitnde relatively to the form of the
 field that its magnetisation is not sensibly different from that which
 it would obtain if immersed in a uniform field, and also that the
 magnetic susceptibility (£) of the substance must be of small absolute
 value.    Under these circumstances, if      /  is the mechanical force
 (reckoned    in dynes) acting   ou  the   body, and H is the strength of
 the field at its centre, then the force in the direction x is given by
 the equation
                              '           dx
    The value k thus determined        is a difference value, that is, it is
equal to the difference     between the susceptibility of the body and
that of the medium in       which it is immersed.       Hence if one and
 the same body is placed    in the same divergent field, but alternately
 surrounded by different    media, the difference in the apparent suscep
tibilities of the body in the two    cases  will give us the difference of
the true susceptibilities of the media.     The experimental method em
ployed by us consisted, therefore, in determining the forces acting on
a small sphere of known susceptibility when suspended first in air.
and next in liquid oxygen, and hence deducing the difference of the
susceptibility of liquid oxygen and air, and therefore the absolute
value of the susceptibility of liquid oxygen, knowing that of air.
    The first step was the construction of an electro-magnet capable of
producing the required field. From the above-named conditions of
success it will be seen that since the volume and susceptibility to be
measured are both small, it is essential that the magnetic field shall
not only be large but must vary very rapidly, or else the forces to be
measured    will be small.
    An electro-magnet giving the required field was therefore designed
as follows : —
    The exciting    bobbin consists of a single coil of double cotton-
covered copper     wire, No. 14 S.W.G. in size.
    The coil is 30 cm. long, 18'5 cm. in outside diameter, and the
aperture in the coil 9'5 cm. in diameter.            The total weight of

              On the Magnetic     Susceptibility of Liquid Oxygen.               313
double cotton-covered copper wire on the bobbin is 71 lbs., and the
total length of wire is roughly about 3300 feet. The total number of
turns of wire on the bobbin is 2478. The wire is capable of carry
ing 12 or 14 amperes for considerable periods of time without
dangerous heating.         The total resistance of the wire is very nearly
5 5 ohms at 20° C.
    This bobbin       of wire is enclosed in a cylinder of mild steel
of    the same height as the bobbin, the walls of which are
2-5 cm. thick.         This cylinder has movable circular end plates of
steel 2'5 cm. in thickness fitting it, and in these plates are circular
holes 9 cm. in diameter.           A    soft  steel   core  was   also   provided,

7'5 cm. below the uppar          surface    of the wire coil.     The steel used
 is high permeability      magnet steel.
                                                                       2 a 2

 314              Profs. J.  A. Fleming and     J. Dewar.
     On passing a current through the magnet coils a magnetic field
 is created in the space just above the upper end of the inner
 steel core, which is very divergent, and which is not only strong,
 but varies very rapidly in an axial direction.
     This magnet was placed underneath a shelf on which stood a very
 sensitive short-beam chemical balance capable of weighing to one-
 tenth of a milligram.      From one pan depended a fine wire passing
 through a hole in the balance case and shelf, and served to suspend
 a ball just within the field of the magnet.
     If the ball was counterpoised by weights and the magnet then
 excited, the ball was subjected to an upward or downward force
 which either decreased or increased its apparent weight, according
 as it was diamagnetic or paramagnetic.        If W is the gain or loss in
 weight on exciting the magnet,       V  the volanie  of the ball, H the
 strength of the field at its centre, and dB./dx the rate of change of
 the field in a vertical direction, then the equation
                             981W = fr.VH
                                             dx
 gives us the value of ihe apparent magnetic susceptibility (fc,) in
 air of the body weighed.
    In order to apply the method we require to know the value of the
 field H at different parts along the vertical axis of the magnet and
 also the value of the field for various exciting currents.
    A careful preliminary investigation on this point was therefore
 made. Constant currents varying from 1 to 12 or 14 amperes were
passed through the magnet coils and by means of a small secondary
coil attached to a calibrated ballistic galvanometer the field strength
at various points in the vertical central axis of the magnet was
measured.      These measurements extended from close contact with
the magnet core to a point about 10 cm. above the end surface of
the recessed polar end of the inner steel core.
    The distance in centimetres of any point from the end polar sur
face of the inner steel core is denoted by x, this measurement
being made as exactly as possible along the central vertical axis of
the magnet.     The strength of the field at this point in C.G.S. units
is denoted by H, and the space rate of change in the x direction by
dH/dx.
    The following tables give the exciting currents (A) in amperes
measured by a Weston ammeter, No. 3134, and the values of x and H.
    The value of dHjdx at any point can be at once determined from
the curve of H in terms of x.

   The induction density or field          along the axial line was also
measured for two constant       excitations corresponding to currents of
12*094 and 6'020 amperes at various distances along the axial line,
and the results are given in Table II.
   The results in Tables I and         II  were then set out carefully in a
curve, and from these curves an interpolation table constructed,
showing the axial field at various points on the axis for different
exciting currents, and these values are given in Table III.
   Having calibrated the magnet, the following objects were provided
to be used as bodies to weigh in the field, viz. : —
   (1) A silver ball, (2) a rather smaller copper ball, (3) several
hollow glass balls containing a little mercury, and (4) a bismuth
ball.
   In order to test the method and obtain confidence in the results, we
made a number of preliminary measurements on the magnetic suscep
tibility of water, solutions of manganese sulphate, and ferrous sulphate
of known densities.
   These experiments were made by weighing the silver ball or hollow
glass ball when immersed in these liquids contained in a beaker
placed in the field cavity of the magnet.
   Five weighings were always made —
   (1) The weight of the ball in air, magnet not excited.
   (2) The apparent weight of the ball in air, magnet excited.

316                Profs.   J. A. Fleming and       J. Dewar.
   (3)  The apparent weight of the ball in water, magnet not excited.
   (4) The apparent weight of the ball in the solution used, magnet
           not excited.
   (5) The apparent weight of the ball in the liquid, the magnet
           being excited with a known current, and the position of the
           ball in the field accurately known.
   From these weighings we obtain all the required information. For
from (1) and (3) we obtain the volume of the ball, and from (1),
(2), and (3) the magnetic susceptibility of the ball, and from (-A) and
(5) the magnetic susceptibility of the liquid.
   The sphere used as a testing substance was suspended by a long
fine platinum or gold wire from one pan of the balance.                   A small
beaker filled with water or the salts solution under test              was placed
over the pole of this magnet and the sphere suspended in it.
   In some cases when using strong exciting currents we found it

necessary^ to pack        round the beaker of liquid with crushed ice in
order to keep the temperature of the water or solution from being
raised by radiation of heat from the magnet coils.                   Any rise of tem
perature in the liquid under test, by causing variation in density,
introduces a difficulty in obtaining exact and comparable weighings
of the ball.
    The position of the ball in the magnetic field was very carefully
adjusted, so that the centre of the ball was as nearly as possible on
the axial line of the magnet.             The distance of the centre of the ball
from the end      of  the   magnet     core   was also measured with as much
accuracy as possible when the balance was lifted off its supports, and
yet the balance index was in the zero position.
    The distance from the pole face measured in centimetres is called
the distance from the pole in the following tables.                 Corresponding to
this distance (x) we know from the preliminary experiments and the
results given in Tables I, II, and            III the strength of the magnetic
field (H) and its axial rate of variation dHjdx.

   The copper ball proved to be ferromagnetic, owing, no doubt, to
traces of iron.        We constructed a curve by which its susceptibility
in various fields could be deduced from the above observations, but
the only reason we employed it was because it seemed desirable to
determine the absolute susceptibility of the liquid oxygen with bodies
as far as possible different in susceptibility. Hence we selected
silver, bismuth, and the above slightly ferromagnetic copper ball for
the purpose.

of the above results.
   Many other experiments were then made with various solutions
of salts of iron and manganese, which satisfied us that we could
place reliance upon the results of this method in measuring the
magnetic susceptibility of a liquid, and we then proceeded to
experiments with liquid oxygen.

    The balls were accordingly all weighed in liquid oxygen contained
in a vacuum vessel placed over the pole piece of the magnet. This
vacuum vessel contained mercury in its vacuum space and was of an
unusually excellent kind. In it liquid oxygen could be preserved
for periods of many hours without a trace of ebullition, and no
difficulty was experienced in making the weighings with great
accuracy.       These weighings of course served also to determine the
density of the liquid oxygon used. The results are embodied in the
following tables.
    In each case the weighings give the apparent susceptibility of the
 liquid oxygen, and these figures have to be corrected by adding or
subtracting a number representing the absolute susceptibility of the
 ball at the liquid oxygen temperature.                Thus in the case of the
 silver ball the figure subtracted is two, as the nearest integer repre
  senting the susceptibility of silver at —182° C. In the case of the
 bismuth ball the figure subtracted is sixteen, in the case of the glass
 balls it is zero or at most unity, and in the case of the copper ball
 the correction is additive, depending on the value of the field.

   Mean value of susceptibility of liquid oxygen as determined with
glass ball No. 4 = 320 x 10"6.
   The absolute susceptibility is derived from the apparent suscepti
bility by adding or subtracting the susceptibility of the ball used
according as it is paramagnetic or diamagnetic.
   In  the case of the copper ball, owing probably to traces of iron, the
paramagnetic susceptibility is rather large and varies with the field.
The proper additive correction was obtained by drawing a curve
and setting off the observed values of the copper ball susceptibility
as ordinates corresponding to the proper field strengths.
   The mean value from all the six sets of observations comprising
thirty-six determinations with the silver, copper, bismuth, and four
glass balls is to give a value of 324 x      10~" as the mean co-efficient of
magnetic      susceptibility    of liquid oxygen.          Prom the relation
fi — 1 + iirk, the magnetic permeability can be deduced, and if
k = 324 x 10"° we have /i = 1-0041, as the value of the permeability
of liquid oxygen.
   The value of /« we gave (see ' Proc. Hoy. Soc.,' vol. 60, p. 292)
as the result of our former experiments by a totally different method
was /i = 1-00287, or nearly, 1-003.
   Hence these two methods agree in giving values of the magnetic
permeability of liquid oxygen differing only by about one part in a
thousand.
   The results of the present work must, however, be taken as giving
a much more probable value of the magnetic susceptibility.
    On examining the above results it will be seen that there is a

   320                   Profs.    J. A. Fleming and        J. Dewar.
   general tendency for the susceptibility with large fields of the order
   of 2500 to be less than the susceptibility for fields of the order
   of 500.       The average susceptibility in fields of from 2500 to 1900
    is more nearly 310 x 10~f, and that in fields from 1100 to 500 more
   nearly 330 X lO"0.
       The difference only amounts to about 10 per cent, of the lower
   value, and      it cannot     be said  that the observations are all of exactly
   equal weight.
       The general result is to show that between the limits of H = 500
   and H = 2500 the average magnetic susceptibility of liquid oxygen
   has a value which does not differ much from 324 X 10-6, but with a
   small but decided tendency to decrease in strong fields.
       The determination            of the variation of susceptibility in much
   weaker fields is left undecided by these experiments, but by the
  employment of a torsion balance we hope to be able before long to
  give the ratios of the susceptibility in various fields much weaker
  than those employed in the foregoing experiments.
         In connection with the determination of the absolute magnetic
  susceptibility of liquid oxygen, our attention has been much directed
  to the important matter of the determination of magnetic suscepti
  bilities of substances in general at very low temperatures.
      Having regard to the great loss in magnetic susceptibility
  experienced by the ferromagnetic metals in heating beyond a certain
  temperature, it has been frequently suggested that bodies of small
 susceptibility might become strongly magnetic if cooled to a
 sufficiently low temperature.              Faraday made many experiments on
 this qnestion, using solid carbonic acid as a refrigerating agent, but
 was not able to arrive at any conclusions.
      A difficulty which presents itself in the use of liquid oxygen as
 a refrigerating agent for this purpose is the strongly magnetic
 quality of the liquid itself.              All bodies except iron, nickel, and
 cobalt, and the strongly ferromagnetic bodies, become apparently
 diamagnetic when placed in liquid oxygen and in a non-uniform
 magnetic field.*
     Moreover, for obvious reasons it is easy to weigh a diamagnetic or
 apparently diamagnetic body in a non-uniform field because the forces
 restoring the disturbed body to its original position increase with
     * An interesting experiment waa made with a ball of ebonite which illustrates
t,lii9 fact.    Ebonite is slightly magnetic in air, owing no doubt (o iron impurity.
 Ebonite is denser than liquid oxygen.            Accordingly, a small ball of ebonite
dropped into the liquid oxygen contained in the vacuum vessel of the pole of the
mngnct sunk to the bottom of the vessel.           On exciting the magnet the ebonite
became apparently strongly diamagnetic         and  was repelled by the pole. It floated
up    in  the liquid  until it reached a level at which  the diamagnetic repu'sion just
balanced the apparent weight of the ball in the liquid oxygen.               Instructive
lecture experiments can be made in this manner.

            On the Magnetic Susceptibility   of Liquid Oxygen.       327
the displacement.     If, however, an attempt is made to determine the
force acting upon a paramagnetic body in a non -uniform field by a
balance, the body weighed is in unstable equilibrium.
   We have only recently overcome these difficulties.        The method
we have adopted for cooling the body nnder test, is to suspend it
freely near the bottom of a test-tube, which is placed in a vacuum
vessel, the interspace between the two being filled with liquid air.
In   this way the body is cooled by radiation to the temperature of
liquid air, and yet it is suspended in, and surrounded by, gaseous air,
the magnetic susceptibility of which is exceedingly small compared
with that of liquid oxygen or liquid air.
   By limiting the vibration of the balance within small limits by
the stops, or by gradually varying the field of the magnet with a
carbon rheostat, until the field is just able to move the object from a
standard position against the fixed restraining force supplied by a
constant counter-balancing     weight, we have been able to effect the
 measurements of the apparent weight of the tested object at a given
distance    from the pole, and in a known field, even though the
equilibrium is not stable. In this way we have made preliminary
experiments on the variation in the diamagnetic susceptibility of
bismuth, and of the paramagnetic susceptibility of manganous sulphate
in the solid condition.
    We made a preliminary experiment by weighing in and out of
the magnetic field a small closed glass bulb, exhausted of its air
both when in ordinary air at the normal pressure and temperature,
and then suspended on the dense gaseous air in the inner test-tube,
which is at a temperature of —182° C. lying at the bottom of tho
inner test-tube, placed as above described in a vacuum vessel. Wo
found the magnetic susceptibility of the dense air at — 182° C. to
be +0 28 X 10-6, in other words about 10 times the susceptibility
of air at the normal temperature and piessure.        This number 0'28
is quite insignificant compared with numbers of the order of 100 or
 300.    Hence an object suspended in the above described manner, can
 be reduced to the temperature of liquid air without changing the
susceptibility of the surrounding medium by an amount which is at
 all comparable either with that of liquid oxygen, or with the value
 of the susceptibility of bismuth, or of most paramagnetic bodies
such as the salts of iron, nickel, cobalt, manganese, or of palladium,
 or any of the strongly paramagnetic bodies.
    In this manner we have made a determination of the change in
 paramagnetic susceptibility of crystallised manganous sulphate in
 the form of powder.
    We find that the susceptibility of the salt at 25° C. is to that
 at -182° C. in the ratio of 105 to 349 or 1 to 3 32.
    These centigrade    temperatures, 25° C. and —182° C  , correspond to

328        On the Magnetic Susceptibility      of Liquid  Oxygen.
298 and 91 on the absolute thermometric scale, and it is obvious
therefore that the paramagnetic susceptibility of solid manganous
sulphate is increased by cooling so that its value varies inversely as
the absolute temperature, and is increased threefold by cooling to the
temperature    of liquid   oxygen.
    It  has been shown      by P. Curie, that the above law holds good for
oxygen, palladium       and   other paramagnetic bodies at high tempera
tures ; and E. Wiedemann (Pogg. Ann., vol. 126, p. 1, 1885) and
Plessner (Wied. Ann., vol. 39, p. 330, 1890) have shown that for
limited ranges of temperature, 16° to 60°, it is true for paramagnetic
salts in the liquid and solid condition.
     Our experiments show that this law may be valid over very wide
limits, and to very low temperatures.        We hope to fully examine this
matter shortly, and to make a full examination of paramagnetic
 susceptibility at very low temperatures.
     We have also made measurements of the magnetic susceptibility
 of bismuth at the liquid oxygen temperature.
     From the mean of three experiments, we find that the diamag-
 netic susceptibility of bismuth is increased by cooling, and that it
 has the following values : —
          Diamagnetic susceptibility of bismuth at      15° C. = 137,
                                                     -182° 0.  =  15-9,
 thus showing an increase of 16 per cent, on the lower value.
     The diamagnetic susceptibility of bismuth is therefore not increased
 inversely as the absolute temperatnre on cooling.
     The above considerations suggest that the very large paramagnetic
 susceptibility of liquid oxygen, which is five or six times greater
  than that of a saturated solution of ferric chloride, may in part be
 due to its low temperature.
     Some experiments we have made on the susceptibility of man
  ganous Bulphate indicate that paramagnetic           susceptibility varies
  directly as the density.
     The density of liquid oxygen is 806 times that of gaseous oxygen
  at 0° C. and 760 mm., "and its absolute temperature is just one-
 third.
     Hence if the law that susceptibility varies as the density and
  inversely as the absolute temperature holds good down to the tem
  perature of —182° C.,' and over the physical change of state, we
  should expect the susceptibility of the liquid oxygen to be 2418
   (= 806 x 3) times that of the gas.
     The magnetic susceptibility of gaseous oxygen as determined by
  Faraday, E. Becquerel, and others is 013 X 10~c.         Now 2418 x 013
   X 10-* =   314 x  10"°.

                     Aluminium as an Electrode in Cells.                329
   The   mean     value we have found for the susceptibility of liquid
 oxygen   is 324 x 10~', and many of our values for it are exactly
 314x10-*.
   It seems therefore possible that for paramagnetic bodies over wide
limits of density and temperature we may find that the magnetic
 susceptibility varies directly as the density and inversely as the
 absolute temperature.
   We desire to add that our thanks are due to Mr. J. E. Petavel
 and Mr. J. T. Morris, for their assistance in carefully carrying out
the tedious work of the ballistic observations, necessary to determine
the field of the electro-magnet we have used.

                                      Direct Currents.
      Two sizes of cells have been used in these experiments, each
  having aluminium and carbon electrodes. The large size consists
  of one aluminium plate, r\ inch thick, and one carbon plate, 5 inch
   thick, separated by ebonite bolts and nuts, the distance between the
   plates being \ inch.        The surfaces thus opposed to one another in an
   electrolyte of saturated potash alum in water have each an area of
   36 square inches.         The aluminium plate was not bought as being
   specially pure, and may have 2 per cent, impurities.              After making
   preliminary experiments          with   alternate  and  direct  currents   over a
   lapse of four days, the following experiment was made with this cell
   and was repeated.
       An exploring electrode was inserted           midway between the plates,
   and consisted of a platinum wire sealed into a glass tube.              The wire
   beyond    the  tube    had a   length  of  abont  2 inches, and   was coiled  into
   a small spiral, the plane of the spiral being parallel with the surfaces
   of the plates. A Kelvin quadrant electrometer was arranged with a
   two-way switch,         so that    the potential   between this electrode and

                 in Cells  for Direct and Alternate        Currents.               331
either the carbon or aluminium plate could be observed. The cell
was placed in series circuit with another, similar in all respects,
except that the distance between the plates was £ inch instead of
i  inch, an adjustable resistance, and an ammeter.                 By means of a
reversing switch this circuit could be reversed across the poles of
twenty- two storage cells having a potential difference of 44 volts.
The temperature of the cell was about 12° C. The negative pole of
the storage cells was connected to the aluminium plate and the
current adjusted to 3'6 amperes, the potential difference between the
aluminium and carbon plates being 4"4 volts, and gas evolved freely.
On reversing the connections, that is, placing the positive pole of the
charging battery to the aluminium plate, the current, so far as this
ammeter could show, was zero, the potential between carbon and
aluminium being about 22 volts. The surface of the fluid was
maintained in a state of agitation, but no gas was evolved, except
in very small quantity, if any.

exploring electrode and the carbon and aluminium plates respec
tively, as also the current, varied in terms of time after reversal
took place. The time between the two reversals in Table I was
27 minutes.       There is no doubt but that the current, when reversal
took place from 3'6 amperes, first crossed the zero and acquired an
opposite sign, finally coming to zero of the instrument.
    This is an important point, and was fully established daring

332          Mr. E. Wilson.       Aluminium as an Electrode
another set of experiments     undertaken    to find the resistance of the
electrolyte.   For this purpose the plates were separated to the extent
of 1T\- inch, and two platinum exploring electrodes used, the dis
tance between them in the electrolyte being -{-£ inch, along a straight
line perpendicular to the parallel surfaces of the plates.       Each time
reversal   took   place from negative to aluminium, to positive to
aluminium, the potential between these electrodes changed sign, and
gradually returned to near zero. The results of the experiments on
resistance show that at this temperature the resistance of a layer of
electrolyte of area equal to the area of the plate submerged, and of
length equal to the distance between the electrode and the plale,
that is  | inch in the experiment of Table I, is 0"063 ohm. The cor
rection is therefore small with current 3"6 amperes, and is negligible
when the positive pole is connected to the aluminium.
   The next set of experiments were carried out with aluminium
                             cent, purity, the electrolytes being specially
Tlf inch thick, of 99'5 per
pure, and only distilled water used. The cells used are of a smaller
size, and each consists of one aluminium plate, 1| inches wide,
having a carbon plate on each side of it, the distance between the
aluminium and carbon being -/s inch, the carbon plates being 2\ inches
wide and \ inch thick.          The aluminium plate was submerged
2f inches in the electrolyte, so that the total area for current is
8^  square inches.
   Two such cells were prepared, one with a 10 per cent, by volume
solution of HjSOi in water, the other with a saturated solution of
potash alum, and left for forty-seven honrs with a current of 5l5 ampere
passing through each in series, the positive of charging cells being
connected to aluminium.        At the end of this time, and with this
current, the potentials across the cells were 2*4 volts for the HjSOj
solution, and 9 volts for the alum solution.             On breaking the
circuit, the potential of the H2S04 solution cell fell to about 0'38 volt
in one minute, and rose fairly gradually to 2"4 volts on making circuit.
The alum solution cell lost its potential immediately on breaking
circuit, that is, the electrometer needle appeared to return to zero,
as though there were no opposing electromotive force.            When the
current was reversed, that is negative to aluminium, and still of the
value ~ f ampere, the HjSOi solution cell gave 0'24, and the alum
solution 1*29 volts.
   The aluminium plate which was formed in the HjS04 solution,
together with its carbon plates, were next washed in distilled water,
and placed in a satnrated solution of alum.           Eleven storage cells
were connected without extra resistance in circuit to each of these
cells positive to aluminium, and the resulting current noted. The
plate which had been formed in H2S04 allowed about 0-2 ampere
to pass, and in 4 hours 10 minutes this current had risen to about

                 in Cells   for Direct and Alternate Currents.                       333
1   ampere, the temperature of the cell having risen.                        The plate
formed in alnm solution only allowed O083 ampere to pass.                            The
two cells were then placed in series and left for 13 hours, with
j3j ampere passing from the aluminium to carbon plates in each.
    The following test was then made. The cells had opposed to
them, aluminium to positive, in turn from 1 to 20 storage cells,
without extra resistance, rising a cell at each step, the resulting
current and potential across the terminals being noted. The results
are given in Table II. We see that from 1 to 18 storage cells the

currents gradually increase in each, the plate formed in HjSO,
having an apparent greater resistance, up to about 16 cells. With
20 cells applied the H,S04-formed plate gave way with great
rapidity, and in a very short time, about fifteen seconds, the current
was 4 amperes, the temperature of the cell rising also from 21° C.
to 23° C. The alum-formed plate seemed more stable with 20 cells,
but speedily allowed a current of over 1 ampere to pass. On going
back to 16 cells the currents were 0-9 ampere in the HsSOt-formed
plate, and 0-29 ampere in the alum-formed plate.

   This brings us to the effect of temperature upon potential for it
given current.  The cell containing the aluminium plate formed in
alum solution above referred   to was placed in an oil bath, the tem
perature of which could bo varied.      The current was that due to
56 storage cells, through a considerable external resistance, about
G50 ohms during heating, and 2280 during cooling.       There was an
excess of alum in the cell, and the solution was kept saturated.  The
variation of potential between the aluminium and carbon electrodes
was noted, as also the temperature of the cell.   The results are

   We see that as the temperature of this cell rises from 13'5 to 70° C,
the potential difference falls from 30 to         volts.   The experiments

0-043 volt at 13-5° C, and 0'025 volt at 57° C. with the currents 0-124
and 0-141    ampere as given in Table IH.       The conclusion    that                   is
temperature has an effect upon the apparent high resistance of an
aluminium plate and its film, the subject of this paper.    This points
to the fact, that in practice for high apparent resistance,   would be              it
necessary to cool or circulate the electrolyte with such dissipation of
energy, that the cell would otherwise acquire       high temperature.a

                in Cells for Direct and Alternate Currents.              335
 In Table    III we see that as the cell cools with a smaller current of
 about 0"051 ampere, the potential between the aluminium and carbon
 plates rises.     In this case at 56, and 12° C, the electrolyte would
 account for 0'0093 and 0'017 volt respectively.
    It was thought that if a plate of aluminium with its film were
 submerged in mercury, the resistance between the metal and mercury
 might give an idea as to whether resistance, pure and simple, played
 an important part in the effects observed.            The plate originally
 formed in HjS04 solution was carefully removed, washed in distilled
 water and dried, and half submerged in clean mercury.               Storage
 cells ranging in number from 1 to 15 were applied as in Table II,
but in each case the poles were also reversed so as to test the insula
 tion with the two directions of currents.     The results show that this
 film on aluminium is a fairly high insulator, but it was not stable.
At    times the resistance was zero, when a sharp noise occurred in the
 cell   like sparking between points in air, and the insulation was
immediately restored.       With 16 volts applied, the apparent resistance
was about      10,000 ohms, whereas from Table     II  we see the appareno
resistance of the whole cell is 230 ohms at 14 volts, the positive pole
being connected to alnminium.           I should say, judging from the
number of times the film broke down, that it was more stable when
the positive pole of the charging battery was connected to the
aluminium ; but in either direction the resistance, when established,
had the same order of magnitude.        Up to six cells, no extra resistance
was included in the circuit as the film was stable, after this a resist
 ance was inserted so as to keep down the current when the film hroke
down, as then the potential between Al and Hg was zero.             Even at
30 volts the film was able to restore its insulating properties, but very
rarely. On removing the plate, a film was left on the mercury where
it had been in contact with the film on the aluminium plate.
    Another set of experiments was made with two cells having
as electrolytes a 5 per cent, solution of HjSOj in water, and a saturated
solution of potash alum in water. The area of the pure alnminium
plate exposed to the fluid was 17 square inches in each cell.              A
current of 1 ampere was passed for four hours through the HaSOi
solution cell, and three hours through the other. At the end of these
times the temperatures were respectively 33 and 51° C. With the
1 ampere passing from Al to C, the potentials between the plates were
respectively 6-3 and 20 volts. The cell containing the plate formed
in potash alum solution was then heated, the current through it being
kept fairly constant by means of a considerable external resistance
and 110 volts.      It was then cooled by placing it in a freezing mixture
of ether and carbonic acid snow. The temperature in this case was
reduced somewhat rapidly, and a portion of the electrolyte at the
bottom was frozen, probably a cryohydrate, leaving liquid above.

 the chemistry of the effect discussed.                 It is known that a clean

" Dear Wilson,
    "  I waited to send        yon   the results of        my     examination of the
 aluminium plates        until   I  had looked        at them       carefully with the

microscope.      Not much information, however, is to be gained from
this.   The skin over the plates is, however, seen to be full of minute
cracks in everj direction, giving the impression of a dried gelatinous
pellicle ; not an unexpected appearance if the plate had been covered
when    wet    with a thin coating of the gelatinous         aluminium
hydroxide.      The analysis of the film over the metal shows it to
consist   of  basic aluminium" sulphate.    The origin of this may of
course have been the formation in the first place of aluminium
hydroxide which subsequently reacted with some of the alum solu
tion to give the basic compound.        How far the formation of this
may have anything to do with electrolysis would, I should think,
be difficult to say without further and more elaborate experiment,
and it must be remembered that a similar coating can be obtained
on an aluminium plate by immersing it in an alum solution and
leaving this freely exposed to the air.

   I  have tried an experiment which   I think shows that a film formed
on aluminium by first being placed in contact with an alum solu
tion and then exposed to the air, gives the same effect as a film
formed in the cell when a current is passed from the aluminium to
a  carbon plate through the electrolyte.      Two similar bright alu
minium plates were prepared with carbon plates on either side of
them, the area of aluminium in the electrolyte being 8^ square
inches.    The electrolyte consisted of a saturated solution of potash
alum in water. One plate was left in the solution for seven hours
with no current passing, and then exposed to the air for 16f hours.
The other plate was submerged in the fluid and immediately read
ings were taken of the current passing and potential difference in
volts between the aluminium and carbon plates. The effect in this
case was exactly what was previously observed.       That is to say, the
current being maintained constant at 0-055 ampere by about 2000 ohms
being inserted in circuit with the cell across about 110 volts,
the potential difference immediately passed from a small negative
value through zero, and after three minutes and forty minutes, had
respectively the values T8 and 2'27 volts ; the temperatures being
12i and 15^° C. The test was continued.         For the next h\ hours
the current was 0'204 ampere, it was then dropped to 0'055 ampere
and kept at this value for 1(5^ hours.    At the end of this time the
potential was 10 volts with 0-055 ampere, and 28'6 volts with 0'163
ampere, the temperature being 15° C.
   The other plate was submerged in its solution, the potential differ
ence and current being immediately noted as before.      The results in
this case show that the potential, with 0'054 ampere, rose immediately

temperatures being 13 and 15'5° C.          This, I think, shows that a film
formed by exposure      to the  air  after being submerged in a saturated
alum solution, has the same effect as another formed in this electrolyte
during the passage of current.            This Hest was continued.    After
twenty -four hours, during which the current was 0 0523 ampere, the
potential was 11 volts, with this current passing, and the temperature
16° C.
    The two cells were then placed in series and an average current of
0 048 ampere passed through them from the aluminium to carbon
 plates for fifty hours.   At tho end of this time, with current 0 04i>
 ampere, the potsntials were 10 in tho case of the plate partially
formed without current, and 10-3 in the case of the other; the
temperatures being 19 and 17i° C. respectively.          With current 0'121
ampere, the potentials were 26-2        and  27 4  respectively at tempera
tures 21 and 19£° C]
    Sodium hydrate forming a weak solution in water was tried as an
electrolyte, the area of the Al plate being the same as before, 17 square
 inches. The forming current of 0'8 ampere was passed from Al to C
 for  2 hours 20 minutes,   when the potential between the plates was
 13'6 volts,   the aluminium plate being covered with a thick black
deposit.

                              Alternate Currents.
    Tho experiments with alternate currents were undertaken in order
 to investigate the instantaneous values of potential and current.
 One object was to see if the effect we have dealt with in the first
part of this paper has time to properly develop with ordinary
frequencies, and if so under what conditions.         Another object was to
 see if aluminium is a valuable metal for use in condensers for alter
nate currents.
                          Aluminium- Carhon Cells.
    If the time taken to develop the effects dealt with in the first part
of this paper were very small compared to the time of a complete
period of an alternating potential applied to the cell, one would
expect to get a practically uni-directional current in the circuit of
 the cell under favourable conditions as to temperature and applied
 potential.    This is not the case with the cells and frequencies dealt
with in this paper.         In all these experiments the author has
 endeavoured to make the cells the controlling part of the circuit,

                    in Cells     for Direct and Alternate Currents.                                                                    339

a small non-inductive resistance and a Siemens dynamometer were
the only part of the circuit other than the cells experimented upon.
The copper resistance of the circuit including armature was from 1
to    5    ohms.

Four smaller cells were used in some of the experiments as will be
6et forth.   Each of these consists of thin aluminium plate opposed
                                                                 a

excess of salt to insure saturation. Table IV contains the important
information obtained from the tests.

 phase difference but the effect we are looking for, namely, a large
ratio between the maximum coulombs in the two halves of a period,
mainly develops with large currents for a given frequency accom
panied by high temperature and small phase difference.      The average
watts have been deduced from the product of instantaneous volts
and amperes at twenty equal intervals during a period.
   The experiments in figs. 1, 2, 3 give results obtained with an
exploring electrode inserted between the plates in the electrolyte as
in the first portion of this paper.   The aluminium and carbon plates
                                                J
in one of the large cells were separated to inch, and the two cells
kept in series as in experiments (4) and (5) Table IV.      The curves
refer to this cell, and provision was made for obtaining the instan
taneous values of the current in the cell, and the potentials between
the exploring electrode and either the aluminium or the carbon
plate.
   In figs. 1, 2, the Siemens dynamometer in the circuit registered
the same current, namely 3'97 amperes, but the frequencies are 16
and 98'5 respectively.    "We see that -Jy second is too short to allow
the effect we are looking for to fully develop, since the ratio of the
maximum coulombs is 1'47. On the other hand, if we examine the
two   sets of curves we see that at 98 periods per second the potential
difference between     the exploring electrode and aluminium has a
maximum value of 3'63 volts during the half period when the
coulombs have the smaller maximum, whereas at 16 periods per
second, the same maximum          current is produced with a larger

            in Cells for Direct and Alternate Currents.        341
maximum potential, namely, 6"27 volts.     That the aluminium plate
was an anode during the half period when the maximum coulombs
were a minimum, was proved by noting the direction of the electro
meter deflection, when the positive pole of a Clark's cell was con
nected to the insulated quadrant, and examining the observed
direction of the deflection   during the experiment.    Experiments
made upon the resistance of the electrolyte with two exploring
electrodes, employing alternate currents, show that at the tempera

 342           Mr. E. Wilson.    A luminiurn as an Electrode
 ture at which these experiments were made, namely, 13-J-0 for the 16
 frequency, and 11 \° C. for the 98 5 frequency, the resistance of a,
 layer of the electrolyte of area equal to the area of the plate
 submerged, and length equal to the distance between the electrode
 and the plate, has a value of about 0"063 ohm.             The curves of
 potential in fig. 2 have been corrected for this, and the dotted lines
show the results.        The average watts dissipated by electrolytic
 hysteresis at the carbon and aluminium plates at 98'5 periods per
second, fig. 2, are 0"69 and 4"5 respectively.    This takes no account of
the resistance of the electrolyte, and has been obtained by taking
instantaneous      products of potential and current at twenty equal
intervals during the period.       During the first half-period work is
supplied at the carbon plate on the average at the rate of 4-l watts ;
during the second half-period the plato does work on the system
at the average rate of 2' 7 watts.        The aluminium plato returns
practically nothing to the system.
    In fig. 3, the frequency is 101, the ratio of the maximum coulombs
in the two halves of the period is 1"7, and the Siemens dynamometer
 in the circuit registered 20-6 amperes.        The average temperature
during     this  experiment  was  about   55°  C,  but had a maximum of
64° C. at the end of the test. Under these conditions, evaporation of
the electrolyte was rapid. The experiments on the resistance of the
electrolyte at this frequency and temperature give 0"033 ohm, and
the potential curves have been corrected, the result being shown by
the dotted lines.      The average rate of dissipation of energy due to
electrolytic hysteresis at the aluminium plate during the period is
153 watts, whereas at the carbon plate this rate is only 9'8 watts.
We see that the maximum volts during the half period when the
maximum coulombs are a minimum have risen to 13, whereas during
the other half period the maximum volts are only 7£.
    The paper by Graetz already alluded to, deals with alternate
currents; and two groupings of cells with aluminium plates as the
one electrode are given, whereby he proposes to rectify alternate
enrrents.      He gives 22 volts as the potential an aluminium cell is
capable     of  opposing, and states that the current could not be
measured with a delicate galvanometer.         The first grouping of these
cells consists of placing between the poles of the alternator two
circnits in parallel, in each of which he places fonr cells in series.
The poles are reversed so that in the one circuit the predominating
current will be positive, whereas in the other it will be negative.
The other grouping of these cells is shown in fig. 4, and the author
states that he gets a unidirectional current in the circuit xy.         In
this circuit he has operated a direct current motor, and deposited
copper.     By superposing one of tho current curves in figs. 1, 2, or 3
on the same curve, but with reversed phases, one can form an idea

              in Cells  for Direct and Alternate Currents.                     343
as to what the   resulting current would         be in the circuit xy.     Curves
in fig. 5 were obtained    by observing the instantaneous value of the
potential difference between the ends of a non-inductive resistance of
0"349 ohm, forming the circuit xy, fig. 4.              Four small cells were

344             Mr. E. Wilson.                    Aluminium                 as an           Electrode
of sufficient size 95 to 96                       per cent, of the energy of the alternate
current can be changed                           into direct current. The efficiency of
such a system as shown in                         fig. 4 will obviously be the ratio of the
rate at which work is done                       on xy to the rate at which work is done
on the whole system by the alternate    current machine.    If this is to
be 95 per cent., then only 5 per cent, must be dissipated in the cells.
   An important point in connection with the working of these cells
is the wearing away of the aluminium.       The thin metal used in the
small cells above alluded (o is perforated with small holes, but I
have not noticed so much deterioration      in the thicker sheet. The
evaporation of the electrolyte is another matter which needs con
sideration if the temperature is raised fairly high in working.
                      Two Aluminium Plates in Alum Solution.
   These experiments were undertaken to find what effect as a con
denser this metal with its film has with varying frequency tempera
ture and current.  The aluminium plates in the two large cells above
experimented upon were opposed to one another in a saturated alum
solution.  The distance between them was £ inch, and the opposed
areas in the solution are 36 square inches on each plate.

parison two plates of ordinary sheet iron of the same area and the
same distance apart as in the aluminium cell were placed in   saturated                                              a
solution  of alum  and  placed  in series with the aluminium  cell. As
before the circuit included a Siemens dynamometer and non-induc
tive resistance, and potentials were observed for different positions of
the phase across the non-inductive resistance, and each cell, by aid
of a Kelvin quadrant electrometer and revolving contact maker.
On account of the irregular wave form of the curves of potential and

                 in Cells  for Direct and Alternate Currents.           345
current', the ratio per period of the energy returned to the system by
the cell to the energy supplied to the cell, is given as a percentage.
If the electrolytic process were perfectly reversible, we should expect
the curves of current and potential to have a phase difference of one
quarter period, if they were sine curves.             An examination of
Table  V     shows that maximum phase difference develops with the
smaller     currents at lower temperature.        In experiment (c) the
maximum amperes are 2"5, the maximum volts 53.               The curve of
potential difference has a maximum rate of change of about
57-5 volts in             second, so that an ordinary condenser with
maximum cuirent 2'5 amperes would have a capacity of about
72 microfarads.       We see, therefore, that aluminium is suited for the
plates   of   condensers.      The average watts in Table V have been
deduced from the instantaneous product of potential and current at
twenty equal intervals during a period.
   The foregoing experiments employed saturated potash alum solu
tion as electrolyte.         The following experiments deal with soda,
ammonia, and potash alums, first when the solutions were saturated,
and second when non-saturated.            In each of the non-saturated
solutions the proportions were thirteen parts of saturated solution at
about 12° C. by volume and seventy equal parts of distilled water.
Three cells were constructed, each containing two aluminium plates
of 99'5 per cent, purity, separated £ inch apart, and each having
33 square inches of surface in the electrolyte opposed to the other.
The results of the experiments are given in Table VI.
   With regard to the saturated solutions one may say that at the
low frequency 7'5 Table VI the results are not so good as at the
high frequency 92"4 Table V.            The non-saturated   solutions also
show a better result with regard to efficiency at the higher
frequency.
   These plates were not specially formed with direct currents and
carbon cathodes before starting the above experiments.            In a pre
liminary experiment of about one hour's duration, before the first
series at frequency 33 in Table VI were made, and starting             with
clean polished plates, the maximum volts for the soda, ammonia,         and
potash were, a few minutes after starting, 4-4, 21*5, and 32.           The
maximum current was 0'48 ampere and the phase differences in           each
case about 70°.       The frequency was 23 and the temperature      of each
cell about     14° C.
   An experiment        was tried in which two aluminium discs 6 inches
diameter and separated -fc inch on an ebonite spindlo were sub
merged to within        J inch of the centre in a saturated potash alum
solution and rotated at 108 revolutions per minute by a small electric
motor.      In this manner more than half the discs were continuously
exposed to the atmosphere.          Two brushes bearing   on copper discs,

pressed into good contact with the aluminium discs, served as a
means of transmitting current through the electrolyte between the
discs. The frequency was 73, the temperature 18° C, and square root
of mean square value of current about 1 ampere.           No perceptible
difference was observed in phase difference between potential and
current when the discs were rotated and at rest in the electrolyte.
   The conclusion is that the effect investigated in this paper takes
time to develop, and is not fully developed with alternate currents of
frequencies sixteen and ninety -eight complete periods per second. It
can be increased by increasing the current density for a given film, and
is greatly influenced by temperature.     The metal aluminium with its
film is suitable for use as the plates of condensers, if due regard be
given to current density and temperature.        It might in some cases
be found useful as an equivalent to a metallic resistance.
   Messrs. Simpson, Greenbank, and Davy, Student Demonstrators in
the Siemens Laboratory, King's College, London, have given me
valuable assistance in the experimental part, and in the working ont
of results. To these gentlemen I tender my thanks.

   Much work has already been done on this subject, though little of a
quantitative character.     Many observers have described the curious
colour sensations which rapid alternations of light and darkness can
excite under certain conditions, admirably exemplified in the " spec
trum tops." Foremost amongst those whose experiments and writings
have led to the present very general interest in the subjects of flicker,
and of the sensation of light and colour, may be mentioned Helmholtz,
Silvanus Thompson, Shelford Bidwell, Henry, Charpentier, and
Rood ; whilst the first to try experiments on the relative sensitive
ness of the eye to flicker in light of different colours, seems to have
been J. Plateau, who, however, employed pigments, and not the
colours of the spectrum.
   The writer's first experiments were made to ascertain the exact
relative  rotations at which the flicker just vanishes in the different
colours  of  the same spectrum, and were carried out (o) as suggested
by Professor Rood in his ' Modern Chromatics,' with a balanced,
blackened, opaque disc, having a broad semicircular arc removed,
and (6) on a cardboard disc, half black, half white, viewed in the
different colours of the spectrum of the second order of a Rowland's
plane diffraction grating of 14,434 lines to the inch. Two sources of
light were employed, (a) direct sunshine, (h) lime-light. The results

are conveniently expressed by curves (tig. 1); along one axis of which
the spectrum is plotted, on the other the rate of rotation of the disc.
This last was found from the pitch of the note, obtained by blowing air
gently through a known number of equidistant holes pierced in the
circumference of the disc, and comparing these notes with those of a
set of standard forks. Where the lime-light was used, great pains
were taken to keep the intensity of the light constant throughout
each experiment, though in these first experiments the intensity
varied for the different curves.      It may be well to point ont that
owing to the nature of the spectrum of lime, the oi-ange is somewhat
brighter and the blue and violet darker, relatively, than they are in
sunshine.   It is for a similar reason, as well as for others too obvious
to mention, that the arc light was not employed.          It will be seen,
that in fig. 1, the intervals of the chromatic scale are plotted in
equidistant order, and it should be remembered that the arithmetic
increase in the number of revolutions to raise the pitch of the note
from C (128 vibrations) to C (256), is only half that to raise it from
C (256) to C (512), and so on. The effect of plotting on the axis of
Y the actual number of revolutions, would be to make all the
curves a great deal steeper.      It seems  necessary, too,   to mention

that the writer's    eyes   are perfectly normal, and that he has a good
ear.    There are   so many experimental details, that to describe fully
a single observation, and to state the reasons for the many precau
tions which must be taken if the result is to bo of any value, would
take up so much space that the writer thinks it best only to mention
a few of the more    important : — The same spot on the lime was never
used twice ; the width of the slit was kept unaltered ; each disap
pearance of flicker was witnessed by two, sometimes three, observers;
the same time as nearly as possible was maintained between the
observations, and used in making them, in order that the retina as
well as the lime might be in approximately the same condition for
each ; the room was completely dark* and the eyes rested between the
observations, never looking at any bright objects, and, above all, not
at the lime ; the oxygen and coal gas were conveyed by special metal
pipes from gasometers in which they were stored under constant
pressure outside the building, but since the composition of both
gases is liable to variation, the intensity of the light was maintained
constant, by regulating the supply of the gases till the flicker of a
half and half disc in the yellow vanished at the same speed of rota
tion (generally A'). After every set of experiments, to make sure
that the illumination had not sensibly changed, the note for vanish
ing flicker in the yellow was again observed. Experience teaches
that the blue-green is rather better than the yellow for this purpose,
and accordingly it was used in later experiments.                  Not more than
two curves, often only one, were drawn in twenty-four hours, and to
check the effects of contrast in consecutive experiments in different
colours, a curve was drawn (a) by taking the colours of the spectrum
from red to violet and vice versa in their natural order, and (£>) by
finding the pairs of colours on either side of the yellow for which
flicker vanished at the same rate of rotation.                    The results of
experiments     made    thus   agree   very    closely,    and   the writer may
say here   that throughout     the   eight years during        which the research
has been carried on, the feeling has steadily grown that in sub
jective vision we have to do with immutable quantities, capable of
exact measurement, and which- vary but slightly, if at all, with
different people.
    A glance at the curves in fig. 1 will show that there is a very
great difference in the rates of rotation necessary for the disappear
ance of flicker in the different parts of the spectrum, the speed for
the yellow being very nearly double that for the violet.
    Also, that on each side of the yellow the rate decreases, until the
flicker disappears for the last distinctly visible red at the same rate
nt. which it vanishes for the full green.
    Pig. 2 presents this last fact in a somewhat different way, and, if

anything, mo:e clearly ; the yellow and the violet — the two extremes
so far as the pie?eut considerations go — are placed at the top and
bottom of the central vertical line, and the number of rotations per
second necessary for flicker just to vanish, given in the column on
the left, is seen to be (fur this half-white, half-black disc) 32 for
the yellow, and 16 for tbe violet, and 24 for the last pair of
colours — crimson and full green.               The comparative rates of rotation
for these colours thus bear the ratios of 2:3:4, which are easily
remembered.
   To return      to fig. 1. The curves                 II   and IX lie considerably
above the others        :  they   are   the    expression of observations made,
as   suggested to Professor Rood by Dr. Woolcott Gibbs,                                by
viewing    the    spectrum       through        a    rotating     disc   having  a sector
of   180°  removed,        using a telescope. Though the form of these
two    curves   is practically the same as that of the others, their
higher position, due to the superior intensity of the light received
by the eye in this direct vision method, proves clearly what is already
well known for white light, that the speed necessary for the disap
pearance of flicker increases with increase of the intensity of the
light, whatever its colour may be. No.                    II   is for lime-light, No. IX
for sunlight, the rays of the sun being reflected through the slit by
means of a heliostat.
   Of the other curves in fig. 2 not much need be said ; they are all
for lime-light, the spectrum being thrown on the rotating cardboard
disc half white and half black.              The writer has thought it better not
to smooth the curves in any way.
   These curves, then, not only confirm the already known fact that

                                                 " Flicker."            351
 the stimulus given to the retina lasts undiminished a shorter time
for the yellow than for any other colour, but they give the very
                                 " last " for the different colours. The
approximately exact relative
general form of the curves following very closely the curve which
expresses the luminous       intensity of the spectrum obtained by
Newton, Abney, and others.
   The next point seems to the writer very important, especially with
reference to what follows. Numerous experiments were made to find
out how the " last " (undiminished) for any one colour varied with
the intensity of the light ; for the present it. is sufficient to say that
in every case the more intense the illumination the more rapid must
the rotation of the disc be made before flicker will vanish.         Hence
vve are bound to infer that as the stimulus applied to the retina
increases in intensity, the impression produced retains its maximum
value for a shorter and shorter time.
   That a brighter illumination does produce a greater stimulus (i.e.,
that neither the contraction of the pupil, nor any other cause, over
comes the effect of brighter illumination) is conclusively proved by
the fact that the brighter the light the brighter on the whole is the
disc when flicker has just vanished.
   Research was next made to find out in what way the rotation of
a disc must be varied for flicker to vanish when the proportion of
the coloured to the black sector varied, the intensity of the illumina
tion remaining constant.
   Two discs were taken : one painted with Indian ink laid on as dry
as possible, and the other of the whitest cardboard procurable ; these
were dovetailed after Maxwell's method and mounted on a motor
with a " syren
                 "
                    disc.  This last was pierced with six, twelve, or
twenty-four holes, that the note emitted might lie within the octaves
which are both easy to sing and in which intervals can bo most
correctly judged.
   As the experiments took many days and nights, and it was most
important that the conditions should be as similar as possible on
different occasions, the whole of the apparatus remained unmoved
throughout the whole set of comparative experiments ; the limc-light
burner was firmly screwed down to the base-board of the lantern.
The rotating disc was most carefully screened from extraneous light,
though if the writer repeated the experiments he would wear a black
ma.sk to prevent the illumination of the dark sector of the disc by
even the faint light reflected from the observer's face. The writer
chinks this may account partly, though not wholly, for the asym
metry of the curves of fig. 3 in the case of the red and yellow.        The
grating was surrounded by a screen coated         with   the dullest optical
black, whilst another screen allowed only the special colour required
to fall on the half of the disc viewed.      Each observer regarded the

 352                       Mr.  T.  C. Porter.
disc from practically the same stand-point and distance, the latter
being that of most distinct vision ; moreover, he kept his eyes fixed
on the same part of the disc, so that the image of the disc did not
travel over the retina.   All these are important details as will appear
later.
   Before examining the curves in fig. 3, consider a disc rotating under
a fixed degree of  illumination, i.e., in a light of constant intensity.
Suppose that the light is of a certain colour, e.g., yellow, and that a

                                                   "
                  Contributions  to the  Study of Flicker."               353
 certain sector only, reflects the yellow light to the eye, the rest of
 the disc being of a perfect black.          Let the disc be rotating very
 slowly : then, as the yellow sector passes before the eye, it will
 appear as bright as possible under the given illumination, i.e., it will
appear of no less bright a yellow than it would, if the whole disc
 were yellow, i.e., the stimulus given to the part of the retina on
 which its image rests, is the maximum possible to this yellow, under
 this particular and constant illumination.        Now, suppose the rate of
rotation to be raised until flicker has just vanished, no part of the disc
 now looks so bright as the sector did at first, and since the final
brightness of the disc varies directly as the width of the yellow
sector (this is the fundamental assumption on which all the colour
equations rest, and is verified by experiments described later), then,
when the flicker has vanished, the effective stimulus at any point of the
retina is to the original and maximum stimulus as the angle of the yellow
sector is to the angle of the whole disc, i.e., 360°, the illumination being
constant  throughout.
    Moreover, since the mere increase in the rate of rotation has no
effect whatever on the real width and brightness of the yellow
sector, but only diminishes the time during which its stimulus is
applied to the retina, and diminishes, in the same ratio, the time the
 black sector takes to pass (and the more rapid passage of the black
sector must, considered alone, tend to increase the brightness of the
disc), whilst it (the increase in rate of rotation) increases to the same-
extent the number of stimuli applied to the retina per second, and
the number of transits of the black sector; it follows, since the final
apparent    brightness   of the disc is less than     if it were all yellow,
that the yelloiv sector requires a finite time in order to produce its ma.ri-
mwn effect, and the same argument applies to any colour.                This
conclusion     is in complete accordance with the results of other
ex perimentalists.
    Hut this is not all that these considerations prove : for since the
increase in speed of rotation diminishes in the same ratio both the
time the image of the yellow sector takes to pass over a point on the
retina, and also the time the image of the black sector takes to pass
(i.e., the time the sensation evoked by the yellow sector must neces
sarily last undiminished, if there is to be no flicker), the increased
speed would have no effect whatever on the flicker except to multiply
the number of times it occurred per second, if it were not that a
                                               (using the word " last
weaker stimulus has a longer " last
                                            "                            " to
mean the duration of the sensation undiminished, after the stimulus
has been withdrawn).          This is a second proof of the principle
established in a different way earlier in the present paper (p. 351).
    Experiments were next made to measure directly the apparent
brightness of rotating flickerless discs, and to find an expression for

354                            Mr. T. C. Porter.
the effect of successive equal increments to the bright sector.         The
method used was to measure the distances from a movable source of
light, of the rotating disc, and of a fixed disc, of the same colour as
the bright sector of the rotating disc, when the brightness of the
two discs appeared equal.        It was found that for illuminations about
the same as those used in the other experiments recorded in this
paper, the law which connects the appai'ent brightness with the
width of the bright sector is that enunciated before, i.e., that a
ftickerless half-and-half disc appears half as bright as the fixed and
wholly white or coloured disc, at any rate within the errors of
experiment which, however, in this part of the research were not
inconsiderable.       When the width of the white or coloured sector
was increased in steps of 10° at a time, the increment of the
apparent brightness in the flickerless disc followed, within the errors
of experiment, the series 1/0, 1/1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, &c, as it should ; and
since these fractions express the ratio between the increase of
stimulus     caused at any stage by an additional 10° of coloured
sector, and the stimulus already existing before its addition, it follows
that we can, with the help of the principles established already,
predict how the rate of rotation for the disappearance of flicker must
vary with the growth of the white or coloured sector.            We should
expect   the  first few  additions of the 10° to produce   the most marked
alteration (a rise, as we already know) in the rate of rotation neces
sary for the disappearance of flicker, since the diminution in the
amount of the black sector is trifling in comparison with its total
width. Towards the final additions of 10°, we shall reach a stage
when the effect of the increment of 10° of white or colour is almost
negligible in comparison with the total width of the white or
coloured sector, but just at this time, the relative diminution of the
 black sector will be most rapidly increasing, and in order that
 flicker may only just be invisible, the rate of rotation must
be considerably       diminished, and this diminution will bear to the
total velocity almost the ratio the diminution of the black sector
 (10°) bears to its total width ; but not exactly this ratio, for since
 the effective stimulus is still increasing, though the increase is small
compared with its total magnitude, and since this implies — apart
from any effect of change in the width of the black sector — that the
 rate of rotation must be raised for the flicker to vanish, it follows
 that the rate of rotation will not diminish at so rapid a pace as the
 shrinkage of the black sector's width would demand, if it alone had
 to be considered.      So far, therefore, the " flicker

 with a growing white or coloured sector, the angle of the bright
 sector being measured on the axis of Y, and the speed of rotation on
 the axis of X) will be, on the whole, symmetrical with respect to the

ing to the half-and-half disc, but not completely so, for the con
sideration just mentioned would cause the curves ¦which are repre
sented in fig. 3 to be steeper on the right than on the left, viewing
the curves from the axis of Y.         It will be seen at once that in prac
tice the converse is true, and the writer believes that this is due to
the fact that the black sector is not completely black.         The effect of
the small percentage of light reflected from the black sector will be
at first to diminish the rate of growth of the speed necessary for
flicker to vanish, for it diminishes the contrast between the coloured
sector and the black — a contrast on which the flicker primarily
depends.     The curves will therefore rise more gradually on the
right, holding the figure as already described.         When there is little
of the black left, there will be proportionately little of the light
reflected from it, — and if this light be bright enough to have any appre
ciable effect, the effect must be to make the decrease of the speed of
rotation (necessary to cause the flicker to all but reappear) more rapid,
because it lessens the effect of the narrow black sector left, giving
the impression that all the coloured sector's light has survived the
passage of the black sector, for a rate of rotation at which, in reality,
a part failed to survive, and would have produced flicker if unaided
by the light reflected from the black sector.
    Thus any want of blackness in the black sector will have con
siderably more effect daring the early part of the growth of the
coloured sector, whilst the black sector is very large, than afterwards,
and this completely explains the observed departure from symmetry
in the curves constructed from actual observation.              It should be
noted that from the way in which the disc is illuminated by the
spectrum, any light reflected from the black sector is of the same
colour as that of the bright sector.         If pigment had been used to
colour the bright sector, and the disc viewed in white light, white
light would have been reflected from both the coloured and the
black sector, and the effect of this would be very much harder to
explain.
    Five curves will be seen in fig. 3 ; they are for different colours of
the same lime-light spectrum ; each of the capital letters gives the
exact result of an observation, carefully verified in every case.        The
actual number of rotations per second          can  be  easily found for any
point on the curves by dividing the number of vibrations of the cor
responding note found on the axis of X by 24, the number of holes in
the syren disc. The musical intervals, so far as the diatonic scale is
concerned, are the true chromatic, and not the equal temperament
system.
    The information conveyed by the position of any point on one of
the curves may be stated as follows, taking, for example, G on the
 160° line of the yellowish-green    : —

Hence      the duration of the impression on the retina undiminished
 appears to decrease as the time of stimulation increases, though
 within narrow limits of variation one of these quantities is nearly
 inversely proportional to the other.
     With regard to the total duration of a luminous impression, the
  writer would point out that nothing has been said in this paper ; the
  few experiments he has made to measure this, lead to the belief that
 it is almost of a different order of magnitude from the time during
 which an impression remains undiminished, and is to be measured
 by whole minutes rather than by small fractions of a second.

    It has been shown by Hittorf* that when an electric current passes
.through a tube containing a gas at a pressure of a few millimetres,
 there is a rapid fall of potential near each of the electrodes, with a
  much more gentle fall in the space between, and whilst the fall near
  the anode and in the positive column varies with the density of the
  gas and the   current strength, the fall near the kathode is constant.
  W arburgt has made careful experiments on the kathode fall, and has
  fully established     its constancy.       If the gas is pure and dry, the
 electrodes clean, and of a metal not acted on chemically by the gas,

and the current not so strong as to make the negative glow cover the
whole kathode or extend to the walls of the tuhe, the kathode fall
has a definite value for each gas — a value that is independent of the
pressure of the gas, or of the current strength, and that appears, in
fact, to be a constant of the gas.
   This being the case, it is probable that the kathode fall will prove
to be connected with other physical and chemical constants of the
gas, and the aim of the experiments described below was to find
whether there is any intelligible relation amongst the kathode falls of
three gases, one of which is formed by the combination of the other
two.
   The choice of suitable gases is very limited, for there must be no
deposition of solid matter by the current, and no chemical action
between the gas and the electi-ode, so that organic gases and gases
containing a halogen cannot be used — at least with metal electrodes.
The present investigation has been confined to water vapour, ammonia,
and nitric oxide and their constituents.
   The general plan of the apparatus was the same for all the gases,
and is shown in the figure below.
   The gas generating apparatus was sealed on at A, and a mercury
pump at L. In order to isolate the generating flask from the rest,
the mercnry trap B was used.       By raising the reservoir C, the mer
cury could be made to rise above the bend at B, and thus everything
to the right could be exhausted. D is a small bulb to catch stray mer
cury. E is the purifying apparatus, and F the vessel in which the
discharge took place.     This vessel consisted of a globe 15 cm. in
diameter, into which were sealed three wires ; G, the anode of alumi
nium, 2 mm. thick; K, the kathode of platinum, 2 mm. thick, and
extending 10 cm. into the globe, so as to afford plenty of free space
for the negative glow ; and H, a thin platinum wire, covered with
glass to within a millimetre of the tip.

358                       Dr. J. W. Capstick.
   The parts of the apparatus were sealed together without glass taps
or india-rubber connections.
   The difference of potential to be obserTed is that between H
and K when the current is passing between G and K. There is no
need for accurate adjustment of the distance between H and K, for
in the dark space the potential gradient is very slight for two
or three centimetres, so that all that is required is that the end of
H   should be outside the negative glow.    In the present experiments
it was about a centimetre from the end of the kathode.
   In the earlier experiments the difference of potential was measured
by a bifilar quadrant electrometer, whose constant was determined by
means of a battery of Clark cells. In the later experiments a Kelvin
multicellular voltmeter was used.
   The current through the discharge tube was supplied from 600
storage cells, a lead pencil line of variable length, drawn on a slate,
being included in the circuit, to vary the current strength.
   The current is not always continuous, but sometimes consists of a
rapid succession of discharges, and when this is the case the observed
kathode fall is not generally constant.        Hence a telephone was
inserted in the circuit to show when the current was continuous.
With the elementary gases the telephone was generally silent, but
with the compound gases the humming was so persistent as to come
near wrecking the work.
   Hydrogen. — Warburg found the kathode fall in hydrogen to be
800 volts, but it seemed desirable to repeat the experiments, in order
to find the degree of concordance that can be obtained by different
observers.
   The gas was obtained from palladium that had been saturated
with hydrogen prepared by the electrolysis of dilute sulphuric acid.
It was purified by solid potash and phosphoric anhydride, and the
discharge tube contained a piece of sodium, to destroy the last traces
of moisture.     The apparatus was repeatedly exhausted, heated, and
refilled with hydrogen, whilst the electrodes were kept red hot by a
strong current, to expel occluded gases.
   The strength of the current was not measured during the experi
ments, but it was varied by altering the resistance in the circuit, so
as to cover a varying length of the kathode with the negative glow,
and so to show whether the tube was large enough to allow the dis
charge to pass without hindrance.      The table below gives details of
the measurements.
   The first column gives the pressure of the gas in millimetres of mer
cury, the second gives the fraction of the kathode that was covered
with the glow, and the third gives the kathode fall in volts.

value    300 found by Warburg, that no further experiments were
made.
   Oxygen.   — The gas was made by heating permanganate of potash,
and passed through a set of Geissler bulbs of sulphuric acid and over
lumps of potash and phosphoric anhydride before reaching the dis
charge tube. The permanganate was twice recrystallised, dried, and
heated till it fell to a fine powder, before being introduced into the
apparatus, in order to ensure the absence of moisture, and so diminish
the risk of formation of volatile manganese compounds.
   The degree of purity of the gas was tested by the spectrum of the
discharge, and it proved a difficult matter to get rid of the nitrogen.
By repeatedly exhausting and filling the apparatus with oxygen
while the glass was kept hot, the nitrogen lines were rendered very
faint, but they were not entirely removed even after continuing the
operations for a fortnight.        Tho hydrogen lines soon disappeared
entirely, but the nitrogen lines were always faintly visible when the
current was strong enough to make the kathode red hot. As, how
ever, a very small amount of nitrogen is sufficient to make the nitro
gen lines far brighter than the oxygen lines, the quantity of nitrogen
present must have been extremely small.
   In the observations recorded below, from two to six readings with
different current strengths were taken at each pressure.          The mean
result is given for each set.

   Nitrogen. — Warburg's determination of tho kathode fall in this gas
was made on atmospheric nitrogen containing argon, and hence it
¦was necessary      to repeat the observations on chemically prepared
nitrogen.
     In the first experiments the gas was prepared by heating ammonium
bichromate.       If the bichromate is mixed with fine sand the decom
position is easily controlled, but the gas is impure, and must be
passed over ignited copper and copper oxide, which involves the
use of hard glass and india-rubber connections. The joints were very
carefully made with thick- walled soft rubber tube, yet the observed
kathode fall, 355 volts, was the same as in air, and nearly the same as
in oxygen, and very much higher than what later experiments showed
was the true value for nitrogen. The result is interesting, as showing
the great effect of a small quantity of oxygen in the nitrogen, and
emphasises the necessity for scrupulous cai-e in removing traces of
impurity.
   The final experiments were made on gas prepared by the decom
position of ammonium nitrite.          A solution of pure ammonium
chloride was contained in a flask from the neck of which a tube a
 yard long passed downwards into a mercury reservoir.           When the
flask was exhausted along with the rest      of  the apparatus, potassium
 nitrite solution could   be sucked in as required by pouring a little on
 the top of the mercury, and lowering the reservoir. At low pressures
 the mixture of ammonium chloride and potassium nitrite does not
 require heating, as the nitrogen comes off regularly and very slowly
 at the temperature of the room.
    The gas was passed over solid potash and phosphoric anhydride,
 and a piece of sodium was placed in the discharge tube.
    In some of the experiments bichromate of potash was also added
 to oxidise to nitric acid any oxides of nitrogen that might be
 formed.     The addition made the evolution of gas inconveniently
 rapid,   and the flask had to be kept cool by a water bath.           The

               On the Kathode   Fall of Potential in   Gases.         3(51
difference between the measurements before and after the addition
was very small.
   It is not necessary to givo a detailed list of all the observations
that were made. It will be sufficient to say that before the bichromate
was added twenty-five observations were made, the mean value found
for the kathode fall was 231 volts, the extreme values being 223 and
241.    After the addition of the bichromate twenty measurements
were made, the mean value being 233 and the range 225 to 238.
The mean of the whole is 232.
   This is exactly the same as Warburg found for atmospheric
nitrogen, whence it appears that the presence of argon has no effect
on the kathode fall.
     Water Vapour. — Distilled    water from a clean silver still was
boiled to remove dissolved gases, and the apparatus was sealed up
whilst the water was still at the boiling temperature.
    The greater part of the air was removed from the apparatus by
means of the pump, which contained some sulphuric acid above the
mercury, and the whole was then allowed to stand for a week, the
acid absorbing the vapour and keeping up a steady evaporation of
the water, thus gradnally sweeping out any remaining air. The un-
condensed gas was ejected from the pump, and the acid renewed
from time to time. Incondensable gas never entirely ceased to pass
over, but before any experiments were made it appeared from an
estimate of the volume of water absorbed by the acid and the volume
of the air bubble in the pump, that the ratio of the pressure of the
air to the pressure of water vapour in the apparatus was reduced to
about one part in five millions. Of course, more gas came over when
the discharge was passing, but even then the quantity was very
small.     Presumably     the hydrogen and oxygen set free near the
electrodes   recombine   at  other parts of the tnbe.
    A compound gas naturally presents difficulties that are absent in
the case of an elementary gas, for as soon as the current is started
the gas becomes mixed with decomposition products, and is no longer
pure.    The chief difficulty, however, arose from the intermittence of
the current.     With elementary gases the current was seldom inter
mittent, with the compound gases it was seldom constant.          It was,
of   course, useless to take  any readings  of the kathode  fall when  the
 telephone was singing, and many [months were spent in a frnitless
 attempt to find what circumstances determine the constancy or inter
 mittence of the current.
    The rate of intermittence was not usually constant, as was evident
 from the variation in the note given by the telephone, and the
 change from sound to silence was sudden, and often accompanied by
 other changes, such as the appearance of stria? in the tube, and a
 sudden change in the kathode fall.        When the telephone was silent

362                         Dr. J. W. Capstick.
it could always in the   case cf the compound gases be made to sing by
a sufficient  increase  in  the current, but a reduction of the current
density by the use of electrodes half an inch in diameter made it no
easier to obtain a constant current.
    The method by which it was hoped that errors due to the decom
position of the gas would be got rid of was to start the current, and
when by accident as it proved rather than by design, the telephone
was silent, to open the mercury trap and allow a stream of pare gas
to play ou the electrodes, whilst the reading of the electrometer was
taken.    It was not often that this could be carried out, for when
after repeated attempts the telephone was silenced, the usual result
of admitting fresh gas was either to make the current intermittent
or to stop it altogether.
   The proceeding was carried out successfully only twice. In the
first experiment the current was steady as soon as the circuit was
closed. The negative glow covered half the kathode and the
kathode fall was 471 volts, but quickly rose to 484 as decomposition
proceeded.      A little vapour was then admitted, and the fall of
potential at once sank to 467 but soon rose again to 482 when the
stream of gas ceased.      More vapour was then admitted whereupon
the kathode fall sank to 469, and in half a minute rose again
to 478.
   The second experiment was less satisfactory as only a single reading
was obtained. After the current had been running for a few minutes
the telephone became silent, the negative glow consisting of a bright
tip covering about a tenth of the kathode and the kathode fall being
484.    On admitting more vapour it sank to 469, but before it had
risen more than a few volts the telephone began singing again, and
could not be made to stop.
    Thus we have four observations        of the   kathode fall in the
undecomposed gas, namely : 471, 467, 469, and 469, the mean being 469.
    In both experiments the pressure of the vapour was about 2 mm.
   Ammonia. — The gas was prepared by the action of soda on
ammonium sulphate that had been treated with nitric acid in the
ordinary way to remove organic substances.            The ammonia was
dried with lime and absorbed in calcium chloride contained in a bulb
sealed to the apparatus.
   Here, as with water vapour, the numerous attempts to secure a
constant current met with little success.     Only two readings of the
kathode fall were obtained, and these were not very concordant.       In
the first experiment the current had been running for half an hour
when the iutermittence ceased, and the kathode fall in the partially
decomposed gas was 510 volts.       When a stream of pure ammonia was
allowed to play on the kathode, the reading of the electrometer rose
to 595, where it remained steady until, after a few seconds, the dis

               On the Kathode   Fall of Potential   in Gases.          363
charge stopped.      In the second experiment the current had been
running for some time through gas at a low pressure, the kathode
fall being 440 volts. A stream, of pure gas sent it up to 570, but the
telephone soon began singing, and the kathode fall sank rapidly
to 480.    The mean of the two observations is f>82 volts.
   Nitric Oxide. — A mixture of nitre and ferrous sulphate was acted
on by dilute sulphuric acid, and the evolved gas washed with potash
solution and sulphuric acid, and absorbed in a saturated solution of
ferrous sulphate.      This solution was contained in a Bask, sealed to
the rest of the apparatus.      The gas was given off readily without
warming when the pressure was sufficiently reduced, and was
passed over potash and phosphoric anhydride before reaching the
discharge tube.
    In the case of water vapour and ammonia, when the current was
discontinuous the observed kathode fall was very variable and not
independent of the current strength, but with nitric oxide the
variation was within narrow limits, the readings always lying
between 340 and 380 volts, whether the telephone was silent or not,
and whatever      the current strength, provided the kathode was not
covered with the negative glow.
    The readings of the kathode fall and the appearance of the dis
 charge showed that the gas is rapidly decomposed by the current.
 When the discharge first started, the kathode fall was always near
 370 volts, and the glow at both anode and kathode was white. In
 a few seconds the glow round the kathode began to grow blue, and
 that round the anode turned pink, whilst the kathode fall slowly sank
 to about 345 volts.      Meanwhile the glow spread backwards along
 the kathode, showing an increase of current, and hence a decrease in
 the resistance of the gas.
     The decomposition proceeded     so   rapidly that it was impossible to
 get the kathode fall for the pure    g.is  by taking the reading whilst a
 stream of gas played on the electrodes, for the strength of stream
 necessary to maiutain the white glow of the pure gas was so great
 that the pressure immediately roso high enough to stop the dis
 charge.     Hence the only feasible plan was to allow the gas to
 stream through the tube long enough to sweep out the products of
 decomposition, then stop the stream by closing the mercury trap,
  pump down to a suitable pressure, start the discharge, and take a
 reading   as quickly as possiblo.
     Twelve readings were taken in this way, when the telephone was
 either silent throughout or became silent a few seconds after the
 current, started.    There was never any change in the kathede fall at
 the   moment    when the current became constant.            The readings
  varied between 366 and 378, the mean value being 373.
     This is so nearly the value for oxygen as to suggest a doubt of its
                                                               2 d 2

accuracy.     The earlier experiments on nitrogen showed that a very
slight trace of oxygen was sufficient to raise the kathode fall from
its true value 232 to 355.             In fact, the values for oxygen, nitric
oxide, air, and nitrogen with a trace of oxygen, are all nearly the
same, which makes it not improbable that in each case the oxygen
alone acts as the carrier of the current.
    We have, then, finally the following values for the kathode fall —
                       Hydrogen                              298
                       Nitrogen                              232

                      (Nitric oxide                          373)
    The last is enclosed in brackets in consequence of the doubts as to
its accuracy. If wo leave the result for this last gas out of account,
it appears that the kathode fall is approximately an additive quan
 tity. Ascribing the values 149, 116, and 184 respectively to the
 atoms of hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen, we get, by addition, 482
for water vapour and 563 for ammonia.                    As each of these depends
on three measurements, they may be taken as agreeing with the
 observed values within the limits of experimental error.                 Hence, so
 far as the evidence of these experiments goes, the kathode fall is a
property of the atoms rather than of the molecule.
    As the kathode fall is constant for all pressures and currents
 whilst the potential gradient along the rest of the tube is variable,
 we may infer that no potential difference less than the kathode fall
 is capable of causing a discharge through the gas.                 This conclusion
 is consistent with the experiments of Mr. Peacp,* who found that the
 minimum difference of potential that gives a discharge in air is
 something over 300 volts.
     Assuming that the conduction is electrolytic, it seems likely, from
  the analogy of the electrolysis of liquids, that the kathode fall may
 prove to be a measure of the energy required to dissociate the gas
 into the ions that carry the electricity, and the present experiments
  were undertaken in the hope of finding some confirmation of this
 hypothesis.      They have not, however, provided the kind of evidence
 that was anticipated.          The results can only be reconciled with the
  hypothesis   if further   assumptions      are made that would put the con
  duction in gases     on   a   very different footing from the electrolytic
 conduction of liquids.           The additive nature of the kathode fall
  might,  for instance,   be   taken  as an indication that the carriers of the
  current are provided by the disintegration of the atoms into much

 " Note on the Complete Scheme of Electrodynamic Equations

       By Joseph Larmor, F.R.S., Fellow of St. John's College,
       Cambridge.      Received May       17— Read May    26, 1898.
    This note forms a supplement to my third memoir on the " Dynam
ical Theory of the JEther,"* to the sections of which the references
are made.
    1. It is intended in the first place to express with full generality
the electrodynamic equations of a material medium moving in any
 manner, thus completing the scheme which has been already devel
oped subject to simplifying restrictions in the memoirs referred to.
 To obtain a definite and consistent theoretical basis it was necessary
to contemplate the material system as made up of discrete molecnles,
involving in their constitutions orbital systems of electrons, and
moving through the practically stagnant sether.        It is unnecessary,
for the mere development of the equations, to form any notion of
how such translation across the tether can be intelligibly conceived :
but, inasmuch as its strangeness, when viewed in the light of motion
of bodies through a material medium and the disturbance of the
medium thereby produced, has often led to a feeling of its impossib
ility, and to an attitude of agnosticism with reference to eethereal      •
constitution, it seems desirable that a kinematic scheme such as was
there explained, depending on the conception of a rotationally elastic
rether, should have a place in the foundations of aether-theory.     Any
hesitation, resting on a priori scruples, in accepting as a working
basis such a rotational scheme, seems to be no more warranted than
would be a diffidence in assuming the atmosphere to be a continuous
elastic medium in treating of the theory of sound. It is known that
the origin of the elasticity of the atmosphere is something wholly
different from the primitive notion of statical spring, being in fact
the abrupt collisions of molecules : in the same way the rotational
quality of the incompressible rether, which forms a sufficient picture
of iU effective constitution, may have its origin in something more
fundamental that has not yet even been conceived. But in each
case what is important for immediate practical purposes is a con
densed and definite basis from which to develop the interlacing

36(5      Dr.      J. L arm or.   Complete Scheme         of Electrodynamic
wards expand, transform, and even modify in detail.         Although,
however, it is possible that we may thus be able ultimately to piobe
deeper into the problem of (ethereal constitution, just as the kinetic
theory has done in the case of atmospheric constitution, yet there
does not seem to be at present any indication whatever of any faculty
which can bring that medium so near to us in detail as our senses
bring the phenomena of matter : so that from this standpoint there
is much to be said in favour of definitely regarding the scheme of a
continuous rotationally elastic aether a6 an ultimate one.
   A formal scheme of the dynamical relations of free aether being
postulated after the manner of Maxwell and MacCullagh, and a
notion as clear as possible obtained of the eethereal constitution of a
molecule and its associated revolving electrons, by aid of the rota
tional hypothesis, it remains to effect with complete generality the
transition between a molecular theory of the oethereal or electric
field which considers the molecules separately, and a continuous
theory expressed by differential equations which take cognizance
only of the properties of the element of volume, the latter alone
being the proper domain of mechanical as distinct from molecular
theory.     This transformation         is,
                                      as usual, accomplished by replacing
summations over the distribution of molecules by continuous inte
grations over the space occupied by them.               In cases where the
integrals   concerned    all remain  finite when    the origin to which they
refer     inside the matter so that the lower limit of the radius vector
         is
is  null, there     no difficulty in tho transition
                      is                                  this :  for example
                                                                       is
the case with the ordinary theory of gravitational forces.             But in
important branches of the electric theory of polarised media, some of
the integral expressions become infinite under these circumstances               ;
and this      an indication that
              is                        not legitimate to replace the effect
                                       it   is
of the part of the discrete distribution of molecules which           adjacent
                                                                            is
to the point considered by that of a continuous material distribution.
The result of the integration still, however, gives a valid estimate of
the effect of the material system as a whole,           we bear in mind that
                                                              if
tho infinite term coming in at the inner limit really represents a
finite part of the result depending solely on the local molecular con
figuration, a part whose actual magnitude could be determined only
 when that configuration         exactly assigned or known.
                                  is                                 The con

such cases, when       finite portion of the effect on

omitted from the aocount in estimating the mechanical effect on an
element of volume of the medium              indeed otherwise mechanical

actions of adjacent molecules determine the structure of the medium,
and any change therein involves change in its local physical constants
and properties, which may or may not be important according to
circumstances    : but such local action contributes    nothing towards
polarising   or  straining the element of mass whose structure is thus
constituted, and therefore nothing to mechanical excitation, unless at
a place where there is abrupt change of density.* In the memoir
above mentioned this molecular principle was applied mainly to
determine the mechanical stress in a polarised material medium.           It
necessarily also enters into the determination of the electrodynamic
equations of a moving medium treated as a continuous system, and
even of a magnetised medium at rest, from consideration of its
molecular constitution. It is here intended only to record in precise

the spacial differentia] coefficients of (F, G, H) are also involved
in the forcives of the aathereal field, and with them the case is
different : the transformation by parts is then analytically wrong,
owing to neglect of the infinite elements at the origin, while
in actuality a finite portion of the whole effect arises from the
influence of the neighbouring molecules.   We have, therefore, by the
molecular principle, to separate the infinite elements from the
integrals and leave them out of account ; and this is effected by
employing the second form above for F, which differs from the first
form only in having got rid of the local terms at the origin in its
differential coefficients. Thus it is not merely convenient, but even
necessary for a mechanical theory, which considers distributions
instead of individual molecules, to replace magnetism by its equival
ent continuous current system as here. The (jutm-magnetism arising

    It is to be observed that this effective current satisfies the condi
tion of incompressible            flow,* which by definition (or rather by the
sethereal constitution) is necessarily satisfied by the total current
(«, v, w) of the previous memoirs ; for the additional terms which
represent the magnetism clearly satisfy the stream relation.f                           The
remainder of the scheme of elecfrodynamic relations is established as
in the previous memoirs.               Thus (F, G, H) now representing simply
f(un "i) w>i)r-Ic?T, which satisfies the stream relation d¥ jdx + dQjdy +

and sufficient interfacial conditions.               The gradients of P, G, H are,
however, not continuous when there is magnetisation or dielectric
convection, on account of the effective interfaoial current sheets
before mentioned.
     The exact        value     of the    mechanical      force    (X, Y, Z) per unit

    *  It is proposed   to call a How-vector which obeys this condition a stream, the
 more general    term  flow or flux including cases like the Tariable stage of the flow of
 heat in which the condition of absence of convergence is not satisfied.             The two
 main classes of physical vectors may be called fluxes and gradients, the latter name
 including such entities as forces and being especially appropriate when the force
 is the gradient of a potential.      Lord Kelvin's term circuital flux has previously
 been used to denote a stream vector ; but it is perhaps better to extend it to a
 general vector which is directed along a system of complete circuit?.
    + The («, r, w) of § 13, however, included a part arising from convection               of
 electric polarisation.     Notice that when this is transferred to the magnetism, as
 here, we have « = n' + dfjdt + df'ldt + pp: thus when there is no conduction and
 p is therefore wholly convected        so that tpjdt is null, the stream character of the

(a,   fi,   7). under    all      circumstances.
   But in circumstances of electric convection these two circuital
relations would not usually by themselves form the basis of a com
plete scheme of equations, as they do when the material medium                                        is
at rest.
   To complete the scheme, the above dynamical equations must be
supplemented by the observational relations connecting the conduc
tion current with the electric force, the electric polarisation with the
electric force, and the magnetism with the magnetic force.        In the
simplest  case  of isotropy these relations are of types
             u'    - al\ f           = (K-l)/47rC5P,             A   =    Kot   +   (rg'-qK).
It   to be observed that the physical constants which enter into the
     is
expression of these relations will presumably be altered by motion
through the aether of the material system to which they belong                                        :
but because there    nothing unilateral in the system, a reversal of
                                is
this motion should not change the constants, therefore their altera
tion mnst depend on the square of the ratio of the velocity of the
system to that of radiation,  and would only enter in a second
approximation.
  The various problems relating to electric convection and optical

aberration worked out in §§ 14 — 16, pp. 225 — 229, will be found to
fit into this scheme. I take the opportunity of correcting an erratum
in p. 226, lines 16, 17, which should read
                         = ^(l +    K-l)wcr + Ar-(coa-0-^)+A'
                     *2 =   Bazoos' fl-^+B'r-1,
with of course different values of the constants.
      2. In a material dielectric the bodily mechanical forcive is derived
from a potential — (K — l)F2/8?r, and there is also a normal inward
traction KP2/8w where it abuts on conductors.                  For the thin dielec
tric shell of a condenser this forcive could be balanced by a hydro
static pressure           (K— 1)F2/8jt together with a Maxwell stress
consisting of a pressure FJ/8n- along the lines of force and an equal
tension at right angles to them : in fact this reacting system gives
the correct traction over the faces of the sheet and the correct
forcive throughout its substance.             If the sheet has an open edge the
tractions on that edge are however not here attended to ; when the
sheet is thin these are of small amount, and their effect is usually
local, as otherwise the nature of the edge would be an important
element.         Moreover, in the most important applications of the
formula the edge is of small extent, so that they form a local
statically balanced system. The stress above specified will thus
represent the material elastic reaction, provided the strains in the
different elements of volume, which correspond to it, can fit together
without breach of continuity of the solid material.                  This condition
will be secured if the shell is of uniform thickness so that F is constant
all over it : in that case, therefore, the elastic reaction in the material
will make up a pressure KFs/8»- along the lines of force and a
pressure (K— 2)F'-/8n- in all directions at right angles to them, which
is the result obtained for solids in § 76.
     If, however, the coatings of the condenser are not supported by the
dielectric shell, the elastic reaction in the shell will be simply a
pressure (K— l)Fs/87r uniform in all directions.                      This is what
actually     occurs   in the   case  of a fluid  dielectric,   where    such support
is not mechanically possible.
      It appeared from § 79 that in glass there is actually an increase of
volume under electric excitation, while the mechanical forces would
produce a diminution : and the same is true for most dielectric
 liquids, the fatty oils          being exceptions,* though by a confusion
between action and reaction the result was there stated as tho
opposite. It thus appears that in general an intrinsic expansion, in
 addition to the effects of the mechanical force, accompanios electric

excitation of material dielectrics. This circumstance will perhaps
recall to mind Osborne Reynolds' theory of the dilatancy of granular
media, which explains that the discrete elements of such media
tend to settle down under the mutual influences of their neighbours so
as to occupy the smallest volume, and therefore any disturbing cause
has a tendency to inorease the volume.
     In § 80, on the influence of electric polarisation on ripple velocity,
the result stated for dielectrics should be doubled.                   It is to be
remarked that a horizontal dielectric liquid surface becomes unstable
in a uniform vertical electric field when the square of the total con
tinuous vertical electric displacement exceeds the moderate value

electrified rod it must often have been noticed that when the rod is
brought too near, the liquid spurts out vigorously in extremely fine
filaments or jets : the fineness of the filaments may be explained, in
part at any rate, after Lord Rayleigh (' Phil. Mag.,' 1882,
                                                                       "

   The Electro-magnetic Theory of Light, as left by Maxwell, gave no
explanation of dispersion, and led to conclusions in some respects
inconsistent with the results of experiments on metallic reflection.
There seems to be little doubt as to the general direction in which it
would be necessary to modify that theory in order to give a satis
factory account of these phenomena.      Electrical conduction has been
considered by many to be inseparably connected with the motion of
charged atoms, whilst the properties of a dielectric have been found
to admit of an explanation on somewhat similar lines ; consequently
it would appear necessary, where fluctuations in the electric field of
frequencies as great as those of light are concerned, to expressly
formulate the reactions of the atoms or molecules composing the
medium through which the disturbances are propagated.                The
mechanical theories of light, when modified in a similar manner, have
been found capable of giving a more or less comprehensive account of
dispersion and metallic reflection; and it would appear that the
assumptions necessitated in the present case are at least as admissible
 as those which have been made elsewhere.        No doubt a theory with
any pretension to finality must include a satisfactory account of the
 nature of the luminiferous ether and of electricity, perhaps even of
 the ultimate constitution of atoms ; and Mr. Larmor's investigations
 show how far we can even now go in this direction.        On the other
 hand, a less comprehensive theory, depending only on the known laws
of electrical actions, may prove not without value,     whilst explaining
                                                      if,
 the observed phenomena,    it enables us to form a  clear mental picture
of the processes involved.

    In what follows,    I  have endeavoured to extend Maxwell's theory so
as to   include dispersion and metallic reflection.           The initial assump
tion that both conducting and dielectric media consist of molecules,
each comprising (in the simplest case) two oppositely charged atoms,
is essentially that made by Helmholtz in his paper on the " Electro
magnetic Theory of Dispersion."* The methods I have employed are
however different, and my final results, though bearing a general
resemblance to those obtained by Helmholtz, differ from them in some
important particulars, besides being simpler and more directly related
to the results of investigations on other theories of the nature of light.
But besides the gain in simplicity and consequent physical deflniteness,
I have had other reasons for not following Hclmholtz's method. The
utility of employing the principle of least action in this case may be
questioned, since the only difficulty appears to lie in formulating the
 reactions due to the charged atoms, and the nature of these reactions
 is implied in the energy equations assumed. Moreover, the energy
 equations obtained by Helmholtz are themselves open to criticism,
 and some of the results obtained do not reduce to Maxwell's equations
 when the terms involving the polarization of the dielectric are equated
 to zero.f
     2. This paper contains (1) a simple explanation of the fundamental
 phenomena observed in connection with a state of steady electrical
 strain in a dielectric ; (2) a consideration of the law of propagation
 of electrical disturbances in a polarizable medium ; equations are
 obtained which explain dispersion, both ordinary and anomalous ; (3)
 and a consideration of metallic reflection, especially in connection
 with Kundt's experiments on the velocity of light in metals.

 duction of a material dielectric between the plates of a charged
 condenser, diminishes the potential difference between the plates.

   Let us consider a dielectric medium, other than the ether, to be
composed of molecules each comprising, in the simplest case, two
oppositely charged atoms at a definite distance apart.              The volume
actually contained by the atoms is provisionally assumed to be small
in comparison with the volume of the interatomic spaces.
   In what follows the term axis of a molecule will be applied to the
vector distance between a negative and its associated positive atom.
In an isotropic medium the axes of the various molecules will, in the
absence of electrical strain, be inclined indifferently in all directions,
so that any element of volume will have no resultant electric moment.
If now a difference of potential be established between any two
parallel planes in the medium, the positive atoms will all move toward
points of lower, and the negative atoms toward points of higher
potential.    As a result each element of volume will now possess a
resultant electric moment. Also, if we define a molecular electric
moment as the product of the atomic charge (taken as positive) into
the vector distance between a negative and its associated positive
atom, the resultant electric moment due to a strained element of
volume containing a number of molecules, will coincide in direction
with the direction of fall of potential.
   In the unstrained medium we may represent the several moments
of the molecules contained in an element of volume by lines radiating
uniformly from a point, and ending on the surface of a sphere.*
   To find the electric moment of an element of the strained medium,
it is only necessary to determine the sum of the alterations of the
component molecular moments in the direction of the fall of potential.
   4. Let P be the electromotive intensity at a point in the dielectric,
and let q be the atomic charge, the distance between two associated
atoms being I.      Then a molecule whose axis makes an angle 0 with
the direction of fall of potential, will be subjected to a couple
Yql sin 6 tending to decrease 0 and each atom will be subjected to a
force Pg cos 0 tending to increase I.        Assuming that the forces of
restitution called into play by the displacement of the atoms are in
both cases proportional to the linear displacements, we shall have
                                               — = K2Pg

where <p indicates the (infinitesimal) molecular rotation, and \Z*1 is
the linear displacement of either atom in a line with the axis of the
molecule.
   The increase of the component molecular moment in the direction of
the fall of potential due to these strains, will be
                              ql<p sin 0 + q&l cos 0.

   5.  A  few remarks may be made in connection with the assumptions
made in the course of the above argument.             An objection might be
raised to the supposition that two oppositely charged atoms could
remain in equilibrium at a definite distance apart.         To this it may be
replied that the form of the argument does not necessitate the
assumption that electrical forces are the only forces acting ; and
even if these were the only forces, it would be possible to account for
the atomic separation by supposing both atoms to be revolving about
their common centre of gravity.
   If the atoms are considered to be small conducting spheres, and if
the volume actually occupied by the atoms is a large fraction of the
volume occupied by the dielectric, a correction on the lines of the
Mosotti-Clausius dielectric theory would become necessary.             On the
other hand, if electrical         conductivity is inseparably connected
with the motion of charged atoms, it would appear to be wrong to
consider the atoms themselves to be conductors.
    If finite motions of the atoms were necessary to explain tbe
properties of a dielectric, a treatment of the problem similar to that
used by Weber, in his molecular theory of magnetism would be
necessitated.       It may, however, easily be shown that infinitesimal
atomic displacements will account for the observed phenomena.             Take
the case of two plane and parallel charged condenser plates.          Let P be
the electro- motive intensity at a point between the plates when
charged in vacuo.       If now, the charge remaining the same, pure water
 is introduced between the plates, the electro-motive           intensity will
 become

carried by the oxygen in       1 gram of water, we shall have

    Hence the magnitude of the displacement, necessary to account
for the dielectric properties of a medium possessing the highest
specific inductive capacity known, is small, even when compared with
molecular magnitudes.
    In determining the force acting on a charged                       atom within a
polarised     dielectric,   a difficulty arises somewhat similar to that expe
rienced when the force on a magnetic molecule within a magnet in
sought.* The above method,                I   think, is not open to very serious
objection, and as the results obtained give a fair explanation of the
experimental       facts,  it may, perhaps, be tentatively adopted.

                          — Mr. Larmorf gives P + -|a-I as a first approxima
tion to the value of the total electric field at a point within a polarized
dielectric, I denoting the intensity of electrification, or the electric
moment of the polarized medium per                 unit volume.     As a consequence,
the Lorenz refraction equivalent is obtained, whilst the relation
 (fS— l)oo density follows from the reasoning employed in the present
paper.      Fnrther, a dispersion formula, differing somewhat from that
of Ketteler, is obtained by Mr. Larmor ; it would be interesting to
know with what degree of accuracy this formula is capable of repre
senting the dispersion of transparent substances, as determined, for
instance, by Paschen and Rubens.               J
    The following somewhat simple argument is submitted in justifica
tion of the assumption made above, that the field in a polarized
medium is equal to P.
     Let the    space    between two plane and parallel condenser plates,
separated by a distance small in comparison with the area of either,
be filled with an isotropic polarizable medium, such as that assumed
above.       The molecules are assumed to be in a state of equilibrium
amongst themselves when the two plates are at the same potential ;
consequently the potential energy W, due to the small rotations
0i, 0,, 03,         of the several molecules composing the medium may be
represented- by a quadratic function of the form
          W =     ija^ + ^-f .... +2 6„0,0,+2&„0,0,+                       ....}.
     A similar expression would obtain for the potential energy due to
 the separation of the atoms within the molecules.                     The conditions
 connecting the various coefficients are such that W is essentially
 positive.

   The first term represents the force acting on an atom of the mole
cule whose subscript     unity, when that molecule alone
                               is                          displaced                               is                ;
the succeeding terms represent the force on the same atom, due to
the displacement of the remaining molecules throughout the medium.
A  number of relations, similar to those given by Maxwell,* may be
deduced, but require no further notice here.
  Let the conducting surfaces, each of area                                  A, and separated by a
distance D, be charged by means of        battery to a constant potential

If, when electrical equilibrium has been acquired, the molecular
rotations are further increased by (Z0l5 defa, dtp,. . . the increment of           .    ,
electrical energy supplied by the battery will be equal to A . Ydl.
Further, writing    = PD, we obtain for this energy
                     V                                      the equivalent                   E,

where   2 indicates summation for the whole of the molecules through
out the medium.        Since, on releasing the molecules, the above amount
of electrical energy will be returned to the battery (the resistance of
leads being considered negligible), we must have
          P^lq sin         d(j>lt   = 22d0»       {a»0„       +   bmfa       +   b^rfa    +             }.

   Hence Fi = ~Pq sin 9X. Consequently the couple acting on   polar                                          a
ized molecule will be equal to that due to  field P. Farther,          a                                         if

arc considered.  Consequently the total electrical field contributed

   6. Only a very slight modification         of Maxwell's equations appears
to be necessary in order to determine the law governing the pro
pagation of electrical disturbances in a polarized medium sucli as
that previously considered.
   Let P, Q, R be the components of the electromotive intensity at a
point, F, G, H being the components of the vector potential there.
The electromotive intensity due to the displacement of the atoms
may, if the velocity of the atoms is small compared with the velocity
of light, be derived from a potential tjr.

Thomson in his developments of Maxwell's theory.*                    They express
the law that however the electromotive intensity at any place may

round a closed curve will be equal to the rate of decrease of the
induction through the curve.

 continual alteration in position of the atoms throughout the medium.
 This will be equal to *:P/4)r.       Mr. HeavisideJ has further shown that
in order to close the displacement current produced by a charge q,
 moving with a velocity vi, we must add at the position occupied by q

would     be   established.            Calculating                by    the      above   approximate
process the real part of the refractive index from Drnde'a experi
mental data, a fair agreement, as to order of magnitude, is found
with the    samequantity when calculated accurately.  The agreement
is not, however, close enough to explain the very accurate propor
tionality between the velocity of light in a metal and the conduc
tivity of the latter which Kundt's figures imply. Since, however,
Pfluger has shown that the temperature co-efficients of the velocities
of light and the conductivities are not of the same order of magni
tude, the process employed above may perhaps represent the nature
of the physical connection between the two quantities to a sufficient
degree of approximation.

readily obtained from (17). It is a well-established experimental

others, hemoglobin and its coloured derivatives show a character
istic absorption band lying between the lines G and M of the solar
spectrum.       The band has been shown to vary in position between

nearer the violet, end of the spectrum, and is of all the blood absorp

3?0        Mr. C. A. Schunck.       A  Photographic Investigation
say they are identical — led Tschirch to the belief that there must
also exist a like resemblance iu the violet and ultra-violet region of
the spectrum.        Tschirch in his investigations* shows this to be the
ease, and finds     a band   in phylloporphyrin (termed by him phyllo-
purpnric acid) in the same position as the band observed in bsema-
toporphyrin, and this corresponding to the characteristic                   band
•which has been shown to exist in the blood colouring matter
derivatives.      But further on I will show that this particular
resemblance in these two derivatives is only partly correct, the
band in the phylloporphyrin I examined being double, though
occupying the same position as the single one of htematoporphyrin.
    Tschirch (in the same memoir) makes the further important dis
covery that this band is not confined to phylloporphyrin alone, but
that it is distinctive of the chlorophyll derivatives generally, and
that it occupies (in the derivatives he observed) the same position
 (varying between narrow limits) as that shown to exist in the blood
derivatives, and, like the blood band, the new chlorophyll band
shows much greater stability than any of the other bands, no
matter what chemical changes the derivatives            have undergone.
    The chlorophyll derivatives investigated by Tschirch are phyllo-
purpnric acid (impure phylloporphyrin), phyllocyanic acid (phyllo-
cyanin), and its zinc, copper, and iron compounds, in all of which
he finds a single band corresponding in position with the band in
the haemoglobin derivatives, in the zinc and copper compounds
shifted slightly towards the red end of the spectrum, and he also
finds it indicated in the living leaf, whilst in chrysophyll and
carotin    he observes three    bands    situated between the solar lines
F   and  H   and in identical positions.     By the kind permission of Dr.
                I
E. Schunck have had access to his beautiful collection of chloro
phyll derivatives, and have bpen able to examine spectroscopically
in the pure state solutions of chrysophyll, carotin, chlorophyll, phyll-
oxanthin, phyllocyanin and its zinc and copper compounds, alka-
 chlorophyll, phyllotaonin, ethyl-phyllotaonin, and phylloporphyrin,
 and a specimen of hoematoporphyriu kindly sent me by Dr. L. March-
lewski.      In all there appears a characteristic absorption between
 the solar lines F and M, which confirms the statement of Tschirch
 that the chlorophyll derivatives, like the htemoglobin derivatives,
 give a very characteristic absorption in this region of the spectrum,
and considering the very near relationship which exists between
phylloporphyrin and heamatoporphyrin, is further evidence of the
supposition that there exists something in common to both chloro
phyll and hcemoglobin, the two great colouring matters of biological
importance in the vegetable and animal kingdoms.

              of the Absorption  Spectra of Chlorophyll, §c.         391
    As I have been able to examine many more derivatives than the
 former investigator, and as the results of my observations differ
 from his, inasmuch that I find only some of the derivatives are
 characterised by the single band, whilst in others two are apparent,
 and in chlorophyll itself and chrysophyll three, and also that my
 method of procedure differs from his, it will perhaps be of interest to
 give the results of my experiments as compared with his.
                           Method of Procedure.
    The spectroscope was    a single   prism one of Iceland spar, which
just divided the sodium lines.       The lenses were of quartz, the focal
 length of the collimator lens being 12-5 inches, and that of the
 camera lens 42 inches.     The dark slide which held the plate was
 movable at fixed intervals, so that seven exposures could be taken on
 the one plate. The solutions were examined in a glass cell with
 parallel quartz faces, placed in front of the slit, the whole apparatus
 being set up for me by Mr. A. Hilger, of London.          The source of
 light used was a Welsbach         incandescent mantle of sixty-candle
 power,  no  chimney being   used,  placed 8 inches distant from the slit.
 For reference lines a hydrogen vacuum tube was used, from which
 tbe lines P, S', L, and H' were obtained, and the violet potassium line
 Kp was at the same time thrown in by volatilising a little of the salt
 in a Bansen burner in front of the slit. The plate used was Messrs.
 Cadett and Neal's " lightning," pyrosoda being adopted as the
 developer.    The exposure given in each case was half an hour, which
 was found to be the most advantageous after various trials of different
 times of exposure had been made. Under these conditions the photo
 graphs extended distinctly as far as the solar line Q. On each plate
 a spectrum of the source of light used was thrown in for a compari
son with the light absorbed by the solutions of the different deriva
tives.   In every case the solutions had to be excessively diluted
before the characteristic absorption became apparent on the photo
graphic plate, so dilute that, with the exception of chrysophyll, caro
tin, and chlorophyll, only a faint indication of colour was visible in
the solutions to the eye by transmitted light, and of the bands in the
visible region of the spectrum, only the first, the characteristic one
in the red, was visible, and that in the majority of cases only faint.
In the case of the hydrochloric acid compounds of phylloporphyrin
and hajmatoporpbyrin      one might say the solutions were colourless,
and yet these two derivatives give the single band more pronounced
and better defined than any of the others. As a very slight differ
ence in the strength of the solutions gave an appreciable difference
in the resulting absorption spectra, three solutions of slightly varying
strengths were photographed of each derivative, and the most charac
                                                             2 o 2

 392      Mr. C. A. Schunck.      A Photographic   Investigation
 teristic of each were then selected and photographed together as
 depicted in the plates.     In no case on dilation were any further
 hands observable, and in all I find this particular distinctive absorp
 tion situated between the lines F and L in chrysophyll, carotin, and
 chlorophyll, and in the other derivatives between the lines G and L,
 the mean position of the bands being situated at the Ka line, varying
 sometimes slightly towards red and in others towards the violet.
 The main difference in my procedure to that of Tschirch is that I
 have made use of artificial light in the place of direct sunlight.    By
 this means I have been able to reproduce the bands as regards their
 definition and their relative intensity in a far more distinct manner,
 and though my photos, do not extend so far as his, mine going to Q
 and his to S, yet as the characteristic absorption does not extend
further than M this is not of great consequence.
                  Chlorophyll, Chrysophyll and Carotin.
    The chlorophyll solution was prepared in the usual way. Fresh
leaves   were extracted with boiling alcohol, and the solution filtered
off from the fatty deposit which usually forms on standing.         When
the solution is diluted so that in the normal chlorophyll spectrom of
four bands only the characteristic one in the red is visible when
received by the    spectroscope, and a photograph is now taken, three
bands are found    lying between the lines F and           (Plate 3, figs.
1 and 2).     The  first two bands are the bands usually numbered
5 and 6 of the     normal chlorophyll spectrum, and can be seen on
dilution by the eye when sunlight is used, and the first one, 5, when
artificial light is used. But the third band in the violet, having its
centre situated about the line h, has not,      I believe, been observed
before.    In weaker solutions still, one only gets a general absorption
in the ultra-violet, no further bands being discernible.        As is well
known, chlorophyll solutions prepared from the leaves of different
 plants vary slightly in their absorption spectra, which depends
 upon the amount of acid present in the leaf. In the spectrum of
the purest chlorophyll solutions, the fourth band situated about the
line E is extremely faint ; the purer the solution the fainter it is,
but where the least trace of an acid is present this band appears
darker than the third, situated between the lines D and E, and on
the solutions standing becomes darker still, while the third becomes
fainter, and has moved further away from the red end. If, how
ever, a chlorophyll solution be exposed to the action of direct
sunlight for a few hours until the colour has become brown, or if a
few drops of a strong acid, as hydrochloric, be added, and the solution
be allowed to stand for a few days, a further change in the spectrum
takes place, by the formation of a fifth band situated between the lines

              of the Absorption Spectra of Chlorophyll, §c.                 393
 E and P. According to the investigations of Schunck and March -
lewski,* these changes may be explained by the supposition that
phylloxanthin is formed in the first case, and phyllocyanin in the
second. These changes take place in a greater or less degree in
 every chlorophyll solution on standing, according to the amount and
 strength of acid present originally.
    I have found in all the various chlorophyll solutions 1 have
examined, even in those which from the commencement gave the
fourth band darker than the third, and those in which the same
change had taken place on standing, that no change had taken place
in the violet, the only change being that more and more of the
ultra-violet rays are absorbed. In the purest solution the total
obscuration started at the line N, while in others the total obscura
tion commenced at the line Ha. But in the case of a solution which
had been exposed to the action of direct sunlight and which showed
the fifth band, then the bands in the violet had disappeared alto
gether, leaving only a general absorption in the ultra-violet.               As
 will be seen from Plate 5 (figs. 2 and 3), the second and third of
these violet bands are identical in position with the two bands found
in phylloxanthin, while the first corresponds in position to a new
sixth band I have found to exist in the spectrum of phyllocyanin
when the solution is examined in a more concentrated form than
 usual, and which appears distinct but faint when photographed.
   The chrysophyll was obtained                 by Schunck's       methodf and
examined in an alcoholic              solution ; the carotin crystals      were
obtained from the carrot root by the process of Arnaud, and was
likewise examined in an alcoholic solution.               In each three very
distinct characteristic      bands     were    found,  which    agrees with the
statement of Tschirch, but the bands from my photographs are not
in identical positions, those in the carotin being slightly shifted
towards the violet end.
   Like Tschirch, I find that both these derivatives are very trans
parent to the ultra-violet rays. Prom Plate 3 (figs. 2 and 3) it will be
seen that the three chrysophyll bands occupy intermediate positions
compared to the three chlorophyll bands, which seems to point to the
supposition that chrysophyll does not exist in chlorophyll solutions
as such, but under certain conditions only is formed by decomposi
tion of a derivative,! and then crystallises out, or that if it does
exist in the solutions it must be in a very small quantity, otherwise
the bands would overlap each other, and the result would be a total
obscuration, which I have only found to be the case in a chlorophyll
solution exposed to the action of direct sunlight.

394       Mr. C. A. Schunck.          A   Photographic Investigation
             Phylloxanthin, Phyllocyanin and its          Compounds.
    Phylloxanthin    and phyllocyanin, the two leading chlorophyll
derivatives   obtained by the action of hydrochloric acid (Schunck,
" Contributions to the
                           Chemistry of Chlorophyll ")• give in alcoholic
solutions in the violet region of the spectrum, in the former case two
bands, and in the latter one (Plate 5, figs. 3 and 4). As has already
been pointed out, the two phylloxanthin bands are identical in posi
tion with the second and third of the chlorophyll ones in the violet,
the band in phyllocyanin being moved slightly towards the violet
end, this band being situated between the lines h and H'. In both
cases the solutions have to be exceedingly dilute before the bauds
become visible on the photographic             plate, the only baud remaining
visible to the eye in the visible part of the spectrum being the first,
the characteristic one in the red, and that now only appears faint.
From the investigations of Schunck,t phyllocyanin plays the part of
a weak base, and combines with strong acids, the compounds, how
ever, being unstable and easily decomposed even by water, and, like
other bases, giving definite double compounds of great comparative
stability, into which metals and acids, especially organic acids, enter
as constituents.
    I have examined    the compounds formed by dissolving phyllocyanin
in anhydrous acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and sulphuric acid, and
find a more prononnced band in each than even in the case of an
alcoholic solution of phyllocyanin, but in each compound the band
is shifted slightly towards the red end of the spectrum compared to
the band in phyllocyanin itself (Plate 4, figs. 1, 2, 3, and 4).
    Of the compounds formed by phyllocyanin with metallic salts, the
one with zinc carbonate in alcohol, with zinc acetate in acetic acid,
and the one with cupric acetate in the same solvent were examined.
 In each the characteristic absorption was noticeable in the same
region of the spectrum.         In the zinc carbonate compound two very
 distinct bands were found corresponding very nearly in position with
 the two in phylloxanthin, the shifting being towards the violet end
 (Plate 4, figs. 5 and 6), the zinc acetate compound, on the other hand,
 gave only one band, corresponding in position with the band of the
 anhydrous acetic acid compound of phyllocyanin (Plate 4, fig. 7),
 whilst in the case of the cupric acetate compound two badly defined
 dark bands were apparent, the division between the bands corre
 sponding about to the position of the phyllocyanin band (Plate 4,
 fig. 8). In both these series of compounds, as in the case of phyll
 oxanthin and phyllocyanin, the solutions had to be very dilute before
 the characteristic absorption became apparent on the photographic

plate.      Here the results of my experiments differ from thoso of
Tschirch, who found but one band in the zinc and copper compounds,
but the discrepancy may have arisen from the fact that he does
not state in his memoir what acid was in combination along with
the metal with phyllocyanin.                 That the zinc carbonate compound
of phyllocyanin should give two bands in the violet region corre
sponding very nearly in position and relative intensity with the two
of phylloxanthin, and therefore, with the second and third violet
chlorophyll bands, is interesting from the fact that of all the
chlorophyll derivatives the spectrum of the phyllocyanin zinc car
bonate in the visible region corresponds more closely than any of
the others with that of chlorophyll, and from the deductions arrived
at from this similarity by Schunck* as regards the functions of
chlorophyll as being a carrier of carbonic acid in the plant, just
as haemoglobin serves to convey oxygen in the animal economy.
   Alkachlorophyll,      Phyllotaonin, Ethyl-phyllotaonin, Phylloporphyrin.
    In his " Contributions        to the Chemistry of Chlorophyll" Schunck
has discovered        that by the action of alkalis upon chlorophyll, the
above definite derivatives are produced in a crystalline form.f
Alkachlorophyll, phyllotaonin, and ethyl-phyllotaonin all give the
single band in a pronounced and well-defined manner, corresponding
very nearly in position with the band in phyllocyanin, viz., at
about Kb, in phyllotaonin it being shifted slightly towards the
violet, and in the other two a trifle towards the red end of the
spectrum (Plate 5, figs. 6, 7, and 8).                  Alkachlorophyll also forms
a definite crystallised sodium salt.                In an alcoholic solution the
band appears considerably shifted towards the red, but a watery
solution gives the band much obscured, in the same position as
the one in the alcoholic solution of alkachlorophyll itself (Plate 4,
figs. 9, 10, and 11).
    Phylloporphyrin on the other hand gives a double band, intense and
fairly well defined, the less refrangible one having its centre situated
at the        line (Plate 5, fig. 9). Phylloporphyrin forms a compound
with acids, which has a spectrum in the visible region quite
distinct from the very characteristic one of phylloporphyrin itself,
which consists of seven bands, while the acid compounds only
show three bands. { On examining the hydrochloric acid compound
in the violet region, a corresponding change is also found in the
spectrum, and instead of the double band, a single very intense

 one takes    its  place, situated   between    the other   two   (Plate  5,
 fig. 10).   This band is the most prononnced and the best defined
 one in the whole series, and only becomes visible on the photo
 graphic plate in excessively dilute solutions, so dilute that one
 might say the solution was colourless to the eye when viewed by
transmitted light.
                  Phylloporphyrin and Hcematoporphyrin.
     On comparing      the spectra of phylloporphyrin and haemato-
 porphyrin in this region, and also those of their hydrochloric
 acid compounds (Plate 3, figs. 6, 7, 8, and 9), it was found that
 hsematoporphyrin gave only a single band, but situated in the same
 position as the double one of phylloporphyrin.          On this point the
 results of my experiments differ from those of Tschirch, who, as
 stated above, found in both & singleb&nd occupying the same position.
 In the hydrochloric compounds of haematoporphyrin, however, a
 single band of the same pronounced character as that in phyllopor
 phyrin was found, the one in hssmatoporphyrin, as will be seen from
the figures, being slightly shifted towards the red end of the
 spectrum, which is interesting from the fact that just in the same
way are the bands in the visible region of the spectrum of these
 two compounds shifted, this constituting their only spectroscopic
difference.
    In conclusion,   my thanks are due to Dr. E. Schunck and Dr. L.
 Marchlewski for the valuable assistance they have given me in
 many details in connection with this investigation.
    I hope in a further paper to investigate more particularly the
spectroscopic behaviour in the same region of the spectrum of the
yellow colouring matter accompanying chlorophyll in leaves and
allied colouring matters obtainable from other sources than the leaf,
for instance, carotin.

    In the following paper we propose to describe        a series of photo
graphs which prove the objective reality of difference and summation
tones. The work was suggested to us by Professor Riicker, and we have
used the method of detecting these tones which has been described by
Riicker and Edser in the ' Philosophical Magazine ' for April, 1895.

The resonator they employed was a tuning fork. On to one prong
of the fork was fixed a mirror, which was made one of a system by
which Michelson's interference bands were produced.             To the other
prong was attached a wooden square of larger area, but of the same
weight as the mirror.         The fork was then compared with a Konig
standard fork and its frequency adjusted to 64.              The notes were
produced by       a  Helmholtz    wind   siren  placed   between    a wooden
pyramidal tube and a large Konig resonator tuned to 64. The
narrow end of the pyramid was placed about half an inch from the
wooden square attached to the resonating fork.
   Throughout the experiments we used blue light, obtained by
passing a beam from an electric lamp through a cell containing an
nmmoniacal solution of copper sulphate.             A slit about 2 inches
long and one-twentieth of an inch broad was cut out of a piece of tin
foil pasted on glaES, and was placed horizontally across the middle of
the bands, so that the bright and dark bands appeared as bright and
dark spots respectively.
   In our earlier experiments, we took photographs upon flexible film
fastened by india-rubber bands to a rotating drum.            A ball shutter,
such as is used in instantaneous photography, was employed. Working
at night, after the traffic had subsided, the bands in their normal
condition were perfectly steady. On taking a photograph, each
bright band produced a perfectly straight line upon the rotating film,
and the whole picture was made up of a series of parallel straight
lines.
   On sounding a 64-fork in the vicinity of the apparatus, the
mirror is set in motion by resonance and thus the bands execute
harmonic motions, with a frequency of 64, about their mean positions.
The general appearance as then seen by the eye is a blue blur. When
this blur was photographed by means of the slit and rotating drum,
we obtained a series of sinuous lines.         To prove that the frequency
of these curves corresponded to a note of 64 vibrations per second, we
made observations on the rate of turning of the drum.          The following
are some of the actual figures obtained : —

    We thus obtained     a series of photographs of what may be called
the difference     and summation curves, which were exhibited in a
preliminary communication read by Professor Riicker at the recent
meeting of the British Association held in Toronto.
   The details of the method now employed are different,              and we

 venture to think much better saited for obtaining good photographs,
 though the drum enabled ns to determine the frequency of the
 oscillation more easily.          When the drum was used, it was incon
 venient to take more than one photograph on the same film, and
 moreover, it was impossible to use plates, which in some respects have
 advantages over films.
     Having satisfied oui-selves by means of the drum, that the frequency
 of the curves we obtained corresponded to 64, we had recourse to
 a sliding plate arrangement fitted with an automatic shutter.            The
 sliding piece is capable of carrying 3 feet of plate 2 inches in width,
 and the shutter is so arranged that any 6 inches of the plate can be
 exposed at will. With one filling of the slide, it is therefore possible
 to take six photographs.
     Our first effort was to obtain photographs of the steady bands when
 no sounds were produced.             We have taken many of these, and
 reproduce one of them in (Plate 6) fig. 1.
    Fig. 2 shows a photograph taken when a 64 fork was sounding
 rather loudly.
    Fig.   3   shows an extraneous          disturbance     produced   by the
 slamming     of a door.    It is evident  that  the  vibrations are compound
and, in part at all events, forced.           We then proceeded to obtain
the difference-tone.       The frequencies of the two notes used were 256
and 320, and these were produced as by Riicker and Edser with a
Helmholtz double wind siren.            The 12 row of holes was tuned to a
256-fork, and then to produce the 320-note the 15 row of holes was
opened.
    Fig. 4 shows a photograph taken when the 256-fork was sound
ing, and when the siren was sounding in unison with it, the 12
row of holes being open.         It will be seen that the bands are steady.
There is a slight vibration present, probably due to the disturbance
produced by the blowing of the bellows.
    Fig. 5 shows a photograph taken immediately after the foregoing
one, upon the same plate, and under exactly the same conditions with
the single exception, that the 15 row of holes was opened and the
320-note therefore sounding in conjunction with the 256.                  The
objective reality of the difference-tone           is clearly  proved.   This
experiment has been repeated on several occasions and with different
notes, and we have obtained many photographs demonstrating the
vibratory motion which is given to the bands by the difference-tone.
In all cases, we have proved that the separate notes sounding alone
produced no effect upon the bands.
   Fig. 6 (Plate 7) is another photograph of the effects produced by
a difference-tone.
    It will  be observed in these two photographs, that although the
chief effect is that due to the sounding of a 64-note, there is super

              The Objective Reality   of Combination   Jones.           399
imposed upon this some other disturbance which causes a slight
departure from the perfect regularity of the curves. This disturbing
effect is probably due to the fact, that, as it is difficult to keep the
 pitch of the notes given by the siren absolutely constant, they had
departed somewhat from their proper values at the moment when the
photograph was taken, and thus forced vibrations of a pitch slightly
 different from that of the tuning fork were added to those corresponding
to its natural period.
     Having finished experiments on the difference-tone, we proceeded
to photograph effects produced by the summation tone.              The two  ,
notes used were obtained from the 9 and 12 rows of holes of the
 upper box of the Helmholtz double wind siren.            It is easily seen
that, to give a summation tone of 64, the disc must be revolving
64/(9 + 12) = 3-048 times per second. To obtain this rate of rotation
 we used a stroboscopic method.       On the upper surface of the lower
box of the siren, we affixed a star-like disc with 18 rays, and
viewed it through slits carried by a fork having a frequency of 274.
    When the star appears stationary, the disc is revolving at the
desired rate, for 18 x 3*048 ¦= 27-4 x 2 approximately.
    We have taken photographs of the steady bands when the siren has
been going at the proper speed, and one set of holes open only.       These
are exactly like the steady bands obtained in the former cases.         On
sounding the two notes together the summation tone is produced, and
we have photographed it in the manner already described.           Figs. 7,
8, and 9 show some of the photographs      obtained.
    In fig. 9, where  the amplitude of the vibration of the bands is
large, the plates used were not sufficiently sensitive to photograph
them when moving through their mean positions.          When the bands
are in their extreme position and therefore at rest, the exposure is
inversely proportional to the velocity of the plate. But when the
bands are passing through their mean position, the exposure is
inversely proportional to the velocity found by compounding the
velocity of the plate with the velocity of the bands in a direction at
light angles. If the amplitude is large enough, this velocity may be
so great as to render the time of exposure too small to affect the plate.
This phenomenon is slightly noticeable in fig. 5, and is very well
marked in figs. 8 and 9.
    In conclusion, we wish to thank Mr. Cameron for assisting us
in taking some of the later photographs, and Mr. Chapman for the
help he has given us in preparing the lantern slides and prints.

                                 (Abstract.)
   This paper gives a fairly complete account of the minute cytological
details of the act of fertilisation and of the processes surrounding it.
from the formation of the ventral canal cell up to the period of cell-
wall formation at the base of the      egg.
   As the oosphere nucleus, after separation        of the nucleus of    the
ventral canal cell, moves rapidly back towards the centre of the eeg,
it increases greatly in size, as described by Strasburger.             This
increase in size is shown to be due to the appearance in the nucleus
of a peculiar metaplasmic substance, which fills up the nucleus, and.
owing to its attraction for stains, ultimately obscures the chromatin.
The mature female nucleus, which is sometimes large enough to be
visible to the naked eye, exhibits merely an uniformly staining reticu
lum composed chiefly of metaplasmic substance, with one or more
nucleoli.
   By the rupture of the closing membrane of the well-marked pit
at the apex of the pollen tube, almost the whole of the contents oi
the lower part of the tube pass over into the oosphere.             At this
stage all the four nuclei, together with a considerable number of
starch grains from the pollen tube, are to be seen lying in the cyto
plasm of the egg.        Cyloplasm from the pollen tube must also
necessarily pass over, and with it the plastid-likc structures to be
Been earlier in the cytoplasm of the generative cells.
    The behaviour of the four nuclei in the egg was carefully followed;
the stalk cell nucleus, the pollen tube nncleus, and one generative
nucleus remain at the apex of the egg, near the point of entry, and
ultimately become disorganised.           The other generative     nucleus,
 which possesses distinct nucleoli, as does also its sister        nucleus,
 advances very rapidly towards the female nucleus, increasing some
what in size and in mass of staining material on its way.             After
coming iu contact with the much larger female nucleus it gradually
penetrates the substance of the latter until it is almost completely
enclosed within it, but breaking down of the nuclear walls, that is.
 actual fusion, is for some time delayed.          After fusion has taken
 place, but while the outlines      of  the  two nuclei are still distinct
 the chromosomes can be distinguished as two separate groups derived

      Experiments on Aneroid Barometers and their Discussion.             401
from the male and female nuclei respectively.             Indications of the
first segmentation spindle are also to be observed at this stage as
fine staining threads running throughout both nuclei.             No definite
resting fertilised nucleus is formed.
     The spindle, which lies obliquely in the centre of the egg, is at
first multipolar in form, and while it is in this condition the chromo
 somes begin to split longitudinally, but can still be distinguished
 roughly into two groups.
     Only after the formation of four segmentation nuclei do these
 begin to wander down to the base of the egg.              On its way down
 each nucleus has a distinct sheath of cytoplasmic fibres, but when it
 reaches the base these become replaced by fine cytoplasmic threads,
 which run from the nucleus out into the general cytoplasm.             These
 later-formed cytoplasmic threads seem to be connected with the for
 mation of cell walls around the nuclei.
     The number of chromosomes in the egg nucleus was determined
 by counting them in the division which cuts off the ventral canal
 cell, and was found to be twelve.       The same number was also to be
 found in the nuclei of the cells of the prothallial tissue and of the
 pollen mother cells. The chromosomes of the first segmentation
 spindle, on the one occasion on which they could be counted, were
 exactly twenty-four in number.         The chromosomes were also counted
 in several types of sporophytic tissue ; at least twenty-one chromo
 somes could always be observed ; presumably twenty-four are always
 present.
     No centro&pheres or centrosomes were to be seen in connection
  either with fertilisation or with any of the related processes.
 " Experiments       on Aneroid Barometers at Kew Observatory

        Superintendent.     Received May 5, — Read June 9, 1898.
  (Communicated by the Author at the request of the Kew Observatory Committee.)
                                  (Abstract.)
     The paper deals with two species of data.           The first consists of
  particulars derived from the records at Kew Observatory as to
  the errors observed in about 300 aneroid barometers.        These had been
  subjected to the ordinary Kew test, which consists in lowering the
  pressure to which the aneroid is exposed inch by inch to the lowest
  point at which verification is desired, and raising the pressure in a
  corresponding way to its original value.           Headings are taken at
  each inch of pressure during both the fall and the recovery, and a
  table of corrections is obtained by reference to the corresponding
   readings of a mercury gauge.

  402     Experiments on Aneroid Barometers       and their Discussion.
     The second group of data are the results of special experiments
  made at Kew Observatory during the last three years.           These were
  intended to link together the phenomena exhibited in the Kew
  verifications, and to further investigate various points bearing on the
  usefulness of the certificate hitherto issued to aneroids.
     The aneroid is an instrument exhibiting elastic after-effect, fre
 quently in a conspicuous way.          When pressure is lowered and then
 maintained constant, the aneroid's reading continues to fall, and when
 pressure is restored to its original value, the aneroid reads at first
 lower than it did originally, but exhibits a gradual tendency to recover.
  These general facts have of course been long known.             The most
  characteristic   features were in fact discussed 30 years ago by
  Dr. Balfour Stewart, then superintendent of Kew Observatory, who
 dealt with a considerable mass of experimental material.         They have
 also been the subject of a comparatively recent pamphlet by Mr.
 Edward Wbymper, who gives the results of a number of interesting
 long period experiments.
     The present paper is partly experimental and partly theoretical.
 It treats of how the differences between the readings with pressure
 descending and ascending in a normal pressure cycle, such as the
 Kew test, vary throughout the range, and how the sum of these
 differences varies from one range to another.         It investigates how
 the error, as pressure is reduced, varies with the rate of fall of pressure
 (when uniform), how the fall of reading at a low stationary pressure
 increases with the time, depends on the pressure, and varies with the
rate of the previous fall of pressure, and how the recovery after a
pressure cycle progresses with the time, and is modified by the nature
of the previous pressure changes.            The influence of subsidiary
stoppages during      the   fall or rise of pressure  is investigated, and
experiments are discussed showing the influence of temperature on the
various phenomena.
    Some of the aneroids employed for the special experiments having
been under observation for nearly three years, the opportunity is
taken of considering the secular change of zero, and also changes in
the elastic and the after-effect properties.
    Algebraic and exponential formula? are obtained by trial for such
phenomena as the variation of the differences of the descending and
ascending readings throughout a pressure cycle, the dependence of
the sum of such differences on the range, the fall of reading at the
lowest pressure and the final recovery.         A theory, to some extent
empirical, is built up, leading to mathematical results, depending on
only three arbitrary constants, for the behaviour of an aneroid in the
ordinary Kew test over any range. One of these constants varies
with the aneroid, but is determined by the observed value of such a
quantity as the sum of the differences of the descending and ascending

    On the  Heat dissipated by Platinum at High Temperatures.           403
readings over any convenient range. The other two constants depend
on the length of the stoppage at the lowest point of the range, and the
relation between the rates of the lowering and the recovery of pressure.
The results calculated in this way show a very satisfactory agreement
with the Kew verifications.
   The investigation being principally intended to increase the useful
ness of the existing Kew test, and to show where it is most in need
 of amplification or amendment, attention is primarily given to the
defects of aneroids.      It is hoped that the increased knowledge of these
 defects will enable rules to be framed for the rejection of aneroids, and
that in this way it will be made worth while for makers to improve
the instrument.       The large differences brought to light between
different aneroids, show that the means of markedly raising the average
are already at the makers' disposal if they choose to utilise their
knowledge.       The present enquiry also shows clearly how the effects
of tentative improvements may best be ascertained. The method of
 utilising aneroids to the best advantage in determining mountain
heights is not formally considered, but a variety of the results should
nevertheless be found of immediate service by any traveller of intel
ligence who has this object in view.

    The first part of the paper refers to the emissivity of a bright
plat inum surface in air and in other gases.
    The temperature measurements are based on the researches of
Callendar and Griffiths, confirmed by the recent determinations of
Heycock and Neville. To check the calibration of the thermometers
at higher temperatures, the melting point of palladium was used. A
number of the curves are extended to 1779° C. by a direct measure
ment of the emissivity of platinum and palladium at their melting
points.
    The platinum wire, which served at the same time as radiator and
thermometer, was 0'112 cm. in diameter.             It was placed in the axis
of a vertical glass cylinder, which formed the enclosure.
    The effects produced by a change in the size, shape, material, and
temperatnre of the enclosure and in the position and diameter of the
¦wire   are also studied.
    The temperature is expressed in degrees centigrade, and the emis
sivity in C.G.S. units.

                 On a new Constituent     of Atmospheric Air.            405
   An abstract of the values obtained is given in the table (p. 404).
    Part  II consists of a bolometric study of the radiation emitted by-
platinum at temperatures ranging from 500° C. to the melting point
of the metal.       It is shown that for theoretical reasons the true rate
of change of the total radiation with temperature lies between the
values obtained by measuring the heat lost by the radiating body
and those deduced from the readings of any form of bolometer or
thermopile.
   By comparing        the  observations   of Dr. J. T. Bottomley and
 Schleiermacher, based on the first method, with those of F. Paschen
and of the author, made by the second method, a reliable criterion
is obtained by which to test any formula intended to express the law
of thermal radiation.
   The formula? of Dulong and Petit, of Stefan, and of Rosetti fail
when tested in this manner ; whilst Weber's formula, from 400° to
800° C, gives results in close agreement with the true rate of
change of total radiation with regard to temperature.
   The second part of the paper also contains a description of some
points of interest in the design of the bolometer which was used
during this work.
   Part  III  refers to the variation of the intrinsic brilliancy of plati
num    surface  with temperature.
   The results may be expressed by the following formula : —
                            (f-400) =    889-6 *yb,
where t is the temperature in degrees centigrade, and 6 the intrinsic
brilliancy in candlo power per squaro centimetre.          The constant 400
is taken as the temperature      limit  at which  the visible radiation falls
to zero.

   This preliminary note is intended to give a very brief account
of experiments which have been carried out during the past year
                                                                 and argon,

with water is pure has already been proved by the fact that Lord
Rayleigh found that the nitrogen obtained from it had the normal
density. The magnesia, resulting from the nitride, yields only a trace
of soluble matter to water, and that consists wholly of hydroxide and
carbonate.    So far, then, the results have been negative.
   Recently, however, owing to the kindness of Dr. W. Hampson, we
have been furnished with about 750 cubic centimetres of liquid air,
and, on allowing all but 10 cubic centimetres to evaporate away
slowly, and collecting the gas from that small residue in a gas
holder, we obtained, after removal     of oxygen with metallic copper,
and nitrogen with a mixture of pure lime and magnesium dust, fol
lowed by exposure to electric sparks in presence of oxygen and
caustic soda, 2G'2 cubic centimetres of a gas, showing the argon
spectrum feebly, and, in addition, a spectrum which has, we believe,
not been seen before.
   We have not yet succeeded in disentangling the new spectrum
completely from the argon spectrum, but it is characterised by two
very brilliant lines, one almost identical in position with D3, and
almost rivalling it in brilliancy.    Measurements made by Mr. E. C.
C. Baly, with a grating of 14,438 lines to the inch, gave the following
numbers, all four lines being in the field at once : —
                            D,            5895-0

                            D4            5807-7
   There is also a green line, comparable with the green helium line
in intensity, of wave-length 5508 8, and a somewhat weaker green,
the wave-length of which is 55000.
   In order to determine as far as possible which lines belong to
the argon spectrum, and which to the new gas, both spectra were
 examined at the same time with the grating, the first order being
employed.      The lines which were absent, or very feeble, in argon,
 have been ascribed to the new gas.      Owing to their feeble intensity,
the   measurements of the wave-lengths which follow must not be
credited with the same degree of accuracy as the three already given,
 but the first three digits may be taken as substantially correct :.—

    Mr. Baly has kiudly undertaken to make a study of the spectrum,
which will be published when complete. The figures already given,
however, suffico to characterise the gas as a new one.
   The approximate density of the gas was determined by weighing
it in a bulb of 32*321 cubic centimetres capacity, under a pressure of
521-85 millimetres, and at a temperature of 15-95°.                 The weight of
this quantity was 0 04213 gram. This implies a density of 22p47,
that of oxygen being taken as 16. A second determination, after
sparking for four hours with oxygen in presence of soda, was made in
the same bulb; the pressure was 523'7 millimetres, and the tempera
ture was 16-45°.       The weight was 0-04228 gram, which implies the
density 22 51.
   The wave-length of sound , was determined in the gas by the
                                         "
method described in the " Argon            paper.   The data are : —

it is  seen that,  like argon and helium, the new gas is monatomic and
therefore an element.
    From what       has  preceded,     it may   be  concluded      that the atmo
sphere contains a hitherto undiscovered gas with a characteristic
spectrum, heavier than argon, and less volatile than nitrogen, oxygen,
and argon ; the ratio of its specific heats would lead to the inference
that it is monatomic, and therefore an element.                 If this conclusion
turns out to be well substantiated, we propose to call it " krypton,"
or " hidden." Its symbol would then be Kr.
    It is, of course, impossible to state positively what position in the
periodic table this new constituent of our atmosphere will occupy.
The number 22 51 must be taken as a minimum density.                      If we may
hazard a conjecture, it is that krypton will turn out to have the
 density 40, with a corresponding atomic weight 80, and will be found
 to belong to tha helium series, as is, indeed, rendered probable by
its withstanding the action of red-hot magnesium and calcium on
 the one hand, and on the other of oxygen in presence of caustic
soda, nnder the influence of electric sparks.               Wo shall procure a
larger supply of the gas, and endeavour to separate it more com
pletely from argon by fractional distillation.
    It may be remarked in passing that Messrs. Kayser and Fried-
 lander, who supposed that they had observed D3 in the argon of the

408            1   Sir W. Crookes.     On the Position          of Helium,
atmosphere, have probably been misled by the close proximity of the
brilliant yellow line of krypton to the helium line.
   On the assumption of the truth of Dr. Johnstone Stoney's hypo
thesis that gases of a higher density than ammonia will be fonnd in
our atmosphere, it is by no means improbable that a gas lighter than
nitrogen will also        be found   in air. We have already spent several
months in preparation for a          search for   and will be able to state
                                                      it,
ere long whether the supposition           is     well founded.
" On the Position of Helium, Argon, and Krypton in the
    Scheme of Elements."   By Sir William Crookes, F.R.S.
    Received and Read June   1898.           9,
  It has been found difficult to give the elements argon and helium
(and   Ithink the same difficulty will exist in respect to the gas
krypton) their proper place in the scheme of arrangement of the
elements    which we owe to the ingenuity and scientific acumen
of Newlands, Mendeleef and others.        Some years ago, carrying                        a
little further Professor Emerson Reynold's idea of representing the
scheme of elements by a zigzag line,    thought of projecting a scheme
                                               I
in three dimensional space, and exhibited at one of the meetings of
the Chemical Society* a model illustrating my views.        Since that
time,  I have re-arranged the positions then assigned to some of the
less known elements in accordance with later atomic weight deter
minations, and thereby made the curve more symmetrical.
   Many of the elemental facts can be well explained by supposing the
space projection of the scheme of elements to be   spiral. This curve
                                                                 a
is,                       inasmuch as the curve has to pass through
      however, inadmissible,
a point neutral as to electricity and chemical energy twice in each
cycle. We must therefore adopt some other figure. A figure-of-eight
will foreshorten into zigzag as well as spiral, and
                            a                         a  fulfils every     it
condition of the problem.    Such figure will result from three very
                                             a
simple simultaneous    motions.    First, an oscillation to and fro
(suppose east and west)   secondly, an oscillation at right angles to
                                ;
the former (suppose north and south), and thirdly, a motion at right
angles to these two (suppose downwards), which, in      simplest          it          form,
would be with unvarying velocity.
I    take any arbitrary and convenient figure-of-eight, without                       refer
ence to its exact nature     divide each of the loops into eight
                                ;I                                                     equal
parts, and then drop from these points ordinates corresponding                        to the
atomic weights of the first cycle of elements.                  I    have here    a model
representing         this figure projected        in space  ;   in   it   the elements are

      The bracketed spaces between cerium and tantalum are probably
occupied      by elements of the didymium and erbium groups.                          Their
chemical properties are not known with sufficient accuracy to enable
their positions to be well defined. They all give coloured absorption
spectra and have atomic weights between these limits. Positions
 marked by a dash (— ) are waiting for future discoverers to fill up.
     Let me suppose that at the birth of the elements, as we now know
them, the action of the vis generatrix might be diagrammatically
represented by a journey to and fro in cycles along a figure-of-eight

410     Position of Helium, Argon, and Krypton in       the Element*.
path, while simultaneously time is flowing on, and some c-ircnmstanre
by which the element-forming cause is conditioned (e.g., temperature)
is declining; (variations which I have endeavoured to represent by
the downward slope.)     The result of the first cycle may be represented
in the diagram by supposing that the unknown formative cause has
scattered along its journey the groupings now called hydrogen, lithium,
glucinum, boron, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, sodium, mag
nesium, aluminium, silicon, phorphorus, sulphur, and chlorine.          But
the swing of the pendulum is not arrested at the end of the first round.
It still proceeds on its journey, and had the conditions remained
constant, the next elementary grouping generated won Id again be
lithium, and the original cycle would eternally reappear, producing
again and again the same fourteen elements.         But the conditions are
not quite the same.     Those represented by the two mutually rectan
gular horizontal components of the motion (say chemical and electrical
energy) are not materially modified; that to which the vertical com
ponent corresponds has lessened, and so, instead of lithium being
repeated by lithium, the groupings which form the commencement of
the second cycle, are not lithium, but its lineal descendant, potassium.
   It is seen that each coil of the lemniscate track crosses the nentral
line at lower and lower points.     This line is neutral as to electricity,
and neutral as to chemical action.        Electro-positive elements are
generated on the northerly or retreating half of the swing, and
electro-negative   elements on the southerly or approaching half.
Chemical atomicity is governed by distance from the central point of
neutrality ; monatomic elements being one remove from it, diatomic
elements two removes, and so on. Paramagnetic elements congregate
to the loft of the neutral line, and diamagnetic elements to the right.
With few exceptions, all the most metallic elements lie on the north.
   Till recently chemists knew no clement which had not more or less
marked chemical properties, but now by the researches of Lord
Raylcigh and Frofessor Ramsay, we are brought face to face with a
group of bodies with apparently no chemical properties, forming
an exception to the other chemical elements.         I venture to suggest
that these elements, helium, argon, and krypton in this scheme
naturally fall into their places as they stand on the neutral line.
Helium, with an atomic weight of 4, fits into the neutral position
between hydrogen and lithium.         Argon, with an atomic weight of
about 40, as naturally falls into the neutral position between chlorine
and potassium.     While krypton with an atomic weight of about 80,
will find a place between bromine and rubidium.
    See how well the analogous elements follow ono another in order :
C, Ti, and Zr ; N and V ; Gl, Ca, Sr, and Ba ; Li, K, Rb, and Cs ; CI,
 Br and I ; S, Se, and Te; Mg, Zn, Cd, and Hg; P, As, Sb, and Bi;
 Al, Ga, In, and Tl. The symmetry of these series shows that we are

     Position   of Helium,   A rgon, and Krypton in the Elements.      41 1
 on   the  right track. It also shows how many missing elements are
waiting   for  discovery, and it would not now be impossible to emulate
the brilliant feat of Mcndeleef in the celebrated cases of Eka-silicon
and Eka-aluminium.        Along the neutral line alone are places for many
more bodies, which     will probably increase in density and atomic weight
until we come to inert bodies in the solid form.
   Four groups are seen under one another, each consisting of closely
allied elements which Professor Mendeleef has relegated to his 8th
family. They congregate round the atomic weight 57, manganese,
iron, nickel and cobalt; round the atomic weight 103, ruthenium,
rhodium, and palladium ; while lower down round atomic weight 195
are congregated osmium, iridium and platinum.            These groups are
interperiodic because their atomic weights exclude them from the
small periods into which the other elements fall ; and because their
chemical relations with some members of the neighbouring groups
show that they are interperiodic in the sense of being formed in
transition stages.

    Since   the above was written, Professor Ramsay and Mr. Travers
have discovered two other inert gases accompanying argon in the
atmosphere.       These are called Neon and Metargon.      From data sup
plied me by Professor Ramsay, it is probable that neon has an atomic
weight of about      22, which would     bring it into the neutral position
 between fluorine and sodium.         Metargon is said to have an atomic
 weight of about 40 ; if so, it shares the third neutral position with
 argon. 1 have marked          the positions of these new elements on the

                                      (Abstract.)
    The method described depends on the fact that in adult leaves
transpiration is stomatal rather than cuticular, so that, other things
 being equal, the yield of watery vapour depends on the degree to
which the stomata are open, and may be used as an index of their
condition. In principle, it is the same as the methods of Merget* and
Stahl.f         These observers used hygroscopic papers impregnated with
reagents which change colour according as they are dry or damp, and
Stahl, who employed paper soaked in cobalt chloride, has obtained
excellent results. In my laboratory I have used, for some years, a
hygroscope for demonstrating stomatal transpiration, in which evapo
ration is indicated by the untwisting of the awn of Stipa pennata ;J
my present instrument is of the same general type, but the index is
             "
made of chinese leaf," i.e., shavings of pressed and heated horn.§              If a
strip of horn is placed on a dry substance, e.g., the astomatal surface of
a leaf, it does not move, but on the stomatal surface, it instantly curves
strongly away from the transpiring surface. In the hygroscope the

degree of curvature is read off on a graduated quadrant, and in this
way a numerical indication of the condition of the stomata is obtained.
    The    instrument makes           no claim to accuracy, but has proved
extremely      useful    when    used   comparatively to indicate and localise
small changes in the transpiration of leaves, and therefore by impli
 cation, changes in the condition of the stomata.                By observing under
 the microscope the uninjured leaf of Caltha palustris, and comparing
 the variations in the size of the stomata with the variations in
 the readings of the hygroscope, it is easy to convince one's self of the
 value oE the method.          It must be especially noted that though a fall
in the hygroscope readings corresponds with a narrowing of the
 stomatal opening, it does not follow that zero on the hygroscopic
scale means absolute closure of the stomata.                 This want of sensitive
 ness has one advantage, namely,            that cuticular transpiration has no
 effect on the horn index, so that any movement of .the index must
 depend on a stomatal transpiration.              The hygroscope indicates well
 the gradual     "  closure  "*   of the stomata that occurs as a plucked leaf
withers. It is generally stated that marsh and aquatic plants do not
close their stomata under these circumstances.                  I find that, although
the phenomenon is much less marked than in terrestrial plants, yet
 that, in many species, partial closure of the stomata undoubtedly
occurs in the aquatic class.
    The most interesting fact observed in withering leaves is that in
 many cases the
                       " closure " of the stoma is
                                                           preceded by temporary
opening, which may occur almost simultaneously with the severance
of the leaf from the plant. Thus the hygroscope readings rise at
first, and subsequently sink to zero. The interest of this fact is the
demonstration of the interaction between the guard cells and the
 surrounding epidermis.           The phenomenon is best seen in plants with
milky juice, but is not confined to this class. The preliminary-
opening of        le stomata occurs in the early morning, but not in the
 evening   —  a fact which is of importance in relation to the mechanism
of the nocturnal closure of the stomata.
    A diminution of the stomatal transpiration can also be brought
about by compressing the stem of the plant in a vice, a process which
is known to diminish the water supply.f The stomatal closure is here
probably an adaptive response to the lowering of the water-supplv
of the leaf, but this is not quite certain.
    A series of experiments were made on the comparative effect of
                                                                                      "
moist and dry air, from which it is clear that the stomata " close
before any visible signs of flaccidity occur in the leaf.                When leaves

are exposed to air dried by HaSOj, closure is preceded by a remark-
   * I use the word " closure " to mean such a narrowing of the stomatal       aperture
as corresponds   with zero on the hygroscope.

ably prolonged opening of the stomata — a phenomenon which requires
further investigation.
     Baranetzky* showed that slight degrees of disturbance affect
transpiration.     The hygroscope gives no evidence of increased tran
spiration   when  the disturbance is slight. When the plant is violently
shaken the leaves become flaccid and the stomata " close," and in
some cases the closure is preceded by increased transpiration, no
doubt due to temporary opening of the stomata, induced by the
guard cells being released from epidermal pressure before they have
lost their own turgor.
     N. J. C. Mullerf showed that stomata may be closed by electric
stimulation ; my experiments show that while a strong shock narrows
the stomata, a weaker one opens them, no doubt owing to the tem
porary loss of epidermal pressure.
     Some experiments on poisonous gases and vapours were made.
 Chloroform and ether slowly " close " the stomata, which finally
 reopen in a normal atmosphere.            Pure CO» also slowly closes the
 stomata.
     The hygroscope is well fitted to demonstrate the fundamental facts
 in relation to light. The fact that the stomata are widely open in
 sunshine    is well known     ;  the difference between bright and less
 bright diffused    light is     not so well known, nor the fact that in
 dark stormy weather the stomata may be nearly closed by day, even
 in summer. The effect of difference of illumination is well shown
 in certain leaves having stomata in both surfaces, e.g., Iris, Narcissus,
 and the phyllodes of Acacia cyclopis. In these the stomata on the
 illuminated surfaces are much wider open than on the less brightly
 illuminated sides ; and when the plant is reversed in position in
 regard to light, the stomata rapidly accommodate themselves to the
 change in illumination.
     The most interesting fact in regard to tho effect of artificial
 darkness is that it is more effectual in producing closure in the after
noon than in the morning ; and, conversely, illumination opens
closed stomata more readily in the morning than later in the day.
 These, together with other observations, tend to show a certain
 amount of inherent periodicity in the nocturnal closure of the
 stomata.     Another fact of interest is that in darkness prolonged for
 several days the stomata gradually open. This last observation is
 used in the section on the mechanism of the stoma as an argument
 against the prevalent view that the stoma closes in darkness, because
 in the abeyance of assimilation the osmotic material, on which the
 turgor of the guard cells depends,       ceases to be manufactured.

416                         Observations on Stomata.
   Schellenberger*       has striven to uphold this view by showing that
in the   absence of COj the stomata close as thoagh they ¦were in
darkness.     My experiments on plants deprived of C02 lead to abso
lutely contrary results, namely, that the stomata remain perfectly
open even during prolonged deprivation of C02.
   It is a vexed questionf whether or no the majority of plants
close their stomata at night. My conclusion is that in terrestrial
plants (excluding nyctitropic plants) a great majority show some
closure at night ; the horn hygroscope stands at zero on the stomatal
surface of by far the greater number of ordinary plants.                 On the
other hand, the hygroscope shows widely open stomata on most
aquatic plants at night.           StahlJ concludes that nyctitropic plants
are remarkable for not closing the stomata at night ; this fact                I
somewhat doubtfully confirm ; but the question is not so simple as it
seems, owing to the varying behaviour of the stomata at night in
different temperatures.
   Since the hygroscope gives numerical readings, it is possible to
represent graphically the daily opening and closing of the stomata.
The curve begins to leave the zero with the morning light ; it rises
rapidly at first, and afterwards more slowly.            In some cases it runs
roughly horizontally until a rapid fall begins in the evening.                In
other cases there is a slow rise up to the highest point, which occurs
between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m.           The hygroscope generally sinks to zero
within an hour after sunset.
   The effect of heat has not been fully studied, but enough has been
done to confirm previous observers who find that heat opens the
stomata.     As regards the visible spectrum, I find that the red rays
are decidedly most efficient, but I am not able to find any evidence
of a secondary maximum in the blue, such as Kohl§ describes.
   The biology of the nocturnal closure is a subject which can
hardly be discussed in a condensed manner.               It is suggested that
 the gaseous interchange of assimilation may require widely open
stomata, whereas respiration may be carried on with comparatively
closed apertures.       If this is so, the stomata might be to a great extent
 shut at night, and an economy in the use of water effected, without
 detriment to metabolism.            Observations  are given to show that
quite another effect is brought about by nocturnal closure.              As long
as the stomata are open, the transpiring leaf is considerably cooler
than the dry-bulb thermometer, but at night it has almost the tem
perature of the air.         In this way a saving of heat is undoubtedly
effected — but it is not easy to say whether it is sufficient to be of much

heat mnst be valuable, by preventing the checking of translocation
¦which he observed on cold nights.
    The mechanism of the stoma is another subject which does not
lend itself to condensed treatment.            I have tried to point out that
¦the stoma has been neglected in the modern reorganisation           of plant
physiology from the point of view of irritability.           Some observers
insist on the preponderant influence of the guard cells, while Leitgeb
in the same way exaggerated the importance of epidermic pressure,
¦whereas the two factors should, as far as possible, be considered as
parts of a whole and as correlated rather than opposed in action.           1
 have also attempted to show how the stoma, like other parts of the
 plant, may be supposed to react adaptively to those signals, which we
 usually call stimuli. The attempt which I have made to rank the
 problem among the phenomena of irritability, is very tentative in

     1. The object of this memoir is to illustrate the general theory by
 •which we may reconstruct     from the knowledge of one organ in a fossil
  or prehistoric race, the dimensions of other organs, when the correla
  tion between organs in existing races of the same species has been
  ascertained.    The particular illustration chosen is the reconstruction
  of probable stature from a measurement of the long bones.
     Up till quite recently this subject remained in great obscurity,
  partly on account of absence of theory, and partly for want of trust
  worthy data.
     2. The estimated statures as obtained by Orfila, Topinard or Beddoe,
  or by use of their methods, differ widely, and those methods have
  no satisfactory theoretical basis. It was usual to suppose that there
  was some mean or average ratio of stature to long bone, and even
  when it was recognised that this ratio varied with the length of the
  long bone, it was thought sufficient to determine it for two or three
  separate ranges of stature, and determine its mean value for these
  ranges by a very limited number of cases.

   3.   The first stage  in advance was taken when Rollet published his
measurements made in the Anatomical Theatre at Lyons, of the
stature and long bones of 100 corpses. Rollet's attempt to establish
ratios on the basis of his measurements is not very satisfactory, but
to him belongs the credit of having first provided a respectable, if not
large amount of data.            Rollet's work was followed by a very able
memoir on the reconstruction of stature by Manouvrier.               Rejecting
about one half Rollet's data, he constructed tables giving the average
stature for certain ranges of each of the six long bones, and farther
what he terms coefficients moyens ultim.es, for ascertaining the stature
corresponding to long bones lying outside the limits of his tableau
barime.     There are many traces in Manouvrier's paper of the old view
       "            "
of a coefficient by which the long bone must be multiplied in order
to obtain the stature.       Beyond this view, it cannot be said to contain
any theory, and it suffers from certain marked defects.                 In the
first place, proper allowance does not seem to be made for cartilage
and the disappearance of animal mntter from the bones.              The 2 mm.
allowed on each bone appear by no means sufficient.              In the second
place,   Manouvrier     does   not  seem   to me  to justify his  extension of
results obtained from the French to very divergent races. He merely
remarks that individual variations are greater than ethnic. Even if this
extension be made, it must be done with hesitation, and with a full
recognition of the assumptions made.            Lastly, we may note that the
statures   obtained   from   the different  long bones by Manouvrier's table
for particular races, are often rather widely divergent among them
selves, and no attempt is made to account for this divergence.
    4. Manouvrier's memoir was rapidly followed by an excellent piece
of work from Rahon, who collected measurements of the long bones of
a very wide series of local races of man, and reconstructed               their
stature by aid of Manouvrier's tables.            This memoir will remain of
first-class importance even if better reconstruction formulas than those
of Manouvrier are adopted. Manouvrier's tables have been used in
recent German memoirs, as those of Nitsche and Kollmann on the
skeletons of the Row Graves and of the Schweizersbild.                They are
accepted at present as the standard tables for the reconstruction
of stature.
    5.  The present memoir starts with the theory of probability, which
the author has already applied to other problems in evolution,
and deduces the most probable stature for any combination of the four
long bones. It is shown that for a population with normal correlation,
the relation between stature and one or more long bones is always
linear.    A general theorem is proved to show that no linear function
of the long bones can give the probable stature with so small
a probable error as the regression formula of the theory of probability.
From this result the following conclusions are obtained :

        Mathematical Contributions    to the Theory of Evolution.     419
    (o) No constancy of the ratio stature to long bone is theoretically
 to be expected, but the ratio of deviation from mean stature to
 deviation from mean long bone, i.e., the regression coefficient is the
 quantity, the constancy of which might be expected.
    (6) No method of predicting individual stature from the indi
 vidual long bones, whether one or all are used, can give a result
 with a less probable error than 2 cm.
    (c) For the same length of femur, tibia, and humerus, the stature
is shorter the longer the radius. This result has considerable bear
 ing on the relationship of man to the anthropomorphous apes.
    6. Formulae are then obtained for the reconstruction of probable
stature as measured :
    (a) On corpse, from the lengths of the long bones containing
animal matter, and with the cartilages attached. These will possibly
be of service for purposes of criminal investigation.
    (b) In life, from the lengths of the long bones without cartilages,
and free of all animal matter.
    Corrections are given for cases in which the femur is measnred in
the oblique position ; the tibia is measured with the spine ; and the
left, instead of the right, hand members are known.
   7. While the formula? are tested on twenty cases, taken at random
from Rollet's data, with fairly satisfactory results, the step from
variation within the local race to racial variations is not made without
a consideration of the circumstances under which natural selection
 will modify a regression formula. It is pointed out that the diver
gence between such regression formula really enables us to predict
to some extent the nature of the differential selection which has
taken place between two local races. To test how far we may safely
                                    '
apply our formula? to other than French measurements, the stature
of the Ainos ^ and ? is reconstructed by means of them from
 Koganei's measurements of the long bones, and the result is found
to be very satisfactory.      If French regression formula? give good
results for the Aino, they will give, in all probability, good results
for prehistoric European races. At the same time it is most import
ant that material should be obtained for an independent investiga
tion of the regression formula? for another European race. With
a view of illustrating the change in the regression formula? owing to
selection, the anthropomorphous apes are considered, and it is shown
that the gorilla, in the regression formula for femur and tibia
stands much closer to man than either the chimpanzee or orang.
   8. The formula? are applied to reconstruct the stature of Palaeolithic
man, Neolithic man in France and Britain, of the Dolmen-builders
and Guanches, of Round Barrow British, and Row Grave Germans,
of Romano-British and Romano-Gauls, of A.uglo-Saxons, Franks,
mediaeval French, and of the Naqada race discovered by Professor

420                 Drs. U.  J. Martin and T. Cherry.
Petrie, and measured by Mr. Warren. The modern populations
occupying the same districts of Europe as Paleolithic and Neolithic
man appear to be taller, but in the case of both south Germany and
Prance there appears to be a slight, but sensible, decrease of stature
since prehistoric times.        Modern English do not seem to have
decreased in stature since the ancient Anglo-Saxons.            In the esti
mates of stature for the above races, the author differs, in some
cases very considerably, from previous writers.
    9. Beyond    the range of normal population (say from 157 to
175 cm. for      J),  the line of regression ceases to be linear.         An
attempt is made, such as existing data      will  allow of,  to  express the
line of regression by the equation to a curve. The constants of this
ourve are determined for measurements of the four chief long bones,
and the results exhibited in a diagram, from which it is possible to
deduce the probable stature corresponding to a given length of any
long bone by inspection.        The prediction of the stature of dwarfs
from the curve obtained from the data of giants shows only 2-25 cm.
 mean error, and must be considered satisfactory.            Application is
 then made of the results to reconstruct the stature of Bushmen,
 Andamancse, and Akkas.          These give sufficiently good results to
 lead us to believe that a fair estimate can be made of the stature of
 European neolithic dwarfs.
     The memoir concludes with a table of reconstructed         statures and
 sexual ratios.

     In the '

 versy on this subject between Behring and Buchner.                 Behring
 maintained that the antagonism was of a chemical nature, and that
 the antitoxin neutralised the toxin much as an alkali neutralised an
 acid.    Buchner, on the other hand, adduced results opposed to this
 view, pointing to the interpretation that the action was an indirect
 one, due to the antitoxin operating in some indirect way through the
 medium of the cells of the organism.        Since this controversy many
  investigations  have  been  made  with the  object of deciding this funda
 mental point.     At the present time, however, opinion is still divided;

direct chemical view, whilst Buchner, Roux, and Metchnikoff still
maintain that the interaction takes place only through the interven
tion of some cells in the body.
    W e will briefly review the more important observations which bear
directly upon the subject of our paper.
      (1)     Observations    favouring the Interpretation        that the Action   of
                                  Antitoxins is indirect.
    Calmette* in 1895 made experiments with the toxin of cobra poison
and its antitoxin, which he had recently succeeded in producing.
Cobra poison is not apparently attenuated by heating its solutions to
68° C. for ten minutes.              The antitoxin is, however, completely de
stroyed       by this treatment.         Mixtures of cobra poison and antitoxin
which produced no symptoms when injected into a rabbit, killed
similar rabbits in a few hours if after the mixture had remained in
contact for ten minutes it were heated for another ten minutes to
68° C. before injecting.             From his experiments Calmette concluded
that the toxin of snake venom does not interact with its antitoxin in
vitro, but only in corpore, and therefore that its action cannot be
explained as a simple chemical operation between the two.
   Wassermannt found that the toxin produced by the bacillus pyo-
cyaneus was not destroyed by boiling, whereas its antitoxin was.
The amount of toxin and antitoxin which neutralised each other was
first determined by experiment, then the same quantities and propor
tions of these substances were allowed to remain in contact and
afterwards heated to boiling. The animals receiving an injection of
this heated mixture died, whereas the control animals which received
an equal dose unheated recovered.                  From these experiments Wasser-
mann concluded that the toxin of pyocyanens does not interact with
its antitoxin in vitro, but only in corpore, and therefore that it cannot
be explained as a simple chemical operation                   between the two.
   NikanorowJ discovered that the precipitate formed by the addition
of a 1 per cent, solution of cupric acetate was possessed of antitoxic
properties and the filtrate not. A 1 per cent, solution of cupric
acetate does not, however, precipitate the toxin. Mixtures of the two
could thus be separated by the use of this reagent.                         Experiments
conducted along the lines mentioned in the experiments above led to
identical results.

of diphtheria which were identical in principle with those of
Calmette and Wassermann.               In this case, however, it is the toxin
which is destroyed at the lower temperature (60° C. Ronx and
Yersin), whereas the antitoxic properties still remained after heating
the serum to 70° C. Mixtures of the two in such proportions as to
cause no symptoms when injected into a guinea-pig were made.
After heating such mixture to a temperature sufficient to destroy the
toxin, the mixture was discovered now to possess antitoxic properties
which could be titrated against a fresh amount of toxin.
 2. Observations     favouring   the interpretation that the action     of Antitoxins
                                       is direct.
     The view that the operation is a direct one has always received
 support from the general trnth of the
                                                  " law of multiples," on which
 indeed the antitoxin notation has been founded.                      It is further
 strengthened by the observations of Kanthack and Ehrlich.
     Kanthack,* in 1896, demonstrated that the influence of cobra
 poison in preventing the coagulation of shed blood, observed by
 Cunningham, was prevented by the previous admixture of some of
 Calmette's antivenomous serum to the solution of cobra poison.
     Ehrlichf found that if a solution of ricin, be added to defibrinated
 blood ( ? animal) the corpuscles are precipitated in a clump.                      A
 ricin solution of the same strength, but containing a little serum
 from an animal immunised against ricin, failed to produce this result.
     Within the last few days we have received a short account of
 some experiments by Stephens and Meyers,J bearing upon the same
 point. Cobra poison exercises a hemolytic action upon blood in
 vitro.     After admixture of the poison with antivenomous serum
  this hemolytic action was absent.               The necessary precaution of
  making     the  solution  of the venom    with   saline solution approximately
 isotonic with blood serum was taken.
     Before relating the results of our own experiments we may point
  out one source of fallacy in the conclusions drawn by Wassermann.
  Calmette, Nikanorow, and Marenghi, viz., that they take no account
  of the factor, time, which may be a very important element in any
  possible chemical interaction between toxins and antitoxins.                 Every
  chemical reaction has a certain definite velocity coefficient, and the
  rapidity of action under any circumstances where the reacting com
  pounds are in solution depends upon this coefficient, and also upon

Temperature will also exercise an important influence.
    As we shall later show, the experiments quoted by these observers
can easily be repeated and the same results obtained.                 Nevertheless
their conclusions are quite unjustified, and by modification of the
factors, time, temperature, and active masses, exactly opposite results
may also be obtained.
                  Experimental      results obtained by the Authors.
    Our experiments have been conducted with the toxin of diphtheria,
and one of the constituents of the poison of the Australian tiger
snake (Hoplocephalus curtus.)
    The diphtheria toxin was prepared by cultivating the organisms
in broth made from well hung beef, after the method of Spronck.*
 It was filtered through a sound Pasteur-Chamberland filter, and the
 toxin strength of the filtrate determined by injection into a series
 of guinea-pigs.         That with which most of our experiments were
 conducted, had a minimum lethal dose of 0'12 c.c. per kilogram in
 48 hours.
     The antitoxins used were Behring's No.                  I and serum from the
 Pasteur Institute, Paris.
     The constituent of the venom used was the one which is not
 destroyed by heating a solution of venom to 90° C.                     This consti
 tuent resembles most closely, if indeed it be not identical with, the
 principal constituent of cobra poison ; and, as shown by one of us,f
 Calmette's antivenomous serum possesses a small but decided counter
 acting action upon it. This action, though unfortunately of little or
 no practical importance, is sufficient for our present purpose, for in
 our experiments we could mix comparatively large quantities of the
 serum with small fatal doses of the venom in vitro. Under these
 circumstances      one could easily neutralise        the poison.
     The antitoxin was the antivenomous serum prepared by the Pasteur
  Institute at Lille, and bore date November, 1896.
     We endeavoured at the outset to determine whether the action of
  antitoxins upon toxins were chemical or physiological, by a direct
  physical method. In 1896 one of nsj published an account of a
  method of separating substances of large molecular size from those of
  smaller, in solutions containing both. This method was simply by
 filtering through a film of gelatin, supported in the wall of a
 Pasteur-Chamberland filter.              The filtration was accomplished by a
  pressure of 50 atmospheres.

  A    standardised     solution of diphtheria toxin was filtered throngh
such    a   filter.   The filtrate was found to contain diphtheria toxin.
This filtrate was then tested to ascertain whether it were as toxic as
 the original solution.   As will be seen from the protocols it was
somewhat diminished in toxic power (Protocol I).
   The antitoxin of diphtheria, as was shown by Brodie,* does not
pass through such a filter.    When antitoxic serum is filtered through
gelatin, the whole of the proteids, and together with them all auti-
toxic virtue, are absent from the filtrate (Protocol II).    As the toxin
is not held back by the filter, whereas the antitoxin    one        is,
                                                                provided      is
with   asimple physical means of separating them, provided they have
not reacted upon one another.
    We mixed a solution of toxin containing eight fatal doses per
kilogram of guinea-pig in each c.c, with sufficient Behring's anti
toxin to more than completely neutralise all the toxin. This mixture
was allowed to remain in contact at 30° G. for two hours, and then
filtered through the gelatin   filter.   Varying quantities of the
filtrate were injected into guinea-pigs up to nearly       c.c. per kilo  4
gram of body weight, that         a quantity originally containing 32
                                      is
fatal doses. The filtrate was quite innocent.          The guinea-pigs
suffered no inconvenience, and gained weight while under observa
tion in small cages.   Tho injections produced no local oedema.
    If the toxin had remained unaffected beside the antitoxin there
was nothing to prevent      passing through the filter in virtue of its
                                it
relatively  small molecular  size. As, however,      did not do so, we
                                                               it
can only conclude that       had entered into some sort of chemical
                                it
relationship with the relatively large molecules of the anti-toxin
during their sojourn together prior to filtration.
    Having obtained results so definite, and in apparent contradiction
to those of the authors quoted in the beginning of this paper, we
next experimented with snake venom in order to repeat Calmette'sf
observations.
  We took a series of rabbits (Protocol V) and injected them with
mixtures containing one constituent of the venom of Eoplocephalus
curtus and Calmette's antivenomons serum.       On reference to the
protocols of this series of experiments       seen that
                                                   it    c.c. of this

sample of serum was sufficient to counteract an amount of the poison
contained in '0002 gram of the dried venom.      This amount killed
control rabbits in about eight hours (Protocol IV).
   In some of the experiments this amount of venom and serum was
allowed to remain in contact for fifteen minutes at the laboratory
temperature (21° C.) and then heated to 68° C. for ten minutes to
destroy the antitoxin.      In Calmette's experiments the rabbits

injected with this heated mixture died, whereas the controls injected
with the mixture which had not been heated lived. From this he
concluded that the serum and venom were merely existing side by
side, and had not re-acted upon one another.            In our experiments, on
the contrary, the rabbits injected with the heated and unheated
mixtures of venom and serum alike lived, nor did any of them suffer
from symptoms such as loss of appetite, loss of weight, or diminished
temperature.       The only conclusion to be drawn from these experi
 ments is that during the time which elapsed between the mixture of
the venom and serum the latter had acted upon the former, so that
there was no longer a fatal dose of venom present.                The protocols
will show that heating for ten minutes to          68° C. has no influence upon
the venom. (P. VI, experiment 4.)
   These results, while they lead       to results   in entire agreement with
those drawn from the filtration          experiments with diphtheria toxin
and antitoxin, are diametrically       opposed to the results obtained by
 Calmette.     As the experiments       are so simple as not to leave any
 possibility   of  experimental    error,  we turned our attention to any
 existing difference in the conditions under which Calmette and our
 selves  worked.      As previously pointed out, Calmette absolutely
 neglected   the  possible influence of time, temperature, and the relative
 proportions of the active masses of the toxin and antitoxin present
 in his mixture. Up to the present we have investigated the value of
 the factors, time, and proportion of active masses, and have shown
 that these are most important. Indeed, by altering either the one or
 the other we can produce results which, if these factors be neglected,
 would lead to diametrically opposite conclusions.
    The toxin and antitoxin of this venom are both of great molecular
size and complexity.         The former is a deutero-albumose and the
latter probably a globulin,* or at any rate its molecular size is of the
same order. A priori one would expect the velocity coefficient of any
reaction between such complex molecules to be a high one, and in
addition, from their great molecular weight, the solution will contain
relatively few molecules : so that it is not surprising that any
 chemical operation in which they are concerned should occupy a very
appreciable time.
    The value of the factors time and influence of proportion of active
masses will be best seen in reference to the table below, which is
compiled from Protocols VII, VIII, IX, and represents the results
of twenty-one experiments. On reading along any horizontal line
¦will be seen the influence upon the result of the time during which
fche toxin and antitoxin were allowed to operate upon each other,
with proportion of active masses constant.             On reading any vertical
line the influence of vaiying proportions of active masses with time

     In our experiments with diphtheria we allowed abundance                                                    of
 time, 2 hours, for the reaction                   between the toxin and antitoxin to
 take place.            The surplus of antitoxin was also large, so that the
 active masses were considerable and the temperature was favourable,
 viz. 30° C. (Protocol III).                    We have not yet determined the in
 fluence of temperature upon the rapidity of the reaction, but our
 results so far seem sufficiently conclusive to decide the question and
 leave no room for doubt that the antagonism between the toxins of
 diphtheria and snake venom and their relative antitoxin is due to
 a direct chemical action which takes place between them.                                           Further,
 that the opposite conclusion come to by Calmette, and presumably
 those of Wassermann, Nikanarow, and Marenghi were due to their
 disregard of the value of time as a factor in such chemical action.

                                 through a Gelatin Filter.
     The toxins were prepared by the method stated above and filtered
through a Pasteur-Ch'amberland                   filter to free them from bacilli.
The minimal fatal dose calculated for one kilogram weight of
guinea-pig was 0"12 c.c. of toxin No. 1, and 0 6 c.c. of toxin No. 2.
Portions of each of these toxins were filtered through gelatin and
afterwards injected into guinea-pigs.                   As seen below the filtrates in
each case contained toxin, but in less amount than the original
solutions.*

    * This small diminution in toxic power by filtration may possibly be due to the
 action of oxygen at high tension         (50 atmospheres     of compressed air) or to the
 size of the toxin molecule being of the order of the molecular size of albumoses.
  Albumoses, as shown by one of us ('J. Physiol.,' 1896), pass through gelatin, but
 lefs readily than water, and the filtrate is accordingly less concentrated than the
  original solution.

II.   Experiments to confirm Brodie's* statement that tlie Antitoxin of
               Diphtheria does not pass through a Gelatin Filter.
    05   c.c. of Pasteur Institute antitoxin was mixed with 1 c.c. of toxin
No.    1  (=8 fatal doses per kilo.), and injected into a guinea-pig
weighing 260 grams.
    The animal remained well and gained 26 grams during the
 four days it was kept under observation.                The same sample of anti
toxin was passed through the                filter.   Of  the filtrate 0'6 c.c. was
 mixed with 0'6 c.c. of the same toxin and injected into a guinea-pig
weighing 163 grams. The animal died in 22 hours.

      a Gelatin Filler is free from Toxin.
    60 c.c.   of toxin No. 1 (containing approximately 500 lethal doses
per kilogram) was mixed with 2-5 c.c. of Behring's antitoxin

VI.     Experiments        to determine whether       mixture      of  venom      and serum
   (in   such proportions        as to completely    deprive    the former      of any toxic
   properties), regained          toxic  properties after destroying the antitoxin
   by heating to G8° C. per 10 minutes, subsequent to admixture.
   The venom solution             and serum     were mixed         in the proportion of
1  c.c.   of serum to every 0"0001 gram of venom.                          This proportion
was found by the previous series of experiments to be adequate.
The two solutions were mixed together, and allowed to remain 30
minutes at a temperature of 23° — 24° C, after which the mixture
was heated to C8° C. for 10 minutes to destroy the antitoxin.                             They
were then cooled and injected subcutaneously in varying quantities
per kilogram weight of the animal.                    The injections had no effect
upon the animals, although they contained originally eight fatal
closes of venom.           This must therefore have been neutralised by the
antitoxin during the time which elapsed before its destruction by
heat.

 VII.      Experiments to determine the influence of variations in the time
      during which venom, and antivenomous serum, operated upon one
      another.
      In this series of experiments, the same samples of venom and
 sernm were employed as before.                   The relative proportions of the
 two were kept constant.               The venom solution and sernm were
 mixed together in the proportion of O'OOOl gram of venom to I c.c.
 of the sernm and well stirred. After they had remained in contact
 at the temperature of the laboratory (21° C.) for times varying
from 2 to 30 minutes, portions were pipetted off, and rapidly
 raised to 68° C, at which temperature they were kept for 10 minutes.
The portions were then rapidly cooled, and injected snbcutaneously
in quantities proportionate to the body weights of the animals.
 Amounts of venom and of serum equivalent to O'OOOl gram and 1 c.c.
respectively per kilogram of body weight were injected in each case,
except the control, when this quantity of venom was employed.

         Kelvin, F.R.S. Received June 7, — Read June 16, 1898.
      The writer has already described (" Some new Studies in Cathode
and Rontgen Radiations," a discourse given at the Royal Institution
ou February 4, 1898) how he has found it possible to study by
means of pin-hole photography the active area on the anti-cathode of
a focus tube from which the Rontgen rays proceed ,

           On the Source  of the Rontgen Rays in Focus Tubes.        433
     By means of a special camera he has now been able to make further
investigations.     The camera is illustrated in fig. 1, where A is the:
pinhole    in a removable lead disc secured by a brass cap to the brass
cone B, which is lined with thick lead so as to be opaque to the
 Rontgen rays. D is a framework into which slides either the
fluorescent screen E, or a carrier containing a sensitive plate should
 photographs be required.      F is an observation tube for use with the
 fluorescent screen. It is made of insulating material to avoid danger
 of  shocks.
                                    Fig. 1.
     "With this apparatus directed at the anti-cathode of a focus tube,
 it is easy with the fluorescent screen in place to take accurate note
 of the image of the active anti-cathode area which appears on the
 screen, aud to observe the variations in form, dimensions, and
 brilliancy that take place under varying conditions.       Similarly by
  replacing the fluorescent screen by a photographic plate in a black
  paper envelope, the Rontgen ray image can be photographed.
  Exposures, varying from one to thirty minutes, according to condi
  tions, are found sufficient to impress upon the plate any effect that
 ican be seen directly with the screen. It has not, however, been
  found possible, even with very prolonged exposures, to photograph
  anything not directly visible with the screen, and having regard to
  the difficulties of maintaining the vacnum and other conditions con
  stant for any considerable length of time, the method of direct
  observation seems generally to be best and most convenient.        For
  direct observation, rather a large pin-hole, say about 2 mm. in
  diameter, gives the best results ; for photography about half this
  diameter is preferable, as it gives sharper images.
     The writer has made numerous observations and photographs with
  this apparatus, both with focus tubes of the ordinary pattern, and
  also with a special tube in which both the cathode and also the anti-
  cathode (which in addition acted as anode) were independently
  adjustable along the axis of the tube, so that the distance between
  them could be varied from a minimum of 4 to a maximum of
  14 cm.     This special tube is illustrated in fig. 2, and during the

observations it was connected to a mercury pump, so that tho degree
of exhaustion could be varied as desired.

   The following are the main effects observed.
   (1) When the anti-cathode intersects the cathode stream at the
focus, the dimensions of the active area are independent of the
degree of exhaustion.       For all other positions beyond the focus it is
larger the lower the exhaustion and vice versa. These observations
are of course only possible between the limits of exhaustion with
which Rontgen rays are produced.
   (2) When the anti-cathode intersects the cathode stream beyond
the focus, the active area is larger the greater the distance between
cathode and anti-cathode.        For instance, with the tube illustrated in
fig.  2, exhausted   to   a  good Rontgen ray vacuum, it was found
that the active area gradually increased from about 0'15 cm.
diameter with 4 cm. distance between cathode and anti-cathode up
to about 2'3 cm. diameter as the distance was gradually increased
to 14 cm. The increase is less the higher the vacua, but is always
very considerable.
   (3) When the anti-cathode intersects the cathode stream con
siderably beyond the focus, the active area is found to consist of a
well defined and very intense central nucleus, snrrounded by a much
fainter but quite appreciable halo. Both of these increase in size as
the distance between cathode and anti-cathode is increased.
   In some cases the halo consists of a well marked hollow ring with
a dark space between it and the central nucleus.             In other cases two
distinct concentric      rings are visible surrounding the nucleus.
Moreover, the nucleus itself, when very large, shows distinct signs
of being made up of one or more concentric rings, sometimes with a
still smaller nucleus within them. These observations correspond
with and amplify what the writer has already noticed by direct
observation of the visible luminescence of a carbon screen arranged
to intersect the cathode stream.*
   (4) With an anti-cathode         inclined at       an angle of 45° to the
axis of the conical cathode stream, it is found that those portions
of the stream which impinge most normally upon the anti-cathode
                   *  '

             On the Source   of the  Rdntgen Rays in Focus lubes.         435
   surface  are considerably the most efficient in producing Rontgen
   rays.   Similarly those portions of the stream that impinge on the
  anti-cathode surface very much on the slant are correspondingly in
  effective in producing Rontgen rays.
      (5) At the degrees of exhaustion most suitable for producing
  Rontgen rays, and with concave cathodes of the usual dimensions,
  the cathode stream proceeds almost entirely from a small central
  portion of the cathode surface, the remaining portion of the
  surface being apparently practically inoperative.            That this is
  so was very conclusively established by photographs taken with
  the tube shown in fig. 2. In the manufacture or subsequent
  exhaustion of this tube three very minute fragments of glass by some
 means attached themselves on to the concave surface of the alu
  minium cathode, and remained fixed there during the experiments.
  The cathode itself was 29 mm. diameter, and the radial distances of
  the three glass fragments from the centre were respectively about
 9 mm., 4 mm., and 2 o mm.          In all the pin-hole photographs of the
 anti-cathode of this tube in which the enlargement of the active area
  was sufficient, the shadows of the two glass fragments nearest to the
  centre of the cathode are clearly visible, while in none of them is
 there any appearance of the third and outer fragment.         It, therefore,
 is evident that the whole of the cathode stream that was effective in
 producing Rdntgen rays came from an area of the cathode surface
 less than 18 mm. diameter, or less than two-thirds of the full
 diameter of the cathode. Further, in each case the shadows of the
two inner glass fragments appeared outside of the central nucleus,
 showing that the whole of the more intense portion of tho cathode
stream proceeded from a portion of the cathode surface less than 5 mm.
in diameter. These results confirm the writer's observations made
with carbon cathodes.*
     (6) The different portions of the cathode stream proceeding from
different portions of tho cathode, cross at the focus and diverge in
a cone that retains any special characteristics of the convergent cone.
The relative positions of the two inner glass fragments on the
cathode, and the positions           and enlargement of their shadows
on the anti-cathode for different distances between the latter and the
cathode, were found to show this very clearly.
     (7) Though by far the greater portion of, the Rontgen rays given
by a focus tube proceed from the active anti-cathode area, still, a
very appreciable quantity is also given off by all those portions of
the glass of the tube that show the green fluorescence.
    Using a somewhat large pin-hole, this is easily observed by turning
the tube so that the more powerful rays from the anti-cathode cannot
reach the pin-hole, when a Rontgen ray image of the whole of the
                     • ' Boy. Soc. Proo.,' vol. 61, pp. 92—93.

436       On   the Source    of  the Rontgen       Rays in Focus Tubes.
fluorescent portions of the glass of the tube can be distinctly seen.
Further, it is noticeable that that portion of the glass that shows the
brightest fluorescence, i.e., that part which lies in the path in which
cathode rays would be reflected from the anti-cathode surface were
they reflected according to the law of equal angles of incidence and
reflection — gives off the most Rontgen rays, while those portions of
the glass that show no flnoresence do not give off any Rontgen rays.
The conclusion appears obvious that whatever produces the one also
produces the other, but as has been pointed out by Professor S. P.
Thompson* and others, the fluorescence is not due to the direct stream
of rays from the cathode, which cannot reach portions of the glass that
show fluorescence, but to some description of radiation that proceeds
from the surface of the anti-cathode that faces the cathode.                   In the
paper    above   referred   to  Professor      Thompson      calls  these radiations
" para-cathodic rays," stating that
                                              they differ from the Rontgen rays
in respect of their power of penetration, and in their capacity of
being electrostatically and magnetically deflectable.                  In these re
spects the writer's experiments confirm those of Professor Thompson,
but when the latter goes on to differentiate theso rays from ordi
nary cathode rays, on account of their not exciting Rontgen rays
where they impinge on a solid surface, the writer is unable to
agree, for, as above stated, these rays do excite Rontgen rays where
they impinge upon the glass walls of the tube ; as mentioned, however,
they do this only to an extent that is relatively very feeble, and so
far as the author knows only discernable by the pin-hole method of
observation, which no doubt explains Professor Thompson's failure
to observe the effect. The " para-cathodic " radiations in question do
not, however, appear to be ordinary cathode rays.                  In the first place
they do not proceed directly from the cathode, but only from the
surface of the anti-cathode that faces the latter. Secondly, they do
not appear to bo negatively but positively charged, as can be ascer
tained by means of an exploring pole connected with an electro
scope.    The writer suggests that, assuming the correctness of the
Crookes theory of the nature of the cathode rays, these "para-
cathodic
           "
              rays may very probably consist of cathode ray particles
which, having struck the anti-cathode, and having thus given up
their negative charges and acquired positive charges, rebound, both
by reason of their elasticity and also by repulsion from the anti-
cathode.     Perhaps owing to the comparative roughness of the anti-
cathode surface, they fly off to some extent in all available directions,
but they do so especially in that direction which the law of equal angles
of incidence and reflection requires.               It also appears very possible
that these " paracathodic " rays are identical with the positively
electrified streams proceeding from the anode, which the writer has

investigated by means of radiometer mill wheels, recently described
in a paper to the Physical Society.
     In any case, it seems clear that in the tubes observed and photo
graphed with the pin-hole camera, the Rontgen rays given off by
certain portions of the fluorescent glass are not originated by the
impact of an ordinary cathode stream, but apparently by the
impact of positively charged streams proceeding from the anti-
cathode.

 "   On the Companions of Argon."               By William Ramsay, F.R.S.,
          and   Morris W. Travers.            Received June 13, — Read June

     For many months past we have been engaged in preparing                     a large
 quantity        of argon from atmospheric        air by absorbing the oxygen
 with red-hot copper, and the nitrogen with magnesium. The amount
 we have at our disposal is some 18 litres. It will be remembered
 that one of us, in conjunction with Dr. Norman Collie, attempted to
 separate argon into light and heavy portions by means of diffusion,
 and, although there was a slight difference* in density between the
 light and the heavy portions, yet we thought the difference too'slight
 to warrant the conclusion that argon is a mixture.                          But our
 experience         with helium taught us that it is a matter of the
 greatest difficulty to separate a very small portion of a heavy gas
 from a large admixture of a light gas ; and it therefore appeared
 advisable to re-investigate argon, with the view of ascertaining
  ¦whether     it is indeed complex.
      In the meantime, Dr. Hampson had placed at our disposal his
  resources for preparing large quantities of liquid air, and it was a
  simple matter to liquify the argon which we had obtained by causing
  the liquid air to boil under reduced pressure. By means of a two-
  way stopcock the argon was allowed to enter a small bulb, cooled by
  liquid air, after passing through purifying reagents. The two-way
  stopcock was connected with mercury gas-holders, as well as with
  a Tiipler pump, by means of whioh any part of the apparatus could
  be   thoroughly exhausted.        The argon separated as a liquid, but at
  the same time a considerable quantity of solid was observed to sepa
   rate partially round the sides of the tube, and partially below the

surface of the liquid.     After about 13 or 14 litres of the argon had
been condensed, the stopcock was closed, and the temperature was
kept low for some minutes in order to establish a condition of equi
 librium between the liquid and vapour.          In the meantime, the con
 necting  tubes  were  exhausted  and  two   fractions   of gas were taken
•off by lowering the mercury     reservoirs, each fraction consisting of
about     50 or 60 cubic cm.         These      fractions should contain
 the light gas. In a previous experiment of the same kind, a small
fraction of the light gas had been separated, and was found to have
-the density 17"2.    The pressure of the air was now allowed to
rise, and the argon distilled away into a separate gas-holder.           The
white solid which had condensed in the upper portion of the bulb
 did not appear to evaporate quickly, and that portion which had
separated in the liquid did not perceptibly diminish in amount
 Towards the end, when almost all the air had boiled away, the
last portions of the liquid evaporated slowly, and when the remaining
liquid was only sufficient to cover the solid, the bulb was placed in
connection with the Topler pump, and the exhaustion continued
until the liquid had entirely disappeared.             Only the solid now
remained, and the pressure of the gas in the apparatus was only a
few millimetres. The bulb was now placed in connection with mer
cury gas-holders, and the reservoirs were lowered.          The solid vol»-
tilised very slowly, and was collected in two fractions, each of about
70 or 80 cubic cm.        Before the second fraction had been taken
off, the air had entirely boiled away, and the jacketing tube had
been removed.      After about a minute, on wiping off the coating of
snow with the finger, the solid was seen to melt, and volatilise into
the gas-holder.
    The first fraction of gas was mixed with oxygen, and sparked over
soda.    After removal of the oxygen with phosphorus it was intro
duced into a vacuum-tube, and the spectrum examined.                It  was
characterised by a number of bright      red  lines, among which one was
particularly brilliant, and a brilliant yellow line, while the green and
the blue linos were numerous, but comparatively inconspicuous.          The
wave-length of the yellow line, measured by Mr. Baly, was 5849"6, with
a second-order      grating spectrum.      It is, therefore, not identical
with sodium, helium, or krypton, all of which equal it in intensity
The wave-lengths of these lines are as follows : —

(new), was next determined.               A bulb of 32'35 cubic cm. capacity-
was filled with this sample of neon at 612'4 mm. pressure, and at a
temperature of 19"92° it weighed CHD3184 gram.
                       Density of neon                      14'67.
    This number approaches to what we had hoped to obtain.                             In
 order to bring neon into its position in the periodic table, a density
 of 10 or 11 is required.         Assuming the density of argon to be 20,
 and that of pure neon 10, the sample contains 53-3 per cent, of the
 new gas. If the density of neon be taken as 11, there is 59'2 per
 cent, present in the sample.           The fact that the density has decreased
 from 17'2 to 14 7 shows that there is a considerable likelihood that
 the gas can be further purified by fractionation.*
    That this gas is a new one is sufficiently proved, not merely by the
 novelty of its spectrum and by its low density, but also by its beha
 viour in a vacuum-tube.            Unlike helium, argon, and krypton, it is
 rapidly absorbed by the red-hot aluminium electrodes of a vacuum-
 tube, and the appearance of the tube changes, as pressure falls, from
 fiery red to a most brilliant orange, which is seen in no other gas.
    We now come to the gas obtained by the volatilisation of the white
 solid which remained after the liquid argon had boiled away.
    When introduced into a vacuum-tube it showed a very complex
 spectrum, totally differing from that of argon, while resembling it in
 general character.         With low dispersion it appeared to be a banded
 spectrum, but with a grating, single bright lines appear, about equi
 distant throughout the spectrum, the intermediate space being filled
 with many dim, yet well-defined lines. Mr. Baly has measured the
bright lines, with the following results. The nearest argon lines, as
 measured by Mr. Crookes, are placed in brackets : —

    The density of this gas was determined with the following

  had decreased  to 13 7.

results : — A globo  of 32-35 o.c. capacity, filled at a pressure of
765'0 mm., and at the temperature 17'43°, weighed O05442 gram.
The density is therefore 19'87. A second determination, made after
sparking, gave no different result. This density does not Bensibly
differ from that of argon.
   Thinking that the gas might possibly prove to be diatomic, we
proceeded to determine the ratio of specific heats : —
            Wave-length of sound in air                34'18
                                       gas             3168

                 „    gas                               1660
   The gas is therefore monatomic.
   Inasmuch as this gas differs very markedly from argon in its
spectrum, and in its behaviour at low temperatures,           it must be
regarded   as a distinct elementary  substance,    and we   therefore pro
                         " metargon."     It would appear to hold the
pose for it the name
position towards argon that nickel does to cobalt, having approxi
mately the same atomic weight, yet different properties.
   It must have been observed that krypton does not appear during
the investigation of tho higher- boiling fraction of argon.        This is
probably due to two causes.    In the first place, in order to prepare it,
tho manipulation of a volume of air of no l6ss than 60,000 times the
volume of tho impure sample which we obtained was required and in
                                                                ;
the second place, while metargon  is a solid at the temperature of boiling
air, kryptonis  probably liquid,
                        a         and  more volatilo at that temperature.
It may also be noted that the air from which krypton has been
obtained had been filtered, and so freed from metargon.            A full
account of the spectra of those gases will bo published in due course
by Mr. E. C. C. Baly.

   Thanks to the most generous and freely rendered services of Mr.
P. Henaghan, Principal Keeper of the Lighthouse on Stephen's
Island iu Cook Straits, have lately obtained a very perfect series of
                       I
Tuatara embryos, ranging in ago from just before the appearance of
the blastopore to about the time of hatching.   I have classified these
embryos   in sixteen stages, and propose shortly to publish a general

        Development     of the Tuatara (Sphenodon punctatum).           441
account of the development with numerous illustrations. As, how
ever, it will still take some time to complete the drawings and manu
script, it appears desirable to publish at once a short summary of the
most interesting results obtained.          The general development, as
already   stated  by Thomas,   conforms   closely to that of other reptiles,
but the following features seem to deserve special mention : —
    (1) The development occupies about thirteen months, the eggs
being laid (on Stephen's Island) in November and hatched about
midsummer of the year following. The last stages in the develop
ment, after abont the first four months, occupy a much longer period
than the earlier ones, so that, having reached an already very
advanced      stage, the development seems to be almost if not quite
suspended during the winter months.
    (2) The blastoderm spreads around the yolk at a very early date,
and the embryo first appears as a cap-shaped mass of cells, the front
end of which is elevated       above the surrounding blastoderm as the
head-fold, while the hinder and narrower end is formed by an undif
 ferentiated mass of cells representing the primitive         streak.    The
front part of the embryo is formed of epiblast and lower layer cells,
and from the lowest of the latter the hypoblast is subsequently
differentiated.
    (3) In the primitive streak a distinct blastopore makes its appear
ance, which presently opens into the enteron below, forming a very
 distinct neurenteric canal which persists for some time.
     (4) The notochord appears to be formed by a forward growth from
 the primitive streak in front of the blastopore, rather than by dif
 ferentiation of hypoblast cells in the mid-doi\sal line of the enteron.
    (5) At a very early date the front end of the embryo sinks into the
 yolk, pushing the subjacent blastoderm before it in such a manner
 that the latter forms a kind of amnion closely investing the head and
 the thoracic portion of the body. This " amnion," though very
 thin, becomes differentiated into inner somatopleuric and outer
 splanchnopleuric portions, but, at any rate for a long time, without
 any mesoblast.
     (6) At a comparatively late stage in development the anterior
  end of the embryo, together with the somatopleuric layer of the
  " amnion," is withdrawn from the splanchnopleuric layer
                                                                      (which
  belongs really to the yolk sac), and thus the embryo comes to lie
 entirely above the yolk sac.
     (7) In the hinder part of the embryo the amnion is formed by
 uprising folds of somatopleure meeting and fusing above the embryo,
 probably accompanied by a down sinking of the embryo.                   This
  process  is continued  backwards   for some  distance behind  the embryo,
  forming a narrow canal which communicates in part with the cavity
  of the true amnion, and opens behind on the surface of the blasto

  442    Development    of the  Tuatara (Sphenodon       punctatum).
  derm close to the sinus terminalis.       The " posterior amniotic canal "
  thus formed is lined by epiblast, but it lies embedded in the meso-
  blast of the serous envelope which gradually splits off from the
  underlying yolk-sac around the embryo.             The posterior amniotic
  canal arises at a very early   date,  and does not persist very long.
     (8) The connection between the true amnion and serous envelope
  (false amnion) in the mid-dorsal line persists in part to a very late
  stage, but there is free communication between the two halves of the
  pleuroperitoneal space above the embryo.
     (9) In connection with the vitelline circulation, very numerous
  absorbing vessels are developed which dip down far into the yolk,
  and large transparent globules of yolk, each surrounded by a layer of
  yolk " crystalloids," become arranged around these vessels like onions
  on strings.   The yolk thus gradually assumes a very characteristic
 radially columnar structure.
     (10) The parietal eye commences its development shortly after
 the appearance of the optic lobes. It arises by evagination of the
 roof of the brain in front of the prominence of the mid-brain, and
 is at first situated slightly to one side of the median line (the left
 side, so far as yet ascertained).     It very soon becomes completely dis
 connected from its stalk as a closed, hollow vesicle, the wall of which
 is composed at first of a single layer of columnar cells.         The outer
 (upper) part of the wall of the vesicle is thickened to form the lens
and the inner (lower) part presently divides into two very distinct
layers, and acquires a secondary, fibrous connection with the brain
immediately in front of the stalk.          It is a curious fact that while
the parietal eye, after separating from its stalk, at first lies on the
left side — the stalk itself is median.
    (11) The posterior commissure arises just in front of the place
where the stalk of the parietal eye connects with the brain and the
stalk passes forwards above it. This fact seems to exclude the
possibility of the stalk of the parietal eye representing the pineal
gland, for, according to Balfour, the posterior commissure arises
behind the pineal gland which is directed backwards.
    (12) The pineal gland in Sphenodon appears to be represented by
a mass of convoluted tubules lying in front of the stalk of the
parietal eye.
    (13) At a late stage of development (in embryos Estimated at
from four to eight months) the body and part of the head are
marked with very distinct longitudinal stripes of white on a grey
ground.     This striping almost entirely disappears before hatching,
beinsr last retained on the under surface of the head.          This observa-
tion is in close agreement with those of Eimer on the markings of
mammals, &c.
    (14)  In embryos of the     same    age  a patch  of cornified  epidermis

         Jhe   Stomodceum, Mesenterial Filaments, fyc, of Xenia.     443
on the snout forms a very distinct "shell-breaker," which seems to
be represented in the adult by the large median scale in front of
the premaxillas.
    (15) At about the time of hatching there are on each of the
 premaxilloe three distinct, sharp, conical teeth, of which the outer
 most is the largest.       These probably unite later on to form the
 large upper cutting teeth of the adult.    There are also three similar
 teeth on each side in the front of the mandible, which probably
 unite to form the lower cutting teeth of the adult.        (I have not
 found any vomerine teeth.)
    Of the above results those regarding the amnion and the parietal
 eye seem to be the most interesting.     I had discovered and draw n
 the posterior amniotic 'canal long before  I was aware of Mitsukuri's
 similar and previous discovery in Chelonians, and it appears to me
 that the observation is of especial interest in view of the supposed
relationship between Splienodon and the latter group, the probability
of which is greatly strengthened by the striking similarity in the
development of the foetal membranes.
    The development of the parietal eye in Sphsnodon certainly sup
ports Beraneck's important conclusion that this organ (in Lacerta and
Anguis) arises independently of the epiphysis, a conclusion which
                                        I
was also unknown to me until after had come to suspect the same
thing from observing the peculiar relation of the stalk of the parietal
eye to the posterior commissure.
    I may add that owing to the scarcity of biological literature in
Christchurch the works of Mitsukuri and Beraneck above referred
to are only known to me from the short abstracts in the ' Journal of
the Royal Microscopical Society.'

    The specimen referred to in this note is   a colony of the Alcyona-
ceous coral Xenia sp. ? from Celebes. The Xeniidte are distinguished
from all other Alcyonaria by their soft fleshy consistency and
non-retractile polyps.      The former character is due to the fact that
their spicules are very minute rounded or oval discs (average measure
ments 0'015 mm. long, O'Ol mm. broad, 0"004 mm. thick), which have

remainder     of the stomodeeum bear short cilia on their free surface,
but among these are numerous "goblet cells" (G, figs. 1 and 2),
¦which have not hitherto been noticed in the stomodffium of the
Alcyonaria.     These cells are swollen by some secretion to -which they
give rise ; tbey generally appear to be empty, having discharged
their secretion, which, in some cases, can be seen issuing from the cell
into the cavity of the stomodaaum. These secreting cells occnr chiefly
in the middle and lower portions of the stomodteum, and are most
abundant on the lateral walls near the siphonoglyphe (see fig. 2).
They do not occur among the cells which form the siphonoglyphe.
    These " goblet cells " of the stomodaaum are the only secreting cells
connected with the digestive cavity which 1 have been able to find,
as the six thick short ventral and lateral mesenterial filaments,
 •which bear the gland cells in other Alcyonaria, are absent in all
 polyps of this Xenia. Only the dorsal mesenteries possess thickened
edges forming the two mesenterial filaments which have a similar
coarse and structure to those of Alcyoninm. The free edge of the
 ventral and lateral mesenteries is only very slightly thickened, and
 the cells which cover this edge differ in no way from those which
 cover the remaining portions of the mesentery.
     The two new points in the anatomy of this species of Xenia are the
 presence of gland cells in the stomodaeum and the absence of the six
 ventral and lateral mesenterial filaments usually present in the polyps
 of the Alcyonacea. Wilson* (in Kophobelemnon) and Hicksont (in
 jLlcyonium) have shown that these mesenterial filaments bear the cells
 which produce the digestive secretion. I would suggest that the
 absence of these filaments in this Xenia is correlated with the pre
 sence of gland cells in the stomodeeum, and that these cells, judging
 from their appearance and position, probably perform some digestive
 function.
     The siphonozooids which occur in Pennatulids and some other
  Alcyonaria are the only recorded examples of polyps in which the
 ventral and lateral mesenterial filaments are absent. According to
  Wilson these siphonozooids derive their food-supply from the auto-
  zooids or feeding-polyps, and, therefore, do not require cells to pro
 duce a digestive secretion.
     In this species of Xenia, then, the secretion in connection with the
 digestive cavity is formed, not by endoderm cells, but by cells which
  are derived from the ectoderm, as, from a study of the buds, I have
  found that the stomodaaum is ectodermic in origin in this as in other
  Alcyonaria.
     The endoderm cells which line the ccelentera and the cavities of the
  tentacles have a similar structure throughout the colony. They are

may be slender or moderately stout, and may attain a length of over
0"12 mm.       The basal part of the cell from which the pseudopodium
arises has the reticulate protoplasm of an ordinary endoderm cell, and
the nucleus of the cell is situated in this portion.           The pseudopodium
is not vacuolated;       its protoplasm exhibits a homogeneous or very
finely granular structure. The pseudopodia usually taper towards
their free end, but in a few instances this end is slightly broadened
and flattened.      In one case the pseudopodium, which is a very large
 one, bears a short branch near the middle of its length.               The pseudo
podia appear to be flexible, as in several cases they are curved so that
their tips approach the basal portion of the cells. These curious
pseudopodia-bearing         cells are very numerous, and are found in all
parts of the endoderm lining the coelentera and the cavities of the

'« On Surfusion in Metals and Alloys."                By W. C. Roberts-Austen,

                                      (P1A.TB3 8, 9.)
                                     Introduction.
    The fact that metals and alloys may be maintained in a fluid state
at temperatures which are many degrees below their true freezing
points, has been but little studied.           As regards salts the question of
surfusion has recently received much attention.                    Ostwald* has
shown, as the result of an investigation of great interest, that a very
minute quantity of a solid will cause a mass of the same substance to
pass from the surfused to the solid state.                His work, moreover, has
led him to distinguish between the meta-stable, or ordinary condi
tion in which surfusion takes place, and the labile condition which
occurs at temperatures much below the melting point.                    Ostwald's
paper, and one by M. Brillouin,t on the theory of complete and pasty
fnsion lead me to offer the Royal Society the results of some experi
 ments of my own on the surfusion of metals.
                                       Historical.
    Metals do not appear to have been studied from the point of view
 of surfusion until       the year 1880, when some excellent experiments
 on   the surfusion of gold were made by the late Dr. A. D. van
 Riemsdrjk,f by whose early death, which occurred last year, Holland
 has lost a skilful physicist. He pointed out that : —
    " Faraday, in his memoir on regelation, published in 1858, stated
 that acetic acid, sulphur, phosphorus, many metals and many solu
 tions, may be cooled below the congealing temperature prior to solidifi
 cation of the first portions."§          On the other hand, in their treatises
 on physics, Danguin||          and  Jamin^f mention tin as the only metal
 -which is capable of remaining liquid at a temperature 2"5° below
 the true melting point of the metal, which is 228° C.
    Van Riemsdijk's contribution to the subject of surfusion of metals
 consisted in showing that the well-known pheuomenon of eclair, the
 brilliant flash of light which often attends the solidification of the
 metal in the ordinary assay of gold, is really due to surfusion. He

also pointed out that surf usion could be either stimulated or hindered
by suitably modifying the conditions, but he made no attempt at
thermal measurements.          It was not until ten years after the publica
tion of van Riemsdijk's work that the recording pyrometer, which                      I
devised and submitted to the Royal Society in 1891,* enabled such
measurements to be readily effected.
    It consists of a camera, enclosing a dead-beat galvanometer, to
which the free ends of a thermo-junction are attached. The thermo-
junction is suitably protected, and, as it only consists of two 'wires,
twisted together and covered with a fine clay tube, it can be placed
in the cooling mass of molten metal or alloy, and the cooling curve
of the mass may be traced by a spot of light from the galvanometer
which falls on a moving sensitised plate.                  A ready method for
studying all the phenomena of the solidification of               mefcals and alloys
is thus afforded.
    The freezing point of a metal, or the initial freezing point of an
alloy, for a fluid mass of two metals may possess many points of
solidification, is represented by one or other of three typical curves.
These are shown in the accompanying figures which indicate the

 nature   of the curves, traced by the recording pyrometer.                    Fig. 1
 shows    the freezing    point   curve    of   a  pure    metal,   the   horizontal
 portion, 06, indicating the actual solidification of the mass, the
 sharpness of the angles at a and 6 attesting the purity of the metal.
 The initial freezing point of most alloys would resemble fig. 1 in
 having the corner a sharp, while the point 6 is generally rounded
 off.   If the alloyed metals form an isomorphous mixture, neither
 angle is sharp, and in many cases there is no true freezing point, the
 curve being of the form shown in fig. 2.                     This represents the
 freezing of the gold-silver alloy containing 28 per cent, of gold in
 which the fluid mass, as a whole, passes through a long pasty range

fication of the other two types, indicates the occurrence of surfusion,
and, aB a case in point, pure gold has been taken, the bend at o,
fig. 3, showing the amount of surfnsion which was observed.                       I
have detected pronounced cases of surfusion not only in gold but in
copper, bismuth, antimony, lead, and tin.             Surfusion, moreover, is
not confiued to pure metals, and I showed in 1893* that the eutectic
alloy in the bismuth-copper series presents a marked case of snr-
 fusion.

     In order to study surfusion, it is necessary to make the galvano
 meter, to which the thermo-junction is attached, very sensitive, and,
 by suitable adjustment, it is easy to catch on the sensitised plate any
 desired portion of the range of the spot of light.             It is, however,
 preferable to balance by a potentiometer the current which results
 from the heating of the thermo-junction, and in this way to prevent
 the mirror from swinging through a long range. The sensitiveness
 of the instrument is but slightly diminished by the introduction
  of the potentiometer.      As the thermo-junction cools down, the spot
 of light from the galvanometer is simply made to traverse a short
  distance many times, instead of a long range once.              The sensitised

plate need only be exposed to the action of the spot of light at the
critical moment, when solidification or surfusion is known to be
imminent. A paper by my assistant, Mr. Stansfield, illustrating
the    use  of this method, will shortly        be  published by the Physical
Society.
   A    curve, traced by the aid of either of the sensitive methods
which have just been described, if it represents the surfusion of &
metal or alloy does not merely show a slight depression as in the
case   of pure gold shown at       a, fig. 3 : the slight depression becomes a
deep dip, (Plate        8, fig. 1, which    represents the surfusion of gold).
In this case three curves were taken on one plate, the line al
represents the heating and melting of gold, the horizontal portion
marking the actual melting of the metal.                 The lines cde and fgk.
on the other hand, represent successive coolings and solidifications
of the metal, surfusion occurring in both cases, the horizontal por
tions at e and h representing the beginning of solidification of the
gold in each case.           It is noteworthy that these successive points
of solidification differ by less than half a degree, the melting point of
the metal (the'line ah) occupying a median position between them.
During the 6urfusion, the temperature of the metal fell about 2:
below its true freezing point. Figs. 2 and 3, Plate 8, both represent
the surfusion of gold ; fig. 4, Plate 8, that of copper,* while fig. 5.
Plate 8, represents the surfusion of an alloy of antimony with 25 per
cent, of copper which freezes at 520°.            It was selected as represent
ing    the   highest temperature of surfusion which                I have as yet
examined in the case of an alloy.               Such a surfusion curve, in the
 case of an alloy, may do much more than reveal the sudden release
 of the latent heat of the fluid mass.          The curve may present a com
plicated record of modifications in molecular grouping occurring in
 the brief space of time actually occupied by surfusion.                   This is
 shown by the points d, e, in fig. 6, Plate 9, which represents the sur
 fusion of tin alloyed with 36-5 per cent, of lead. All the curves on
 Plate 9 serve as bonds connecting the behaviour of alloys with that
 of freezing solutions of salts.
    The explanation of the existence of these points, d, e, is simple.
 The freezing point curve of the lead-tin series is a very ordinary
 type, and is shown in the accompanying diagram (fig. 4), and, as
 regards the portion where the lines meet, full details are given on a
larger scale in fig. 5. It consists of two branches united at the point
 where they join a horizontal line which represents the freezing of the

temperature (183°). The eutectic constitutes a fluid residual
which is left after the        excess of either lead or tin has fallen out as
the mass cools down.           When, however, the tin is present in slight
excess of the amount required to constitute the eutectic, the whole
mass of the alloy may remain fluid at temperatures below that at
which the eutectic would naturally freeze. It may even cool to a
temperature at which it can no longer maintain all its lead in solu
tion, and some lead will, therefore, fall out while suffusion is actually
taking place. This explains the existence of the point d, which marks
an arrest in the fall of temperature, in Plate 9, fig. 6 (on the line ab,
representing the fall of temperature during surf usion).     Conversely,
when the surfusion is ended, the latent heat is released, and the
line bee represents the rise of temperature due to the release of latent
heat.   There should also be on this line an indication of a retarda
tion or arrest in the rise of temperature, because the lead which fell
out of solution (at the point d) has to be re-melted.      This point of
arrest   will   be found at e.
  In  the same way, in fig. 7, Plate 9, which represents a fine case of
surfusion in the lead-tin alloy containing 64 per cent, of tin, there is
also a point at/, on the line gh, at which point the lead fell cut of
solution during the surfusion.     Fig. 8, Plate 9, represents the sur-
fnsion of a lead-tin alloy containing 68 per cent, of tin. In this case
the tin is in large excess, and freezes first. In becoming solid, the
tin would have been represented by a horizontal line somewhere
about the point      s,      line
                          on the        ij,
                                       had not surfusion occurred, and

by the solidification of the eutectic mother liquor represented by
the line Im.    This eutectic does not surfuse because the tin (the
metal in this alloy which       prone to surfuse)
                                   is                  already present in

at n probably indicates that the lead in the eutectic may surfase
slightly even though the crystallisation of tin has begun.
    By taking a series of lead-tin alloys which do not contain more than
2 or 3 per cent, of tin, in addition to the amount required to constitute
the eutectic     (62 per cent, of tin), the temperatures at which the
lead begins to crystallise below 183°, can be measured.                      The results

 but in all the alloys one of the freezing points (the eutectic) is at

 recorded while surfusion occurred.                   For instance, take the alloy
 containing 64 per cent, of tin, its initial freezing point would be at
 a (185°), that of its eutectic at b (183°), while the third freezing
 point, c (176°), is due, as has already been explained, to the falling
 out of lead while the fluid mass was in the surfused condition.                       In
 order to observe the uppermost of the three points (185°), it is
 necessary to stir the mass to prevent the possibility of snrfasion.
 On the other hand, a record of the lowest freezing point can only be
 obtained in a fluid mass which is perfectly tranquil.                       When lines
 are drawn through all the points recorded it will be seen that the
 line AB, representing the solidification of lead, extends far below the
 horizontal line XX. It should be remembered that if the fluid mass

                   On Surfusion       in Metals and Alloys.                  453-
is stirred, the first point to   be recorded     will be the   upper or tin point
(185°), followed by the eutectic point (183°).            If the alloy surfuses,
the first point recorded will be the lowest point (176°), followed in
turn by the eutectic. In general, therefore, only two freezing points
can be obtained in a single record.
   In the case of salts the crossing of the curves of solubility has
already been observed by H. le Chatelier and by Dahms, but in the
case of alloys, experimental evidence has hitherto been wanting.
Tbe silver-copper series presents many analogies to the lead-tin
series.   Heycock and Neville*, in their excellent work on the com
plete freezing point curves of many series of alloys, have calculated
what the ideal freezing point curve of the silver-copper series would
be, but the present paper affords, I believe, the first experimental
evidence as to the identity of the behaviour of saline solutions and
metallic alloys as regards selective snrfusion.
   Prolonged experience in these methods of manipulation may prove
that it is possible to effect the separation of a particular metal or
definite groups of metals by dropping in (during the surfusion of the
fluid mass) a fragment of the same metal or of the particular group
of the associated metals it is intended to separate. It is woll known
that the introduction of a fragment of the same metal or of an iso-
morphons metal or alloy will determine its solidification.                Such a
method may readily be employed in studying the surfusion of salts.
In the case of metals, so far as my own experiments go, the sur-
fused state is singularly unstable, for it may be disturbed even by
very slight tremors.      It remains to be seen whether it is possible to
arrange   the experiments in such a way as to maintain metals and
alloys for an indefinite time in Ostwald's meta-stable condition
which would need the presence of a particle of soljd matter to
induce the solidification of the mass.
   Ostwald applies to the change from liquid to solid the equation
which represents the gas-liquid change. In the former case there
are, however, the three phases, solid, liquid and gas, present, and a
complete expression of the change must take account of all three.
Thus during surfusion the gas phase is in equilibrinm with the liquid
phase, but when solidification has begun the gas phase must also be
in equilibrium with the solid phase. It is possible that the solidi
fication of the mass may be started by crystals deposited directly
from its vapour so that solidification of a surfused metal may be
started by crystals from its own metallic atmosphere.               The amount
of gas evolved by a solid metal is, of course, very small.             Evidence
of the vaporization of metals at very moderate temperatures is not
 wanting. Demarcyt showed in 1882 that in vacuo metals evaporate
                    * 'Phil. Trans.,* A, vol. 189 (1897), p. 26.

454                  Prof. D. Mendeleeff.        Experimental
at much lower temperatures than they do at ordinary atmospheric
pressure.     Pellat* pointed out that the proximity of the surface
of a metal to that of another metal in air, changes its electrical con
dition, and he attributed this to vaporization of metals, showing
that even ii-on exerted an influence at a distance. Colsonf showed
that a photographic plate was affected by the vapour of certain
metals, notably by zinc, cadmium, and magnesium even through
porous septa.         Dr. RussellJ in some recent and very interesting
                   experiments, was led to the conclusion that even so
                   infusible a metal as cobalt will by vaporization, affect
                   a photographic plate. In January, 1897, before hearing
                   of Dr. Russell's experiments, I began some experi
                   ments with a view to ascertain whether metals, vapor
                   ized in vacuo near the ordinary temperature, will
                   actually unite to form alloys.           The arrangement is
                   shown in fig. 6.         A and B are two discs of metal
                   with polished surfaces separated by a ring of glass, the
                   whole being enclosed in a vacuous tube which could be
                   heated in a water bath.        I found that when cadmium
                   and silver were opposed for eight days at a tempera
                   ture of 50° an appreciable deposit of a tinted cadmium-
                   silver alloy formed on the surface of the silver.
                   Cadmium must, therefore, have passed across the
                   interval between the discs A and B.
                      The results given in the present paper, reveal addi
                   tional points of similarity between the behaviour of
alloys and that of ordinary saline solutions.             I trust, therefore, that
it may be useful as a continuation of ray investigation on the
" Diffusion of Metals," which formed the subject of the Bakerian
Lecture of 1896.

    In the year 1893 the Central Chamber of Weights and Measures
(Glavnaya Palata Mer y Vesov) was created in St. Petersburg to act
as a Central Institution of the Empire for the verification of all
kinds of standard measures.             Having been appointed Director of
the above-mentioned Institution, I was first of all occupied in

                   Investigations   on the Oscillations   of Balances.        455
making arrangements for accurate weighings, whereby                 some improve
ments have been introduced in the usual methods ; a detailed
description will be found in the official report on the renewal of
Russian standards of measure and weight.
    The results of the work show that with the balances of our
Institution we are able to find the difference between two platinuoi-
iridinm kilogram weights by one single weighing with an accuracy
of ± 0'02 milligram, and by a system of weighings to ± 0-002
milligram with a probable error of a few ten-thousandths of a
milligram.
    We have a number of such balances, bnt those mostly used were
constructed by the well-known balance makers of Vienna, Ruprecht
and Nemetz ; some important improvements have been made upon
these balancer, especially in the direction of minimising the in
 fluence of the observer.
    Having obtained such results in accurate weighings, I have used
 them, not only in the comparison of standards of weight, but also in
 an experimental research on the oscillations of a balance, hoping to
 collect some material, not only for an investigation of balances of
different systems and constructions in general, and of the friction of
the knife-edges, but especially to find the action of gravity and
moment of inertia on such a pendulum as is represented by an
accurate balance.
    If we consider the time of one oscillation (from 30 to 60 seconds),
 we find that our balances correspond to synchronous mathematical
 pendulums of a length equal to 1000 — 3000 metres. The investiga
 tions in this direction are not yet completed, but one part of the
                                                   I
 results obtained is now in print, and would like to communicate an
 abstract to the Fellows of the Royal Society.
    Before going into the matter, I must explain that the many
 hundreds of observations of the times of oscillation and the changes
 in the scale-reading have been made by my friends and assistants,
 especially F. P. Zavadsky, V. D. Sapogenikoff, and also by Messrs.
 Dobrokhotoff, K. Egoroff, Miller, and Misses Ozarovskaya and
 Endymionova.      Their active co-operation has greatly contributed
 to the success of the experiments, and I am much indebted to them
 for verifying the numerous calculations which this research involves.
    In the investigations mentioned, the following data were ob
served   :   —
   1. The readings of the scale,      were observed through
                                             Z„,                   tele   a
scope after reflection from a mirror attached to the beam of the
balance,      the first reading.
             Zi   is             One division of the scale corresponds
in the different balances to an angle of from 0-5 to    minutes.4   The
readings were taken by estimation                  to 0"05 division, which agrees
nearly with the probable error in          I.

456                   Prof. D. Mendeleeff.          Experimental
    From every set of four to five readings the position of equilibrium
 L« was deduced, and the amplitudes rn, hy taking the differences
between Z» and L„.          The difference between r„ and r„+i is called in
what follows the decrement D„.
    2. The time of the passage through the position of equilibrium,
T„, was determined partly by the use of a chronographic watch,
partly by Marey's cylindrical chronograph, reductions having been
 made to true astronomical mean time by comparisons with our
standard clock (Hohwii 31) controlled by signals from the Pulkova
Astronomical Observatory.
    From the observed T„ was deduced the mean duration (in seconds
of mean time) of one oscillation, i.e., from i» to Z„+,.
    3. k, the number of milligrams corresponding                 to one division of
the scale.
    4. e, the weight in milligrams of a litre of air inside the balance
case, according to readings of the thermometer (±0"003°), barometer
and Assman's       psychrometer.
    5.  p, the weight of the load on each pan expressed in grams.
    6. P, the weight of the whole moving mass of the balance and the
load in grams.
    7. r, the volume of the load in millilitres.                 The same has an
influence on tn and D,„ and we have examined the change of Ds
and    tH.
    I. The Variation ofD and        t depending     on the value of one oscillation,
              R/i = L—Ih+i, or amplitude, rn = (L»— 1„)( — 1)»*
   The duration of one oscillation, all other conditions being constant
in all six examined balances without exception decreases with decreasing
oscillations or amplitudes. These variations are not only many times
greater than the errors of the readings, but many hundred times
surpass the corrections of the time of one oscillation, as deduced
from the usual formula for the reduction of the oscillations of a
pendulum to infinitely small amplitudes.                  The decrease of the time
of one oscillation in the most simple manner can be expressed in first
approximation by the formula
                                      tH  =         . . .
                                                                                  (1).
Therefore                         T. = Q-U/S-",
where
                                         log. nat. ft"
and                                 Q =      T0-U.
  *   r, is Tery nearly equal to }B, but   I prefer to give D and t in relation to r»,
because by this method the small errors in     L„ disappear.

   More clearly visible is the decrease of D with decreasing amplitude
rn, and it is sufficient to observe four readings.  The experimental
law of the decrease of D by first approximation can be represented
by the formula
                                         D»   = d+xrH,
where d is the limit of the decrement in the case of infinitely small
amplitudes, and a a constant coefficient, which in all examined
balances varied between 0 0010 and 0'0002. Observations relating
to t» and D„ have been made in a very great number, and all of them
confirm the above given result.*
     Therefore
                                                d-1
or                                     — = Kd"-N,
where                                  N =    r^—    ,

                                                     r0
  Similar facts about t and D have been shortly mentioned before,f
bat little notice of them has been taken. But in our very numerous
observations these facts stand out so clearly and beyond doubt, that
also in the ordinary simple pendulums we must suppose the existence
of similar deviations which only by their smallness have escaped the
attention of the observers.     I have commenced the investigation of
a simple pendulum    in this direction.
   As D and t are varying with the amplitude r„, in what follows
D and t will be given for the case when r = 15 divisions, using the
signs D14 and tls.

 That    is to say, the time of one oscillation in the last case is one-half
 of    that when an agate plane is nsed, although the load and the
 position of the centre of gravity were the same in both cases.
     Therefore the experiment shows a great dependence of the time of
 one oscillation decrement and of the sensibility from the friction of
 the lenife-edges, although usually it is assumed that t and A; do not
 directly depend upon the friction.               Further experiments are going
 on, especially as regards the changes found in the value of the
 decrement.*

     If  we put on the pans of the Ruprecht's balance two platinum-
 iridium pounds (Russian) (cylinders of which the height and diameter
 are equal and the weight 409-5 grams), we find k — 0'033 milligram,
 t about 44-4 sees., and D about T0175 ; replacing these weights by
 two plates of 914 square cm. section (of the same weight 409'5 grams),
 we find t about 39'7 sees., and D about T0240.
     VI. Variation of t and D with the Variation of the Volume of the

     The experiments will be continued and extended, and I hope to
  obtain results which will throw more light on the little explored
  regions of the oscillation of a balance considered as a physical
  pendulum of peculiar properties.
     Some results will probably be applicable to the ordinary physical
  pendulum.
     But, for the moment, I would not like to make any theoretical
  generalisations.

" On the Determination of the Magnetic Susceptibility of Rocks.''
      By A. W. ROcker, Sec. R.S., and W. H. White, A.RC.S.
      Received July       6, 1898,    and published during the vacation.
   In  the Report of the Magnetic Survey of the United Kingdom*
the question as to how far the local and regional magnetic dis
turbances of the earth's field may be ascribed to the influence of
masses   of magnetic rocks was discussed by Professors Riicker and
Thorpe.f
   In a previous paperj a method for the determination of the
magnetic susceptibilities      of rocks was given, together with values
for the specimens then examined. It was considered desirable to add
to this relatively small number of results so as to obtain a broader
basis for the development of the theory.            Accordingly Sir Archibald
Geikie, F.R.S., Director-General of the Geological Survey, has been
good enough to snpply ns with a typical series of specimens of the
basic rocks of the country, and, after a complete overhauling of the
method originally adopted, we have measured the susceptibility of
sixty-eight of these new specimens of forty-five different rocks. The
earlier stages of the work were carried out by Mr. F. Fisher, A.R.G.S.,
who would, no doubt, have taken part in the whole had he not left
the college for an appointment elsewhere.
   The principle of this method of determining the susceptibility of
small pieces of feebly magnetic materials is to compare the suscepti
bility of the fragment with that of the displaced volume of liquids
of known susceptibility in which it is immersed.
   In more detail, the method is as follows : —
   (a) To measure the susceptibility of the magnetic liquids a tube
containing the liquid is introduced into one of two eqnal solenoids,
the effects of which on a small magnetometer destroy each other. In
these experiments a field of seven absolute units was employed.           The
ratio of the deflection caused by the tube of liquid to that produced
by a measuring solenoid traversed by a small current, multiplied by
the computed constant of the instrument, gives the absolute sus
ceptibility of the liquid.
   The apparatus was figured and described on pp. 506 — 509, * Roy.
Soc. Proc.,' vol. 48, 1890.
   (b) The differences of susceptibility of rocks and liquids are
measured on the calibrated sonometer scale of a Hughes' induction
balance.    Two tubes, filled with a liquid to the sufficient depth of
6 cm., are balanced, and the distance         through which the compensator

          Determination of   the Magnetic Susceptibility of Rocks.    461
has to    be moved to produce silence    after the introduction of a small
piece of   a rock into one of the tubes is noted. This is repeated with
liquids of different strengths.       Then if a, b are the differences
observed between the rock of susceptibility x and two liquids of
susceptibility hi, &j respectively, we have
                  a      K]— x         ,        6X] — aK3
                  b      Kj— x                     b—a
due regard being given to the signs of the differences.
    The liquid employed was pure glycerine in which finely divided
magnetic oxide of iron was suspended, for no solutions of metallic
salts possess a susceptibility sufficiently high for our purpose. These
liquids were very carefully prepared, and in the light of the expe
rience now gained it is desirable to add to tbe statements made in
the earlier paper on this point. Natural magnetite cannot be ground
 fine enough to remain long in suspension, though experiments in
 ¦which a coarsely powdered mixture of magnetite and manganese di
oxide (minerals of about the same specific gravity) was shaken in
 water and allowed to settle rapidly into a solid mass were fairly
successful.
    Finally, the magnetic oxide was prepared artificially by adding
 ammonia to 9 boiling solution of sulphate of iron of which one-half
 had been oxidised by nitric acid. The black precipitate, dehydrated
 by alcohol and dried at 100°, gives a friable dark brown mass about
 one and a half times as magnetic as a good specimen of the powdered
 mineral.
    By grinding with glycerine between glass plates the oxide is
 reduced to minute yellow scales.     Glycerine mixtures made with this
 substance give no indications of settling for forty-eight honrs.
    Numerous experiments with various suspensions of natural magne
 tite called attention to the fact that in a magnetic field the particles
 rotated slowly to set their axes along the lines of force, thus giving a
 fictitious susceptibility largely dependent on the permanent magneti
 sation of the grains of magnetite. With the artificial oxide this effect
 is extremely small, but, to avoid it altogether, we prepared gelatinised
 glycerine mixtures which at ordinary temperatures become solid.
 In this state we repeatedly determined, firstly, their absolute sus
 ceptibility with the magnetometer apparatus, and, secondly, the
 value in sonometer scale divisions of each balance tube filled with
 the jelly. With these particular tubes one division = susceptibility
 O0001075.      The balance tubes being thus standardised, the absolute
 magnetic value of a liquid is determined by the induction balance
 under exactly the same conditions that hold during the tests of
  rocks.

                         Sensitiveness  and Accuracy.
   The errors arising from various sources have been carefully con
sidered.     They naturally fall into two groups —
   First. Errors in the determination of the primary standard of sus
ceptibility, and affecting all results equally.
   Second.     Errors affecting individual specimens.
   1. Under the first heading come the probable errors in the mag
netometer constant and readings.
   In the value of the constant there is an estimated probable error
of + 1 per cent. Combining with this several smaller errors dne to
temperature, variation of resistances, imperfect adjustment, external
magnetic disturbances, &c, we conclude that the susceptibility of
each standard jelly is subject to a probable error + 2 per cent. The
two jellies actually gave factors 0-000109 and 0"000106 (the error of
constant being the same in each case). Presumably the mean factor
0*0001075 is within + 2 per cent, of the truth.
   2. Errors in the values of individual rocks arise from the limited
sensitiveness of induction balance, telephone, and ear. The values
of the magnetic liquids are not appreciably affected by this, bat it
becomes important in the case of rock specimens of small size and
feeble susceptibility.
   In the earlier paper already referred to it was stated 0"00013 was
the lower limit to the range of measurement by the methods adopted
and experiments made since with magnetic and non-magnetic sub
stances indicate about the same degree of accuracy.        For moderate
susceptibilities, however, the accuracy now attained has been greater
than in the earlier work, and the errors cannot in most cases be much
greater than 1 per cent. The difference between two specimens taken
from the same rock is of course greater than this, as the composition
of the rocks is not uniform.
   It is not    necessary to give a detailed   example of an experiment.
Suffice  it to say that in  a   particular case the susceptibility of the
rock (No. 2) was determined by comparison (1) with liquids H and
D of susceptibilities 0 00074 and 0 00357, and (2) with liquids
H and C of susceptibilities 000074 and 0-00250. The results
obtained were 0-00104 and 0-00179, the mean being 0-00172.
   The agreement of these two values is not particularly good, though
not exceeding the probable error given above.
   For some unrecorded reason this specimen was tested again, and
gave—
                       From D and H', as = 0-00174
                          „ C and H', x = 0 001 70
                               Mean value = 0 001 72
   The susceptibility   was not in this case computed from mixtures D

          Determination   of the Magnetic Susceptibility    of Rocks.    463
and C taken together, for that       would   introduce extrapolation,  which
we avoid as much as possible.
     In the case of the three specimens of susceptibilities     greater than
O'Ol we are compelled to extrapolate beyond our strongest mixture,
and with the eighteen specimens below O'OOl we make our weakest
mixture a factor in the extrapolations.
     In some  instances (e.g., No. 45) there is a very distinct difference in
the strength of two pieces broken off the same hand specimen.
     A few of the specimens used in the earlier investigations were
 re-examined, and gave considerably larger susceptibilities than those
 previously measured. This is probably due to an error in the deter
 minations of the absolute value of the susceptibilities of the liquids
 employed, but in the case of any individual rock this error would not
 exceed the difference often observed between two different fragments
 of the same specimen. The fact also that the mean value now obtained
  is almost exactly the     same   as that formerly given (viz., 0'00255   as
  against O00245) justifies the conclusions based upon the use of this
  or the smaller number (0-00160) which was used in many of the
  calculations on the magnetic effects of basaltic rocks. The accuracy
  of the absolute values now given has been tested by experiments on
  ferric chloride.   Although the susceptibility of this substance is
  much smaller than that of most of the rocks, the result of our
  measurements was in close accord with the means of values deduced
  from the experiments of Quincke and Townsend.

            Detection and Localisation          of Phosphorus in Tissues.              4(57
 " On     the Detection and Localisation of Phosphorus in Animal
        and Vegetable Tissues."               By A. B. Macallum, Associate-
        Professor of Physiology, University of Toronto.                             Com
        municated by Professor SHERRINGTON', F.R.S.                          Received
        June 15,— Read June 16, 1898.
    The distribution of phosphorus, like that of organic iron, in tissues,
 is a question of considerable importance to the cytologist and it is
 therefore necessary that the method of detection for this element,
 should be a satisfactory one. There are difficulties, however, which
 make the micro-chemical detection of phosphorus less easy than in
 the case of iron, for there is no precipitate holding phosphorus which,
 under the microscope, gives as striking a demonstration of its
 presence as ferrous sulphide does of iron. Ammonium phospho-
 molybdate is, in the test-tube, a markedly coloured precipitate, but
 when its constituent crystals are examined under the microscope the
colour observed counts for little. When also, as in tissues, the pre
 cipitate may be in a much more finely divided form, the canary-
yellow colour may be so faint that it is indistinguishable from the
yellow produced in the tissue by the action of the nitric acid in the
precipitating reagent, although Jolly* holds that the yellow colour of
the phospho-molybdate compound in the tissue cannot be simulated
by dilate nitric acid.
    To get over these difficulties Lilienfeld and Montif used pyrogallol
to reduce the molybdic portion of the compound to the condition of a
lower oxide after they had, by washing the preparations in water,
removed the uncombined molybdate of ammonia from the tissues.
*'
   Pyrogallol gives, in the test-tube with phospho-molybdic acid, an
intense colour varying from brown to black, whereby lower oxides of
molybdenum arise." J In speaking in another place of the action
of pyrogallol on the phospho-molybdate, they state that it gives, in
the parts of the preparations rich in phosphorus and according to
the quantity of the latter, " a yellow, brown, or black colour."
    Baciborski§ points out that the reaction of pyrogallol with
ammonium phospho-molybdate in the test-tube is a green one, while
that produced with ammonium molybdate is a brown one. This
author further states that the green reaction is obtained in the
tissues of Euphorbia wherever                 crystals of ammonium             phospho-

molybdate occur, but a brown colour in other parts of an intensity
which varies according to the length of time during which the pre
paration is washed, but if it is long and continuously treated with
water no brown colour appears.               The brown, therefore, would be due
to molybdate of ammonium, and is no indication of the presence of
the phosphorus compound.
   Heine* was unable to confirm Raciborski's observations regarding
the reaction produced by pyrogallol, but he found, using stannous
chloride     as    a reducing     agent, that almost invariably a blue reaction
appeared, which may pass eventually into a dirty green colour.                             In
the test-tube also the reaction with the reducing agent is, according
to the amount of the molybdate present, as well as to the strength
of acidity in the fluid, a green, brown, or blue one, whether phosphates
are present or not.
    Pollacci,f using zinc chloride as a reducing reagent, fonnd the
resulting colour range from dark blue to grey.
    It is evident from the foregoing that there is error somewhere in
the observations which have been made on the action of pyrogallol
on ammonium phosplio-molybdate,                  and it is obvious that, if Raci-
borski is right in his contention, then the results of the investigations
of Lilienfeld and Monti, relying as they did upon the yellow, brown,
                                                                      "

or black        reaction to indicate the presence of phosphorus, must be
wrong. As a number of observers, including Sherrington, Grourlay,§            J
and Held, || have used the same method and the same criteria on
special tissue elements, it is therefore important to know the truth
 concerning the results so obtained.
    My observations confirm Raciborski's on the action                    of pyrogallol
on ammonium phospho-molybdate.                     When the former, in solution,
aqueous       or   ethereal,  is   allowed   to   act    on the thoroughly washed
phospho-molybdate precipitate, the canary yellow of the latter is inva
riably turned to green, even in the presence of nitric acid, and this
 colour is maintained for a conple of hours, after which the precipi
tate takes up slowly a darker shade, until at the end of twenty-four
 hours it has a black colour with a faint shade of green in thin layers.
 The form of the crystals, which are black, is maintained.                       When the

reducing reagent is allowed to act on a nitric acid solution of ammo
nium molybdate, a brownish-black or black colour is produced, and an
amorphous precipitate may be formed, which, under the microscope
lias a grey blue-black appearance, the fluid itself remaining brown,
the colour being due to the oxidised pyrogallol. At the end of
twenty-four hours the amorphous elements are black, with or with
out a brown shade. When, on the other hand, pyrogallol acts on
ammonium molybdate in solution the resulting colour is deep brown,
very much like that of a saturated solution of Bismarck brown,
"which is maintained at the end of twenty-four hours, but in no case
is a precipitate formed. It must be noted in this case that the colour
formed results immediately on the addition of the pyrogallol.
    That what happens in the test-tube is what also obtains in tissues
 nuiy be shown readily. If one impregnates sections of tissue with
ammonium molybdate for an hour or more, these, thoroughly washed
 and then treated with a pyrogallol solution, give a brown colour,
 which is most marked in the parts of the cells which have an affinity
for colouring matters. It is obvious that in the absence of nitric acid
there is no phospho-molybdate compound present, and yet the reducing
reagent shows that though repeated washings were resorted to, the
ammonium molybdate has not been removed. On the other hand,
 when the tissues are placed in a nitric acid solution of ammonium
 molybdate the results obtained are strikingly different.         One may
conveniently demonstrate these by placing fresh Spirogyra        threads  in
                                                                  —
the solution for from five to ten hours at a temperature of 35 40° C,
 then washing them quickly in distilled water and putting them in a
 freshly prepared strong aqueous solution of pyrogallol. In ten
 minutes the threads may be again washed, dehydrated, cleared in oil
 of cedar, and mounted in balsam. Wherever in such preparations
 one expects to find phosphorus, e.g., in the nuclei, it is demonstrated
 by the green reaction. If the pyrogallol is allowed to act longer
 than ten minutes it begins to stain the cells and to mark the green
 more or less with a brown coloration, which distributes itself in them
 as colouring matters generally do.
    Perhaps the most striking way of demonstrating that the phospho-
 molybdate is turned green and the molybdate brown by the action of
 pyrogallol, is by impregnating portions of thin strips of writing paper
 with a solution of sodic phosphate, drying them, and then submitting
 them to the action of the nitric-molybdate solution, which gives them
 a yellow colour.     On now washing them in distilled water, and sub
 mitting  them  to  the pyrogallol solution, the areas which are impreg
 nated with the phospho-molybdate        become green in a few seconds,
 while the parts which contain the molybdate solution alone become
 brown or yellowish-brown, and the contrast between the two reac
 tions thus appears marked.

 470       Prof. A. B. Macallum.          Detection and Localisation
    The error at the base of the process adopted by Lilienfeld and
 Monti has been the assumption that it is possible to wash out of
 tissues all traces of the ammonium molybdate not combined with
 phosphoric acid.        I have found that when the stamens of Erythro-
 niurn americanum, treated for twenty-four hours with the nitric-
 molybdate solution, were washed with distilled water many times for
 five months, they gave, at the end of that time, marked evidence of
 the presence in them of ammonium molybdate.                 The addition of
 stannous chloride brought out everywhere in such preparations the
 appearance of the blue molybdic oxide, whereas, when such prepara
 tions were treated with pyrogallol solution, the phospho-molybdate
compound was found to be limited in its distribution.             From animal
 tissues also,   I  have found it impossible to remove by washing the
 molybdate reagent.          Indeed, one may succeed thus in removing the
 phospho-molybdate compound rather than the other.
    Heine* also has specially insisted on the strong affinity that cell
substances, those which contain phosphorus as well as those which
do not, have for ammonium molybdate, forming with the latter,
 compounds insoluble in water or in dilute nitric acid solutions.               He
prepared a quantity of liiston, free from phosphorus compounds,
 which, after treatment with the nitric-molybdate reagent and after
frequent washings, gave with stannous chloride abundant evidence of
 the presence of ammonium molybdate.
    One is consequently justified in concluding           that the results of
Lilienfeld      and   Monti's    observations,   based as they are on the
" yellow, brown, or black " reaction of the pyrogallol, are incorrect,
and    that while       the   reaction may appear in phosphorus-holding
elements,     it  is simply a coincidence, and not an indication of the
presence of phosphorus.
    The property of pyrogallol to form, in the reduction of the
molybdate and tho phospho-molybdate compounds, a coloured sub
stance which can be taken by cellular elements just in the same way
and to about the same extent that they take up other colouring
matters in solution, constitutes an objection to the use of this
reducing reagent. It is not possible to be certain in all cases in regard
to the length of time during which it is to be allowed to act, and,
consequently, a very faint green may be obscured by a light brown
reaction, resulting either from the oxidised pyrogallol or from the
reduced molybdate in the presence of traces of nitric acid.
    In consequence of this objection,       I  endeavoured to find a reducing
reagent which would leave the molybdate compound, in the presence
of nitric acid, unaffected, while it would markedly react with the
phospho-molybdate, not only in the test-tube, but in tissues.                Zinc

chloride does this, but in an unsatisfactory way.        It is very slow in
its action, and feeble in its reducing power.      It gives a green reac
tion with the phospho-molybdate compound, but none with the
molybdate in the presence of nitric acid. Stannous chloride reduces
both the compounds at once, forming the blue oxide of molybdenum,
and therefore it is, for the point in view, valueless. Ferrous sulphate
is also very slow in its action, and it has the disadvantage of giving
a faint green colour to the tissue, independent of that which may be
produced in the phospho-molybdate compound.
    The reagent which I found the most valuable from every point of
view is phenylhydraziu hydrochloride.          This, in an aqueous solu
          —
tion of 1 & per cent, strength, is certain in its action if it is freshly
prepared or not more more than two or three days old. It, in the
absence of alcohol or of a caustic alkali, makes a very marked dis
tinction between the molybdate and the phospho-molybdate com
pounds. It gives with the former, in powder, the brown oxide at
once, in solution, a brownish precipitate which may or may not
appear immediately, depending on the strength of the solution, but
in a solution of the molybdate containing nitric acid, e.g., that used
as the reagent for phosphoric acid, it has no apparent effect on the
molybdenum compound, although, in a few minutes, a soluble, red
dish, aromatic compound may be formed in the solution.              On the
other hand, with phospho-molybdates, either in the presence or in
the absence of ammonium molybdate, or nitric acid, or of both, it
gives at once the dark-green oxide of molybdenum.                 Examined
 under the microscope, the crystals of the phospho-molybdate aloue
are found to have the green colour, which, after an hour's action of
the phenylhydrazin, is so dark as to suggest, at first sight, black.
 That this reaction depends upon the presence of phosphoric acid,
 may be clearly shown by adding to a mixture of the reducing
reagent and of the nitric molybdate solution a quantity of phos
phoric acid solution.     Although the mixture will stand for several
minutes without any change other than the formation of a slightly-
 reddish solution, yet on the addition of the acid solution the dark-
 green reaction appears immediately and markedly, sometimes accom
 panied by the formation of a blue-violet soluble compound.              No
 other acid exercises a like effect.     Solutions of potassium hydrate
 and sodic hydrate and alcohol, in a certain proportion, will call forth
 in the mixture a greenish-blue or blue colour, which, in the case of
 the alcohol preparation, fades out in twenty-four hours.           In this
 latter, the colour would appear to be due to the formation of an
 aromatic compound, and not directly to an alteration in the molyb
 date.   Nitric acid alone will produce, in a solution of phenylhydr
 azin, a reddish colour, and rarely also, when ammonium molybdate is
 present, a blue- violet colour, which appears to be due to a phenylic

472        Prof. A. B. Macallum.      Detection and Localisation
 compound.       What the conditions    are, under    which this coloured
 compound is produced, have not been determined, but this reaction
 cannot interfere with or confuse the results of the action of the
 reducing reagent on the phospho-molybdate compound.
    On the molybdate and phospho-molybdate          compounds distributed
 in animal and vegetable tissues, the phenylhydrazin hydrochloride
acts as   it does on these in the test-tube. It is not necessary to free
 the tissue preparations from ammonium molybdate.             They may be
 placed for a minute or two in a dilute solution of nitric acid, after
 ¦which  they are transferred to the reducing solution, which, in less
 than two minutes, brings out the green colour where the phospho-
 molybdate compound occnrs, but a faint yellow reaction where
ammonium       molybdate alone is present.    Instead of dilute nitric acid,
 one may use distilled water, but it is not necessary to do even this,
 for if the preparations are transferred directly to the reducing- fluid
 ¦with but what may adhere to them of the nitric-molybdate solution,
the result is the same.
    When the reducing fluid has been allowed to act for the proper
 length of time the preparations are washed in distilled water, then
dehydrated, cleared in oil of cedar, and mounted in balsam.            Pre
 parations made in this way four months ago are now quite as satis
factory   as they were at first.
    Reference to the other reagents and methods which have been
used is also necessary.      The nitric-molybdate reagent was made by
dissolving one part of pure molybdic acid (MoOj) in four parts of
strong ammonia, and adding thereto, slowly, fifteen parts of nitric
 acid, sp. gr. 12. The proportions indicate weights. The resulting
solution had a faint yellow tinge, and, after decantation from the
very slight sediment, remained free from a precipitate as long as
any of it was unused.
    Fresh tissue material was used as well as that which had been
hardened in alcohol.      The alcohol material is the best, for the nitric
acid, before it converts the phosphorus compounds in fresh tissue
elements into orthophosphoric acid, must dissolve a portion at least
of the phosphorus-holding proteids, and thus the phosphorus when
converted may not be distributed as intra vitam.         I  have, however,
used fresh     material, wherever  possible,   to compare  with  that hard
ened in alcohol.      The latter offers advantages in the fixed form of
the elements, and in the preparation of thin sections which readily
permit the uniform action of the reagent as well as the extraction of
lecithin and inorganic phosphates.
    The time during which the reagent was allowed to act on the pre
parations varied from ten minutes to twenty-four, and even, in some
cases, forty-eight hours.     It was found that a temperature of 35° C.
favoured considerably     the formation  of the phospho-molybdate.     The

               of Phosphorus in Animal and               Vegetable    Tissues.         473
formation is a progressive one, the extent of the reaction appearing
to have some relation to the time employed. The inorganic phos
phates are first affected, then lecithin, the organic phosphorus being
much more slowly converted into the orthophosphate.
     According to Liebermann,* the phosphorus found in such com
pounds as nnclein and nucleic acid is in the form of monometa-
phosphate, but Kosself has thrown doubt on the results on which
this view is based, and he claims that the facts point rather to the
occurrence of other anhydrous forms of phosphoric acid in these
compounds.            JollyJ has inferred from his experiments that in
organic compounds of phosphorus the latter does not occur in the
 unoxidised metalloid (" metalloidique non oxyde integre ") form.
 Milroy§ has found that in the digestion of nuclein compounds with
 trypsin, some of the phosphorus is set free as orthophosphoric acid,
 but the greater part (89'08 — 9T63 percent.), occurring in an organic
 form, does not possess the characters of metaphospboric acid, for its
 solutions may be boiled a long time without producing an increase
 in the amount of the ortho compound present.
     As the nitric-molybdic reagent reacts only with the ortho form of
 phosphoric acid, it is obvious that the organic phosphorus in the
 tissues must be put in the condition of orthophoshoric acid. Lilienfeld
 and Monti treated the fresh tissues with baryta water or sodic car
 bonate, in order to set the phosphorus free as phosphate, which was
 then demonstrated          as the phospho-molybdate           ;  but, as Liebermann ||
  points out in the case of yeast nuclein, the baryta compound is only
 after long boiling, or, after heating with acids, converted into the
  orthophosphate.         The action of the baryta must, in part at least, be
 to change the structure of tho elements, and it is not certain, there
  fore, that in all cases the ortho compound formed should be in the
 structures where the phosphorus originally existed. This, and the
  fact that the sodium compound first formed by sodic carbonate, being
  soluble, may diffuse from its original situation, render this method
 of doubtful       value in localising phosphorus in tissue elements.                These
  observers,       however,     claim    that    the   nitric  acid    in  the   molybdic
  reagent has the property of gradually converting the phosphorus
  ¦compounds into the orthophosphate, and tbey allowed fresh prepara-

  474        Prof. A. B. Macallum.            Detection and Localisation
  tions to remain a long time in this fluid for this pnrpose.              I have, as
  already stated, found that the long continued action of the reagent
  has this result, and that the conversion is more marked if the reagent
  is allowed to acf. at a slightly increased temperature.             One cannot be
  absolutely certain that the anhydrous forms of phosphoric acid when
  liberated, and before being converted into orthophosphoric acid, do
  not diffuse through the tissue elements, but in a number of experi
  ments made to decide this point,            I ascertained that if such, diffusion
  did occur, it was in such minute amounts as to be unobservable. A
  risk of diffusion is incurred when a tissue, very rich in orthophos-
  phates, is acted on by the reagent.             A part of the phosphoric acid
 in this case, except in very thin sections, diffuses and forms a slight
 deposit of phospho-molybdate crystals on the preparation.                  Prepara
  tions of renal tubules and the cat's placenta illustrate this well.
     Owing to the abundance and general distribution of lecithin in
  animal and vegetable tissues, it is necessary to extract this com
 pound from them in order to ascertain the distribution of the other
 phosphorus compounds.             Bitto* has shown that the extraction can
 be regarded as complete only when the material, first treated with
 ether, has been acted on by boiling ethyl alcohol thirty times, each
 period of extraction lasting about ten minutes.                Adopting this pro
 cess, I subjected samples from all the material used to extraction in
 a Soxhlet apparatus for five hours, the condensed but still hot alcohol
 being siphoned off every 6 — 10 minutes.               This treatment is specially
 necessary     in the  case  of  nerve     tissues   in which it makes a marked
 difference in the phospho-molybdate reaction.
     A much more difficult problem is that of the removal of thd in
organic phosphates from tissues.                Jollyf used acetic acid of 20 per
cent, strength for this purpose, claiming that this fluid removes all
the phosphates except that of iron.                It does indeed remove a large
 part of them, but not those which may be in the nuclear elements.
 In order, therefore, not to confuse the inorganic phosphorus with
that of organic combinations,              I   have always endeavoured to de
termine in any given material what extent of molybdo-phosphate
reaction may be obtained in the first ten minutes after the nitric-
molybdate reagent is added.               This reaction indicates whether the
tissues are rich or poor in inorganic phosphates, and it may be com
pared with what may be obtained after a longer stay in the reagent,
any enhancement in the reaction thus demonstrating the phosphorus
of organic compounds.

                                 Results of the Method.
    I.   General. — The chromatin         of all nuclei gives, after eighteen
hours' treatment with the                 nitric-molybdate reagent a strong
phospho-molybdate reaction.                This is so marked that the nuclei
appear under ordinary microscopic magnification as if they were
stained with a dark-green dye for the express purpose of showing
the chromatin structures.              Even the finer fibrils constituting the
so-called reticulum are prominently brought out.                         This is well
illustrated in the nuclei of the epithelial cells of the skin, alimentary
tract, renal tubules, and olfactory region, and of the muscle fibres,
liver cells, testicular and ovarian cells, nerve cells (spinal cord),
 pancreatic cells, connective tissue cells, and leucocytes of Meno-
branchus       {Necturus) lateralis and Atnblystoma punctatum.                In veget
able cells, as shown in Erythronium americanum, the same result
 was found. In brief, wherever true chromatin was found, there the
reaction for phosphorus was obtained.                    In the chromatin of the
mitotic loops in dividing animal and vegetable cells, no reaction
more marked than in the chromatin of the resting nuclei was in any
case obtained. This fact definitely contradicts the view of Lilien-
feld* that the chromosomes in mitosis are composed of nucleic acid
only, a view which Heine,t as a result of experiments in staining
with mixtures of dyes, also rejected.                  The phosphorus in nucleic
                          —
acid amounts to 9- 10 per cent., but               in  nuclein it is 3—4 per cent.
 If Lilienfeld's view is correct, then the reaction for phosphorus
 in the chromosomes should be at least twice as marked as in resting
chromatin elements, taking volume for volnme.                             The results
obtained by Lilienfeld in his staining experiments must be explained
 on some other hypothesis than that which he adopted.
     The eosinophilous nucleoli in animal and vegetable nuclei give a
strong reaction for phosphorus, but less marked than in the case of
the chromatin.          On the other hand, the nucleolar elements in the
nucleus of the ovary of Erythronium which, as I have pointed out,J
are rich in "masked" iron, give a deep reaction for phosphorus.
 A similar result was obtained in the nucleoli of the nuclei of the
 embryo-sac of the same form, in the peripheral nucleoli of the
 maturing ovarian ova of Menobranchus, in the nucleoli of Corallorhiza
                                                             " masked " iron.

 476       Prof. A. B. Macallum.             Detection and Localisation
 nucleoli of the nerve cells in the spinal cord of Menobranchtu and of
 the ox and dog, give a deep reaction, but it is not uniform through
 out the nucleolus, portions of a granular form, giving a deeper
 colour than the surrounding material.
    In the cytoplasm of various cells the organic phosphorus present
 is usually small in amount, and, unless inorganic phosphates are
 present, the lecithin being extracted, the reaction is a very faint one.
 In the cells of the nucellas and in the bast cells of Erythronium a
 deeper reaction is obtainable in the cytoplasm ; and this appears to
 be due to the presence of chromatin— at least in the case of the
 nucellar cells. The cytoplasm of the latter is also, as I have pointed
out elsewhere, iron-holding.               Other exceptions are found in the
pancreatic cells, liver cells, nerve cells, striated muscle fibres, in
maturing and mature ovarian ova of Amphibia, and in the spermato-
zoids of Ascaris.       These exceptions are referred to at greater length
 below.
    In dividing     cells the     achromatic      spindle gives   no reaction for
 phosphorus.       This result is quite the opposite        of  that   which Heine
obtained when he used stannous chloride as a reducing reagent after
tho employment of the nitric-molybdate reagent.                  Heine advanced
the view that his result showed that the molybdic reagent could not
be depended on to indicate the presence of phosphorus in tissues.                 It
is rather to be interpreted as indicating that stannous chloride does
not distinguish between the molybdate and the phospho-molybdate
compounds.
    In no case has the centrosome or centrosphere in animal and
vegetable cells given a reaction for phosphorus.
    II. Special. — The zymogen granules in the pancreas of JKemyctylus,
from which the lecithin was thoroughly extracted, gave a deep reac
tion for phosphorus after eighteen hours' treatment with the nitric-
molybdic reagent.         The phosphorus apparently is less firmly bound
than is the case in the nuclear chromatin in the same cells, for the
reaction in the latter is slower in appearing.                A very distinct but
less deep reaction was obtained also in the protoplasm in which the
granules lie, more especially in the part adjacent to the lumen, and a
marked reaction also was produced in the antecedent substance of
the zymogen, found usually in the outer or protoplasmic zone of the
cells.   This substance, which           I  have named prozymogen,*        contains
iron in a "masked " form, and it stains in every way like chromatin.
                                                                 "
Tho presence of phosphorus, as well as of " masked                   iron, seems to
indicate very clearly that it is a nucleo-proteid.

               of Phosphorus in Animal and            Vegetable  Tissues.      All
holding confirms the view which I advanced seven years ago,* that
both are primarily derived from the nuclear chromatin.
    The deeper reaction for phosphorus which is obtained in that part
of   the pancreatic       cell immediately       adjacent   to the lumen, may be
due to ferments dissolved in the cytoplasm at this point or to a
phosphorus-holding substance derived from the zymogen at the same
time the fermentB are formed.
    A diffuse reaction for phosphorus, slow in appearing, was obtained
 in the cytoplasm of liver cells of dog and man. These cells also
 frequently contain abundance of inorganic phosphates whose presence
may render the demonstration of the organic compound difficult.
    I   have been unable to determine whether organic phosphorus com
pounds are present in the cytoplasm of the renal cells, for in the dog
and human subject these cells are rich in inorganic phosphates which
are difficult to extract, and, consequently, obscure the reaction for
the other compounds if these occur here.
    Mr. F. H. Scott, who is at present working on the micro-chemistry
of nerve cells, has found that Nisei's granules also give a distinct
reaction for phosphorus.              He has also found that the substance
forming the granules does not digest in artificial gastric juice.
Mackenzief had previously found that these granules contain
 " masked " iron. They stain like chromatin. These facts lead one
to conclude that the substance of the granules is a nucleo-proteid.
    A feeble reaction for phosphorus has been obtained in the axis
 cylinders of medullated nerves from which the lecithin was extracted.
    In the muscle fibres from the chelaa of the crayfish a deep phos
 phorus reaction was obtained in the dim bands and in the beadlets
 which constitute Dobie's line, while no reaction occurred in the
 lateral discs of Engelmann. The phosphorus-holding substance is
coterminous with the anisotropous element.                The phosphorus demon
strated is not due to presence of lecithin, for this was wholly ex
tracted from the preparation before it was treated with the nitric-
 molybdic reagent, and it was not due to inorganic phosphates, for the
reaction did not come out, except very feebly, during the first twenty
minutes.
    In the striated muscle fibres of Amphibian larvae the iron-holding
substance appears to be also limited in its distribution, as it was
found only in the dim bands,J Dobie's line giving no evidence of its
presence, perhaps because this structure in Amphibia is too minute
to permit a proper determination of this point. In my experiments
on crayfish muscle both the dim band and Dobie's line appear to give

  a reaction  for " masked " iron, and thus in muscle this element and
  phosphorus would seem to have the same distribution.
     The matrix of cartilage in Menobranchus and the frog gives a
  marked reaction for phosphorus, which seems in large part to be due
 to inorganic phosphates, for it appears soon after the addition of the
 nitric-molybdate reagent.        The reaction in some specimens appears
 in areas or zones about cartilage cells or groups of them, the areas
 being separated by narrow zones in which no reaction was observed.
     In the maturing and mature ovarian ova of Amphibia the cyto
 plasm is very rich in organic phosphorus, though not so much so as
 the nucleus.     As the yolk spherules form, the amount of phosphorus-
 holding substance seems to lessen, possibly through its being taken
 up by the spherules which, even when freed from traces of lecithin,
 give a marked phospho-molybdate reaction in about six hours.                  It is
 to be noted that these spherules are also iron-holding.
     In the spermatozoids of Atcaris the organic phosphorus is, on
 the whole, distributed as I have found the " masked
                                                                    " iron to be in
 these structures.* The " nucleus

                                             gave a deep phospho-molybdate
 reaction, and a less marked reaction was obtained in the surround
 ing cytoplasm.
    A diffuse but distinct reaction for phosphorus was obtained in
 human chorionic villi of the seventeenth (?) day, and in the pla
 cental villi of the sixth week and third and sixth months.                       A
part    of  this  reaction    is  due   to   inorganic     phosphates,    for  it is
obtained to a certain extent in about ten minutes after the nitrio-
 molybdic reagent is added.           The cat's placenta is very rich in
inorganic phosphates       distributed     throughout the tissue, but more
 abundant in the deeper portions of the organ.
    The colloid bodies of the thyroid are phosphorus-holding accord
ing to Gourlay,f who relied in his experiments on Lilienfeld and
Monti's interpretation of the action of pyrogallol on the phospho-
molybdate compound.            Through the kindness of Dr. J. H. Elliott,
 I obtained an abundance of free colloid bodies of the ox, fixed in
alcohol, which, after extracting the lecithin, I fused in a platinum
cup with crystals of pure potassic nitrate.              The mass, treated with
a quantity of the nitric-molybdate solution, became yellowish,
owing to the formation of the phospho-molybdate,                   the character
istic crystals of which could be found under the microscope.                   The
reaction was not due to inorganic phosphates, for when thin sec
tions of the ox's thyroid, freed from lecithin, were placed in the
reagent, the phospho-molybdate           compound formed very slowly, and
the maximum       reaction    appeared only after eight hours.            The pre
sence of organic phosphorus in these elements does not, as Gourlay

 them, for Dr. Elliott has found that they digest in artificial gas
 tric juice, leaving do residue, which would not be the case were a
imcleo-compound present.
    The outer portions of the rods and cones in Menobranchus and
Diemyctylus are rich in organic compounds of phosphorus.                       It is
more abundant in the rods than in the cones, and it is not due to
lecithin, for the retina? used were freed from the latter, nor is it
owing to the presence of inorganic compounds of phosphorus, for
the reaction is not obtainable during the first twenty minutes after
placing the organs in the nitric-molybdate solntion, while it is a pro
gressive one up to the sixth hour.          The chromatin of the nuclei of
all the layers of the organ also gives the reaction.
    The chromatophore in Spirogyra gives a weak phospho-molybdate
reaction, and it appears to be due to the presence of an organic com
pound of phosphorus.          A more marked reaction, however, is usually
found in the pyremoids in the same genus, and also in those of (Edogo-
ninm, Cladophora, and Conferva. In fresh specimens of Spirogyra,
taken during daylight and put into the nitric-molybdate reagent, the
pyrenoids appeared to give a stronger reaction than those of
specimens taken at ten o'clock at night. The reaction develops
slowly.
    A diffuse reaction for phosphorus, slow in developing, was obtained
in the cytoplasm of Saccharotnyces Ludwigii.              In apparently normal
cells this may be the only reaction which will be obtained, but in
cells cultivated in the sap of the iron-wood tree a spherical body
occurs, at first sight like a nucleus, but frequently homogeneous, which
after about ten hours' treatment with the nitric-molybdate reagent
gives a reaction for phosphorus which may be very marked. This
body is in no sense a nucleus,* nor does the phospho-molybdate reac
tion reveal any structure that corresponds to the latter. The fact

that the "masked                          cells has a distribution parallel to
that of the organic phosphorus, also points distinctly to the absence
of a nucleus.
    In Cyanophyceee the " central body " always gives evidence of the
presence of organic phosphorus compounds.                  A stronger reaction
for phosphorus was obtained in the iron-holding, chromatin-like
granules which are to be found in the central body, or on its peri
                                                     "               "
phery, in Tolypothrix and Oscillaria. The              cyanophycin      granules,
on the other hand, have not given any evidence of the presence of
organic phosphorus except in some few filaments of a preparation
of Oscillaria tenuis, in which case a marked reaction was developed
in about an hour.
