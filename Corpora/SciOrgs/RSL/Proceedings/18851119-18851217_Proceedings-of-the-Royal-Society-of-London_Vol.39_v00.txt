   In a former communication which I had the honour of making to
the Royal Society,* I described a method of preparing metallic
glucinum and of determining its specific heat.            From my experiments
I deduced the result that the atomic weight of the metal must be
13-6 (circa) in order to agree with Dulong and Petit's rule.
   It is well known that the position assigned to glucinum in the
periodic arrangement of the elements requires an atomic weight of
two-thirds the above number, or approximately 9, and that with the
larger atomic weight it falls between carbon and nitrogen, and is
entirely out of place.
   Various criticisms were offered to explain this apparently anomalous
result.   To the suggestion of Professor J. E. Reynoldsf that
the pure metal would have a specific heat 50 per cent. greater than
that of a sample containing 6 per cent. of impurities,           I have already
replied.^    Another explanation was offered by Brauner,§ who
thought it possible that the specific heat of the metal might increase
with the temperature and thus agree with Dulong and Petit's rule, at
some higher temperature-interval than 0 — 100°.               Branner's sugges
tion was based upon the position which glucinum should occupy in
the periodic arrangement and which would be similar to that of boron
and carbon.    Some determinations of the specific heitt of the metal up

to 300° made by Nilson and Petterson* confirmed this prediction to a
certain extent, but as this important question could not be considered
as definitely decided, the following investigations          were undertaken.
Owing to the small amount of time at my disposal the experiments
have absorbed the greater part of my leisure for the past fourteen
months, and in the mean time my results have been partly forestalled
by other investigators, but the importance of the subject justifies me
in publishing what is little more than a confirmation of the work of
others.
   My experiments may        be  divided into two groups, (i) those on the
specific heat of pure glucinum at varying temperatures, and (ii) thoset
on the vapour-density of volatile glucinum compounds.f
     I. Specific Heat of Metallic Glucinum at varying Temperatures.
   For the determinations of the specific heat of glucinum at varying
temperatures a fresh quantity of the metal was prepared from the
pare chloride by the method which              I  have previously described
(loc cit.). The chloride was obtained from oxide which had been
carefully purified with ammonium carbonate.             Experiments in which
impure glucina was fused with acid potassium fluoride, and the fused
mass extracted with water containing hydrofluoric acid, proved that if
iron is present much of it goes into solution with the glucinum. The
usual method with ammonium carbonate gives better resnlts, especi
ally if the process is several times repeated, and if at last an insufficient
quantity of the solvent is used, so that some of the glucina remains
undissolved with the last traces of the alumina.              The concentrated
solution of the double carbonateJ can then be easily decomposed by
leading steam into it through a wide tube. The dangerous bumping
which always happens when the concentrated solution is boiled is thus
completely avoided.       In this way, after three or four purifications, it
is easy to obtain a sample of glucina which when fused with acid
potassium fluoride dissolves in water containing hydrofluoric acid
without leaving the slightest trace.            A very convenient form of
charcoal for mixing with the oxide to prepare the chloride is a kind of
lamp-black known in trade as gas-black.              When burnt it leaves a
much smaller quantity of ash than the best sugar charcoal, and can be
mixed with the oxide much more easily and intimately than the latter.
   Most of the metallic glucinum prepared from this pure chloride was
in the form of thin, lustrous, highly crystalline laminae.          The purer
portions were selected and compressed in a steel mortar to a compact,
lustrous cylinder 11 mm. long and 8 mm. in diameter.

     An analysis of a portion of this metal after the specific heat deter
  minations had been done was conducted as follows.                   Since aluminium
 was absent in the oxide and could not have been introduced during
 the  preparation of the metal, the only impurities to be looked for were
 silicon, iron, and glucinum oxide.                 On solution of the metal in a
 dilute acid, the silicon would mostly remain behind in the free state,
 bnt a part would be liberated as silicon hydride.*                   The oxide would
 also remain undissolved            as the metal had been heated up to 450*
 in the specific heat determinations.                  The iron would, of course,
 dissolve.
     29-4  mgrms. of the metal was dissolved in dilute sulphuric acid, and
 left a minute, imponderable residue, which was estimated at 0-2 mgrm.
 It remained floating in the liquid for some time, was light coloured,
 and was probably glucina mixed with some ferric oxide.                     The iron in
 solution was estimated by the depth of colour produced by ammonium
 sulphocyanate, just as by the operation known as
                                                                         " Nesslerising "
 minute quantities of ammonia are estimated.                    I believe this method
gives    more   accurate    results    for  the estimation    of  very small quantities
of iron than the usual process with potassium permanganate.                            In
 using    a dilute solution    of   this   reagent   a  considerable    excess   must  be
added before the pink colour becomes visible, and the end point or
amount of excess is very difficult to determine ; whereas with
ammonium sulphocyanate and working under similar conditions it is
very easy to match the two colours and to determine accurately a
 minute quantity of iron. The iron in the above solution of glucinum
sulphate was oxidised by a drop of weak bromine-water, the excess of
bromine boiled off, and a given volume of ammonium sulphocyanate
added in a Nessler cylinder.              To another similar cylinder, containing
the same quantity of free acid and ammonium                         sulphocyanate and
made up to the same volume, was added a solution of feme sulphate
containing 0-1 mgrm. iron per c.c.                    Of this solution 0-3 c.c. was
required, corresponding to 0-03 mgrm. iron.                   The composition of the
metal was therefore        : —

in other words,      it was almost pare. Its purity wu*s also shown by the
difficulty    with   which     it dissolved in dilute acids. A small pieco
which had been left in dilute sulphuric acid (1 : 10) over night was
only partly dissolved in the morning, but solution took place rapidly
on    warming.

   Several attempts were made to determine the density of this block
of metal. They were all unsuccessful, owing to the difficulty of com
pletely removing the enclosed air.
   Another sample was therefore used in the loose form as extracted
from the iron boats. The following results were obtained : —
                d$%=   1-88 (i), 1-90 (ii); mean  = 189.
   The composition of this metal was —

num becomes <Zfg = l-85.

the result is only accurate lo the second decimal place.

    The calorimeter employed was an improved form of the instrument
described in my former paper (/oc. elt.).             The opening and closing of
the two sliders, and the movement of the catch to release the substance,
were, however,       made automatic        by suitable electrical connexions.         It
was thus only necessary to run the calorimeter under the heater and
beck again in order to transfer the substance from the latter to the
former.      The calorimeter (M, fig. 1), with its brass casing, and the bent
 thermometer      (tt), were the same      as those used before     ; the agitator (P)
was    worked by     a small electromotor      (T).   Two new heaters were used,
one  for temperatures up to           150°, and one   for temperatures from         150°

 to 300°.     The former (fig. 2) consists of          a double brass vessel with
a thick jacket      of  slag- wool.     The  vapour   of   the boiling liquid passes
 from the boiler to the heater by one tube, and leaves by another, is
condensed and flows back to the boiler.                 The liquids used in this
heater were methyl alcohol, water, and xylol, but the results obtained
with the first-named liquid were inaccurate owing to the small rise
(0*6°) in the temperature of
                                      the calorimeter. In this apparatus it is
possible to obtain a temperature constant to -fa0 for any length of time.*
    The heater for high temperatures (A, fig. 1) was made on the
pattern described by Lothar Meyerf, the construction of which will
be evident from the figure.              C is an outer non-conducting casing,
L is a ring burner, from which the heated gases pass up through
the heater and escape through perforations in the double lid (V).
This heater is mounted on a thick slab of asbestos (D), by means of
which it stands on two brass plates (E), which are separated from
one another by a coil of thin lead tubing, through which a current

of cold water flows.          In this way the chamber (B) into which the
calorimeter has to be run is kept quite cool. A double tin screen
(not shown in the figure) serves also to prevent the calorimeter
from receiving extraneous heat.                 The whole operation of trans
ferring     the    substance    from    the  heater   to the calorimeter can be
performed in less than two seconds, and the gain of heat by the
calorimeter during this period cannot be measured. In a series of
blank experiments it was found that when the calorimeter remained
under the heater (at 300°) for 15 seconds, the thermometer <4 rose
           The temperature of the substance in the heater was measured
by three delicate thermometers from Geissler.                   Their fixed points
were determined in ice, water, naphthalene, and benzophenone, but
they were not calibrated.          The gas supply for this heater was regu
lated by three regulators made by Giroud. of Paris, burning 60, 80,
and 110 litres of gas per hour, and giving temperatures of 200", 240°,
and 310° respectively.          With these regulators the temperature could
be kept constant to about                 provided there were no great fluctua
tions in the gas pressure.         I  have sadly felt the need of a good regu
lator for high temperatures.* The suspension of the substance (S) in
the heater was by a small pair of tongs, made so that the jaws open
when the arms are closed.               The tongs with the substance are sup
ported by a thin platinum wire which is attached, outside the heater,
to a thread passing over pulleys and fastened to a catch (K).                When
this catch is released the tongs fall by their own weight until they
reach the ring X ; this brings the arms closer together, and the sub
stance drops into the calorimeter.             The connexions are so arranged
that when the calorimeter is run under the heater, the lid of the
calorimeter casing is first opened, then the slider under the heater,
and finally the catch is released, and the substance falls. As the
calorimeter returns the two sliders are again closed.
    The liquid used in the calorimeter was purified turpentine, of
which the specific was determined as follows : —
     (i.) Bv the method of mixtures, using metallic magnesium, of
which the specific had been found to be c,'tJt=0-2442.                This gave for

    These numbers show a rapid and continuous increase in the specific
 heat as the temperature rises. In order to find whether this increase
continued above 300°, two experiments were made at higher tempera
 tures with a double calorimeter.            This calorimeter consisted of two
 thin brass vessels, placed close together with suitable thermometers
 and agitators.      One of these received the glucinum, and the other a
 platinum cylinder of known weight. These two substances were
 placed in two similar glass tubes, packed side by side in a wide iron
 tube with slag-wool, and the whole heated in the furnace which was
 used tor the vapour-density determinations.!                After the heating had
 been continued for about three hours, the iron tube was withdrawn,
 and the substances quickly tipped into the calorimeters.                     In calcu
 lating the temperature, Violle's results of the specific heat of platinum
 at varying temperatures were used. These two experiments gave th
 following results : —

         Cun¦c showing specific heat of glucinnm at varving temperatures.
   A curve showing the true specific heat at varying temperatures is
given iu fig. 3. According to the above expression the specific heat
reaches a maximum at about 470°, and then falls. But it is doubtful
whether this expression would correctly represent the specific heat at
temperatures above 500°.         Weber's experiments with diamond and
graphite tend to confirm this doubt. His results between —79° and
+ 280° show a rapid increase in the specific heat, and give a para
bolic curve similar to that obtained for glucinum. But in the other
experiments which he made between 600° and 1000° the increase in
the specific  heat is much less rapid, and the curve takes another
form. However this may be, my results show that the specific heat
of glucinum rapidly increases up to about 400°, and that between
400° and 500° it remains practically constant at the approximate
value of 0-62. If this number is multiplied by the atomic weight
taken as 9*1, the atomic heat becomes 5-64. It is therefore clear that
this number represents the true atomic weight, and not 13-6, as was
previously deduced from the specific heat between 100° and 10°.
Glucinum is thus to be classed with those elements of which the
specific heat increases rapidly with the temperature, and, like most
elements with low atomic weights, its atomic heat is considerably
below the average.
   The expression for the true specific heat of the metal given by
Nilson's results is similar to that obtained from mine. His values
for the constants, as calculated by me, are : &<)= 0-3710, «=0-000o8,
and /3= — 0-00000044, which closely agree with those derived from
my experiments.

             II.  Vapour-denrity     of Volatile Glucinum Compounds.
    The compounds of glucinum which can be volatilised unchanged
 are those which it forms with organic radicals and with the halogens.
 Of the former class Cahours states* that he has prepared the ethide
 and propide, and gives their boiling-points, but all my efforts to
 prepare either of these compounds in a sufficiently pure state to deter
 mine its vapour-density were fruitless.               I operated, as Cahours
 recommends, on an excess of metallic glucinum with mercuric ethide
 or propide in sealed tubes ; but either the tubes exploded violently,
 always when a temperature of 135° was exceeded, or if the change
 was successfully accomplished, as shown by the separation of metallic
 mercury, the compound decomposed again on distilling.                  Mercuric
 ethide acts on glucinum chloride, slowly at 100°, more rapidly at 130°,
 and a considerable quantity of mercury ethyl chloride is produced,
 which partly remains dissolved in the excess of mercuric ethide, and
 partly separates out in the usual pearly scales. A similar reaction
 takes place between mercuric ethide and glucinum bromide, but from
 neither of these reactions could a volatile compound of glncinum be
obtained.       I  hope to be able to examine these interesting reactions
 at a later date.
    As the organic compounds of glucinum were not available for
 vapour-density determinations, my attention was directed to the halo
 gen compounds.          The bromide, chloride, and iodide of glucinum are
all volatile, and their volatility is in the order named. The first two
volatilise without decomposition            if water and air are absent; the
last-named decomposes on heating.              In the presence of a trace of air,
 both the chloride and bromide decompose when heated, the latter
more easily than the former ; in both cases the haloid element is set
free.     And since both these compounds corrode glass and porcelain
when vaporised in vessels of these substances, the determination of
their vapour-density is a matter of some difficulty.
    I first made some determinations in glass tubes with the chloride,
nsing Schwarz's modification! of V. Meyer's displacement method.
The glass was corroded, and the results were not concordant.              Porce
lain was also attacked.          The tubes nearly always contained free chlo
rine, although the experiments were done in pure dry nitrogen.                 It
was then decided to try platinum for the determination, and after it
had been found that glucinum chloride could be sublimed unchanged
   * " Compt. rend.," lxxvi.
   t " Berlin Ber.," xvi, 1051.
   The obvious errors in this modification have been pointed out by V. Meyer
(" Berlin Ber.," xvii, 1334). Tbey are chiefly that a portion of the wide tube is
irregularly heated, and that the large boat which carries the substance takes air
with it in its fall into the tube.

                     On the Atomic       Weight  of Glucinum.                      11
 in a   platinum tube in a stream of nitrogen, a platinum vessel was ob
 tained    from Messrs. Johnson, Matthey, and Co. This platinum vessel
was of the usual size and dimensions of those employed for vapour-
density determinations by displaced air, except that the narrow tube
was about one-half the ordinary length.              The open end of this tube
 was firmly attached to the upper part of the usual glass apparatus by
well-wired caoutchouc tubing.*             The substance was introduced, and
the displaced air measured by the method used by Meier and Craftsf
in their researches       on the vapour-density of iodine.          As a graduated
vessel    for the reception of the displaced air, an ordinary calibrated
burette was used, the lower end being connected with a tube of the
same width by strong caoutchouc tubing.                These two tubes were held
in common retort-stand clips, and could be easily adjnsted, so that the
mercury was at the same level in each.                They were connected with
the vessel in the furnace          by  a narrow   glass tube (1 mm. bore), and
the one containing the air was immersed in a vessel of water.                  As a
furnace, two of Fletcher's draft furnaces were used, placed one above
the other, with a wide clay cylinder between them.                     This gave a
chamber 30 cm. high and 12-5 cm. in diameter, which could be heated
up to any temperature           from about 400° to 800°. The temperature
could be kept sufficiently constant for these experiments with a good
gas    tap.
    The platinum       vessel was freely suspended in two clay crucibles,
placed mouth to mouth, and with a hole knocked in the bottom of the
npper.       This served to protect the vessel from the direct action of
the furnace gases.          The temperature was measured by a Siemens'
pyrometer, the porcelain tube of which was connected with platinum
wires to the platinum vessel.        J
    With this apparatus the vapour-densities of glucinum chloride and
bromide      were determined. Glucinum chloride was prepared in several
ways, but the best method was found to be that recommended by
Nikon, which consists in heating a few mgrms. of the metal in a
stream of dry hydrochloric acid in a narrow platinum tube.                       The
chloride is sublimed as near the end of the tube as possible, the con
nexions removed, and a small cap fitted on the open end. The tube is
then cut off with a pair of scissors, so as to form a small capsule in
closing the chloride.        This is introduced into a well-corked glass tube
and weighed. While the preparation of the chloride was going on, the
   •
       During the progress of this part of my work, I  received the account of Nilson
and Petterason's experiments on the vapour-density of glucinum chloride (" Berlin
Ber.,"   xvii, 987). It will be observed from the sequel that   I  have adopted some
details  from them, notably the use of carbonic acid for displacement.

apparatus was gently heated, and* dry carbonic acid passed through it
by a glass tube going to the bottom of the platinum vessel, until the
issuing gas was completely absorbed by caustic potash.*                The glass
tnbe was then gradually withdrawn, and the temperature raised.                As
soon as the temperature had become constant, which was easily seen
by the mercury remaining stationary in both tubes and the resistance
of the pyrometer being constant, the cork at the top of the vessel was
removed for an instant, the small platinum tnbe with the substance
dropped in, and the cork immediately replaced.                  The equilibrium
was thus hardly disturbed, and a few minutes afterwards the substance
was allowed to fall into the heated vessel.
    In the two following determinations (the only ones which were
made) evaporation commenced at once, and was complete in about
twenty seconds.          The following are the data of these two experi
ments :  —

    After each experiment the platinum vessel was washed out with a
 mixture of potassium iodide and starch, but no trace of free chlorine
 was found.      The small platinum tube was then washed with water,
 dried, and weighed ; this gave the weight of the substance used.
     The vapour-density of glucinum bromide was next determined in
 the same apparatus.         This substance can be obtained like the chloride,
 by   heating  the  metal    in  dry hydrobromic acid, but, owing to the diffi
 culty of obtaining a regular stream of tho dry gas, it is best prepared
 by burning the metal in gaseous bromine.               Combination between the
 two elements       takes    place   at a low   red   heat, with brilliant incan
 descence. The crude bromide is afterwards purified by resubliming it
 in a current of hydrogen or carbonic acid. Like the chloride, it can
 be sublimed unchanged in carbonic acid. Glucinum bromide sublimes
 at a lower temperature than the chloride, and, unlike the latter com
 pound, vaporises before it melts. It begins to volatilise at about 450°.
 When carefully sublimed at a low temperature, it forms beautiful
 suow- white silky needles, and does not attack glass if air and moisture
 are perfectly absent. If heated in the presence of air, free bromine is
 at once produced.
     A quantity of     the crude substance was prepared         by heating a few
    • There was always a minute bubble of air left unabsorbed by the potash, even
 when the gas was passed through the apparatus for 20 hours. It was probably
 due to diffusion through the caoutchouc connexions, and did not appear to in
 fluence the results.

                    On the Atomic      Weight  of Glucinum.                    13
centigrams    of metallic glucinum in bromine vapour. This was purified
by sublimation in dry hydrogen, and was finally sublimed into several
narrow glass tubes, each of which was sealed up. When a determina
tion was to be made, the two ends of one of these tubes were cut off,
and the solid lump of the bromide quickly rammed into a small plati
num tube closed at one end.           A cap was fitted on this tube, and it
was weighed in the same manner as the chloride.
   The vapour-density was determined like that of the chloride, and
the following are the data of the four experiments made : —

   In these experiments there was always         a trace of free bromine pro
duced.      In  experiment    4, where   it was  largest, the iodine, set free
on   the addition of potassium iodide, was estimated by centinormal
potassium arsenite, of which 0-2 c.c. was required.           This corresponds
to 016 mgrm. bromine, or less than 1 per cent. of the quantity present.
The decomposition        which had taken place could not, therefore, affect
the result to any appreciable extent, and that the substance had com
pletely evaporated was proved by the fact that the small platinum
tube weighed the same before and after the experiment within one
or two tenths of a milligram.
   The possible densities for glucinum chloride and bromide are —
      ForGl"Cl3               2-76         ForGl"'Cl3             414, and
        „   Gl"Br3    ....    5-84          „   Gl'"Br3    ....    8-76
   The values found were —
           For  G1C12             2-72, and  for GlBr2              6 34.
   It   is  therefore evident that the molecules of these two sub
stances in the gaseous state are represented by the formulae G1C12
and GlBr2 respectively,        in which the metal is a dyad, and has the
atomic weight 9-1. Thus from Avogadro's law, to which there are no
known exceptions, the conclusion is confirmed which was obtained
from the specific heat of the element at high temperatures.
    The long disputed question of the atomic weight of glucinum is
thus definitely and finally decided in favour of that number which
 satisfies the requirements of the periodic law, and another element is
 added to the long list of those whose atomic weights have been cor-

 rected by this important generalisation.           In all future determinations
 of the atomic weight of          an element, the position which the element
 should occupy in the periodic arrangement must receive due import
 ance, and had    I                                               I

until it became cloudy, and any excess of ammonium carbonate decom
 posed, then again filtered and mixed with its own bulk of strong
alcohol.     The crystals, which only separated slowly and adhered
firmly   to   the walls of the containing vessel, were drained, washed
 with alcohol, and dried between filter-paper.
   The analyses of two separate specimens gave the following
results  : —

                        Note on Siemens' Pi/rometer.
   The following are the details of construction and graduation of the
 pyrometer employed in the vapour-density determinations.                  About
 100 cm. of thin platinum     wire   (0-13  mm.    diameter) was coiled round
 a thick piece     of ordinary clay tobacco-pipe, and three thicker
 platinum wires were soldered with gold to the two ends. To these
 thicker wires were soldered three copper wires, which went to the
 bridge where the resistance was measured. The whole was enclosed
in a porcelain tube, one end of which had been closed by a plug of
clay, and the wires were so arranged that the junctions between the
copper and platinum came at the same height, just within the tube.
By suitably arranging the three wires and a known resistance in the
arms of the bridge, measurements could be made of the resistance of
the thin coil without that of the leads, so that any change in resist
ance was due to the altered resistance of the coil alone.          The wire of
which the coil was made had previously been heated several times to
redness.
    In order to graduate the instrument it was immersed in melting ice,
boiling water, aniline, diphenylamine, sulphur, selenium, and zinc.
For boiling these substances (with the exception of water) iron tubes
welded together at one end, of 5 cm. diameter and 46 cm. length,
were used.      The upper portion of the tube for about 8 cm. was sur
rounded with a coil of thin lead tubing, through which a stream of
cold water was allowed to flow.         This acted as a very efficient con
denser, and kept the upper part of the tube cool enough to handle
easily.    The results obtained are expressed in the following table, in
which the first column gives the substance, the second its melting
or boilincf point, and the third the actual resistance found.             In the
fourth column the resistances are reduced to that at 0°=1, and in the
fifth are given the corresponding resistances, calculated from the
empirical formula —

     The agreement between the calculated and observed results is good,
  except in the last two instances.                   The selenium probably contained
 some sulphur, which would lower its boiling point, and only one
 experiment was made with zinc, as this temperature could only be
 reached in the furnace used under an exceptionally favourable gas
 pressure.
     The change       in the resistance            of commercial      platinum    has been
 investigated      by the late      Sir W. Siemens, M. Benoit, and others.
     Siemens expressed his results in the form —
                                 rt  = r0(AT* + BT          -  C),
 and this can be thrown into                  a general      expression   similar to that
           I
 which have used, viz. : —
                                  rt  = r0(l + at       -
     Benoit's results* can also be expressed by a similar formula.
     But although there is a general agreement between these different
 results, the values of the coefficients vary considerably,                     and it is
 therefore always necessary in using this pyrometer to calibrate it for
 every wire. I have even found that the change of resistance of two
 pieces of wire from the same bobbin varied considerably.
     M. Benoit has kindly furnished me with the following synopsis of
 various results, which, although they differ much from one another,
 can all be expressed by the general formula given above : —

One of the temperatures used in this research was that of boiling cadmium, which
was taken from the earlier and incorrect determinations (with an iodine thermo
meter)    of Deville and Troost as 8ti0° instead of circd 770D.            M. Benoit has,
however, informed me, in a private communication, that on introducing this cor

   In any kinetic theory of gases the statistical method of investiga
tion mnst be used, and since the separate molecules of the gas
are supposed to possess some properties to very different extents,                                         it
is necessary to know how many molecules there are which have the
measure of any given property between certain limits.        Thus the
question of the distribution of configuration and velocity amongst
the molecules    one of the most important problems in any theory of
                     is
gases.
  This problem has been solved for the ordinary solid particle theory
 byMaxwell and Boltzmann, and their researches are the more valu
able as the results do not depend on any assumptiou about the law of
force between the molecules.
   In this paper     shall attempt to solve the same problem for the
                      I
vortex atom theory of gases.         In this case the question       a little                   is
more complicated,   as the radii   of  the vortex rings can vary as  well as
their velocities.  This    one of the most striking differences between
                                   is
the two theories    according to the ordinary theory all the molecules
                      ;
of a gas are of the same size, according to the vortex atom theory the
molecules of the same gas vary in size. If this be true, a porous plate
of the requisite degree of fineness might play in this theory the
part which Maxwell's demons play in the ordinary theory.             For let
us suppose that we have two chambers, A and B, separated by                                                a
porous plate, and that A       filled with gas initially while
                                        is                           empty,                  B   is
then  ifthe pores in the porous plate are so .fine that only the smaller
molecules can get through from A to B, then, though some of the
molecules will recross the plate, some gas will remain in           and the                   B,

molecules in B will, on the whole, be moving faster than those in A,
and so may be supposed to be at a higher temperature, since the
smaller the radius of a vortex ring the greater its velocity. Thus B
and A might be the hot and cold chambers respectively of a heat engine,
and in this way work might be derived from the gas which was origi
nally at a uniform temperature, so that this arrangement would not
obey the second law of thermodynamics.
   If the molecule on the vortex atom theory of matter consisted of a
single ring its velocity of translation would be a function only of its
radius.     It is, however, for several reasons advisable to take a more
general case, and to suppose that the molecule consists of several
rings linked through each other, the rings being nearly equal in
radius, and also nearly coincident in position; or what is perhaps
better, we may suppose that the vortex core forms an endless chain,
but that instead of being a single loop like the simple ring, it is
looped into a great many coils nearly equal in radius and nearly co
incident in position.       We may realise this way of arranging the
vortex core if we take a cylindrical rod whose length is great com
pared with its radius, and describe on its surface a screw with »
threads so that the threads make min turns in the length of the rod,
where m is an integer not divisible by n.          Then bend the rod into a
circle and join the ends, the threads of the screw will form an endless
chain with n loops, and we may suppose that this represents the way
in which the vortex rings are arranged ; it is shewn, however, in my
" Treatise on the Motion of Vortex Rings " that this way of arranging
the vortex core is unstable if n be greater than six. When the vortex
core is arranged in the way just described, the velocity of translation is
no longer a function of the size of the ring alone ; at the same time when
a vortex ring of this kind moves about in a flnid where the velocity is
not uniform, the change in the velocity of the ring will be due chiefly
to the change in its radius.       For the velocity at a small distance d
from the circular axis of a vortex ring whose radius is a and strength
m is —
so that  as 8a/d   is very large, a change £a in the radius of the ring

Thus for the same relative changes of a and d the changes in the
velocities are in the ratio of log 8a/ d to 1, and as log 8a/d is very
great, we may neglect the change in the velocity of the ring produced
by the alteration in the distance between the loops in comparison
with that produced by the alteration in the size of the ring.
   The kinetic energy of a quantity of fluid containing vortex rings of
this kind may conveniently be divided into several parts.      The first
part consists of the kinetic energy of the irrotationally moving fluid
surrounding the ring, the second part of the kinetic energy of the
rotationally moving fluid ; this again may conveniently be divided
into two parts, one part being the kinetic energy due to the rotation
in the core, and the other that due to the translational velocity of the
vortex core.
   The kinetic energy of the irrotationally moving liquid surrounding
the ring may be expressed in several ways ; it is equal to the strength
of the ring multiplied by the rate of flow of the fluid through it ; the
most convenient expression for our purpose, however, is
                                     Ara8,
where          velocity of translation of the vortex ring resolved
        v is the
along the normal to its plane, a is the radius of the ring and A a
constant.
  (See p. 12 of my "Treatise on the Motion of Vortex Rings.")
  The energy due to the rotation of the vortex core is
where n is the number of loops in the ring, /> the density of the fluid,
and m the strength of the ring.
  The kinetic energy due to the translational velocity of the ring is
                               £M.(u*+v* + w*),
where   M is the mass of fluid in the ring and w2 + f3 + W2 the square of
the velocity of the ring.
   Thus if T be the whole kinetic energy due to the ring —
                   T = Ava*   + ^nv-pm?a + £M (u2 +    v2   + w2)   .
  Let us consider a vortex ring placed in a fluid where there is                   a
velocity potential 0 independent of that due to the vortex ring itself,
the value of O is supposed to be known at every point of the fluid.
  We have to fix the position, size, and motion of the ring. We can
do this if we know the coordinates (x, y, z) of its centre, its radius
(a), the direction cosines     (Z,

dO/dz.
   Let               j-=laP,     rj=maP,     %=naP,  u=Vi.
   Then we shall prove that it is possible to determine p and q so that
the number of molecules which have the values of x, y, z, f, rj, f, u,
between     x, y, z,        £, u,   and x + dx, y + dy, z + dz, f + tZf, v+tij,
f       ai + dw, and for which the kinetic energy of the molecule and
the surrounding fluid is T, is when the gas is in a uniform and steady
state —
                              Ce~iTdxdydzd^d^d^dw,
where C is some constant determined by the number of molecules in
the gas.
   We shall first prove        that this represents a possible distribution
among the molecules of        the quantities denoted by f , >/, a', when the
vortex rings are moving       in a fluid whose velocity varies from point to
point ; we disregard for      the present the effects of any collisions which
may take place among the vortex rings themselves.              In this case the
rings are supposed to be so far apart that they do not influence each
other, so that the velocity of any ring is the same as if the others did
not exist.     T represents the kinetic energy due to the ring and the
distribution of velocity potential Q on this supposition.
   We have to prove that if the distribution b'o represented by this
expression at any time, it will continue to be represented by it. This
will  be the case   if the expression
                              Ce~ktdxdydzd^dijd^dai,
remains constant       as the molecules     move about.    Now T, the kinetic
 energy, remains constant, so that we have to prove that
                                  dxdydzd^dtjdgdui
also remains constant.
   Since Q is the part of the velocity potential which is not due to
the rings themselves, by the equations on pages 65 and 66 of my
" Treatise on the Motion of Vortex Rings," we have —

collision with those of the B group, and that the values of the co-ordi

   In my " Treatise on the Motion of Vortex Rings " it is proved that
the effects of a collision depend on, in addition to the quantities
already specified, the angle which the line joining the centres of the
rings when they are nearest together makes with the shortest distance
between the directions of motion of the rings ; let us call this angle              <p.
0    ispositive for the ring which first passes through the shortest
distance between the directions of motion of the ring, negative for the
other ring, and     may have any value between — jt/2 and jt/2.

distance between the centres of the two rings              less than some

     Let
       ~/d<p be the fraction of the number of pairs of molecules which
come  into  collision in the nnit of time and contain one molecule from
the group A and another from the group B, and for which 0 is
between 0 and 0 + dxj).      Then if the states in which the A and B
molecules are in after the collision be called A' and B' respectively,
the number of pairs of molecules which in the unit of time leave the

— fj, idj, will also collide.   Let these latter molecules be said to be in
the states (—A1), (— B') respectively.       Thus the percentage of collision
for the states AB), that(       for collisions between two molecules in the

But since as many molecules are moving in any direction as in                                   the

number in the state A', and similarly the number of molecules in                                the
state — B'   the same as the number in the state B', and since
                   is                                                                    the
gas exhibits no vector properties, the                      mean path between the collisions
between the molecules in the states                          A' and B' must equal the mean
path between the collisions between                         the molecules in the states — A'

So that the percentage for the state (A'B') equals the percentage for
the state — A', — B'), but this, as we saw, equals the percentage for
               (
the state AB and, therefore, the percentage for the state AB

collision may be fixed with regard to either molecule,   and  since                             0   is

     Thus the condition for a steady distribution is satisfied, and we
therefore conclude that a possible distribution of the values of the
coordinates among the molecules of the gas is represented by the
expression   —

and                                  3(j'—2)=q.
     Let us consider the case when there is no external disturbance in
the fluid containing the vortex rings ; the distribution will be uniform
in all parts of the fluid, so that the number of molecules which have
the quantities f,         £, u, between f, 1/, f, 01 and f+df, rj + drj,   f +d£,
u + du is independent of x, y, z, and so by the above formula will be
proportional to —
                                   e~"d^drid%du',
or if the normals to the planes of the vortex rings point uniformly in
all directions the number of molecules which have a between a and
a + da, v between v and v+dv is proportional to —

     Though in the kind of moleoule we are considering, a and v may
be treated as independent variables, still the limits of v depend upon
the value of a.        For suppose the molecule to consist of n rings

greatly affect each other's velocity ; in this case v will equal —

the    velocity of the molecule will be greatest when the n rings are
close together   ; in this case v will equal —

So that         if we integrate first with            respect to v we must do so between
these     limits.

we cannot perform the integration except between the limits zero and

     The quantity p is at present undetermined.
    Let us apply this result to find the pressure of a gas on the
sides of the vessel which contains it.        To do this we must consider
what takes place at the sides of the vessel.                    The general
nature of this action was described by Sir William Thomson
 ("Nature," vol. xxiv, p. 47). As the vortex rings move up to the
sides of the vessel they swell out and move          slowly up the bounding
surface, where they form a layer of swollen         vortices  sticking to the
sides of the vessel.      A vortex ring coming      up to the surface tends
 to wash off the vortex rings attached to the       surface on either side of
 it, so that when things have got into a state of equilibrium there is u
 vortex ring washed off for each one that comes up.                  Thus the
 pressure on the surface of    the vessel  will be the  same as  if the vortex
 ring struck against the surface and was reflected away again with
 its velocity reversed, if we assume, as seems natural, that the average
 velocity of the rings leaving the surface is the same as of those
 approaching it. Thus each ring that comes up may be looked upon
 as communicating      twice its momentum to the surface, and we can
 explain the pressure of a gas, just as in the ordinary theory. We
 have to remark here, however, that the phrase momentum of the
  vortex ring is ambiguous, as there are two different momenta con
 nected with the ring ; there is (1) the momentum of the ring and the
 fluid surrounding it ; and (2) the momentum of the fluid forming the
  ring alone ; this is proportional to the velocity of the ring, while (1)
 is not only not proportional to the velocity, but in the single ring
  decreases as the velocity of the ring increases ; in a very complex ring
  it does not necessarily do this, but even in this case it is not propor
  tional to the velocity.
     Now, when a vortex ring gets stopped by a surface the question
  arises whether the momentum communicated to the surface is the
  momentum (1) or (2). The answer to this question depends on what
  we consider the nature of the surface to be.        If the surface stops the
  fluid as well as the ring, then no doubt (1) is the momentum which is
  communicated to the surface.       If, however, the surface stops the ring
  but allows the greater part of the fluid to flow on, then the momen
  tum communicated to the surface is evidently approximately equal to
   (2). If we consider that the surface is formed of vortex rings the
  latter supposition seems the more probable, as the fluid in which the
  rings move can hardly be supposed to be stopped by such a porous
   surface.   We may illustrate this by a mechanical analogy.           Let us
   suppose that we have a number of anchor rings with circulation

                   The Vortex Ring Theory       of    Gases.            35
established round them moving about in water, and striking against
a grating immersed in it. The momentum of the anchor ring will
consist  of two parts, one due  to the   circulation, the other dne to the
translational velocity of the ring. If the grating is so fine that the
openings are only a small fraction of the whole area, then the
momentum communicated to the grating will be the whole momen
tum ; if, however, the grating is a coarse one, so that the openings
form the larger portion of the area, then the momentum communi
cated to the grating will only be the momentum of the ring itself.
And this seems to correspond to the case of vortex motion.
   Thus if a be the velocity of the gas resolved along the normal to
the boundary surface, the pressure on the surface per unit of area or
the momentum communicated to it per unit of time is —
                                22Ma3
                                 = §2M«2
using the same notation as before.
   Now, the number of molecules which have the quantities         a and  /9
 between «, (3 and x+dx, p+dfi is proportional to —
                          e       a •  p  *  dxdfi,
so  that if N be the number of molecules     —

 and the molecule is supposed to be so complex that we may, without
sensible error, suppose the limits of a. and /3 to be zero and infinity.
   We may take ljh as proportional to the temperature 0 of the gas,
since it is the same for each of two gasea which are in contact
 with each other, and is also proportional to the mean kinetic energy
of the rings themselves.
   Substituting the above value for e/3, we see that the pressure equals
                              {p-Vj-'
and thus varies as NO.

     Atpresent the quantity p ia quite undetermined.     It could be
determined by comparing the coefficients of viscosity and the conduc

'•
   The History of the Kew Observatory." By Robert Henry
     Scott, M.A., F.R.S., Secretary to the Meteorological Council.
     Received and read June 18, 1885.*
The building, known by a misnomer of at least half a century's
date as the Kew Observatory, while it is really situated at Richmond,
is erected on, or close to, a part of the foundations of a much earlier
structure, the old Carthusian Priory of Jesus of Bethlehem.
    We learn from Crisp's " Richmond " that "the ancient hamlet of
West Sheen occupied that portion of land now known as the Richmond
Gardens, or Old Deer Park, and for the site of which hamlet or village
we may perhaps take with tolerable correctness the present Observa
tory as the centre."
    The Observatory is situated upon a low mound, which is apparently
artificial. The central part of the building stands upon vaulting con
structed of bricks, differing in character from modern "stock" bricks,
being soft, red, thinner and narrower.            Similar bricks are to be found
in the walls of Richmond Palace (Crisp, p. 123), and such have been
mainly used in the construction of the basement of the Observatory,
up to the stone course.
    The basement is surrounded by three successive square rings of
vaulting, of which the innermost is 5 feet wide by 8 feet high, the
second 8 feet by 6 feet high, and the third and last 6 feet 6 inches by
5 feet high.     This vaulting is constructed of bricks similar to those
used in the upper part of the building, which resemble the bricks of
the present day.
    Crisp's statement, given above, is not absolutely exact, for the topo
graphical history of the plot of land bounded on the one side by
the bend of the river, and on the other by the present high road from
                                                  "
Richmond to Kew, the old " Kew Lane (see Fig. 3, p. 46), is rather
complicated.      Three separate domains can, however, be recognised —
                             1. Kew Gardens.
                             2.  Richmond Gardens.
                             3.  The Old Deer Park.
   Of the three domains Nos.         1  and 2 were separated by a bridle path
called " Love Lane," which             started from West Sheen Lane near
Richmond Green, and ran in a north and south direction to the Horse
   * I  am indebted to the kindness of several friends for much assistance in the
preparation of this history, particularly to Dr. E. W. Bond, of the British Museum,
Mr. W. Thiselton Dyer, F.R.3., and to the members of the staff of the Observatory.

Ferry at Brentford.        Nos. 2 and 3 were quite distinct, though con
tiguous to each other, whereas the above quotation from Crisp would
convey the idea that the two names, Richmond Gardens and the Old
Deer Park, were applied indiscriminately to the same area.
   1.  Kew Gardens lay to the east of Love Lane, they were the
gardens of Kew House, of which Frederick Prince of Wales (son of
George II) took a long lease from Mr. S. Molyneux, his secretary, to
whom it had passed by his marriage with Lady Elizabeth, grand-niece
of Lord Capel.
   Mr. Samuel Molyueux, F.R.S., had erected an observatory in a
wing of the house, in which he in the year 1725 made, with a
telescope of his own construction, in conjunction with Bradley, the
famous observations which, after his death, were continued by Bradley
and proved the Aberration of Light. This was the original and real
Kew Observatory.
   Kew House was taken down in 1803, and the present sundial on
its site erected by William IV, in 1832. The inscription on that
dial* hardly gives sufficient credit to Molyneux, to whom, however,
Bradley does full justice in Phil. Trans., Vol. XXXV, No. 406, p. 637.
   2. Richmond       Gardens were the gardens of Richmond Lodge,
formerly Ormonde House; of this area 37 acres, including 12 taken
from the Old Deer Park, are still in the occupation of the Royal
Family.
   As Dr. Evans, in his "Richmond and its Vicinity" (2nd Ed., 1825),
               "
says (p. 12), Richmond Gardens existed and were in the zenith of their
popularity before Kew Gardens emerged into distinction."
   3. The Old Deer Park was the park of the same house, which stood
between    it and the gardens.
   As to the origin of Richmond Lodge, we have to go further back.
 Richmond Palace (or the Palace of Sheen, as it was called before
 Henry VII gave the village the name of Richmond) was the Sheen
 Manor House.       It was situated on the south-west side of Richmond
 Green, near the river, and of it little remains save an archway with
 the Tudor Arms and parts of the outer walls.                 Edward I made it a
 palace,  and  it continued    so  until  the   time  of Charles   I. Edward III,
 Henry VII, and Elizabeth all died there. Under the Commonwealth
 in 1650 it was sold, and after the Restoration was again in the hands
 of the Crown, and it had been mostly pulled down in the seventeenth
   * The inscription upon                             "
                            the dial is as follows : — On this spot, in 1725, the Rev.
 James Bradley made the first observations which led to his two great discoveries —
 the Aberration of Light and the Nutation of the Earth's Axis. The telescope which
 he used had been erected by Samuel Molyneux, Esq., in a house which afterwards
 became a Royal residence, and was taken down in 1803. To perpetuate the memoir
 of so important a station, this dial was placed on it in 1832, by command of His
  Most Gracious Majesty King William the Fourth."

  Richmond Lodge, which in its turn became the Palace of Richmond.
was apparently originally the Lodge of the Palace Park, the Old Deer
Park. It was situated near the present Observatory.        The gardens
were in front of it, the park at the back.
   As regards the position of the Priory,   have learnt from Dr. Bond,
                                            I
of the British Museum, that all the recognised authorities agree in
placing the Carthusian Monastery to the north or the north-west of the
old Palace of Sheen. Crisp gives an engraving of tho Monastery
before its demolition, and in an engraving of a panoramic view of
Richmond by Anthony van de Wyngaerde, dated 1562, a building
resembling Crisp's view  is shown in the site of the Priory indicated in
the subjoined map.

    We now come to the original buildings on the actual site of t.
 Observatory, and we find in Crisp the following statement: —
     " It was in the
                         year 1414 that Henry V, to expiate, as it has been
 said, the crime by which his family had attained to the crown of
 England, namely, the dethronement and murder of the unfortunate
 Richard II, founded here a ' famous religious house for forty monks
                                                 '
 of the Carthusian order, under the name of ' The House of Jesus of
 Bethlehem at Sheen,' by which name it was incorporated, and one
 John Wydrington constituted the first prior.
     " At the same time that
                                      Henry founded this noble priory, he like
 wise built and endowed another one at ' Syon ' on the opposite bank
 of the river, where the present Syon House now stands ; this he
 dedicated to St. Bridget, for sixty nuns of that order."
    Crisp says, " There is in the British Museum an old work, in which
 mention is made of these two ' relygious houses,' and that ' it is there
 stated they were founded for the reason that a constant succession of
holy exercises should be kept up night and day to the end of time, so
that when the devotions at one convent had been concluded, at the
other they should instantly begin.
    "
       Shakespeare had learned from the works of old chroniclers and
 historians the reasons given for the institution of these two (houses),
as in his ' Henry V
                               '
                                 he makes the king, prior to the battle of
Agincourt, utter the following words : —
                            " ' Not to-day, O Lord,
                 O, not to-day think thou upon the fault
                 My father made in compassing the crown !
                 I Richard's body hare interred anew,
                 And on it have bestowed more contrite tears
                 Than from it issued forced drops of blood.
                 Fire hundred poor I have in yearly pay,
                 Who twice a day their withered hands hold up
                 Toward HeaTcn, to pardon blood ; and       I have built
                 Two chantries, where the sad and solemn priests
                 Still sing for Richard's soul.'
    " These
              buildings of Sheen and Syon were both of them stately
edifices, and were as nobly endowed."
    In 1541 the monastery, along with others, was suppressed.*

    Crisp says fuither : " It was in the year 1770* that the village or
 hamlet of West Sheen with the ancient gateway forming the entrance
 to, or rather part of, the priory, and eighteen houses with large pieces
 of gronnd attached, were pulled down, and the entire site converted
 into park or pasture land, as we now see it ; but the antiquary to
 whom the records of such institutions as this ' House of Jesns of
               '
 Bethlehem are so dear, while pondering over the changes which have
 taken place in Richmond, and observing how little we now retain
 of so much which has once existed here as the work of our Norman,
 Plantagenet, and Tudor kings, can but cherish a feeling of the deepest
 regret at the total annihilation of the ancient priory buildings of
 Henry V at Sheen."
    Richmond Lodge, or House (once occupied by Cardinal Wolsey),
 which stood at no great distance from the present Observatory, had
 been granted in 1707 by Queen Anne to the Duke of Ormonde, and
 partly rebuilt by him, in the year 1708-9, on the site of an old
 building which had likewise borne the name of the Lodge for a long
 period of years.    On the impeachment of the duke in 1715, he hastily
 left the country, and resided at Paris.           Ormonde House was ap
 parently unfinished at the time. The Earl of Arran, his brother, who
 purchased the property, then leased for the term of about ninety
 years, sold the lease to the Prince of Wales, afterwards George II,
 of whom, both before and after his succession to the throne, it was
 a favourite place of residence, and even more particularly so of his
 queen (Caroline).     From this cause a numerous circle gathered in
 and about the village and neighbourhood of Richmond, forming here
 the court* of the reigning monarch.
    Here, in the garden appertaining to this lodge, took place the
 int-rview between Queen Caroline and Jeannie Deans, after her
journey on foot from Edinburgh to plead for the life of her sister
 Effie, which has been so graphically and so touchingly described by
 Sir Walter Scott in his " Heart of Midlothian."
    There is one passage in the dialogue which has a connection with
the site of the Observatory, and that is Jeannie's reply to the Queen
when addressed in the following words : —
    " Stand up, young woman, and tell me what sort of a barbarous
p-ople your countryfolk are, where child murder is become so common
as to require the restraint of laws like yours."
    " If your Leddyship pleases, there are many places besides Scotland
where mithers are unkind to their ain flesh and blood."
    For as Crisp says, " It cannot be denied that the behaviour of
Caroline had been unnatural towards her son ; she seems to have
England quarterlv. The inscription round, when read at length, is — Sigillum Domus
Jhen Chriiti de Bethlem Ordinit Cartusiensis de Shene."

hated him thoroughly and intensely — slighted his young and amiable
wife — sided with his father, who upon all occasions behaved towards
him with harshness and severity ; and when on her deathbed the
prince importuned to be allowed to see her, and sent her a most
affectionate message, refused to have him admitted to her presence."
And therefore " of this famous Richmond Lodge, its magnificent
gardens, the statuary and the numerous and singular buildings with
which the Queen of George          II  had at such an extraordinary outlay
enriched the place, the remains of the ancient monastery of Sheen,
the large and embattled Gothic entrance, and the numerous houses
still appertaining to the hamlet — we have now not a vestige left."
For "a few years after the accession of George III, the public, more
especially of Richmond and Kew, were surprised to learn that it was
His Majesty's intention to pull down the whole of the buildings and
convert the estate into a large pasturage for cattle, which intention
was duly carried out."
   " It was at the time asserted, and in that assertion there is no
doubt much truth, that the young King so detested the memory of
his grandmother, Queen Caroline, so cherished a recollection of the
unnatural behaviour which she had always shown towards his late
father, Frederick, Prince of Wales, that he took an earnest pleasure
in destroying all that she had erected, or on which her taste and
resources had been expended."
   To return to the topographical description of the property.                The
Brentford Horse Ferry was superseded by the erection of the first
Kew Bridge in 1759.
   In 1765 George     III  obtained an Act (6 George III) for the shutting
up of Love Lane, undertaking in return to maintain Kew Lane, the
present high road from Richmond to Kew Bridge.                     This Act was
apparently ineffective, for a further one was passed in 1 784 (25 George
III).
   The Palace at Kew was the residence of Augusta Princess of Wales,
mother of George ni, and the Observatory                   attached to it fell
into disuse. Accordingly, when the Transit of Venus occurred in
1769, facilities for observing it at the old Kew Observatory                   did
not exist.    This was pointed out to King George               III   (apparently
by   Dr.   Demainbray),      and  he   gave  orders   for  the    erection of an
Observatory in the Old Deer Park, the architect being Sir William
Chambers.      This was known as the " King's Observatory," and in a
paper* by the late Major- General Gibbes Rigaud, it is further styled
"the King's Observatory at Kew." Dr. Evans, however, calls it "The
Royal Observatory," and speaks of it as being at Richmond.

   The   first Superintendent of         the Observatory     was Dr. Stephen
Charles Triboudet Demainbray,           descended   from  parents who had fled
to London from France on the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes.
This gentleman, after a varied career as a lecturer on science in various
universities and institutions in these islands and in France, had settled
in London as instructor in science to the King before his accession,
and   subsequently      to Queen Charlotte. One point in             his career
shows the estimation in which he was held in France.                   I gather
from    General Rigaud's paper, " In France (although               not of the
                                                           '                    '

    When the new Observatory was finished, Ur. Demainbray adjusted
 the instruments there in time to make the Transit observation, and
 was its Superintendent until his death in 1782.
    George    III  frequently attended at the Observatory, and procured
 the best clocks and watches that could be made and placed them
 in the Observatory, so that by daily observations of the sun when
 passing the meridian, the time was regulated, and for many years
 the accurate time for the regulation of the clocks in both Houses of
 Parliament. at the Horse Guards, St. James's, and elsewhere, was taken
 from the King's Observatory, before the accommodation was so well
 and publicly afforded     as it is at present from the Royal Observatory
 at Greenwich.       The clock which was the principal timekeeper at the

44                           Mr. R. H. Scott.
Observatory is now at the Patent Museum, South Kensington              (No.
1426), and is going well.    It bears the following inscription : —
    " This clock   was made by Benjamin       Vulliamy,   Clock-Maker to
the King, for his Majesty George III, by whom it was used in his
private observatory at Kew.       It was successively the property of
their Majesties George IV and William IV, of H.R.H. The duke of
Sussex, and of their Majesties Ernest, King of Hanover, and George,
King of Hanover, by whom it was given to Frances Moul ton, widow of
Benjamin Lewis Vulliamy, eldest son of the maker, April 18th, 1854."
    His Majesty King George III, with the assistance of Dr. Demain-
bray, and his son the Rev. Stephen Demainbray (who held and
superintended the Observatory, as the astronomer, for upwards of
fifty-eight years after his father's death) procured a large collection
of instruments, models, &c, besides a large apparatus for experiments
in all branches of natural philosophy, as also a very valuable natural
history collection.    In addition to these, there was a collection of
minerals from the Hartz mines ; but these were afterwards given by
King George IV to the British Museum.
    The Observatory was for many years an object of great interest to
 King George III, and the Rev. S. Demainbray was for a length of
time the teacher of the younger members of the King's family, who
attended at the Observatory for his lectures on astronomy, electricity,
 &c. King William IV also took great interest in the Observatory, and
frequently visited it.
    At the time of the transfer of the Observatory to the British
 Association, Mr. S. Demainbray retired on a pension, and he died in
 July, 1854, at the age of ninety-five years.
    During the latter part of the fifty-eight years in which he super
 intended the Observatory he was assisted by his nephew, Stephen Peter
 Rigaud, Esq., Savilian Professor of Astronomy at Oxford, and Radcliffe
 Observer.    This gentleman took charge of the Observatory during
 the Oxford vacations, and thus enabled his uncle to reside during
 those periods on his living in Wiltshire.        The King's Observatory
 lasted, therefore, for seventy-one years, i.e., from 1769 to 1840.
    The Observatory itself was at one time in charge of a curator
 named John Little, who was hanged in 1795 for the murder of two
 old people in Richmond to whom he owed money, and who was
 strongly suspected of having murdered a carpenter named Stroud,
 who was discovered in the principal or octagon room of the Observa
 tory, the body lying under an iron vice.     The St. James's Chronicle,
 in August, 1 795, in giving an account of Little's execution, says, " from
 his civil deportment he was in general the only attendant on His
 Majesty when he walked in the gardens."            The inquest on Stroud
 at a previous date had resulted in a verdict of accidental death.

Extract from Simond's "Voyage en Angleterre." Paris, 8vo, 1817.
   " Le roi aime l'astronomie, et a un Observatoire dans un
                                                                   petit parc
à Richmond, appelé " The King's Paddock." Il y a un grand télescope
de   Herschel ; un instrument des passages (transit) de huit pieds de
long, à travers lequel nous observâmes passant le meridien ; un
instrument vertical de douze pieds, pour les observations au zenith :
un mural de huit pieds de rayon ; un télescope equatorial, et plusieurs
autres instrumens moins considerables ; quelques modèles de machines,
entre autres, une pour déterminer la pression latérale des voûtes ;
une collection de mineraux, et un cabinet d'instrumens de physique.
    " Sa
          Majesté étant venue à l'Observatoire, il y a quelques années,
pour observer une occultation de planètes, un daim poursuivi de
Windsor, traversa la rivière, franchit les palissades, suivi de toute la
mente, et vint se laisser prendre au pied de l'Observatoire, précisément
au moment de l'observation.
    "Je demandai si l'attention de Sa Majesté s'était montrée supe
rieure à cette interruption. On me répondit qu'un nuage, malheureuse
ment survenu précisément au même instant, avait rendu l'observation
impossible, et qu'autrement rien n'aurait pu l'en distraire."
    The following would appear to be a correct account of the incident
somewhat romantically treated in the above, as it was narrated by the
late Sir James South to Dr. Balfour Stewart : —
    One day Sir James was at the Observatory with the King (George
III)   when they saw the stag hunt from Windsor approaching, and
ascended to the roof to watch it. Concealed by the parapet His Majesty
pointed out to Sir James the different gentlemen following the hounds,
 and at the royal dinner in the evening the King created considerable
 amusement     by assigning   to the guests the relative    places they each
 occupied in the hunt, as they were unable to imagine what position of
 vantage His Majesty had occupied during the proceedings.
    With this the record of the first period of the Observatory     comes to
 a close, and   the building passed into the management of the British
 Association for the Advancement of Science, for the space of thirty
 years, till August 1871.      The negotiations, which were carried out in
 connection    with the establishment       by H.M.'s Commissioners         of
 Woods and Forests, in the first instance with the BiOjal Society, and
 in the second with the British Association, cannot be better described
 than in the following Memorandum drawn up in 1871 by Sir Charles
 Wheatstone, who himself, with Sir Edward Sabine and Mr. J. P.
 Gassiot,   was among the original subscribers to the undertaking in
 1842.    The same three gentlemen, as Members of the Committee,

continued     their active superintendence of the Observatory during the
whole period of its connection with the British Association.
   It will be seen that throughout this memorandum it is termed the
Kew Observatory           in all official documents.

HISTORICAL REMARKS BY SIR CHARLES WHEATSTONE.
   In 1841 the Government came to the determination                   of no longer
keeping up        the  Observatory  and   Museum   established    by His Majesty
George the Third in the Old Deer Park at Richmond. In consequence
of this resolution, the Curator and the Reader in Natural Philosophy,
who had for many years been attached to the building, were pensioned
off,  and the valuable contents were distributed to the Armagh Obser
vatory, the British Museum, King's College, London, the College of
Surgeons, and some members of the Royal Family.                      The building
being     thus    dismantled  and  vacant,  was  applied  for  by  the   Council of
the Royal Society, on the recommendation                 of the Committee of
Physics      and     Meteorology,  as  appears  from  the  following Minutes of
June 24, 1841 :—
     "Mr. Daniell reported, on the part of the Committee of Physics,
that theyhad passed the following resolution, viz.: —
     " ' The Committee, understanding that the building formerly
occupied as the Observatory at Kew is disposable, and may be had if
applied for, and having frequently experienced the want of such a
building for various scientific purposes, recommend to the Council
that an application be made to secure it for the Royal Society.'
     " Resolved, — That this recommendation be adopted ; and that the
President be requested to make application to the proper quarter for
the possession of the building in question."
     An application was accordingly made, and the possession granted
to the Royal Society ; consequent on which the following resolution
 was recorded on November the 11th of the same year : —
     " Resolved, — That it be referred to the Committee of Physics to
consider and report to the Council to what specific scientific purposes
it would be desirable to appropriate the building formerly occupied by
the Observatory at Kew, in case of a grant of that building being
made to the Society           by the Government ; and what would be the
probable annual expense of applying it to such purposes."
     On January the 10th, 1842, a communication was received by the
Secretary from the Office of Woods and Forests, requesting to be
informed when the Society would be prepared to take possession of
the building,         as  it had long since been cleared and ready to             be
 delivered       up when required.       The following resolution was thereon
 recorded     : —
     " That     the Secretary inform Mr. Milne, in answer to his letter, that
 the Council having referred the matter in question to the considera
 tion of a Committee, beg to defer their answer till they receive the
 Ttport of that Committee, which they expect will soon              be prepared."

  48                           Mr. R. H. Scott.
     The report called for was read on February 10, 1842, and was as
.follows : —
     " The Sub-Committee report that, from the peculiar restrictions as
 to access and inhabitancy, and other circumstances affecting the pro
 posed grant of the Kew Observatory to the Royal Society, they do not
 consider that any regular and systematic course of physical observa
 tions at present devisable could be therein advantageously made by
 the Society, or by any observer under their immediate appointment
 and direction ; but that nevertheless they consider that such a build
 ing so held might, if occupied for safe custody by a proper person, be
 highly available for many useful scientific purposes, which have long
 been desiderata as part of the establishment at Somerset House ; such
 as, among others, the following : —
     "1. As a depository of instruments and other property of the Royal
 Society, either not in use, or for which, for general or special reasons,
 Somerset House may not be regarded by the Council as an advan
 tageous place of deposit.
     " 2. As a station for occasional     observation and comparison     of
 pendulums, either returned from abroad, or about to proceed on
 voyages, as also for affording foreigners wishing to compare pendulums
 an opportunity of so doing.
    " 3. As a station for trial and comparison of magnetical apparatus,
and affording to observers desirous of acquiring a knowledge of the
nature and use of such apparatus, an opportunity for conveniently
doing so, and of obtaining a practical knowledge of the system of
magnetical observation recommended by the Society.
    " 4. As a station in which many occasional phenomena might be
advantageously      observed by Fellows of the Society, or others, on
permission     obtained  from the President and Council, such as, for
example, concerted observations of shooting-stars, &c, or in which the
                                       '
phenomena of what has been called magnetic storms,' or unusual mag
netic disturbances might be witnessed, and their particulars attended
to by observers desirous of so doing, without interfering with obser
vations regularly in progress at official stations, or with a view to
other circumstances in their phenomena than what may be ordinarily
                                                                     '
observed at such stations ; it being considered that such ' storms     are
sometimes of considerable duration, and may become known to exist
by direct communication from Greenwich or other regular observing
station.
    "     As
      5.     a  proper place for the trial of physical apparatus and
occasional physical experiments, for which no convenience exists at
Somerset House; such as may either be proposed by scientific
committees, or be undertaken by individuals, on permission duly
obtained from the President and Council.
   " 6. As a proper place for the comparison of standards of every

                    History of   the Kevo Observatory.                49
description in which general steadiness of temperature and structure,
light, retirement, and security may be especially needed.
   "As regards the probable cost of such an establishment to the
Society, it appears to include essentially: — 1st, the wages of a man
who should reside in the house, and take care of it; 2nd, such repairs
as may from time to time be required, should Government not take
on itself the charge of maintenance of the structure ; 3rd, the interest
of money expended in fitting it for the purposes in view ; and 4th, the
taxes and rates which may be incident on its occupation.
    " As to the first of these items, the Sub-Committee consider that
an amount of 10a. 6d. per week, 271. 6s. per annum, would suffice
with fuel.
    " The building has been represented to them as being in excellent
repair, and not to have cost bl. annually for some time in its main
tenance in that state ; nor are they without reason to hope that
such an understanding might be had with the proper authorities as
would strike out this item in future.
   " It has also been stated to them, that
                                             among the fixtures of the
buildings are included an ample provision of glass cases and other
receptacles well adapted for the preservation of instruments and books,
and which have heretofore served for the preservation of the very
 valuable collections lately presented     by Her Majesty to King's
 College,  London,  and which would materially alleviate the charges
 incidental on this head.

                                                 "Edward Sabine."
    On the 10th of March, however, the Council of the Royal Society
rejected the gift they had previously solicited, in the following
resolution : —
    "Resolved, — That, on full consideration of the report of the
Committee of Physics, including Meteorology, presented at the last
meeting of the Council, it does not appear to the. Council to be
expedient for the Society to occupy the Observatory at Kew ; and
that the Treasurer be requested to make known this decision to the
Commissioners of the Woods and Forests, expressing at the same
time their thanks for the courtesy and attention paid to the suggestion
of the Council on the subject."
   The building having thus become again unappropriated, a number
of Fellows of the Royal Society and Members of the British Associa
tion, desirous that it should be retained for the purposes of science,
recommended that an application should be made for it in the name
of the British Association, and entered into a subscription for the
purpose of promoting the objects stated in the following prospectus.

50                               Mr. R. H. Scott.
The subscription was headed by donations of 151. each from the
Marquis Of Northampton and Lord Francis Egerton as Presidents
respectively of the Royal Society and the British Association ; and the
following gentlemen entered their names for sums varying from al.
to  \0l. each : —
    Sir John Herschel, Sir John Lubbock, Sir Charles Lemon, Sir
H. de La Beche, Sir John Rennie, Lient.-Col. Sabine, Capt. Chapman,
The Rev. Dr. Buckland, Dr. Arnott, Dr. Fitton, Prof. Daniell, Prof.
Graham,      Prof. M-Cullagh, T.C.D., Prof. Wheatstone, R. L Mnrchison,
Esq., J. Davies Gilbert, Esq., H. F. Talbot. Esq., J. Taylor, Esq.,
G. Rennie, Esq., J. Evans, Esq., J. P. Gassiot, Esq., and R. Napier, Esq.
    The views of these gentlemen were expressed as follows : —
    " It has frequently been the subject of regret that there does not
exist in this country any of those facilities for the encouragement and
advancement of physical science which have been ro liberally afforded
by the Governments of other nations.
    " The Continental
                           philosopher, when he for the first time visits our
shores, finds to his great surprise that in the metropolis of this great
empire there is not one collection of physical instruments which can
afford the slightest idea of the present advanced state of scientific
investigation.       A few of our establishments for public instruction,
indeed, are provided with apparatus for exhibiting the most usual
results of experimental philosophy to classes of learners at public
lectures, and there are two or three public exhibitions at which
some of the most popular and practical results are shown, but the
most valuable instruments of scientific researches, particularly those
by means of which alone accurate quantitative results can be obtained,
are nowhere to be found.          It is to be hoped that ere many years have
passed     a   National   Physical    Museum worthy of the name may be
established in London, but as this is an object which we cannot expect
 to see re.ilized by the private co-operation of individuals, it is proposed
 to carry into present effect a plan of a more limited nature, which will
 supplv some of the most obvious and urgent existing wants otherwise
 uuprovided      for, and which does not seem beyond our means of
 accomplishing.
     " It is
             proposed to establish, in connexion with the British Associa
 tion, a Physical Observatory.            The useful purposes to which it is
 intended     to apply  the Building    at Kew, to be placed at the disposal of
 the British Association,      are, among others, the   following: —
     " 1. It will be a repository for, and place for occasional observation
  and comparison of the various instruments which the recent discoveries
  iu physical science have suggested for improving our knowl-dge of
  meteorology, <fcc, in order that their relative advantages and defects
  may be ascertained.
     " A
          great number of very ingenious instruments have been invented

                         History of  the Kew Observatory.                   51
    on the Continent within the last twenty years, which are practically
    unknown in this country, but which, if properly understood, verified,
    and brought into use, would lead to valuable results.
       " At  the present moment a most important and widely extended
   series of simultaneous observations in different parts of the world is
   being carried out, and to this object the British Government and East
    India Company have munificently contributed. With the exception
   of the magnetical instruments, none are at present employed for these
   observations but those which have been long known and verified ; this
   has arisen from want of proper knowledge of the means of construct
   ing, using, and interpreting the results of the new instruments.       Did
   we possess this knowledge, the harvest to be gained from the system
   of combined observations, now in operation, might be more than
   doubled, with scarcely any increase of expense.
       " 2. A repository  and station for trial of new instruments, having
  the same objects as the above in view, which may be proposed in this
  country. Among instruments which have been proposed, and which
   will probably not be constructed and brought into use without the
  assistance which an Institution like this alone can afford, may be men
  tioned : a universal meteorograph, which will accurately record half-
  hourly indications of various meteorological instruments, dispensing
  entirely with the attendance of an observer; an apparatus for record
  ing the direction and intensity of the wind simultaneously at various
  heights above the earth's surface ; an apparatus for telegraphing the
  indications of meteorological instruments carried up in balloons or by
 kites, to an observer at the earth's surface.
      "3. As a station to which persons, willing to become coadjutors in
 the system of consentaneous observations, may bring their instruments
 for the purpose of comparison with the standard instruments there
 deposited.      Attention need not be called to the increased value of
 observations made with instruments thus properly compared.
      " 4. As the depository of a complete set of the magnetic instru
 ments at present in use in the various magnetic observatories, in order
 that any person desirous of so doing may understand their construc
 tion and acquire their use. The only magnetic observatory in England
 is at Greenwich, and the instruments, being in constaut use, cannot be
 employed for the purposes here mentioned.
     " 5. A complete series of apparatus for experiments on atmospheric
electricity.      For such investigation the locality is peculiarly adapted.
Nothing      of the kind at present exists in England, and yet there is no
subject in meteorological science for which so much remains to be done.
     " 6. One of the rooms to be fitted up as an optical chamber with a
Heliostat, Fraunbofer's prismatic telescope, photometers, &c, prin
cipally for the purposes of optical astronomy, a subject at present
totally neglected.
                                                                  e 2

     7. As complete a collection  as can be gathered together of the
measuring instruments employed in the various branches of physical
science, for the purpose of obtaining accurate quantitative results.
   " The facilities which such a collection would give to original
investigation do not at present exist in this country.
   " It is not at          recommended that any expenditure   of the
                     present
funds should   be made for apparatus  intended merely to exhibit the
necessary consequences of established laws."
  A successful application was then made by the authorities of the
British Association for the possession of the building; and at the
Meeting at Manchester in June, 1842, the President of the year, Lord
Francis Egerton, thus alluded to this gift of the Government in his
opening address : —
         I
   " have been
                  speaking of matters for some time past in progress
and notorious to all who have taken an interest in your proceedings.
They are gratifying as proofs that the impulse of this Society has
been communicated and felt in high quarters.     It is surely desirable
that under any form of Government, the collective science of a country
should be on the most amicable footing with the depositories of
its power ; free indeed from undue control and interference, not
dangling in antechambers, nor wiping the dust from the palace stair
cases, uucontaminated   by the passions and influences with which
statesmen have to deal, but enjoying its good will and favour,
receiving and requiting with usury its assistance on fitting occasions,
and organized in such a manner as to afford reference and advice
on topics with respect to which they may be required.  * * * The
most recent instance     I                   I
                       cannot omit — mean the important accession
to the means of this Society of a fixed position, a place for deposit,
regulation, and comparison of instruments, and for many more
purposes than    I
                 could name, perhaps even more than are yet contem
plated, in the Observatory at Kew. This building was standing useless.
The Council of the Association approached the throne with a petition
that they might occupy         it,
                              and   am happy to say that the sceptre
                                     I
was gracefully held towards them and     ;     think this transaction
                                                 I                     a
fair instance of that species of connexion between science and govern
ment which   I hope may always be cultivated in this country.     I   am
informed that the purposes to which this building         isreadily and
immediately applicable, are of an importance which none but men
advanced in science can appreciate.      You will hear farther of them in
the Committee Recommendations."                                  C. W.

           KEW OBSERVATORY UNDER THE BRITISH
                               ASSOCIATION.
   This period naturally divides itself into two intervals, the first of
ten years, 1842 to 1851, when Mr. (afterwards Sir Francis) Ronalds,
F.R.S., acted as Honorary Superintendent.                 In 1852, the second
period of twenty years commenced, and the Kew Committee first
appeared as actually taking control of the establishment, with Mr.
John Welsh, F.R.S., as Superintendent. The Committee had been
formally constituted in 1849, as shown by the following extract : —
    Extract from   the  First Minute Book of     the Kew Committee of  the
                              British Association.
   "At   a Meeting of the Council of the British Association, held at
6, Queen Street Place, London, October 25, 1849 —
                                    " Present :
   Sir Charles Malcolm, K.C.B., in the Chair, succeeded by Robert
Hutton, Esq.   ;
            W. J. Hamilton, Esq.       ;      Dr. Forbes Royle ;
            Robert Hutton, Esq. ;             Lieut.-Colonel Sabine ;
            Francis Ronalds, Esq. ;           John Taylor, Esq. ;
It was resolved that the following gentlemen be named as a Com
mittee for visiting and exercising          a general superintendence     over
the experiments and observations to be made at Kew ; and that the
Council are persuaded that the Members of the Committee will render
a good service to science, and will entitle themselves to the cordial
thanks of the British Association, if they will regard themselves as
Members    of a real working Committee : —
                          Sir J. W. Herschel, Bart.     ;
                          J. P. Gassiot, Esq. ;
                          Colonel Reid, Royal Engineers;
                          Colonel Sykes ;
                          Charles Wheatstone,      Esq. ;
in addition to the  President, Trustees, and Officers of the Association."
   The first   Report of the Committee, signed by Mr. Gassiot as
Chairman,    was that for 1853.          In 1859   Mr. Welsh died, and was
succeeded by Mr. Balfour Stewart, F.R.S., who held office for twelve
years, up to August, 1871, when the connection of the Observatory
 with the Association was terminated, as will be explained sub
sequently.
   The first notice    we find   in the Reports of the Association      as to

 54                            Mr. R. H. Scott.
the administration of the Observatory was the following          resolution
adopted at the Manchester Meeting in June, 1842 : —
      " That Professor Wheatstone, Professor Daniel], and Mr. Snow
           Harris be a Committee for constructing a self-recording
           meteorological apparatus to be employed in the building at
           Kew, recently placed by Her Majesty the Queen at the dis
           posal of the British Association, with the sum of 50 J. at their
           disposal for the purpose.
              " Also that the sum of 200Z. be placed at the disposal of the
           Council for upholding the establishment in the Kew Observa
           tory."
    In the volume for the next year, 1843, we have the Report of a
 Committee, consisting of Professor Wheatstone, Mr. Hutton, the
General Secretary (Colonel Sabine), and Treasurer (Mr. John Taylor),
appointed by the Council to superintend the establishment of meteoro
logical observations at the Kew Observatory.           And at the close of
the first year the Council report the establishment of the following
registries, viz.  : —
      " 1.  An ordinary meteorological record with standard instruments
           made by Mr. Galloway under the superintendence of Professor
           Wheatstone.
      " 2. A meteorological record with self-registering instruments on
           a new   construction by Professor Wheatstone.
      " 3.  A  record of the electrical state of the atmosphere.
    " Mr. Ronalds' name now appears in connexion with the electrical
records, and for the next nine years he acted as Hon. Superintendent.
   It is evident that the action of the Council in taking charge of the
 Observatory was criticised at an early date, for from the Report of
the Meeting at Southampton, 1846, we learn that the expediency of
discontinuing Kew had been referred to the Council at the previous
Meeting, as will be seen by the following extract of a Report from
the Council presented to the general Committee, September 9, 1846.
   The General Committee at Cambridge having passed a resolution —
      " That it be referred to the Council to take into consideration
         before the next Meeting of the Association the expediency        of
         discontinuing the Kew Observatory,"
the Council appointed a Committee, consisting of the President (Sir
John Herschel), the Dean of Ely, the Astronomer Royal, Professors
Graham and Wheatstone, and Lieut.-Colonel Sabine, to collect infor
mation on the scientific purposes which the Kew Observatory has
served, and on its general usefulness to science and to the Association,
from whom they received the following Report : —
   " Kew
             Observatory, May 7, 1846. Present, Sir J. F. W. Herschel,

                      History of    the  Kew Observatory.                   55
 Bart., the Astronomer Royal, Professors Graham and Wheatstone, and
 Lieut. -Col. Sabine.
     " After an attentive examination of                   state of the estab
                                              the present
 lishment and of other matters connected therewith, the following
 resolutions were unanimously adopted, viz. : —
       That it be recommended to the General Committee that the estab
lishment at Kew, the occupancy of which has been granted by Her
Majesty to the British Association, be maintained in its present state
of efficiency.
    " 1. Because it affords, at a
                                       very inconsiderable    expense, a local
habitation to the Association,         and a convenient depository for its
 books, manuscripts, and apparatus.
    " 2. Because it has afforded to Members of the Association the means
of prosecuting many physical inquiries which otherwise would not have
been entered upon.
     " 3. Because the establishment has already become a point of interest
to scientific foreigners, several of whom have visited it.
    " 4. Because the
                        grant of the occupancy of the building by Her
Majesty,    at the earnest  request of the British Association, is an instance
of Her Majesty's interest in and approval of the objects of the
Association.
    -•
       5. Because if the Association at the present time relinquish the
establishment      it will probably never again be available for the
purposes of science.
    " (i. Because it
                      appears, both from the publications of the British
Association and from the records in progress at the establishment, that
a great amount of electrical and meteorological observation has been
and continues to be made, and that a systematic inquiry into the
intricate subject of atmospheric electricity has been carried oat by
Mr. Ronalds, which has been productive of very material improvements
in that subject, and has in effect furnished the model of the processes
conducted at the Royal Observatory ; and because these inquiries are
still in progress under local circumstances extremely favourable.
    " 7. Because other inquiries into the working of self-registering
apparatus, both meteorological and magnetical, are in actual progress
at the establishment, and there is a distinct prospect of the facilities
it affords being speedily much more largely profited by.
    " 8. Because the access to the
                                      Observatory from London to Members
of the Association will shortly be greatly improved by railroads, and
because the local facilities and conveniences of the establishment have
been very greatly enhanced by alterations in its relations to the
Commissioners of Woods and Forests.
                           Signed.
                                         " J. F. W. Herschel, Chairman."
    In presenting this Report to the General Committee            the  Council

56                           Mr. R. H. Scott.
requests that   it may be understood to convey also the opinion of the
 Council.
   At this early period much of Mr. Ronalds' attention was directed
to the subject of atmospheric electricity, and in this investigation he
was assisted by Mr. W. Radcliff Birt. At the same time the Hon.
Superintendent was far from neglectful of other branches of physical
research, and he devoted much of his rare mechanical energy to the
invention and perfecting of the photographic processes for the registra
tion of meteorology and terrestrial magnetism, with which the name
of the Kew Observatory has been permanently associated.
   In the course of the year 1850 magnetic observations were com
menced with instruments provided by Lient.-Colonel Sabine, and Mr.
John Welsh was appointed by the Committee as Assistant, Mr. Birt
having left the Observatory; and in the following year we notice the
first commencement of the Verification Department, which has
subsequently become such an important feature of the Kew opera
tions — the purchase of a standard thermometer by Regnault, with the
intention of employing the latter instrument in the verification of
thermometers made by artists in this country — and the procuring of
M. Regnault's apparatus for calibrating and graduating thermometer
tubes.
   In  1852  the verification work   had  fairly started, as well as the
making of standard     thermometers.    Mr. Welsh also had made two
ascents in a balloon, for the determination of the temperature and
hygrometric condition of the air at different elevations, before the date
of the British Association Meeting.
   In the course of this year Mr. Ronalds left the Observatory to
reside on the Continent, and accordingly from this date Mr. Welsh is
to be regarded as Superintendent of the Observatory, the first or
preliminary stage of the Observatory having come to an end.
   In 1853, as already stated, appeared the first Kew Report. signed
by  Mr. Gassiot as Chairman of the Kew Committee, and in the next
year, 1854, we learn that the best form of barometers and thermo
meters for the use of the Mercantile Marine had been decided on by
the Kew Committee at the request of the Board of Trade, and that
Mr. Welsh had experimentally tested the marine barometers in a
vovage to Leith and back, and in one to and from the Channel Islands.
   Also that Sir J. Herschel had suggested the importance of
obtaining daily photographic pictures of the sun's disk, and that
Mr. Warren de la Rue having reported that the probable cost would
not exceed 150Z., this sum had been procured from the Donation Fund
of the Royal Society.
   In the same year Robert Beckley was engaged as machinist, on the
recommendation of Mr. de la Rue. Two acres of ground were also

                    History of   the Kew Observatory.                  57
secured, contiguous to the Observatory.      Welsh's standard barometer
 dates from 1855, and the introduction of gas to the Observatory from
the next year. In the same year Mr. Balfour Stewart was engaged
 as Assistant, but he only remained for a brief period in that capacity,
 for in 1857 he was succeeded by Mr. Charles Chambers.
    In 1856 Mr. Becklej's modification of Robinson's anemometer
 was submitted to the Committee, and also a series of monthly
 determinations of dip and horizontal force was commenced with
instruments provided by General Sabine from his Department at
Woolwich.
    The next important event to be chronicled is that the following
Memorandum relative to the re-establishment             of self-recording
 magnetic instruments     at the Kew Observatory       was submitted to
the Committee by General Sabine on July 22, 185G : —
    " 1. The decennial
                        period in the solar magnetic variations, and its
coincidence with a similar period in the frequency and amount of
the solar spots, appear to be highly deserving of attention in an
 Observatory established, as Kew is, for physical researches.
    " 2. There is reason to
                             suppose that the permanency and regularity
in the occurrence of the decennial period in the magnetic variations,
and its coincidence with the periodic variation of the solar spots,
might be effectually and satisfactorily tested by observations of both
 classes of phenomena at the alternate periods of maximum             and
 minimum, say, for example, in 1857 and 1858 as the anticipated
period of maximum, and in 1863 and 1864 as the anticipated period
 of minimum, and so forth.
    " 3. The
              apparatus constructing under the superintendence          of
 Mr. de la Rue will, it is hoped, fully meet the requirements of the
 research in respect of the solar spots.
    "4. Since the time when the magnetic self-recording instruments
 belonging to the Kew Observatory were constructed under the direc
 tion of Mr. Ronalds, very considerable improvements have been made
in the art of photography, and the six months' trial which was made
by Mr. Welsh of Mr. Ronalds's instruments has led in several other
respects   to suggestions for improvements which could not but be
expected to be required in instruments of so novel a kind, while at
the same time the six months' trial referred to has placed beyond
doubt the sufficiency of a properly conducted research by means of
self-recording instruments, for the examination of the solar magnetic
variations."
    The Committee authorized Mr. Welsh to proceed with the construc
tion of the instruments, which were completed at an expense not
exceeding 250Z., derived from the Government           Grant Fund, the
instruments remaining at Kew at        the disposition of the Council of
the Royal Society.

58                           Mr. R. H. Scott.
    In the same year the Kew Heliograph was completed, and it was
arranged that Mr. Welsh should undertake the Magnetic Snrvey of
Scotland, the results of which operation were published by Mr. Stewart
in the Report of the British Association for 1859.         In 1858 also Mr.
G. M. Whipple was engaged as a boy.
   In ] 859 Mr. Welsh died, and was succeeded by Mr. Balfour Stewart.
At this date an instrument had been devised at the Observatory for
tabulating the values of the magnetic elements from the magneto-
grams, and as the staff of assistants at the Observatory was not
sufficiently   large to undertake     these tabulations,    General  Sabine
undertook    to have the  results tabulated at Woolwich for every hour.
    In 1860 the Kew Photoheliograph was taken by Mr. de la Rue,
mainly at his own expense, to Spain, for employment at the Solar
 Eclipse on July 18th. Its use was a complete success, and proved
that the red prominences belonged to the sun.
    In 1861 Sir W. Thomson's Electrograph was brought into regular
operation at Kew, and an account of two years' work with it was
prepared and submitted to the Royal Society by Professor J. D.
 Everett in 1868.
    In 1862, at the suggestion of Admiral Fitz Roy, who agreed on the
part of the Meteorological Department of the Board of Trade to bear
the expense incurred, the Barograph designed by Mr. Ronalds was
fitted up, and has been from that date kept in constant operation.
    It was also reported that as on account of the inadequate strength
of the staff of assistants it was not possible to work the Photo-Helio
graph at Kew, it had been in operation at Mr. de la Rue's observa
tory, at Cranford, since February 7th.         The instrument remained in
Mr. de la Rue's hands for twelve months, when it was re-erected at
Kew.
    In 1862 Mr. Stewart communicated to the Royal Society an account
of some experiments made at Kew in order to determine the increase
between 32° Fahr. and 212° Fahr. of the elasticity of dry atmospheric
air the volume of which remains constant ; and also of others to
determine the freezing-point of mercury.
    In the next year Mr. Chambers left the Observatory to enter the
India Telegraph Service, and eventually to take charge of the Colaba
Observatory, Bombay ; his place, as Magnetic Assistant, being filled
by Mr. Whipple.
    In 1865 we hear that the Indian Government having decided that
pendulum observations should be made in India, Col. Walker and
Capt. Basevi received instruction at Kew.           A convenient room for
pendulum     observations  was  likewise  fitted up in the Observatory, the
expense being defrayed from the Government-Grant Fund of the
Royal Society ; and in this room preliminary observations were made
for determining the constants of the two pendulums about to be

                      History of   the Kew Observatory.                  59
used  in India.      The observations were made by Mr. Loewy, and the
results communicated to the Royal Society.
   In the same year it is reported that — (1) the solar spectrum was being
mapped by the spectroscope belonging to the Chairman (Mr. Gassiot),
and at his expense. All the measurements between D and E had been
made and completely verified, and a map of this region in accordance
with these constructed ; the investigation was continued until 18(56, at
which time about three-fourths of the region between E and F had
been mapped.        And (2) that Hofrath Schwabe, of Dessau, had very
generously placed his valuable and extensive series of sun-pictures
at the disposal of the Royal Astronomical Society for the immediate
use of the Kew Observatory.            The enumeration of spots on the
principle followed by Herr Schwabe was then commenced and has
been   continued up to the present time.
   1865 also witnessed the commencement of an investigation, which
was continued at intervals for several years, but which cannot be said
to have led to definite results as yet.     It is thus introduced :—
   " At the joint
                    suggestion of Professor Tait, of Edinburgh, and the
Superintendent,      an ingenious apparatus has been constructed by Mr.
Beckley, by    means   of which a disk can be made to revolve in vacuo
with great velocity ; and a short description of some experiments
performed by means of this instrument, with a view of ascertaining
whether visible as well as molecular motion is dissipated by a medium
pervading space, has been communicated to the Royal Society by the
Superintendent in conjunction with Professor Tait."
   In 1866 the completion of the Kew Photographic thermograph by
Mr. Beckley is announced, and in the same year the General Com
mittee of the British Association adopted the following resolution : —
      " That the Kew Committee         be  authorized   to discuss and make
         the necessary arrangements with the Board of Trade, should
         any proposal be made respecting the superintendence, reduction,
         and publication of meteorological observations, in accordance
         with the recommendations        of the Report of the Committee
         appointed to consider certain questions relating to the Meteoro
         logical Department of the Board of Trade."
   This resolution initiated the close relationship between the Kew
Observatory and the Meteorological Office, of which the reorganiza
tion was then in contemplation : a relationship which has materially
modified the course of operations at Kew Observatory in subsequent
years.
   In  1866 the first set of results obtained from the heliograph were
published at the expense of Mr. de la Rue under the following title,
" Researches     on  Solar Physics," by Messrs. Warren de la Rue, B.
                                          " On the Nature of Sun-spots."
Stewart, and B. Loewy ; first series,

60                           Mr. R. H. Scott.
   This was successively followed in   1867 by the Second Series, entitled
" Researches on Solar
                           Physics, Second Series, Area-measurements
of sun-spots observed by Mr. Carrington during the           seven years
1854-60 inclusive, and deductions         therefrom," and   in 1868 by
Appendix to the second series, " On the Distribution in     Heliographic
Latitudes of the Sun-spots observed by Carrington."         These papers
all appeared at Mr. de la Rue's expense, and all bore the   names of the
same authors.
   Two papers were likewise communicated in 1868 to the Royal
Society by these gentlemen.        The first is entitled "Researches on
Solar Physics, Heliographic Positions, and Areas of Sun-spots observed
with the Kew Photoheliograph during the years 1862 and 1863." The
second, "Account of some recent observations on Snn-spots made at the
Kew Observatory."
   1867.    In the Report of the Kew Committee for this year we have
a  short account of what steps had been taken by Government with
reference to Meteorology, ending with the names of the superintending
Meteorological Committee, and stating that on the 3rd of January this
Committee had appointed Mr. Balfour Stewart as its Secretary, on the
understanding that he should, with the concurrence of the Kew Com
mittee of the British Association, retain his present office of Superin
tendent of the Kew Observatory.
   It was also proposed that Kew Observatory should become the
Central Observatory, at which all instruments used by or prepared for
the. several observatories or stations connected with the Meteorological
Department should be verified, the entire expense attendant thereon,
or any future expense arising through the connexion of the Observa
tory with the Meteorological Department, being paid from the funds
supplied by the latter," and not in any way from money subscribed by
the British   Association.   These proposals having been submitted to
the Kew Committee, they approved of the Kew Observatory being
regarded as the Central Observatory of the Meteorological Office,
and of Mr. Stewart's holding the office of Secretary to the Scientific
 Committee superintending that office.
    In the same year we are informed that the magnetic curves produced
at Kew previously to the month of January, 1865, had all been
measured and reduced under the direction of General Sabine, by the
staff of his office at Woolwich ; and the results of this reduction com
 municated by General Sabine to the Royal Society in a series of
memoirs.
   In the course of this and the succeeding year the assistants at the
six outlying automatic observatories, in connection with the Meteoro
logical Office, Aberdeen, Armagh, Falmouth, Glasgow, Stonyhurst,
and Valencia, received their training at Kew, while Mr. Stewart, with
 the assistance of Mr. Beckley, personally superintended the erection

of the instruments at the several stations.       The Report for 1868
contains an account of the work done at Kew as the Central Observa
tory of the Meteorological Committee, in which it is stated that this
work may be divided into four heads : —
      (1) The arrangement of the self-recording meteorological   instru
             ments, their verification at Kew, and erection      at  the
             various stations.
      (2)  The arrangement        of a system of tabulation   from the
             automatic records of these instruments.
      (3) The   arrangement      of a system by means of which the
             accuracy of the instruments themselves, and of their
             tabulated records, may be secured.
      (4)  Work    done at Kew as being itself one of the Observatories
             of the Meteorological Committee.
   In  1869 we   learn inter alia that Mr. Beckley had devised his self-
recording rain gauge, an account of which was submitted to the
British Association at Exeter. At the close of the year, in October,
Dr. Stewart resigned the Secretaryship of the Meteorological Com
mittee, and the relations between the Kew Committee and the
Meteorological Office were consequently modified.

      KEW OBSERVATORY UNDER THE ROYAL SOCIETY.
     The letter from the Secretary of the British Association, com
 municating the Resolution of the Council of that body, which has
 been given above, was taken into consideration          by the Council of the
 Royal Society      on  the 19th     of  January, 1871.    At the Meeting of
 the Council on the 16th of March of the same year, a letter was read
from Mr. J. P. Gassiot, F.R.S., offering to the Royal Society an
 immediate gift of securities, the proceeds of which were to be devoted
 to the maintenance of a Central Magnetical and Physical Observatory
 at Kew.      The negotiations for the acceptance of this munificent offer
 were carried to a successful issue during the ensuing months, and on
 the 15th of June the following memorandum was entered on the
 Council Minutes of the Royal Society : —
 Memorandum       of  the general   heads   of the proposed Deed   of Trust of
       the Fund offered by Mr. Gassiot for -maintaining the Kew Observatory
       and carrying on the magnetic, meteorological, and physical observa
       tions there : —
     " Securities representing 10,OO0Z. are proposed to be given to the
 Royal Society by J. P. Gassiot, Esq., F.R.S., upon trust, for the
purpose of assisting in carrying on and continuing magnetical and
meteorological observations with self-recording instruments, and any
other physical investigations as may from time to time be found practi
cable and desirable, in the Kew Observatory, in the Old Deer Park,
at Richmond, Surrey, belonging to Her Majesty's Government; or,
in the event of that Government at any time declining to continue
placing that building at the disposition of the Royal Society, then
in any other suitable building as the Council of the Royal Society
may determine.
    " The Observatory and the income of the Trust Fund are to be
under the entire control and management of a Committee to be from
time to time appointed by the Council, for the time being, of the
Royal Society.
    " The services of such Committee (like those of the present Meteor
ological Committee nominated             at the request of Her Majesty's
Government) are to be gratuitous.
    " The income is to be paid to the Committee
                                                       (to be by them applied
generally towards continuing and maintaining the Observatory and
providing the expenses of conducting the observations and investiga
tions), also for any repairs to the Observatory building and premises,
or for repair or improvement            of the present instruments, or for
providing    new   instruments,   as  the Committee may from time to time

                      History of   the Kew Observatory.                  63
d¦tem    expedient, and generally for carrying out the objects of the
Trust as may be from time to time determined by the Committee.
   "An annual statement of receipts and expenditure is to be prepared
by the Committee with any report that the Committee may from
time to time deem to be desirable, and the same are to be presented
to the Royal Society, and the report is to be published in the
Proceedings of the Royal Society, or in such other form as the Council
may from time to time direct.
   " If,
          by reason of the Kew Observatory, or any other such equivalent
Observatory being at any time discontinued, the observations should
cease to be recorded, and the investigations cease to be made for (say)
twelve consecutive months, the Trust Funds, with all accumulations
(if any), are to be paid over to the person who shall, for the time
being, be, de facto, the Treasurer of the London Middle-Class School
incorporated by Royal Charter, dated 12th of June, 1866, by the
name of " the Corporation for Middle-Class Education in the Metro
polis and suburbs thereof," to the intent that the same may be applied
for the use and benefit of that Corporation as it may think fit and ns
a part of its general funds, and the receipt of such officer is to be a
sufficient discharge to the persons paying over the same.
    " Power to the Royal Society to enlarge such period of twelve months
for a further period of not exceeding (say) two years, in order to give
time for obtaining a site and constructing a new Observatory, with
power to apply the current income, and any accumulations thereof, in
aid of those purposes.
    "'Also, give power to the Royal Society to direct some other charitable
 disposition of the Trust Fund, in case, at the time of the failure of
the Trust as to the Observatory, the Loudon Middle-Class School
shall have     ceased to exist as a corporation.'
    The Deed of Trust was duly prepared and submitted, and was sealed
 with the corporate     seal of the Society on the 29th of June, 1871.
    The Kew Committee of the Royal Society was at once appointed,
 and consisted of the then existing Members of the Meteorological
 Committee of the Royal Society.
    The Observatory was handed over to the Society by the British
 Association at its Edinburgh Meeting.
    Mr. Samuel Jeffery, formerly in charge of the Magnetic Observatory
 at Hobarton, was then appointed Superintendent, while Mr. R. H. Scott
 undertook the duties of Honorary Secretary to the Committee,
 which he continued to discharge for six years until 1877, by which
 time the future success of the undertaking was fully secured.
    Mr. Jeffery held the office of Superintendent until February, 1876,
 when he was succeeded by Mr. G. M. Whipple, B.Sc, who, as appears
 from the preceding pages, had been connected with the Observatory
 for eighteen years.

 (54                         Mr. R. H. Scott.
     During the period of the connection of the Observatory with the
 British Association the expenses incurred in carrying out the various
 experiments and researches as detailed in the foregoing pages were
 considerable.    These were met by grants from the Government
 Grant Fund or the Donation Fund of the Royal Society, or from
 private sources.
     During the last fourteen years, however,   since the establishment
 has been under the management of the     Royal Society Committee, the
 necessity for greater economy has been recognised, and the operations
 have been carried on without assistance from the Funds above men
 tioned.   The administration has, at the same time, been so satisfac
 torily conducted, and the receipts for the verification of instruments
 have so largely increased, that the Committee have been enabled,
out of the surplus balances at their disposal annually, to provide
important and cosily additions to the instrumental equipment of
the Observatory, such as the complete refitment of the magneto-
 graphs, and the purchase successively of a Galton's Thermometer
testing apparatus — of a hydraulic press for deep sea thermometers
— of    a new   cathetometer — and  lastly of the entire  apparatus  for
watch-rating.
    The only extraneous source of income for the Observatory, over and
above occasional small grants from the Meteorological Council for
special researches, has been the money so liberally supplied by Mr. de
la Rue for the completion of the measurement of the sun-pictures.
    The Committee has, however, to regret the gradual disappearance of
many familiar faces from the band of men who took prominent parts
in the management of the Observatory in former years.
    Of Superintendents, the death of Mr. Welsh has already been
noticed, and his predecessor, Mr. Ronalds, after receiving the well-
merited honour of knighthood for his inventions in Telegraphy, died
in 1873 at the age of eighty-five years.
    Of the members of the British Association Committee, Col. W. H.
Sykes, almost its first Chairman, died in 1870 ; Sir C. Wheatstone,
whose name appears in the very first resolution of the British Associa
tion relating to Kew, deceased in 1871; Mr. Gassiot, for eighteen
years the chairman of the British Association Kew Committee, and
the munificent patron of the Observatory in recent years, died in
1876; while Sir E. Sabine, who had been from first to last identified
with the magnetic operations at the Observatory, and might almost
be termed the guiding spirit of the undertaking, passed away in 1883,
having almost attained the patriarchal age of ninety-five years.
    The following are the most important facts which can be gathered
from the successive Reports of the Royal Society Committee : —
    18 72. The Photoheliograph was regularly worked, as in former years,

                      History of  the Kew Observatory.                  G5
  up  to the end of February, 1872, at which epoch the period expired
   which was originally fixed by Mr. de la Rue for the continuance of
  the observations at the expense of the Royal Society Government-
  Grant Fund. The observations were afterwards carried on up to the
  end of March, with the object of fully including ten years.        Since
  that date eye observations of the sun, after the method of Hofrath
  Schwabe, have been made in order that the observations for connect
  ing sun-spots with magnetic phenomena might not drop through until
  photographic records had been taken up on a permanent footing.
     In order to furnish the final corrections to the reductions of the
 sun-pictures, a scale of equal parts, 15 feet in length, designed by Mr.
 de la Rue, and made at his expense, was, with the sanction of Her
 Majesty's Office of Works, erected temporarily on the Pagoda at the
  Royal Gardens, Kew. This was photographed by the Kew Photo-
 heliograph, and so enabled the optical distortion of that instrument to
 be determined.
     Observations were continued for several months, when the apparatus
 was taken down, and the Photoheliograph lent for two years to the
 Astronomer Royal for use at Greenwich.
     1873. A series of experiments were commenced and carried on for
 a space of nearly two years at the expense of the Meteorological Com
 mittee, at the Pagoda in the Royal Gardens, to test the influence of
 height above the ground on the vertical distribution of temperature.
 The thermometers were placed at three different levels, viz., 22 feet
 6 inches,  69 feet, and 128 feet 10 inches above the ground.
    In  the month of May a request was received from Col. J. T. Walker,
 F.R.S., Superintendent    of the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India,
 for provision to  be made at the Observatory   for vibrating pendulums.
    In the year 1865 two pendulums lent by the Royal Society for use
 in India had been vibrated at Kew by the late Capt. Basevi, as explained
 above ; and it was necessary that these pendulums should be vibrated
 again on their return, and that at the same time two pendulums
obtained from the Imperial Academy of Sciences at St. Petersburg
 should also be vibrated.
    The Committee at once complied with the request; and at the
expense of the Indian Government          preparation was made for the
experiments in the south hall on the basement story, by removing for
a time the apparatus for testing sextants, and building up from the
foundation-arches two solid isolated supports for the Russian clock
and pendulum.
    Capt. Heaviside, R.E., the officer charged with the duty of making
the pendulum experiments, arrived in England in July, and, finding
all the arrangements satisfactory, at once commenced his operations.
    Endeavours were made, in connection with the arrangements just
mentioned, to obtain an electrical time communication       between Kew
    vol. xxxix.                                                  f

66                            Mr. R. H. Scott.
and the Royal Observatory       at Greenwich   ; but the proposal failed of
success.
    The experiments were continued until the end of May, 1874, when
the apparatus employed, with the exception of the Russian pendulums
and their accessories, was, at the request of the Secretary of the Royal
Society, received at Kew for storage.
    1874. The Magnetograph instruments were dismounted in January,
1874, for the purpose of thorough examination and readjustment.         The
necessity   for  this measure is  obvious, when  it is remembered  that  the
instruments had been in unintermitted action for the period of fifteen
years.
    The  scale- values were accordingly redetermined, and the instruments
 handed over      to  Mr. Adie for examination     and repair.  They were
 returned and remounted in May, but were not at that time set in
 continuous action, inasmuch as it was intended that the automatic
 records should be suspended for the entire year, so as to commence
 a new series of observations with the year 1875.
    In this year an improved automatic Electrograph, invented by Sir
 W. Thomson, was erected and set in operation.
    In the year 1873 a grant had been obtained from the Government-
 Grant Committee for the purpose of carrying on a series of experiments
 on the constants of Robinson's Anemometers ; and a piece of ground
 in the Park was rented.       Several anemometers, of various construc
 tions, were erected therein.
    The experience of a few months was sufficient to show that the ex
 posure in the Park was not nearly sufficiently open to afford facilities
 for testing the instruments at any but very low velocities, and not
 satisfactorily even in such cases.     Application was therefore made to
 the. Secretary of the Crystal   Palace  Company for permission to employ
 a rotary machine driven by steam-power, so as to be able to vary the
 velocities at pleasure.
     Consent having been most freely given, the experiments were com
 menced, and the instruments tested at various velocities up to about
 thirty miles an hour, the highest attainable by the apparatus.
     A  paper on the results of these experiments was laid before the
  Royal Society by Prof. Stokes in 1881 (Proceedings Royal Society,
  Vol. XXXII, p. 170).
     1875. The year was marked by the recommencement of regular
  work with the Magnetographs.        The instruments were set in action on
  the 1st of January, 1875, and therewith the second series of continuous
  photographic records of magnetic phenomena was inaugurated.
     The principal constants employed in the computations for the Tables
  used in the reduction of the monthly absolute observations which had
  been determined by Mr. Welsh were also re-examined. A memorandum
  containing the results of the observations in question for the twelve

                      History of the  Kew Observatory.                  67
 months ending September 30th, 1875, was prepared and appended to
 the Report for the year, and has formed a feature of every subsequent
 annual report.
    The Registering Sunshine Recorder invented by the late Mr. J. F.
 Campbell,   of Islay, F.G.S., which had been in operation for about
 twenty years at the Office of the Local Government Board, 8,
 Richmond Terrace, Whitehall, was transferred to Kew, and set in
 action at the Observatory.    The instrument consists of a glass sphere
 and wooden bowl, and the effect is measured by the amount of wood
 charred by the sun's action in the course of six months.      Experiments
 were set in progress at the Observatory to obtain a satisfactory daily
 record of the duration of the sun's heating action by a similar method.
   1876. In the previous year Mr. C. S. Peirce, of the United States
 Coast Survey, had made through the Admiralty an application to the
 Royal Society to swing his pendulums at the Observatory.       Permission
 was at once granted, and Mr. Peirce arrived at Kew in June, 1876, and
 as soon as some necessary fittings had been put up in the Pendulum
 Room be erected his apparatus, and made a complete series of vibrations.
    In 1876, at the request of the Editor of the Times, and at the
 expense of that journal, the Staff commenced the preparation of a
 weekly diagram showing the traces of the self-recording meteorological
 instruments on a reduced scale, together with an epitome of the general
 features of the weather. This has appeared without intermission from
 that date.
    The examination and checking of the work of the self-recording
 Observatories of the Meteorological Committee was discontinued in
 November.       This change of arrangements involved a considerable
 reduction in the amount allowed by the Meteorological Office to Kew,
as its central Observatory.
   1877. Sir Edward Sabine having brought the discussion of the
Magnetical Observations carried on under his superintendence in all
parts of the globe for a period of nearly forty years, to a close in
         " Contribution," presented to the Royal Society
a final                                                    (No. XV, Phil.
Trans., Vol. 167), represented to the War Office that he was able to
dispense with the further services of the two Sergeants of the Royal
Artillery who had acted as his clerks, and had been in constant attend
ance at Kew since November, 1871.          These men were in consequence
withdrawn on the 31st of March.
   The documents deposited in Sir E. Sabine's late office were pre
sented by the War Office to the Royal Society, and, in conformity
with instructions received from the Council, are retained in the custody
of the Observatory.     A detailed list of these documents and papers has
been prepared, and a selection made of all those relating to marine
observations, which, at the request of the Hydrographer, were trans,
ferred to the Hydrographic Department of the Admiralty.      "
                                                                 r2

  (is                           Mr. B. H. Scott.
      A system was organized for etching a " Hall-mark," as in the
 annexed figure, upon all Thermometers            which have been
 verified.
      The Astronomer Royal having courteously offered the Committee
 every facility for a suggested comparison between the Greenwich and
 Kew Standard Barometers during April and May, a number of care
 fully selected Portable Standard Barometers were conveyed to and fro
 between Greenwich and Kew on three separate occasions, and a large
 number of comparative readings were obtained by the Superintendent
 and Messrs. Baker and Foster.
     A complete detailed account of the experiment         was  drawn   up,
and laid before the Royal Society, February 7th, 1878.       (Proceedings,
Vol.    XXVII,    p. 76.)
     A Hydraulic     Press especially constructed for the purpose of sub
jecting     Deep Sea Thermometers to pressures similar to those they
experience when sunk to great depths, was erected in the workshop.
 Tt is capable of exerting a strain equal to 4 tons on the square inch.
     1879. Experiments were commenced at the Observatory, with the
view of determining the relative merits of different patterns of
thermometer screens, and continued for upwards of two years.           For
tin-s purpose there were erected on the lawn a Stevenson's screen,
of the ordinary pattern, and a large wooden cage, enclosing a Wild's
screen, of the pattern employed in Russia. Each of these screens
contained a dry and a wet bulb thermometer, and a maximum and
minimum,       all of which were read daily, at 9 a.m. and 9 P.M., their
indications     being compared with those of the thermograph        at the
same hours.
     A discussion     of the twenty-eight months' observations was sub
sequently     made    by Mr. Whipple, and the results published by the
Meteorological      Council.
     1880. A Sub-Committee, which had been appointed in 1878 to
 consider tho best means of utilising the records of the magnetographs,
 reported that it was inadvisable, in their opinion, to proceed with the
 regular tabulation of the curves, and suggested that attention should
 rather be directed to their comparison. with synchronous curves, taken
 at other Magnetic Observatories in different parts of the globe, in
 order to ascertain whether similar disturbances occur at these several
 stations, and at what time intervals ; with a view to the development
 of the theory of magnetic disturbance.
      In order to carry out this scheme, a circular, inviting co-operation
 on the part of observers provided with magnetographs of the Kew
 pattern, was issued to tho Directors of the following Observatories: —
  Batavia, Bombay, Brussels, Coimbra, Colaba, Lisbon, Mauritius,
  Melbourne,     Potsdam.    St. Petersburg (Pawlowsk), San Fernando,
  Stony hurst, Utrecht, Vienna, and Zi-Ka-Wei.       Replies favourable to

                    History of    the Kew Observatory.                  09
the project were received from all those whose instruments were work
ing under satisfactory circumstances.
   An examination     of the records    for the year 1S79 indicated the
month of March as that most suitable for the purpose of the com
parison. Accordingly, a further request for copies of the Declination
curves for that month was issued, and, in response, they were received
from Coimbra, Colaba, Lisbon, Mauritius, Melbourne, St. Petersburg,
Stonyhnrst, Toronto, Utrecht, Vienna, and Zi-Ka-Wei.
   The comparison of these magnetic curves was undertaken by Pro
fessor W. Grylls Adams, who communicated to the Swansea Meeting
of the British Association a preliminary account of the principal facts
which came to light. This was followed by a second paper printed in
the Report of the York Meeting, 1881.
   At the request of the Council of the Royal Astronomical Society, the
valuable collection of MSS. containing the memorable scries of sun-spot
observations made by Hofrath Schwabe, of Dessau, during the years
 1825 to 1807, which had been deposited in the Library of the Obser
 vatory, the first volumes since 1805, was transferred to the Society's
Library at Burlington House, London. In order, however, to render
 the collection of sun-spot observations as complete as possible, and to
 prevent the total loss of the observations in case of fire, the Committee
 voted the sum of 90Z. to defray the cost of making a complete copy of
 the solar drawings.
   This was accordingly done, and accurate tracings made of every one
of Schwabe's drawings. These were pasted into blank books, and any
important notes were transcribed at the same time.
    The Observatory, therefore, now possesses a complete record of the
condition of the sun's surface, extending from November, 1825, to the
present date.
   In 1881, an application was received from Major Herschel, R.E.,
 F.R.S., by authority of the India Office, for permission to make certain
experiments with the invariable pendulums deposited at Kew, and for
the loan of the instruments, with their accompanying appliances, with
facilities for prosecuting the experiments at the Observatory.
   These requests were granted, and in the autumn of the year operations
were carried on, both in the Pendulum Room and in the Experimental
House at Kew.
   On completing his work Major Herschel conveyed the instruments
he employed, first to the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, and sub
sequently to a house near Portland Place, London. Series of observa
tions were made in both those places, with the object of reducing to a
common standard the determinations of gravity made by Kater, Airy,
Sabine, and others.
   On the conclusion    of these latter experiments, Major Herschel con
veyed    the pendulums, clock, &c, to America, where, after making a

70                           Mr. R. H. Scott.
series of observations at Washington, he handed them over to th.
officers of the United States Coast Department. Subsequently Professor
C. S. Peirce, of the United States Coast Survey, who had made a series
of pendulum observations at Kew and elsewhere in 1876, visited the
Observatory in July, 1883, and made a subsidiary series of experiments
with a view of determining the flexure of his stand when on the Kew
piers.
   1882. In April of this year the Chairman announced the comple
tion of the long series of reductions of the Kew Photoheliograph
measurements, extending over the period February 7th, 1862, to April
9th, 1872.     He stated that the MSS. volumes containing the results
had been deposited for reference with the Royal Society, and that the
whole of the sun-pictures had been re-measured at the Observatory,
and reduced by Mr. A. Marth, F.R.A.S., so as to give the heliocentric
longitudes and latitudes of the spots, as well as their areas.
   The entire expense attendant on these reductions,           which has
amounted to the considerable sum of 1,452Z. 6s. Id., was defrayed by
Mr. de la Rue. This amount was in addition to the sums that gentle
man had previously disbursed in contributing to the maintenance of
the Photoheliograph,    and the prosecution of solar research. The total
amount of his payments towards this branch of the Observatory work
has reached the large sum of 2,071/. 15s. 4tf.
   In the same year the Committee received very gratifying testimony as
to the accuracy of the Standard Thermometers constrocted at the Obser
vatory. In a paper contributed to the "American Journal of Science,"
Dr. Leonard Waldo, of the Winchester Observatory, Yale College,
U.S.A., remarks that after a critical examination of three Kew Standard
Thermometers, in which every degree was separately measured, entail
ing no less than 2,300 micrometer readings, he came to the conclusion
that their errors are practically insensible, and too small to be detected
with certainty.
   Professors Thorpe and Riicker also tested very minutely three similar
instruments made for them at Kew.         In a paper read at York before
the British Association, Professor Riicker stated, " In no case would
the calibration error in the determination of a difference of tempera
ture have amounted to 0-02= C. It may therefore be concluded that
Welsh's method, as applied at Kew to selected tubes, and with a
measuring instrument of great accuracy, is capable of giving first-rate
results.    The errors which remain when it has been applied are so
small that they may be neglected in all cases but those where the
thermometers are to be used under the most favourable conditions,
i.e., with the stem of the same temperature as the bulb, &c.          This
satisfactory conclusion is confirmed by the fact that Professor Rowland
has recently stated that the calibration of the Kew thermometer used
by him in his research on the mechanical equivalent of heat was
practically perfect." (British Association Report, 1881, p. 541.)

                    History of  the Kew Observatory.                  71
    1883. In this year the Committee decided to make a trial of a
system of watch-rating for the public, and granted 100Z. for the
preliminary expenses. In accordance with a scheme prepared by the
Superintendent, they fitted up in the Observatory a first-class burglar-
and fire-proof safe for the safe custody of the watches.    In the next
year's Report we learn that the arrangements for rating watches
mentioned in last year's Report had been completed and brought into
operation successfully, at a cost of 193Z.
   1884. A second safe having been purchased by the Committee, an
apparatus was fitted to it which enables the enclosed watches to be
maintained continuously at either high or low temperatures, whichever
may be required, and furthermore without being subjected to injury
by fumes of gas in the former case.
   The following was the constitution of the Kew Committee at the
close of the year 1881: —
                 Mr. W.   de la Rue, Chairman.
                 Captain W. de W. Abney, R.E.

   The following may be considered as a summarised statement of the
scientific work done at the Kew Observatory since its foundation as a
Physical Observatory : —
     1. Improvements in the construction and manufacture of instru
           ments for meteorological observations, the production of new
            ones, and the modification      of older forms.
     2.   The same with regard to magnetic and electrical instruments.
     3. The distribution of such instruments over the globe.
     4 The ensuring of accuracy of observations by means of the
           verification and distribution of standard instruments and the
            instruction of observers.
     5. The continuous recording of magnetical and meteorological
            phenomena.
     6.   The practical adaptation of photography to scientific purposes,
           and especially to the continuous registration of phenomena
           occurring on the sun's surface.
     7.  The improvements of nautical, geographical, fiscal, physical,
           and medical instruments by verification, and of horological
           by watch-rating.

" On the Microscopic Characters of             some Specimens        of Devitri
     fied Glass, with Notes on certain analogous Structures in
     Rocks." By Douglas Herman and Frank Rutley. Com
     municated         by Professor T. G-. Bonney, D.Sc, F.R.S.
     Received May 28, 1885. Read June 18.
                                    (Plates 1—4.)
    Devitrification     is a process which may either take place naturally
or be brought about by artificial means.          Instances of the former are
familiar to us in once glassy rocks which have passed into a felsitic
or micro-crystalline-granular condition.         The change which has taken
place in the conversion of obsidian into felstone is so great that it
would not be possible to infer the original nature of the rock, were it
not that certain structural peculiarities, often of a very delicate cha
racter, are retained.       It is, indeed, a most remarkable feature in such
rocks that physical change so complete should fail to obliterate the
              a
perlitic structure and the fine streaky markings or fluxion-bands
which are common in the vitreous lavas of every age. The microscopic
recognition of such structures has of late years added considerably to
our knowledge of the rhyolitic rocks and tuffs of Archaean and
Palaeozoic times, many of which were undoubtedly hyaline rhyolites.
Through devitrification their original character has been obscured,
and in many instances can only be revealed by the use of the
microscope.      Although much has been written upon this subject,
including Vogelsang's admirable work,* we are still in compara
tive ignorance of the conditions under which such devitrification
has taken place.          The experiments of Daubree,f made upon glass
tubes at a high temperature and pressure, in presence of water,
resulted in the development of a schistose or foliated structnre,
corresponding with the cylindrical form of the tubes acted upon :
the development in some cases of reticulating cracks, due to contrac
tion, the transformation of the glass into a friable substance with a
structure both fibrous and concentric, and also into a hard material
with similar structure.          Professor Danbree has likewise in these
experiments produced radiating crystalline or spherulitic bodies,
mieroliths, and actual crystals of pyroxene and quartz.                The glass
upon which he operated contained, in its unaltered condition —

   The observations recorded in the present paper refer to structures
developed in specimens of glass which, for the most part, were pre
pared, and all devitrified, at the Glass Works of Messrs. Pilkington
Bros., St. Helens, and it is possible that they may have a special
interest for those who are studying the natural devitrification of
obsidians or other glassy or glass-bearing rocks, since in the cases here
resorded the precise conditions of devitrification are known, while in
the natural process we do not know the precise conditions.      We may,
however, assume- with considerable safety, that within certain limits
there will be a more or less close analogy between the results of the
natural and artificial devitrification, allowing of course a margin for
certain natural conditions which it would be difficult if not impossible
to reproduce experimentally.      Thinking that some definite laws might
be arrived at by devitrifying solids of various forms, we have operated
upon cubes, hexagonal prisms, trigonal prisms, spheres, cylinders,
flat plates, and other distinct forms, and these we shall first describe.
The difficulties attendant upon the microscopic examination of such
materials consist principally in their excessive opacity in some
cases, and in others upon the readiness with which the substances
disintegrate during the process of grinding.         The latter difficulty
has in many instances been successfully overcome by Mr. Cuttell,
by whom most of the sections have been carefully and admirably
cut, so that the boundaries of the solids are preserved without
injury.
   Specimen No. 115 originally formed part of a 1-inch-thick piece of
plate-glass, which was accidentally colonred green, during fusion, by

              Microscopic Characters      of Devitrified Glass.         89
a  small quantity of ferruginous material.     The plate, measuring about
t' feet by 3 feet 8 inches, was devitrified in the following manner.     A
layer of sea sand, previously washed, sifted, and dried, was spread to
a depth of 2| inches on the floor of a kiln used for annealing glass
house pots.     On this sand the plate was carefully bedded and covered
with more sand to a depth of C inches, the whole being kept together
by a low brick wall. The object of bedding in sand was to prevent
the bending and fusion of the plate when the kiln attained its highest
temperature.      The kiln was then lighted, and the heat slowly raised.
In six days it had attained a dull red, and in six days more was at its
full heat, a very bright red, sufficient to soften, but not enough to
melt, the glass through its covering of sand.        This temperature was
maintained for twelve days, when the kiln was let out, and quickly
cooled by opening the door.        The mass of sand, however, retained its
heat   for a considerable    time after  it was possible to enter the kiln,
for, on removing the dwarf retaining wall four days after the door
was opened, the plate broke in consequence of cold air coming in
contact with one of the edges, whilst the other parts were at a com
paratively high temperature. The glass was thus in the kiln altogether
for twenty-eight days, during six of which it was gradually heated to
dull redness, during six more the temperature was increased to bright
red, maintained at this for twelve days, and cooled during four.         It
was found to be thoroughly devitrified, and large piecos were ground
with sand and water to a fine smooth surface on both sides, by which
the thickness was reduced to seven-eighths of an inch. The portion
 selected for microscopical examination was broken off a corner of one
of the large pieces.      It is opaque, dull, and porcellanous externally
on the ground surfaces, in places which have not been ground the
 surface is rougher, and has a glazed appearance. The parallel faces
 are of a pale green colour with a reticulation of white lines, enclosing
 areas which range from about T¦? to £ inch in diameter, mostly poly
 gonal in form.     The specimen was of irregular triangular shape, and
 the sides and edges formed by cracks, probably produced at an early
 period of the heating process, are of a uniform greenish-white or pale
 greenish-grey tint. The hardness appears to be slightly greater than
 that of the same glass before devitrification, upon which it produces
 feeble scratches.    A cross fracture, revealing the devitrified interior,
 shows very    delicate, slightly undulating bands, which agree in direc
 tion with the parallel faces of the plate, and the alternate bands, when
 viewed in this direction, exhibit a silky lustro like that of chrysotile,
 satin-spar, and other fibrous substances, only rather feebly.           At
 the marginal extremities        of this fractured surface similar bands
 are seen running in a direction at right angles to the others,
 and these transverse bands occupy two triangular areas, as shown
 in fig. 1.

   In order to ascertain more precisely the nature                of this structure,
three sections were cut : —
   A, at right angles to the parallel faces of the plate.
   B, parallel to   one   of the parallel faces of the plate, and including
         between the planes of section little more than the greenish
         superficial layer with the white reticulations.*
    C, parallel to one of the short sides, passing through one of the tri
         angular areas near one of the angles, so that the section
         includes both sets of bands, cutting one set transversely and
         lying parallel to the other. These sections exhibit the general
         structure admirably when held obliquely in different directions
         between the eye and the light.
    The following is a description of their microscopic characters : —
    Specimen No. 115, Section A.             When viewed by ordinary trans
mitted light under a low power, the banding already described is
indicated by transparent or very translucent belts, alternating with
bands of very feeble translucency.             Both kinds of belts are traversed
by fine lines, indicating a fibrous crystalline structure, which com
monly shows a radiate arrangement, the divergent groups of fibres
emanating from centres situated on or about the margin or edges of
the section.!      Each radiating group has what may be termed its own
allotment, bounded by well-defined straight lines.                 The boundary of
one side of an allotment sometimes consists of a single straight line,
at others of two or more straight lines, meeting in very obtuse angles.
The boundary lines are not curved.                   When the section is rotated
between crossed Nicols, these allotments form a well-marked and im
portant feature.       The divisional lines in this section may be separated
into two groups.          The first group consists of five lines, viz., a
median line, running parallel to the two parallel faces of the plate-
glass, and four lines which form a bifurcation at either end of this
median line, and enclose the terminal triangular areas. The second
group of lines consists of those boundaries of the crystalline allot-

                                             TV of an inch having since been ground off.
   +  It must, however, be noted that the margin of the section lies about T'7 of an
inch from the original surface, the T'T of an inch hav ng been removed by grinding.

 ments which run approximately at right angles to the surfaces which
constitute the boundaries of the devitrified specimen.         In polarised
light the general aspect of the section is peculiar, and strikingly
resembles a patchwork rug made of the skins of tabby cats. Further
on we shall endeavour to account for this brindled appearance, which
is represented in fig. 1, Plate I, as seen between crossed Nicols. The
vertical edge of the section seen on the right of the field is the trace
of one of the parallel faces of the devitrified plate-glass.            The
N. W. portion represents part       • of one of the terminal triangular
areas, while the remainder shows some of the other crystalline allot
ments.
    Specimen No. 115, Section B. This is a particularly interesting
section.    It is in fact one of the green surfaces of the devitrified
plate-glass, i.e., present surface, T\ inch of glass having been ground
away, and we can easily trace in it the polygonal structure already
alluded to. Between crossed Nicols the polygonal areas are sharply
defined and are irregularly clouded with crystalline aggregates, which
appear dark.        On rotating the section through 90° these dark
 aggregates become light, while the previously light portions become
dark ; we are, in fact, looking on the ends of bundles of crystalline
rods.     These  polygonal areas are the cross sections of fasiculi of
divergent crystals, and the boundaries of these polygons are shrink
age cracks, giving rise to a columnar structure, while the columns,
like those of basaltic lavas, have their longest axes normal to the
cooling surface.     Fig. 2, Plate 1, shows the general appearance of this
section, magnified eighteen linear, between crossed Nicols. As it seemed
possible that greater amplification might afford more information
 concerning the nature of the little crystals which constitute these
 bundles, a ^-inch objective was used, with the result shown in fig. 3,
 Plate 1. Only dark hazily-defined spots could be discerned between
crossed Nicols, which became light on revolution of the section, while
previously light portions became dark. The section has, in fact, the
appearance of what is known as crypto-crystalline structure, and
resembles, to a certain extent, some of the felstones, which, from other
evidence, are known to have been once vitreous lavas. An examina
 tion of this section proves then that the polygons are the cross
sections of the crystalline allotments of Section A, and that those
allotments are longitudinal sections of polygonal, often pentagonal,
 prisms. Whether or not the polygonal jointing is connected with the
 crystalline developments, which it sheaths and separates, is a matter
open to discussion.      The Section B, when held between the eye and
candle flame, presents the illusive appearance of being studded with
 concavities or convexities, from which it, we think, may be inferred
 that the radiate arrangement of the crystalline fasiculi originates at
 or about the centre of each polygonal area on the original surface of

the thick plate-glass.* If so it is possible that the strain consequent
on crystallisation may have produced the prismatic fission.                    Fig. 1,
Plate 3, might then be taken to represent portion of the surface of
the slab at the commencement of devitrification, the dots indicating
primary centres of crystallisation, while fig. 2 on the same plate
would represent the development of prismatic structure by the forma
tion of cracks between and around these centres of crystallisation.
Fig. 3, Plate 3, shows one side (the lower one) of the block, fig. 2 the
arrow denoting the direction in which the crystallisation advances.
Apart from any hypothesis concerning the possible relation of the
prismatic structure to the crystallisation, which may or may not be
true, since it is possible that the prismatic structure was developed
first, it is evident from the inspection of such a diagram that we may
have a section giving prisms of very different widths, the width in
section not necessarily representing the actual width of the prism,
while in such a case the centre and general axis of the crystalline
bundle may appear to be thrown on one side of the prism.
    Specimen 115, Section C.          This section truncates one of the ter
minal triangular wedges, of which mention has already been made, so
that here we know for a certainty that we are looking on the cross
section of the crystalline fasciculi belonging to the triangular area,
and here we meet with precisely the same phenomena as those
described and figured for Section B. On either hand the adjacent
crystalline bundles emanating from the upper and under surfaces of
the thick plate are seen lying in the plane of section, i.e., we are
looking at longitudinal sections of those bundles.                     In these we
again    see the  cat-like  brindlings.       On   the  broken  and   partly ground
away edges of this part of the section, a power over 500 linear shows
that the crystalline bundles are made up of small fibres or microliths,
closely packed side by side.         The section is in all parts traversed by
long, fusiform, or acicular brownish microliths, which lie with their
longest axes in various directions, but usually across the general
directions of crystallisation.
    The brindled appearance in the crystalline bundles of these sections
suggests at first sight the idea of pauses in the crystallisation, but
when we find that by ordinary illumination the light is very faintly
transmitted along these lines, some further explanation seems need
ful, and it seems probable that in these diverging crystallisations there
is a kind of cone-in-cone or divergent composite structure, such as in
that met with in the kidney-ore variety of hematite, or in clay-iron
stone, the apices of the cones giving rise to a turbidity and being
ranged so as to form successive arcs of approximately concentric
 circles, as indicated in fig. 6, Plate 3. From the evidence afforded by

the sections now described, it seems certain that devitrification has in
this instance commenced at the surface, and has proceeded inwards
in directions at right angles to the different surfaces.                 Owing to its
uniform rate of progression, the different sets of crystalline fasciculi
have met along lines which divide the devitrified mass in a remark
ably symmetrical manner, as shown in fig. 5, Plate 3, which represents
one corner of the slab. That unequal rate of progression would cause
h deviation from this symmetry is shown diagrammatically in fig. 4,
Plate 3, and actually in the deflection of the diagonal line in fig. 1,
Plate 1, Section A.*
    Specimen G is a plate of flashed glass, about 2^ mm. in thickness,
which has been completely devitrified under conditions similar to
those described for Specimen 115, that is to say, it was imbedded in
silver sand (previously washed and dried), placed in a kiln, and the
temperature gradually increased during a period of eleven days up
to a bright red. This heat was maintained pretty steadily for eleven
days more, after which the kiln was quickly cooled, and the glass
withdrawn.        The flashed surface is of a deep blue colour, and is
incrusted with grains of sand. The opposite face is mottled with
small dull green and greenish- white spots, and has a surface like
coarse glazed pottery.           Flashed glass was chosen in this case, as it
was thought possible that some of the pigment might be carried
inwards by the crystallisation. This, however, does not seem to have
taken place to any great extent, for on examining a thin section taken at
right angles to the broad surface of the plate under a power of 250 linear,
the blue layer is seen to have remained on the surface, although
its bonndary is ill defined, and the bluish tint extends for only a very
little distance inwards, gradually fading away. On the outer surface
of the coloured layer there has, however, been a considerable dis
turbance of the blue glass, which appears to have been fused, and to
have run between the sand grains against which it was bedded,
ff, Plate 2, fig. 2, fbrming a cement of blue crystalline sheaves. The
crystalline structure of the blue layer is throughout very irregular,
consisting of similar sheaf-like aggregates and interlacing crystals.
 Passing from this layer we find the contiguous glass converted into
radiating crystalline groups, separated by sharply defined joint planes,
   * Supplementary Note. — Specimen 115. Thermal conductivity appears to be
uniform on the large parallel faces of the plate, both at the margin and at a distance
from the margin. The isothermal curves are also circles on the sides of the plate at
right angles to the large faces. On a transverse section of the plate which traverses
the crystalline fasciculi in directions both longitudinal and transverse, as in Section C,
the wax also melts in circles both on the area of the longitudinal and on that of the
transverse sections.   This accords with the statement of M. Ed. Jannettaz (" Propa-
gition      la Chaleur,"   " Bull. Soc. GeoL de France," 3C Serie, t. ix,

y. Plate 2, fig. 2, which traverse the plate normal to the large parallel
surfaces.   These joints are evidently the boundaries of polygonal
prisms, and it is the ends of these prisms which cause the green and
white spotted appearance on one surface of the specimen, while the
reason that no such marking is visible on the other surface is partly
due to the screen of sand grains which covers       it, while beneath there
would be no such markings until we reached the layer of originally
white glass, because the joints do not nppear to traverse the irregu
larly crystalline blue layer.      Divergent crystallisations, also bounded
by prismatic joints, start from the green spotted surface of the plate,
and the two sets of divergent crystallisations meet in an undulating
line, 11., Plate    2,
                     fig. 2, which approximately divides the plate into
two plates of about equal thickness.        The joint planes on the opposite
sides of this line do not coincide, and the halves of the plate     if  sepa
rated along the surface, of which this undulating line         is  the trace,
would doubtless present a mammillated appearance. The general
structure reminds one of that of part of a much flattened chalcedonic
geode. It will be seen that in this specimen the devitrification has
taken place on precisely the same principle as in the thick plate pre
viously described.      There has been a prismatic structure developed
normal to the bounding surfaces, divergent crystallisation occurs
within the prisms, and these crystalline fasciculi advanced in opposite
directions until they arrested one another, but the line of arrest in
this case  is  sinuous, while in the preceding specimen the lines of
arrest are straight.      On examining the section under a power of
50 diameters, fine lines, like small scratches, are seen to cut across
the divergent crystallisation. Under much higher powers they appear
as rod-like microliths, and they lie with their longest axes in all
directions, but mostly transverse to the divergent fibres.
   Specimen I   is part of a completely devitrified square prism of plate-
glass.    The  devitrification  of this specimen was brought about by two
separate operations.       The whole of the prism, about       4    inches in
length, was bedded in silver sand and heated during four days to a
temperature gradually increasing from that of the atmosphere up to a
red heat, maintained at that for two days more, and then quickly
cooled.    When cold     it was broken in two and found to be regularly
devitrified to depth of about
                a                   1^   mm., the interior being unaltered.
One of the halves was then burnt again, this time for the same period
and under exactly the same conditions as Specimen G, i.e., bedded in
sand, brought gradually to a bright red, maintained steadily at that
heat for eleven days, and then quickly cooled. The faces are of a pale
greenish-yellow,    have  a  glassed appearance like that of pottery, and
are traversed by    a  network   of very fine cracks.   When the specimen
is held before a strong light these surfaces present a spotted appear
ance, similar to that seen on the plane surface of other devitrified

              Microscopic Characters    of Devitrified Glass.           95
solids.   Under the microscope it is seen that the crystallisation has
advanced as usual from the surfaces inwards.        After passing through
a distance of about   \\  mm. from   the  surface there  has been a pause,
marked by a fairly well-defined line, indicating the extent of the
devitrification produced by the first heating to a red heat. This line
is not straight, but has a series of slight convexities directed inwards,
each convexity being bounded by joint planes normal to the surface.
The prism therefore had first of all a devitrified envelope, the inner
surface of which was mammillated, and each maramillation was the
termination of a small prism.       As the crystallisation advanced from
the inner surface of this envelope, a fresh series of less numerous
joints was developed, giving rise to a coarser prismatic structure, and
between these joints we see in section a beautiful divergent crystal
lisation, each divergent group originating on the inner surface of
the first crystalline envelope, a single prism sometimes containing only
one such group, at others several.         The general direction of these
prisms is normal to the surfaces of the devitrified specimen, and the,
lines of arrest would join the opposite angles of the square section,
were it not that in this particular slice an irregular pentagonal area
occurs, against four of whose angles the lines of arrest abut.        This
irregular pentagon is a transverse section of another set of divergent
crystallisations, whose longest axes would diverge from the axis of
vision, and they evidently emanated from one of the basal planes of
 the large devitrified square prism, or from a transverse fracture as the
 prism was broken across after the first heating.       Had the specimen
 been a cube, a section taken parallel to two of its faces and passing
 accurately through the centre of the cube, would merely have shown
 two continuous lines of arrest joining opposite angles and intersecting
 in the centre of the square section, assuming, of course, that the
crystallisation advanced equally from all six faces. Such a structure
 would divide the cube into six equal four-sided pyramids, as indicated
 in the diagram, Plate 3, fig. 7. In the specimen before us the crystal,
 lisation has advanced rather irregularly, and the lines of arrest are
 consequently not continuous straight lines, but continuous series of
 straight lines, a repetition, in fact, of the conditions indicated in the
 diagram, fig. 4, Plate 3.
    Specimen H is portion of a similar square prism of plate-glass,
 heated gradually for six days to a red heat under exactly the same
 conditions as the first operation on Specimen I. It differs from the
 preceding specimen in having been devitrified for only a slight
 distance from the surface.     A section of the crust through one of the
 angles presents an appearance precisely similar in character to that of
 the crust of Section Ej (a six-sided prism), figured on Plate 2. These
 are groups of divergent crystals which pass from the surface inwards,
 and are separated by prismatic jointing.       The inner surfaces of each

crystalline group is convex, the convoxity being directed towards the
interior of the solid. When magnified between 500 and 600 diameters
these convex surfaces are seen to be fringed by the projecting termi
nations of the divergent crystalline fibres.
    Specimen K. This is part of a completely devitrified trigonal
prism of plate-glass, devitrified by two operations, under precisely the
same conditions as Specimen I, and the section has been taken parallel
to the basal plane. The general principle of devitrification elucidated
by the examination of the preceding specimens may also be clearly
recognised in this case, hut the crystallisation, after the first envelope
was formed, advanced in a somewhat irregular manner, which needs
interpretation. The irregularity in the crystal! isation of this specimen
may be attributed to the fact that there is a flaw in it. The general
 structure is shown in Plate 3, fig. 8. Here we notice first of all the
 envelope or devitrified crust, due to the first heating operation, in
 which there is prismatic structure and a series of divergent crystal
 lisations trending inwards. Next comes a similar but coarser series
of prisms also normal, or approximately normal, to the sides of the
 trigonal prism, and in these the divergent crystallisation has also
 travelled from without inwards.        So far there is no deviation from
 the general principles of devitrification which we met with in the pre
 ceding specimens, in fact the crystallisation has proceeded inwards as
 usual, in directions approximately normal to the limiting planes of
 the devitrified   solid.  We now meet, however, with an apparent
 exception to the general rule, for the three sets of crystalline fasciculi,
 instead of continuing their course until they arrest one another in
 three straight lines joining the angles and the centre of the triangular
 section, are suddenly arrested and enclose an area rudely shaped like
 a three-rayed star, this being subdivided into three irregular portions.
 The deltoidal areas are traversed by cracks, and from points along
 these lines we have groups of crystals diverging on both sides of the
 lines.   They have consequently travelled from within outwards.
    The different areas of devitrification are by no means symmetrically
 disposed.    Diagram, fig. 8, Plate 3, shows, with approximate truth,
 how the parts of the actual section really occur.      It will be seen on
reference to this figure, that at the point a there is a -crack which
 extends in a curve towards b. From a point on the curved line ab,
 about opposite to the middle of the edge in which the crack a occurs,
 another nearly straight crack passes to c, and from the inner surface
of the devitrified crust a third crack extends in a curve from the little
fissure a to the point d. The crystallisations diverge on both sides of
these three cracks.      They are bounded by prismatic joints, which are
continuous across the cracks, and each pair of crystalline fasciculi
 diverges from a common centre situate on the crack and between a
 pair of prismatic joints. These three distinct areas of crystallisation

              Microscopic Characters      of Denitrified Glass.            97
are very irregular in form, and this has already been attributed to
the presence of the flaws emanating directly and indirectly from the
fissure.   There appeared to be no reason why in such a solid the
devitrification should not proceed steadily inwards until the three sets
of prisms arrested one another along three lines passing from the
three angles of the triangular section, and meeting in its centre.
   With a view to settling this point another trigonal prism (Specimen
No. 143), free from any flaws, was devitrified.        A transverse fracture
through   this  devitrified prism  shows   three  distinct and similar areas
of crystallisation ; each is an isosceles triangle. These triangular areas
are bounded by the three sides of the prism and by three straight lines
of arrest, which accurately join the centre or axis of the prism with
its three angles or edges, fig. 9, Plate 3. This demonstrates conclu
sively that the irregular devitrification seen in Section K is due to
simultaneous crystallisation along flaws.
    Specimen D heated twice under same conditions as Specimens          I and
K, is part of a completely devitrified six-sided prism of plate-glass.
The surface has a glaze like that of pottery. The transverse section
of the prism is not a perfect hexagon, and it has not been cut quite
at right angles to the principal axis. There is a well-marked crust of
•divergent crystalline fasciculi due to the first short heating, prismatic
joints being also present, but they are not well defined. Devitrifica
tion has then proceeded inwards in directions approximately normal
to the lateral faces of the prism in broad divergent crystalline groups,
separated by joint planes, which preserve at the best a very imperfect
parallelism. In fact the prismatic structure which they indicate seems
very irregular, and in the section a prism is often represented by a
lanceolate or an irregularly shaped area, while the divergent crystal
lisations do not all seem to be formed in directions parallel to the
plane of section.       These crystallisations show brindled markings,
similar to those seen in Specimen No. 115. There is strong chromatic
depolarisation in this, as also in the preceding Sections      I and K.
    Specimen E is part of a six-sided prism of plate-glass, 2 cm. in
diameter, which has been devitrified to a depth of barely 1£ mm.
 under precisely the same conditions as Specimen H. The devitrified
crust is yellowish-white, and has a glazed surface like that of pottery.
 Two sections have been cut from this specimen, E being taken
 transversely to the principal axis, and E2 parallel to it and to one of
 the faces of the prism. The latter section consists, in fact, only of
 the devitrified crust of one of the faces of the prism.
    Section E, taken transversely to the principal axis of the six-sided
prism, shows a devitrified crust, which by reflected light looks white,
while by transmitted light it appears under the microscope of a brown
or yellowish-brown tint.        It consists of divergent groups of very
delicate acicular crystals, but even under high powers their termina-

tions,    -where   they shoot into the unaltered glass, cannot be clearly
made out.        In most cases their terminations appear to be rounded,
 while in others they have a rectangular aspect, suggestive of a basal
 plane or an edge normal to the principal axis.              The groups are not
 separated by prismatic joint planes, but the divergent crystals of
adjacent groups appear to slightly overlap.           The directions of extinc
 tion indicate that they are possibly rhombic forms.              When magnified
about    570  diameters   the individual   crystals  seem    frequently to consist
of linear aggregates of minute globulites, but this appearance is
 possibly deceptive, and in some cases the crystals exhibit no such
structure. The terminations of the crystals pass rather irregularly
into the adjacent glass, giving the edges of the crystalline groups a
fringed aspect somewhat like the pile of velvet.                The adjacent glass
shows colourless spheroidal specks or globulites.
    Section E2 is taken parallel to one of the faces of the six-sided
prism, and is, indeed, a shaving of the devitrified crust. Mr. Cuttell
succeeded in making a section the full size of the face, and from this
the drawing, fig. 1, Plate 2, was made.           In this drawing a basal and
lateral edge are shown, and it will be seen that from these edges
divergent groups of crystals pass inwards. With the exception of
this fringe, which represents more or less oblique sections of the
  crystalline groups which constitute the devitrified crust, the re
mainder of the face shows only a polygonal network, the polygons
 being the cross sections of prisms.       It has, in fact, the same structur-
as the margin, only the crystalline groups are in this part cut trans
versely to the direction of their growth, while at the margin they are
cut obliquely, for the section being taken a little distance inwards
from the surface of the face trenches slightly upon the crystalline
groups of the adjacent faces, both lateral and basal.                The section as
originally cut was so feebly translucent that an endeavour was made
to reduce its thickness.        This, however, resulted in its almost total
disintegration along irregular cracks without materially increasing
its translucency.
    Specimen F. This is a completely              devitrified sphere of light-
coloured bottle-glass      18 mm.  in diameter,    devitrified in two operations
under the same conditions as Specimens I, K, and D.                      Under the
microscope     a  section taken  through    the  centre    of  the  sphere shows a
somewhat irregular circumference, which is accounted for when th-
surface of the original specimen is carefully examined, for it is seen
to be pitted with numerous small cavities, and to have a rough fritted
and imperfectly glazed aspect. The irregularities of this surface ar-
 due to the impressions of sand-grains, a few of which may still be
detected adhering to the surface.         The glass has evidently undergon-
incipient    fusion,  and the  crystallisation in the immediate neighbour
hood of the sand-grains is very small and confused.                This irregularly

  crystalline margin is bounded internally by   a sinuous   crack, showing
  the extent of the devitrification produced by the first heating to which
  the specimen was subjected, while other irregular cracks traverse this
 portion circumferentially as a rule, but they sometimes pass through
  the margin radially.      The latter are few, penetrate but a short
  distance, and are mostly fringed by delicate crystalline fibres normal
  to the crack, and usually terminate in a radial group of fine acicular
 crystals or fibres. In one or two spots the cracks are seen to follow
  the contours of small cavities, from which sand-grains have been
 stripped in the process of grinding the section. Inside the wavy
 circumferential crack the crystallisations have shot inwards in long
 divergent groups, which towards the middle portion of the sphere
 give place to large irregular radiating groups of crystals, so large,
 in fact, that there does not appear to be more than half-a-dozen of
 them in the section, and these are in most instances cut through in a
 plane remote from their centres, thus giving oblique and transverse
 slices through the crystalline rods.    Had these groups been able to
 crystallise freely they would have resulted in spherules, and this,
 indeed, might have been the case had the devitrification of the
 sphere been incomplete ; as it is, they seem to have rudely polygonal
 boundaries.    The devitrification of this specimen seems in part to be
 of a micro-crystalline-granular character under a magnifying power of
 18 linear, but under a power giving an amplification of 570 diameters
this is seen not to be the case, the mass being resolved into a closely
 matted aggregate of little acicular crystals with a general tendency
to radiate grouping, as shown in fig. 4, Plate 1. In fig. 5 on the
 same plate the general aspect of a portion of the sphere at and near
the margin is shown.      The circular hole near the margin is where a
sand-grain, around which the glass has fused, has been stripped out
in grinding.

composing the glass was not quite complete.        This specimen exhibits
a curious and very rough concentric scaly or platy structure. It is
of a pale greenish-white tint, and the broken surfaces are covered
with small glistening hair-like crystals.     It feels rough to the touch

hot.    The glass was in the stiff, pasty condition suitable for rolling
when introduced into the kiln, and was kept at a bright red by flame
playing almost directly upon it for about half an hour, during which,
and possibly during a short period of subsequent cooling, the devitri
fication was effected.       The devitrification of this specimen is quite
incipient, and affects merely the two parallel surfaces, one of which
is uneven and scratched owing to contact when in a soft condition
with the rough bed of the kiln. This latter surface is extremely
interesting, as it shows a reticulating series of irregular cracks,
traversed in places by straight belts of spherules which are apparently
in no way connected with the cracks, and begin and end abruptly in
a seemingly capricious manner, fig. 4, Plate 2.*                 The cracks are
similar to those produced in glass by heating it and plunging it in
water.       Other isolated and larger spherules are also to be seen upon
both surfaces of this specimen.          Fig. 3, Plate 2, shows one of these
surfaces   —  the  upper,   as  seen  by ordinary transmitted          light, and
magnified 32 linear.       The shaded spots represent incipient spherules
which fail to show any depolarisation ; the darker spots are decided
spherules with strong depolarising power.             The unshaded portion of
the section also transmits light between crossed Nicols, and is therefore
in a state of strain.      Under a magnifying power of 1150 diameters
the incipient spherules can merely be resolved into brownish granular
patches, sometimes approximately round, not uncommonly dumbbell-
shaped, or like two coalescing spheres, but usually they are of irregular
form, and their general aspect is nebulous.
    Specimen L. A piece of pale greenish sheet-glass transferred, when
in the semi-fluid state suitable for working, to a small pot in which it
was maintained during four or five hours at a temperature barely
                                           " gathered."      It is traversed by
sufficient to permit of its being
rudely parallel, irregular, flocculent. milky bands. Under a power of
about 250 diameters numbers of minute crystallites are visible ; they
show no double refraction.           Some are stellate, others fusiform or
acicular. The latter are often wholly or partially surrounded by fine
dusty segregations, which frequently seem to be diminutive divergent
spicules.      The most common forms have the aspect of monoclinic or

  triclinic   crystals. Their angles vary considerably ; one gave 150°,
  another    116D,  but these measurements are of little value, as it is
  doubtful whether the individuals measured were lying parallel with
  the planes of section.        Some of these forms are shown in fig. 6,
 Plate 2,    not represented   as  they are actually grouped in the prepara
 tion, but selected from various spots.        They closely resemble some of
 the crystallites met with in the slags of blast furnaces.        They occur
  in the white turbid bands in the glass, the transparent portion being
  almost free from them.
     Specimen M is a piece of clear sheet-glass, about 2-5 mm. thick,
 from a pot containing somewhat less lime than usual. Owing to the
 furnace being rather cold during the time the glass from this pot
 was being worked, devitrification in the form technically known as
 " ambitty " set in, and increased to such an extent that blowing was
 stopped and the pot emptied by ladling.            The specimen was blown
 shortly before the ladling operation was commenced ; it contains a
 few very beautiful crystallites similar to those figured in Plate 8 of
 Vogelsang's
                  " Krystalliten."     One of them, which closely resembles
 one of the usual forms of snow-crystals, being a skeleton hexagon or
 six-rayed star, gives angles of 60° between the component crystalline
 needles.      These exhibit double refraction, and undergo extinction in
 directions parallel to and at right angles to their longest axis. Between
 crossed Nicols depolarisation from strain is visible in the adjacent glass,
 the minute brushes of light being more intense about the points of
the principal needles. It would appear from the depolarisation and
 directions of extinction that this crystallite may be referred to the
rhombic system, twinned somewhat after the manner of chrysoberyl.
This seems the more probable, since some of the forms in Section L
also resemble certain rhombic forms.           The crystallite just described
is seen when examined under a power of about 280 linear to be
traversed by an irregular network of strong cracks lying in the same
plane as the crystallite, and extending nearly to but never beyond its
margin. In the centre of the crystallite is a dark spherule.              The
fact that the reticulating cracks are restricted to the area occupied by
the crystallite indicates a relation to the latter, and the depolarisation
of the adjacent glass indicates strain. Since this strain-depolarisation
only occurs at the margin of the crystallite, we may infer that the
strain is connected with its development, and the cracks are no doubt
the result of this strain.      Had the body been a completely developed
crystal     and   not  a skeleton    form, the strain would probably have
resulted in the development of a perlitic crack, and not in a reti
culating series of cracks which possibly arise from strain about a
number of points.        Another crystallite in the same piece of glass is
very different in appearance to that last described ; its general out
line is that of an irregular hexagon.          It is traversed by four well

marked crystalline rods, apparently composed of piles of octahedra
like those of alum, and where they touch the margin of the crystal
they usually pass beyond       it,   forming little spicular crystallisations
like fir-trees or like the crystals formed in cast iron. They throw out
branches at right angles to the main spicule.          The crystallite  is also
traversed by other crystalline rods of           like character, but at right
                                                 a
angles to the first set, and these also pass out in little fir-tree-like
crystallisations.     There are also small rods which run in two direc
tions obliquely to the former, and which intersect in an angle of
about 87°.      The form therefore   is  not cubic, as might at first sight be
thought.      The larger spiculee also show double refraction.        There  is
some depolarisation in the glass around this crystallite due         to strain,
but no cracks are developed.         The spiculro extinguish parallel to and
at right angles to their longest axes.        At least they appear to do so,
but   it   difficult to tell, and the colour difference

                                Generalisations.
    From the microscopic         examination      of the specimens already
described,* it seems evident that the devitrification of solids of
the nature described in this paper takes place in a definite and
apparently uniform manner, to which Specimen No. 105 is no excep
tion, for the incipient spherules and the well-developed spherules are
 but rudimentary phases of the divergent groups which we generally
 meet with, and which have been already described.             In Specimen 105
 they are essentially superficial, and we can imagine them as hemi
spheres, as represented in fig. 3, ready, as devitrification advances, to be
continued inwards, in which case we cease to recognise their spherulitic
                                       Fig.  3.
character. In solids free from flaws the devitrification appears then,
as a rnle, to consist in the development of divergent groups of
crystals, the divergence being usually limited by a network of minute
joints, which give rise to small polygonal prisms.           These crystals and
joints extend inwards from the different faces of the solid, and may
or may not ultimately meet. The crystalline groups in their respec
tive prisms are banded by arcs of circles, which we may assume are
related, but perhaps obscurely, to the initial pseudo-spherulitic struc
ture of the superficial crust of the solid.         These arcs indicate succes
sive stages of growth. The crystallisations from the different faces
of the solid ultimately, in small masses, arrest one another, and
devitrification is then complete. In the case of the sphere, Speci
 men F, already described, the process has gone on in much the same
   *  With the exceptions of Specimens 78, L and M, in which devitrification was
produced during cooling from the fluid state, and Specimen 105, which was probablv
still somewhat soft when devitrification commenced, all the specimens described
were devitrified whilst in the solid state by more or less prolonged periods of
heating.

manner    for a slight distance from the surface, after which an irregular
crystallisation has been set up from independent centres; but it
should be remarked that difference in the chemical composition i-
known to influence the mode of procedure, as well as the character
of the devitrification.       The direction of the prismatic structure-
always seems to be approximately normal to the surfaces, and the
divergent sheaves of crystals advance from the surface inwards by
successive growths within the prisms.          It seems quite possible that
in the absence of such prismatic jointing the whole mass would
become spherulitic, or would consist of an irregular felted mass of
crystallites. The near resemblance which some of the specimens just
described bear to devitrified and partially devitrified obsidians shows
how close the structural relationship is, and that, allowing for difference
in the conditions under which the process takes place, the principle of
devitrification is the same.
   Specimen No. 122<2, a piece of ordinary sheet-glass, which wa-
bedded in white sand and heated during a period of only four days to
a temperature gradually increasing from that of the atmosphere up to
a blood-red — a temperature somewhat lower than that employed for
any of the specimens previously described, shows purely superficial
devitrification by the development of globulites and spherules or
spherulitoid crystallites, like fig. 11, Plate 3.       In this particular
crystallite, which is of a pale brown colour, no structure can be made
out. It seems merely to consist of an aggregate of globulites, but in
other cases bodies of precisely similar form show a decided radiating
crystalline structure, like that of the brown spherules, which occur
with them in the same specimen, the only difference between these
crystallites and the spherules consisting in the external form or limit
ing surface.      It is for this reason that we propose to call them
spherulitoid crystallites.     Fig. 10, Plate 3, drawn from the same piece
 of glass, shows part of the network of cracks by which the surface is
cut up, and the curious manner in which the globulites have segre
gated aiong these cracks, so as to leave the fairly well-defined circular
 and oval spaces in which the globulites are less densely packed.
 Spherules sometimes occur within these clearer areas, but the latter
 do not seem to have any necessary connexion with the development
of the spherules.
   In Specimen No. 1226, superficially devitrified under the same con
ditions as the preceding, a tendency to the formation of perlitic
structure is seen around some of the spherules.
    Specimen 126, a piece of rough plate-glass, ^ inch thick, bedded in
 white sand, contained in a small lire-clay pot, and placed in a kiln,
 the temperature of which was gradually raised during a period of
 8^ days, by which time a dull red heat, about 650° C, was attained.
 As it was known by comparative experiments with similar pieces of

               Microscopic Characters   of Devitrified Glass.           105
glass contained in other pots in the same kiln, that no appreciable
change had taken place in the glass up to this time, we propose to
reckon, in this and subsequent experiments, what may bo called the
active period of devitrification, from the first attainment of 650°,
neglecting altogether the time required to bring the specimen up to this
temperature, which necessarily varies in different cases, and is known
to be without appreciable effect on the glass. The pot containing Speci
men 126 was withdrawn from the kiln 29 hours after its first attaining
the temperature of 650°, by which time the heat had slightly increased.
The pot with its contents was allowed to cool during about four hours,
when the glass was removed from its covering of sand, which had
cooled down almost to the atmospheric temperature.          This specimen
shows devitrification only on the surfaces, the alteration being so
slight that writing can be clearly read through the glass when it i-
placed close over it, but when raised an inch above the writing the
latter appears blurred and illegible.       The devitrification, which is
quite incipient, consists in the segregation of vast numbers of minute
granules and globulites about various points on the surface of the
glass, and in very many cases small stellate crystallites lie in the midst
of these segregations.      They are colourless and translucent, but too
small to show any double refraction, even if they possess the property.
Under an amplification of 120 linear the specimen shows portions of
its surface which are still quite clear and unaltered.     The margins of
the unaltered areas show some fine nebulous segregations which
envelope no crystallites, but the majority contain the stellate forms
already alluded to.     Of these, the simplest form is a four-rayed star
or cross, the arms of the cross being apparently at right angles, but
most of these crystallites are many-rayed, as shown in fig. 13, Plate 3,
which was drawn with a magnifying power of 820 linear.           On the top
and left hand margin of this drawing portions of a crack are shown,
and on certain parts of the surface of this specimen the nebulous and
crystallite-bearing spots are separated by a network of irregular
cracks.
    Specimen 127, a piece of polished plate-glass,    J inch thick, treated
in the same pot as Specimen 126, and under exactly the same con
 ditions. This is another instance of incipient and purely superficial
 devitrification.   The general appearance is somewhat like that of
 No. 126, but in this case, although a few imperfectly developed
 spiculae are present, there are no distinct stellate crystallites, possibly
 because in glass of this kind, containing a considerable quantity of
 lime, stellate crystallites d« not occur so frequently as in the quality
 represented by Specimen 126, and the alteration of the glass consists
 merely of delicate nebnlous spots, which under a power of 820 linear
are seen to be composed wholly of globulites, and this is the most
 rudimentary phase of devitrification touched upon in this paper.

  The little nebulous patches are mostly circular in form, and these
  circular patches often coalesce. There are a few instances in which
  the globnlites occur within sharply defined circular or approximately
  circular boundaries, but for the most part the nebulous patches shade
  gradually away into the glass.                       One of these patches magnified
  820 diameters is shown in fig. 12, Plate 3.                              The structure fore
  shadowed in this and in Specimen                              126, may be regarded              as

      Specimen No. 147 is especially interesting on account of the per
  fect manner in which it demonstrates that devitrification takes place
  from the .surfaces of a crack, just as from any other surfaces.                               The
     * A very interesting        example of a like structure, but on u much larger scale, is
  seen in a specimen        of obsidian collected by Mr. John Arthur Phillips, at Hot
  Springs, near Little Lake, in California.           The obsidian is black and contains several
  grevish-white, or yellowish-white, spheroidal bodies (lithophyscn of Richthofen),
  which range up to an inch in diameter.             These, when examined carefully, are seen
  to consist of numbers of small sphenUes, about ^'j of an inch in diameter, but many
  of still smaller dimensions.        The minute spherulitic structure of these large spherules
  is best seen on weathered surfaces, but even on fractured surfaces the spherules may
  still be seen, though their spherical character is less clearly visible, owing to inter
  stitial matter, which becomes removed by weathering.                   In these larger spherules
  there is evidence, though obscure, of a radiating structure.                  The mimicry of the
» little spherules built of globulitos, in           Specimens     126 and 127, by these large
  spherules   built of  little   spherules,  in  the  obsidian,   is  very striking, but it is quite
  probable   in the  latter   case   that the   smaller  spherulitic    structure was set up in the
  large   spherule  after    its  formation,  the  vestiges  of  a  radiating  crystalline structure
  tending to confirm this view.

               Microscopic Characters       of Devitrified Glass.      107
  specimen is a slab of f-inch British plate, about 4 inches by 3 inches
  in diameter, and upon one of its surfaces a straight cut or scratch,
  about 2 inches long, was made by a diamond, producing an exceed
 ingly fine crack, extending at the edge of the plate to a depth of over
  \ inch in a direction approximately normal to the surface upon -which
 the scratch was made, and gradually dying out to the end of the
 diamond cut. The crack was sufficiently fine to show Newton's rings.
 The specimen was then completely devitrified by heating continuously
  for nine days at a bright red heat, a temperature considerably
  higher than was employed in the case of Specimen 126, 127, and
  it was subsequently cracked across in the direction of the line
  marked BB in fig. 1, Plate 4.            Fig. 2 represents the fractured
 surface.    At each end are the usual triangular areas, formed by lines
 of arrest, bnt the line of arrest which usually joins the apices of
 these triangular areas is here interrupted by another series of crystal
 lisations which have emanated from the crack produced by the
 diamond scratch.      In the half of the plate nearest to the scratched
 surface we have, indeed, a reproduction of what has taken place at
 the outer edges of the plate, the result being a nearly equilateral
 triangular area of crystallisation, bisected by the crack already men
 tioned.   This crack, however, passes a little beyond the median line
 of arrest, and from its termination the crystallisation radiates and
 -nds against a curved arrest line, as shown in fig. 2, Plate 4.
    That devitrification does not always proceed in the orderly and
 uniform manner seen in Specimens 115, 147, and, indeed, in nearly
 all of the examples already described in this paper, will be best
 realised by reference to the figures of Specimens Nos. 132 and 136 on
 Plate 4, figs. 4 and 5. Fig. 3 in the same plate, Specimen No. 137, is
 a small slab of glass partially devitrified. The crust has been formed in
 the usual way by crystallisation proceeding from the surface inwards,
 but the process has been arrested, and where the outer crnst is broken
away a core of somewhat cracked but perfectly clear glass is seen, in
which no spherules or other crystalline bodies are visible. In Speci
 mens 132 and 136, however, the result has been different, for after
a slight external crust has been formed, devitrification has also
started from numerous points within the glass, giving rise to a well-
marked spherulitic structure.
    Why these spherules have been formed instead of a gradually
increasing crust is a matter which we hope to explain in a subsequent
paper.

telescope.  If the sun were removed to a distance equal to that of th-
nearest star, its disk would subtend less than the one-hundredth of a
second of arc.   We have also to consider the small relative brightness
of the corona, the light from which has been estimated                                      at different
times to be from Torero to about the -joinsoo Par'; °f the                                  sun's     light.
It is, indeed, possible that stars which have a higher                                    temperature
than our sun, are surrounded by coronae of greater extent                                  and bright
ness.
   At the eclipse of 1882, some information was obtained of the sun's
condition in relation to that of the brighter stars. The photographs
of the more refrangible part of the spectra of stars, which                had the        I
honour to lay before this Society in 1879,* gave a clue by which the
stars could be arranged in a serial order, at the head of which stand
the bright stars Vega and Sirius.               ventured to suggest that the

differences in their spectra might be due primarily to temperature                                           ;
and even to make the further suggestion, that the hotter stars were
probably the younger stars, and that we had obtained possibly some
indications of the relative ages of the stiirs.       The position of the sun
came some distance down           in   the series, very near the position of

prominences at the base of the corona.              The thin condition of these'
lines, as well as the breadth of the lines of calcium at H and K, confirms
the position which     I had ventured to give to the sun relatively to some
of the brighter stars, namely as belonging to the least fervid of the
white stars, and just above those which begin to show a yellow light.
    There are indeed some stare in the spectra of which the line D3
which is seen in the prominences, and in the lower parts of the corona
of the sun, appears as a bright line, but this may be due to gas below
any true corona, which may be about these stars.
    There are also the so-called nebulous stare, which are surrounded
by an aureole of faint light of measurable angular extent, but it would
seem more probable that these belong to, and should be discussed with,
the clusters and nebulae, and should not be regarded as exhibiting a
corona of the nature of that which surrounds the sun.
    So far then as our present powers of observation go, the corona of
the sun stands alone ; it is therefore the more to be regretted that the
observations of this object are beset with great and peculiar difficulties.
The absorption and scattering of the sun's light by our atmosphere,
amounting according to Professor Langley to nearly 40 per cent.,*
which are essential to the maintenance of the conditions under which
life, as it now exists, is possible upon the earth, comes in, in this case,
so seriously to our disadvantage that the corona can be seen for a few
minutes only at long intervals. It is only on the rare occasions when
the moon coming between us and the sun cuts off the sun's light from
the air at the place where the eclipse is total, that we can see the
corona through the cone of unilluminated air which is in shadow.              On
an average once in two years, for from three to six minutes, the corona
is visible, and then only over a very narrow strip of the earth's surface.
It is not surprising that many attempts have been made to observe the
corona without an eclipse.        The earlier attempts were based upon the
hope that if the eye were protected from the intense direct lightof the
sun, and from all light other than that from the sky immediately
about the sun, the eye might become sufficiently sensitive to perceive
the corona.     In the later attempts, success has been sought for from
the great diminution of air-glare which takes place at high elevations,
 when the denser and more dusty parts of the atmosphere are left below
the observer.      Professor Langley made observations on Mount Etna,
 and also on Mount Whitney, 15,000 feet high.                              I
                                                              He says : — " have
 tried visual methods under the most favourable circumstances, but
 with entire non-success."       Dr. Copeland, assistant to Lord Crawford,
observed at Puno at a height of 12,040 feet. In his report he says :f
 — " It ought to be mentioned that the appearances produced by the
 illuminated atmosphere were often of the most tantalising description,

  giving again and again the impression that my efforts were about to-
  be crowned with success."
     The spectroscopic method by which the prominences may be seen
 without an eclipse, fails for the corona, because a small part only of
 the coronal light is resolved by the prism into bright lines, and of these
 lines no one is sufficiently bright and coextensive with the corona to
 enable us to see the corona by its light.
     Let us look at some of the conditions of the problem.         As the
 obstacle to our seeing the corona consists of the bright screen of
 illuminated air which comes in before           it,   itof importance to
                                                            is
consider the relative degree of brightness of the air-glare, under
favourable conditions, to that of the corona behind it.
    During the eclipse of 1878, Professor         W. Langley found the
                                                 J.

the moon to be six times greater than that of the full moon, but at
3'   distance, the light to have fallen off to one-tenth of the light
of the full moon.*        Professor Harkness concludes for the same
eclipse : —  (1.) The total  light of the corona was 3-8 times that of the
full moon, or 0000069 of that of the sun. (2.) The coronal light
                 0
varied inversely as the square of the distance from the sun's limb.
(3.) The brightest part of the corona was 15 times brighter than the
surface of the full moon.        (4.) The corona of December 12, 1870,
seems to have been       7^ times brighter than that of July 29, 1878.f
In his report on the eclipse of 1883, M. Janssen says — " Cette ex:
perience a montre qu'a Caroline l'illumination donuee a ete plus
grande que celle de la pleine lune."J
  The chief point of importance for this inquiry lies not so much in
the actual value of the coronal light as in the relation of that value to
the brightness of the illuminated air near the sun.     Many observers
have borne testimony to the continued visibility of the corona for
some minutes     (from three minutes to twelve minutes) after the end of
totality.
   The observations which give to us direct information on this point
are those which have been made of the planets Venus and Mercury
when they come in between us and the sun.     It obvious that as the

the light which comes from it.         Under these circumstances the
observer sees the  sky in  front of the planet to be darker than the
adjoining parts, that   isto say, the withdrawal of the coronal light
from behind has made a sensible diminution of the brightness of the
sky.   It follows that the part of the sky about the sun, behind which
the corona  is situated, and to which its light  added,

the adjoining parts, in a degree not far removed from the eye's power
of distinguishing adjacent areas which differ by a small degree of
brightness.
   If,   therefore, by any method of observation even a small advantage
could     be given to the coronal light as compared with the air-glare,
and,     especially, if, at the same time, we could by any method
accentuate the small difference of illumination, a method might be
found by which the corona could be observed.
   When the report of the photographs taken during the Egyptian
eclipse of 1882 reached          this country, I was led to conclude that the
coronal light as seen from the earth was strong in the violet, and
probably to some extent also in the ultra-violet part of the spectrum.
   Apart from the question of the greater relative intrinsic intensity
of the more refrangible region of the coronal light as a whole, or of
any one of its components (its gaseous component gave bright lines
in the violet region), there are two considerations which show us that
the coronal light should be strong in the violet as compared with the
air-glare near the sun.
   The selective absorption of our atmosphere would cause the light
scattered by it in the near neighbourhood of the sun to be relatively
poor in this part of the spectrum ; but there is a second cause acting
in the same direction, which arises from the selective power of absorp
tion of the sun's atmosphere.
   The absorption which the photospheric light suffers from the solar
atmosphere has been investigated by Professor Langley, Professor
Pickering, and especially with great minuteness by Professor H. C.
Vogel.       Vogel found that while at the edge of the sun's disk the red
light was reduced to 30 per cent. of its value at the centre of the disk,
the violet light was reduced to 13 per cent.
   Vogel sums up by saying that if the solar atmosphere were removed,
the brightness of the violet part of the sun's light would be increased
about three times, but the red light one and a-half times only.* The
selective action would doubtless be more strongly marked beyond
the visible limit.
   The rapid increase of absorption near the sun's limb, in Vogel's
observations, indicates a low and dense solar atmosphere.                   Professor
Langley agrees in this view of the sun's atmosphere. He says, " The
portion of the (sun's) atmosphere chiefly concerned in absorption, I
have been led to believe, from several considerations, is extremely thin,
and    I  am inclined to think is mainly identical with the reversing layer
at the base of the chromosphere."
    Professor Hastings also considers the " layer which produces absorp-
   * "   Spectralphotometrische TTntersuchungen."

Weissenechaften."      Berlin,  Marz, 1877.  Also "  Ueber die Absorption der chemicale

tion to be very thin," but he prefers to regard this layer as consisting
not of gas, but of "a thin smoke-like envelope of precipitated
material."* Professor Pickering assumes the existence of an absorb
ing atmosphere about equal in height to the sun's radius, but we
shall see further on that there are reasons which make this supposition
extremely improbable.
    The light emitted by the corona, whether by the incandescent
particles or by the gas mingled with them, which lies outside the low
region of absorption, will not have been subjected to the same selective
absorption as the photospheric light which is emitted below this
region.      For this reason the light emitted by the corona will be richer
in the more refrangible rays than the sun's light before it enters our
 atmosphere, and will be in a still larger degree richer in these rays
 than the solar light which has been scattered by our atmosphere near
 the sun.      These considerations led me to hope that if the corona were
observed       by this kind of light alone it would be at some advantage
 relatively to the air-glare which comes in before it. It was of import
 ance at the same time to magnify the small advantage the coronal
 light might have by        some    method     of observation which could bring
out strongly minute differences of illumination.                      Such a power is
 possessed by a photographic surface.                I  took some pains to satisfy
           "
 myself that under suitable conditions of exposure and development
 a photographic plate can be made to record                         (strongly) minute
 differences     of  illumination     existing    in   different   parts of a bright
 object, such as a sheet of drawing paper, which are so subtile as to be
 at the very limit of the power of recognition of a trained eye, and as
 it appeared to me, those which surpass that limit."f

    Professor Stokes has suggested the following method of increasing the intensity
 of that part of the coronal light which is polarised relatively to the glare from the
 sky.    He says in a letter, which he permits me to add here : — " The light of the
 corona is known to be strongly polarised, while the atmospheric glare would show
 no sensible polarisation.    Let p be the intensity of the coronal light along any
 radius vector which is polarised radially, and q the intensity polarised tangeutially,
 and let la bo the intensity of the glare.      Then, without polarising the light, the
 intensity of the coronal light relatively to the glare would be as p + q to 2a. Suppose
 now the light falling on the plate to be polarised, say, in a north and south plane.
 Then north and south the ratio of the coronal light to that of the glare would be
 increased to p to a, while in east and west directions it would be reduced to q to a.
 In north-east and south-west as well as in north-west and south-east directions, the
 ratio would be the same as without polarisation.       If in four successive photographs
 the plane of polarisation were set to north, uorth-cast, east, south-east, we should
 get a relative increase in coronal light, in one or other of the photographs, all round
 the sun.     It would be least in north-north-east, east-north-east, &c, directions,
 where it would be p eos:22i° + q sin5 22i° to a, or about 0-85^' + 015y to a.
    " The most convenient way of polarising would probably be to use a Nicol of some
 size not far from the plate."

   part of the spectrum,* but afterwards obtained the desired light-
   selection    in the film itself by the use of argentic chloride, which
   Captain Abney had shown to be most strongly sensitive to light from
   h to a little beyond H.f              Plates prepared with argentic chloride
   possess a further advantage for this work in consequence of the
   greater steepness of their gradations of density corresponding to
   differences of light-action as compared with argentic bromide plates.
       When very small differences of illumination only, existing close
   about a body so enormously bright as the sun, have to be photographed,
  the most minute precautions have to be taken to avoid false effects
  upon the plate, which may arise from several causes.                      Lenses should
  not be used to form the sun's image on the sensitive surface, in con
  sequence of possible false light about the image which may come from
  outstanding aberrations, though they have been corrected for photo
  graphic work, and from reflections at the surfaces of the lenses. I
  therefore employed a mirror of speculum metal. Other necessary
  precautions are described in my paper, namely, the position of the
  shutter very near the focal plane ; protecting the sensitive surface
  from the sun's direct light by a metal disk a little larger than the
  sun's image ; placing before the apparatus a long tube fitted with
  diaphragms to prevent light from the sky, excepting near the sun,
 from entering the apparatus ; backing the plates with asphaltum
 varnish ; and some others.         J

      About twenty plates were taken in 1882, in all of which an appear
 ance more or less coronal in character is to be seen about the sun's

 was greatly helped by the kind assistance of Professor Stokes and of
 Captain Abney, there seemed to be good ground to hope that the

    In the following year,           1883,    working with the Lassell mirror,              I
found that when the sky was free from clouds, but whity from a
strong scattering of the sun's light, the sun's image in the photographs
was well defined upon a sensibly uniform surrounding of air-glare,
but without any such sndden increase of illumination near the sun's
limb, or other indication which might be due to the corona.                         It was
only when the sky was exceptionally clear that coronal appearances
presented themselves with more or less distinctness.

reason    that a larger amount of light would be difficult of management, and partly
because this restriction of the aperture would enable me to adopt the arrangement
which is shown in the diagram.
    " It will  be seen at once from an inspection of the diagram that in this arrange
ment the disadvantage       of a second reflection by the small mirror is avoided, as is
also the mechanical inconvenience of         tilling the speculum within the tube as in
the ordinary form of the Herschelian telescope.             The speculum b remains in its
place at the end of the tube a, d.      The small plane speculum and the arm carrying

below is a similar hole, over which is fitted a framework to receive the - backs         con
taining    the  photographic plates,  and  also to receive a frame with fine ground glass,
for putting the apparatus into position.         Immediately below, towards the speculum,
is fixed a shutter, with an opening of adjustable width, which can be made to pass
 across more or less rapidly by the use of india-rubber bands of different degrees of
 strength. In front of the opening         f   is fixed a tube, c, 6 feet long, fitted with
 diaphragms, to restrict as far as possible the light which enters the telescope to that
 which comes from the sun and the sky immediately around it. The telescope-tube,
 a a, is also fitted with diaphragms, which are not shown in the diagram, to keep from
 the plate all light except that coming directly from the speculum. It is obvious
 that, when the sun's light entering the tube at        / falls upon the central part of the
 speculum, the image of the sun will be formed in the middle of the second opening at
 d, about 2 inches from the position it would take if the tube were directed axially to
 the sun.     The exquisite definition of the photographic images of the sun shows, as
 was to be expected, that this small deviation from the axial direction, 2 inches in
 7 feet, does not affect sensibly the performance of the mirror.       The whole apparatus
 is firmly strapped on to the refractor of the equatorial, and carried with it by the
 clock motion." — Report B. Ass. Advanc. Science, 1883 p. 346.

    The total solar eclipse of May       6, 1883,  furnished an opportunity of
comparing the photographs taken with an eclipsed sun with those
taken in this country without an eclipse.            On the day of the eclipse
the weather was bad here, but plates taken before and after the
eclipse were placed in the hands of Mr. Wesley, who had had much
experience in making drawings from photographs taken during former
eclipses.    Mr. Wesley drew from these plates before any information
 reached this country of the results obtained at Caroline Island ; he
 was, therefore, wholly without bias in the drawings which he made
 from them.        When these drawings were compared afterwards with
 the Caroline Island plates, the general resemblance of the corona was
 strong, and the iden tity of the object photographed in England and
 at Caroline Island seemed placed beyond doubt by a remarkably
 formed rift on the east of the north pole of the sun, which is seen
 very nearly in the same position in the English plates and in those
 taken during the eclipse. This rift, slightly modified in form, was
 found to be present in a plate taken about a solar rotation-period
 before the eclipse, and also on a plate taken about the same time after
 the eclipse.*
     In 1884, a grant from the fund placed annually by the Government
 at the disposal of the Royal Society was put into the hands of a
 committee appointed by the Council of the Royal Society for the pur
 pose of photographing the corona at a place of considerable elevation.
 The Committee selected the Riffel, near Zermatt, which has an eleva
 tion of 8,500 feet, and appointed as photographer Mr. Ray Woods,
 who, as assistant to Professor Schuster, had photographed the corona
 during the eclipse of 1882, and who in conjunction with Mr. Lawrance
 had photographed         the eclipse of the following year at Caroline
 Island.

 light was always present about the sun, arising, it would seem, from

this morning and showed us the drawings Mr. Wesley has made of his coronas. He
told us that he particularly did not wish to see our negatives, but that he would like
us to compare his results with ours. We did so, and found that some of the strongly
marked details could be made out on his drawings, a rift Dear the north pole being
especially noticeable ; this was in a photograph taken on April 3, in which the detail
of the northern hemisphere is best shown, while the detail of our southern hemi
sphere most resembles the photograph taken on June 6 ; in fact, our negatives seem
to hold an intermediate position.       Afterwards  I  went with Dr. Huggins and
Mr. Woods to Burlington House to see the negatives. The outline and distribution
of light in the inner corona of April 3 is very similar to that on our plate which
had the shortest exposure ; the outer corona is, however, I think, hidden by atmo
spheric glare.    As a result. of the comparison 1 should say that Dr. Huggins'
coronas are certainly genuine as far as 8' from the limb."
                                                                          i 2

finely-divided matter of some sort in the higher regions of the air.
Mr. Woods observed from the Riffel that when no visible clond or
mist was present, there came into view a great aureole around the sun,
about 44° in diameter, of a faint red colour at the outside and passing
into bluish-white near the sun. This was clearly a diffraction pheno
menon showing the presence of minute particles of matter of some
sort in the higher regions of our atmosphere.
    The abnormally large amount of air-glare from this cause— even on
the finest days — prevented any success in photographing the corona in
this country, and went far to counteract the advantages of being
above the denser strata of air which Mr. Woods would have gained on
the Riffel under ordinary circumstances.
     Mr. Woods sums up his results in the following words : — " Results
on the same day are almost, if not quite, alike both with the disk and
without.         The corona varies more or less from day to day. The
clearer the day the better the results."*
    During the last two years the sky in this country has been too
bright from scattered light to make it possible to obtain successful
photographs of the corona.f
    We have now to discuss the probable nature of the corona.J
    The drawings, but especially the photographs, of the solar eclipses
of the last twenty-five years show that notwithstanding great changes
in form and in brightness, the corona is permanent in its more funda
mental characters.            The observed changes in form, in brightness, and
in relative extension, are obviously due to secondary modifications of
the conditions to which the corona owes its existence.
    The circular form which was ascribed to the corona in the older
observations can scarcely be regarded — even in the roughest sense of
the word — as correct. On the contrary, the apparent form of the corona
is always very irregular, in consequence of the greater extension and the
greater relative brightness of certain parts.                  Upon the whole, there is
    * "The Observatory,"       December,     188-1^ p. 378.
    + It  may not be unnecessary        to state that what the photographer has to seize
upon    on  his  plates  is the  small  excess of photographic power of the air-glare in
creased by the coronal light from behind over that of the air-glare alone.          For this
purpose    the  greatest  care  is necessary   to select the most suitable time of exposure,
and to arrest the slow development of the plate at the proper moment. Unless the
attempt is made at a high elevation, the impression upon the plate must be a very
slight one, and the developed image can only be seen under favourable conditions of
illumination.      Great care must be taken that all instrumental effects have been
carefully eliminated. A convenient way of distinguishing effects upon the plate
which are due to the instrument, is to take pictures with the instrument alternately
on the west and on the east side of the meridian.
    J The principal points of the discussion of the nature of the corona which follows
were suggested in a discourse given at the Royal Institution, February 22, 1885,
entitled " On the Solar Corona."

                         On the Corona      of  the Sun.                    117
an observed tendency of the brighter parts of the corona to assume a
square form in consequence of the greater extension of the coronal
matter at the latitudes between the poles and the equator of the sun —
that is, over the zones of maximum spot-action.             The corona is fre
quently  less  extended   over  the  poles  and  over the equatorial regions of
the sun.
   A  noticeable    exception to this state of things occuiTed in 1878,
when the most remarkable features of the corona were two extended
equatorial rays which could be traced to a distance of several solar
diameters. We shall have to consider, further on, some circumstances
which may have had a large influence in bringing about this state of
the corona.
   In addition to these large changes in the external form of the corona,
there is a complex structure within it which appears to be in con
tinual change.      This inner structure was observed by Professor S. P.
Langley   in 1878,   under very favourable conditions, with a telescope of
5 inches aperture and a power of 50.
   He sums up his observations in the following words : — *
   1. Extraordinary sharpness of filamentary structure.
   2. Arrangement not radial, or only so in the rudest sense.
   3. Generally curved, not straight lines.
   4. Curved in different directions.
   5. Very bright close to the edge, fading out rapidly, fading out
wholly (this part of corona) at 5' to 10' from it.
   In addition to this more minute structure, there are large bright
portions, apparently streaming outwards, and often leaving between
them less bright spaces, which have the appearance of rifts. There
are also curved forms which seem to turn round and to return to the
sun.
   We must not forget that the corona has thickness as well as exten
sion, and that the forms seen by us must appear more or less modified
by projection. Rays inclined towards or from the observer would be
materially altered in respect of their apparent position on the sun, and
long rays in the nearer or more distant part of the corona would appear
to start from parts of the sun other than those to which they really
belong. For the same reason the increase of intrinsic brightness of the
corona towards the sun's limb must be much less than the increase of
brightness as seen by us, of which no inconsiderable part must be due
to the greater extent of the corona in the line of sight as the sun is
approached.      Besides the real changes in the corona which have been
observed    at different  eclipses, there are several sources of apparent
change which may have modified the photographs taken of the corona.
 Of these may be mentioned — the state of the air at the time ; the kind
of sensitive surface employed ; the length of exposure ; whether

 the image has been formed by a lens which shortens and enfeeblf s
 the ultra-violet part of the light, or by a mirror which furnishes an
 image more truly representing the corona in the nature of the light
 existing in it.    The difficulties which     seemed to lie in the way of a
 satisfactory explanation of the forms and of the enormous extent of
 the corona, caused some doubts to be entertained as to the corona
 being a true solar appendage, and various views were formerly put
 forward to endeavour to explain the corona as an optical appearance
 only, arising from our atmosphere, from a lunar atmosphere, or from
 cosmical dust.     Mr. De la Rue, in his address before Section A of the
 British Association in 1872, says truly, " The great problem of the
 solar origin of that portion of the corona which extends more than a
 million of miles beyond the body of the sun, has been, by the photo
 graphic observations of Colonel Tennant and Lord Lindsay in 1871,
 finally set at rest, after having been the subject of a great amount of
 discussion for many years."*
    These earlier views are too completely a part of the history of the
subject to need mention here, but for the circumstance that Professor
Hastings has recently revived the theory of Delisle, that the corona is
an optical appearance due to diffraction.
    Professor Hastings bases his theory upon the behaviour of the
bright line, 1474, which he saw, in his spectroscope, change in length
east and west of the sun during the progress of the eclipse at Caro
line Island in 1883.     He assumes, in his explanation of this observa
tion, that Fresnel's theory of diffraction may not apply in the case of
a solar eclipse, and he suggests that at different        moments the phases
of  the  light  waves  may change       so that  they  no longer form a con
tinuous periodic series, and that it is possible, at such great distances,
that the interior of the shadow may not be entirely dark, and that
sufficient light may come inside to give to an observer on the earth
the appearance of a bright aureole around the moon.-f
    Professor Hastings considers the simpler explanation of his obser
vation which has been suggested, that the change in length of the
line which he observed might be due to a scattering by our air of the
light from the brighter part of the corona, and, therefore, might not
indicate any change in the corona itself during the progress of the
eclipse, to be untenable, on the ground that the air-was_too clear, and
" diffusion absolutely     insensible."     He supports this strong state
ment by saying that the photographs taken by the English and by the
French observers showed a sensibly black moon, and that il in the
photograph of the coronal lines, H and K, taken by the English
observers these lines ended abruptly at the moon's edge."J

    Captain Abney, F.R.S., who has the photographs taken at Caroline
Island under examination, informs me that : —
    " The diffusion
                      during that eclipse was not insensible, as the lines
H and K are distinctly visible across the black moon as dark lines.
It is true that H and K, as bright lines, do stop at the moon's limb,
but these lines are not coronal lines, as they belong to the pro
minences.      In the Egyptian eclipse — which was a very short one —
the prominences were far over the moon's limb, and the diffusion
due to the atmosphere was such that the lines H and K were shown as
bright lines over the moon. In the Caroline Island eclipse the pro
minences were much less marked and more hidden during the eclipse
than was the case in Egypt, and it appears that the diffusion by the
air must have been much greater in the former (Caroline Island)
than in the latter, since it is the light from the hidden sun which was
evidently reflected and re-reflected.          On one side of the moon's limb
 H and K are      seen  reversed, whilst on the other they are reversed
 beyond the bright lines.
    " In both cases the reversals are rather faint, but as strong as the
reversal which was seen on the corona spectrum at the Egyptian
eclipse.    In my opinion, in the photographs of the corona with the
 longest exposure (I am not now speaking of spectrum photographs)
the moon is not shown as perfectly black, but             I  should not like to
 found any theory very definite as to this, as it might be due to
 over-development, but I think not."
    It should be mentioned that during the time that Professor Hastings
 observed the change in length of the line 1474, photographs of tho
 corona    were  taken    by M. Janssen, and by Messrs. Lawrance and
 Woods. M. Janssen says : " Les formes de la couronne out etc abso-
 lument fixes pendant toute la duree de la totalite."* The photographs
 taken by Messrs. Lawrance and Woods show that the corona suffered
 no such alterations in width and form as would be required by Pro
 fessor Hastings' theory, during the passage of the moon across the sun.
    For other points raised by Professor Hastings, and for his discussion
 of former spectrum observations of the corona,             I must refer to his
 memoir.f
     The evidence in favour of the corona being a true solar appendage
 appears to me to be of overwhelming weight.               It seems difficult on
 any   other hypothesis    to  explain    satisfactorily — (1) the observed and
 the photographed spectra         of  different parts of the corona ; (2) tho
 visibility of the planets Venus and Mercury as dark bodies when near
  the sun ; (3) the filamentous, and especially the peculiar curved
 structures seen in photographs of the corona ; (4) the close agreement
  of photographs taken at different times during an eclipse, and
                        * " Annuaire pour l'An 1884," p. 859.

especially between photographs   taken during the same eclipse at
places many hundreds of miles apart.
   At the same time a very small part of the light which is seen
about  the eclipsed sun must be due to diffusion by our atmo
sphere of the coronal light itself, especially of the very bright part
near the sun's limb ; and we have an indication of the amount of this
diffused light from the apparent illumination of the dark moon,
where the effects of diffusion will be most strongly present. During
some  eclipses the part of the sky where the sun and moon are may
be faintly illuminated by light reflected from those regions of the
atmosphere near the horizon which are still in direct sunlight.
  It may be well to mention the principal hypotheses which have
been suggested in explanation of the corona.
    1. That the corona consists of a gaseous atmosphere resting upon
 the sun's surface and carried round with it.
    2. That the corona is made up wholly or in part of gaseous and
 finely divided matter which has been ejected from the sun, or received
 by  it,and which    in motion about the sun from the forces of ejection,
                         is
of the sun's rotation, and of gravity, and possibly of      repulsion of a
some kind.
   3.  That the corona resembles the ring of Saturn, and consists of
swarms of meteoric particles revolving with sufficient velocity to pre
vent their falling into the sun.
    4. That the corona      the appearance presented to us by the un
                                     is
ceasing falling into the sun of meteoric matter and of the debris of the
tails of comets.
   5.  That the coronal rays and streamers are, at least in part,
meteoric streams strongly illuminated by their near approach to the
sun, neither revolving about nor falling into the sun, but permanent
in position and varying only in richness of meteoric matter, which
are parts of eccentric comet orbits.   This view has been supported on
the ground that there must be such streams crowding richly together
in the sun's neighbourhood.
    G. The view of the corona suggested by Sir William Siemens in
Lis solar theory.*
    The sun must be surrounded by a true gaseous atmosphere of
relatively limited extent, but there are several considerations which
forbid us to think of a solar atmosphere, in the proper sense of the
term, that     of a continuous mass of gas held up by its own elasti-
               is
  * Since this lecture was read
                                 my attention has heen called to the papers by Pro
fessor  O. Reynolds, " On the Tails of Comets, the Solar Corona, and the Aurora
considered as Electric Phenomena," and "On an Electrical Corona resembling the
Solar Corona," in vol. t, 3rd Ser., " Lit. and Phil. Soc," Manchester, pp. 44-56, and
pp. 202-2U9. Professor Reynolds considers the solar corona to be       species of that
                                                                         a

city, which rises to a height sufficient to afford an explanation of the
corona which streams several hundred thousand miles above the
photosphere.
     Gravitation on the sun is about twenty-seven times as great as on
the earth, and an atmosphere extending to a moderate coronal height,
even if it consisted of a gas thousands of times lighter than hydrogen,
wonld have more than metallic density at the sun's surface, a state of
things which spectroscopic and other observations show cannot be the
case.
   There is another consideration from the rapid increase of density
which would take place sunwards in such an atmosphere.                   Each
stratum would be compressed by the weight of all the strata above                  it,
and therefore in descending by equal steps the density of the atmo
sphere would increase in geometrical ratio. Professor Newcomb gives
as an example an atmosphere of hydrogen           such
                                                   ;      gas, though heated
                                                               a
to as high a temperature as        likely to exist at a height of
                                  is                                 hundred
                                                                       a
thousand miles above the sun, would double its density every five or
ten miles.* There       isno approach to so regular and so rapid an in
crease of density to be observed in the corona.
   Another circumstance which puts continuous gaseous atmosphere
                                             a
oat of question    isthe fact that comets have passed unscathed through
the coronal regions.      Shooting stars passing with the relatively small
velocity of thirty or forty miles per second through our atmosphere,
rarefied as  itis, at the height of fifty or sixty miles, are instantly burnt
up. R-sistance and heat increase as the square [or more probably for
such high velocities as the cubef] of the velocity, yet the nucleus of             a
comet has passed through several hundred thousand miles of coronal
matter with a velocity of 300 miles per second without suffering any
sensible loss of velocity. These considerations are amply sufficient to
show that the theory of a solar atmosphere of gas of the extent of the
corona held up by its own elasticity cannot be entertained.
   As we have reason to believe that the corona          an objective reality
                                                             is
about the sun, matter of some sort must exist wherever the corona
is seen to extend.      The questions before us are — (1.) In what form
does the matter exist    ?  (2.) Whence does         come
                                                        it     (3.) What are

matter, the spectroscope has given us definite information.

   (6.) A solar spectrum, which shows that the incandescent solid or
liquid matter of the corona reflects to us light from the photosphere.
   (c.) A spectrum of bright lines, which is relatively faint and varies
greatly at different eclipses. We shall consider this spectrum more
particularly further on ; it is sufficient at this part of the argument
that we speak of this spectrum so far only as it tells us of gaseous
matter which accompanies the solid or liquid matter.
   It is scarcely necessary to say that solid or liquid matter can exist
in the corona only in the form of discrete particles of extreme
minuteness.
   The corona must, therefore, consist of a fog, in which the particles
are incandescent, and in which the gaseous matter does not form a
continuous atmosphere.    Some of the considerations we have already
had before us, make it evident that this coronal fog, except very near
the sun, must be of a degree of tenuity surpassing any experience we
possess  from terrestrial experiments.  In order to give some definite-
ness to our conceptions, let us suppose a single minute liquid or solid
particle in each cubic mile.    A fog even so extremely attenuated, or
even much more so, would probably be fully sufficient to give rise to
the corona, under the enormous radiation to which it is subjected.
  (2.) The next question we have to consider is whether the matter
of the corona is of solar origin, or whether it comes upon the sun
from without.
   Two external sources of the coronal matter have been suggested,
and are widely held, namely : — (a) meteroids, and (6) the lost matter
of the tails of comets.
   (a.) The solar system is crowded with meteoroids revolving in all
kinds of erratic orbits, and we know that the earth encounters many
thousands of them every hour, but the sun is in a different position
with regard to such of these bodies as belong to our system. In
order to fall into the sun, the planetary meteoroids would have to be
thrown into       through some disturbance of their orbits, produced by
                     it,
planetary   attraction, or by collision with other streams, unless we
admit      aslow retardation of velocity produced       by      resisting            a
medium.
   There may be meteoroids which fall directly into the sun from
space. Mr. Denning's recent observations  seem to show that the
solar system encounters meteor streams which may be moving with
great velocity through space.*
   Many of these bodies may fall into the sun, but we have no know
ledge of conditions which would ensure so steady an inflow of
meteoroids as would be needed to maintain the observed extent of
the corona in a state of permanence about the sun.
   (6.) The other suggestion which has been made regards the corona

as   fed by the lost matter of the tails of comets. We must remember
that the matter which comes from the nucleus of a comet, and forms
its tail, and is then lost, has been shown by the spectroscope to con
sist in nearly all comets, of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and possibly
oxygen.*        If this matter is condensed into the discrete particles
which form the tail, in the same conditions of chemical combination
as it existed originally in the nucleus, we should expect these particles
to be again vaporised in their near approach to the sun ; and under
these conditions we should expect to find the corona to be mainly
gaseous, and to give a spectrum similar to that which is produced by
 the emitted light of comets.           We know that such is not the case ;
 there is, however,     a  single observation by Tacchini at Caroline Island,
 in which in one part of the corona he suspected two of the bands which
are present in the ordinary cometary spectrum.                His words are : —
 " Dans le spectre du grand panache, qui etait faible et presque con-
 tinu, et que Ton voyait seulement a fente large, j'ai observe deux
 bandes qui m'ont semble etre analogues a celles que j'ai observers
 dans les spectres de cometes, e'est-a-dire, la centrale et la moins
 refrangible."t       The terms in which this unique observation is given
 show that the lines, even if truly present, were faint and exceptional,
 and cannot be regarded as characteristic of the coronal light.
     It may indeed be suggested that the cometary matter suffers decom
 position at the time when it becomes luminous near the nucleus, and
 that carbon may be separated in a finely divided state, and go to
 form part of the lost matter of the tail. In the case of comets which
 have more than one tail, or exhibit rays driven off with a curvature
 different from that of the principal tail, there is good reason to
 believe, as Bredichin has endeavoured to show,| that each tail or
 caudal ray consists of matter different in density, which has been
 separated by a force of repulsion varying as the surface.                  It would
 appear    doubtful,   even    on this  view,  if the supply   of  comets'     tails is
 sufficiently regular     in  amount to maintain a permanent corona about
 the sun.
     It seems to me to be much more probable that the corona is fed
 from the sun itself.          This view is supported by tho spectroscopic
 evidence, for the coronal gas is shown to consist of substances which
  exist also in the photosphere.           The structure seen in the corona is
  much more in harmony with the view that the matter is going up
  from the sun, than that it is coming down upon the sun.
     An examination of the photographs taken at eclipses, or of Mr.
  Wesley's admirable drawings from them, can scarcely fail to lead an
  unbiased student to the same conclusion as that which was forced

 upon Mr. Lewis Swift when he observed the corona of 1878 : — "                       I
 was irresistibly led to the conclusion that the corona, whatever may
 be its nature, is not a solar atmosphere, nor an inflow of meteoric
 matter,    as   many suppose, but rather an outflow of something."*
 These considerations appear to me to be of great weight in support of
 the view, that though some meteoroid and some cometary matter may
 fall into the sun, the corona consists essentially               of matter coming
from the sun.
     (3.) We have now to consider under what dynamical conditions
matter coming from the sun can take on forms such as those we see
 in the corona, and can pass away to such enormous distances, in
 opposition to gravitation, which is so powerful at the sun.
    There is another celestial phenomenon, very unlike the corona at
first sight, which may furnish us with a clue to the true answer to
 this question.      The head of a large comet presents us with luminous
 streamers and rifts and curved rays, which are not very unlike on a
small scale some of th6 appearances which are always present in and
are peculiar to the corona.             We do not know for certain the con
ditions under which these cometary phenomena take place, but the
only theory upon which they can be satisfactorily explained, and
which now seems on the way to become generally accepted, attributes
them to electrical disturbances, and especially to a repulsive force
acting from the sun, probably electrical, which varies as the surface,
and not like gravity, as the mass.f A force of this nature in the case
of highly attenuated matter can easily master the force of gravity,
and as we see in the tails of comets, blow away this thin kind of
matter to enormous distances in the very teeth of gravity.
    If such a force of repulsion, acting from the sun, is experienced by
comets, it must also be present near the sun, and may well be expected
to show its power over the matter ejected from the sun's surface.J

   J  As a contribution to the history of opinions involving more or less distinctly
the idea of repulsion, it may be well to give the following words by Professor Young
(" Amer. J. of Science," vol. i, May, 1871, p. 7) :— " On the one hand, that of Pro
fessor Norton and Mr. Proctor, whose views regarding these rays (the long faint
rays) are nearly identical, and represent them to be streams of matter, similar to
cometary substance or auroral."      In a foot-note Professor Young says further : —
" Since my name has sometimes been referred to in connexion with the so-called
'
                                                                        I
  Auroral Theory of the Corona,' it is proper for me to state that make no claim
to be its originator.   So far as I know, Professor Norton was the first to work out
and publish a connected theory of the subject, basing his conclusions largely upon

                              On the Corona      of  the Sun.                        12.5
      The existence of a force, -which, under suitable conditions, may
  become one of repulsion at the sun's surface, is not hypothetical only,
  for we have reasons to believe that such a force must really be present
  there. Though we have no definite knowledge of the distribution of
  electricity on the surface of the sun, we do know that chemical and
  mechanical actions are taking place there which must be accompanied
  by electrical disturbances.         It seems to me that these disturbances,
  which must be of a high order of magnitude, bring about the magnetic
  changes on the earth which are observed to take place in connexion
  with solar phenomena.*
      The grandest displays of terrestrial electrical disturbance must be
  altogether insignificant in comparison with the electrical changes
  which must accompany the ceaseless and fearful activity of the
  photosphere.        Not to mention the frequent outhursts of heated gas
  thousands of miles high, and over areas in which the earth could be
  engulphed, there is the unceasing formation of the fiery photospheric
  cloud-granules about as large as Great Britain.                Surely it is not too
  much to say         that   our terrestrial    experience of lightning and of
  his discussions of Donati's comet, which were printed in this Journal some years
 ago.    Professor Wiulock also informs me that he has held and published a very
                           I
 similar opinion, and so think hare more than one of the European astronomers.
 My own father, more than twenty years ago, was accustomed to teach from the same
 chair of astronomy which I now occupy, an essentially similar doctrine. Thus the
 idea had long been familiar to me, and,      I presume, more or less so to astronomers
 generally."
    It may be well to give a more direct reference to the papers of Professor W. A.
Norton. He says, speaking of comets (" Proc. Amer. Ass.," 1854, p. 166) : — " The
tails of comets flowing away under a repulsive force from the sun."
"
   [this repulsive force] to consist of the impulsive action of auroral matter flowing
                                                              " The
from the sun."     Again, speaking of the corona, he says :         aigrettes of auroral
matter flowing off chiefly from the polar regions into space."          In a subsequent
paper (" Proc. Amer. Ass.," 1859, p. 167) Professor Norton defines his idea of the
repulsive force as "a general force of cosmical repulsion exerted by all cosmical
masses."
    Mr. Proctor's   views will be found in his work, "The Sun, the Ruler of the
Planetary System," 3rd Ed., 1885, pp. 326—427.
    For M. Faye's views on a repulsive force, see " Annuaire pour l'An 1883," also
"Annuaire pour l'An 1885," and numerous papers in the "Comptes Rendus."
Reference should also be made to the conjectures on the existence of a repulsive
force thrown out by Sir John Herschel in his Cape Observations.
    * Professor Stokes and Professor Balfour Stewart have both speculated on the
connexion between solar disturbances and terrestrial magnetism, and have both
imagined that the operative solar change is thermic — not electrical, and that it is
through radiation that it affects the condition of the earth in such a manner as to
be manifested by magnetic disturbances, though the modes in which these philoso
phers have conjectured th-t. this takes place are wholly different.    In a subsequent
note   I have suggested that the operative solar change is electrical, and that the
action is probably one of nlatical induction. — August 20, 1885.

aurora fail to supply us with any adequate basis for a true concep
tion of the electric forces in action on the sun.
    The phenomena of comets show not merely a highly electrical con
dition of the sun's surface, but also the permanence of an electric
potential of the same kind, whether negative or positive.* Though
we do not know eaough of what is taking place at the sun to define
the conditions which may cause the matter ejected from the sun's
surface to have a high electric potential of the same name, yet we
can see that broadly all the different actions which take place there,
and to which the electric disturbances are probably due, are parts
of one continuous process going on always in the same direction,
namely, the transference of energy from the interior to the photo
sphere, and the loss of the energy there, in the radiant form.
    We must bear in mind that a strongly electrified ttf.ate of the solar
 surface would not act as a force of repulsion upon discrete particles
of matter insulated from each other, such as exist in the tails of
 comets and in the corona, unless these particles possessed an electric
potential of the same kind as the solar surface. If these particles
 were in an nnelectrified condition, the action of the sun would be one
 of statical induction only, altering the original distribution of elec
 tricity over their surfaces, but powerless to change in any sensible
 manner the positions of their centres of gravity in space, because
 the attraction on one side of each particle would be balanced by the
 repulsion on the other.
    * The sun's potential may be regarded as due to actions of some kind always going
 on, or to a permanent charge received    at some past time. The sun if once charged
 with electricity of the same name would doubtless remain so charged, as Mr. Crookes'
 experiments appear to show that a vacuum would be a perfect insulator.
    If the sun has been charged with electricity of one name, we do not know how this
 came about, though more than one probable conjecture might be hazarded. Some facts
 mentioned further on as to the influence of Mercury and of Venus upon the coronal
 matter would seem to make it very probable that these planets are permanently
 charged with electricity of the other name to that of the sun.    If this should hold
 good also of the more distant planets (we know nothing of the absolute potential of
 the earth's surface) , we should have the planets charged with one kind of electricity,
 and the sun charged with the opposite electricity.      As we have reason to believe
 that the sun and the planets formed originallv one cosmical mass, the question may
 be suggested whether these changes of electricity of opposite names can have been
 brought about in connexion with the separation of the matter which forms the
 planets from that which exists in the sun.
    If we regard the sun as possessing an electric potential of one name, it is not
 absolutely necessary to suppose the local electric disturbances which are spoken of
 in the text.   Electric disturbances are undoubtedly taking place there, and through
 these the ejected matter might come to have a higher potential than it possessed as
 forming part of the sun.     Through these local disturbances some of the matter of
 the corona might have sometimes a higher or lower potential of the same name,
 and in this way might arise one of the varying conditions upon which the observed
 changes in the corona depend. — August 20, 1885.

                         On the Corona    of  the  Sun.                       127
   If we grant the existence of a high electric potential of the sun's
surface, we become possessed of a means of explanation of the chief
coronal phenomena, provided we accept the conclusion to which our
arguments have already led us, that the matter of the corona is of
solar origin.
   The photosphere is the seat of ceaseless convulsions and outhursts
of fiery matter.     Storms of heated gas and incandescent hail rush
upwards, or in cylones, as many miles in a second as our hurricanes
move in an hour. Dante's and Milton's poetic imaginings of Hades
fall far below the common-place scenes at the solar surface. Is it then
going beyond what might well be, to suppose that some portions of the
photospheric matter, having an electric potential of the same kind as
that of the solar surface, from which they come, and ejected, as is
often the case, with velocities not far removed from that which would
be necessary to set them free from the sun's attraction, should come
under the action of a powerful electric repulsion, and so be carried
upwards, and from the sun ?
   If we take this view of things, we are able to accept the objective
reality of many of the very long coronal rays, which seem to rest upon
sufficient testimony.     At the eclipse of 1878, Professor Langley traced
the coronal matter to a distance of twelve solar diameters, and he
         " I feel great confidence in saying that
adds :                                                 (this distance) was but
a portion of its extent."*         Professor Newcomb traced this ray to
                                " six degrees from the
about the same distance,                                    disk."f Such dis
tances are small as compared with the extent of the tails of comets.
   This view of the corona is in harmony with the source of the
matter, and of the forces which the structure of the corona almost
irresistibly suggests, namely, that these have their seat in the sun.
We should expect, what we find to be the case, that there is usually
great coronal richness and extension over the spot zones where the
solar activity is most fervent.      Matter blown upwards by an electrical
repulsion would rise with the smaller rotational velocity of the photo
sphere from which it started, and would appear to lag behind in its
ascent, and so give rise to the curved rays, which are so common a
feature. We may well suppose that the forces of eruption and of
subsequent electrical repulsion would vary in different places, and
not be always strictly radial ; under such circumstances a structure,
similar to that which the corona presents, might arise. A force of
 repulsion would also be present among the similarly electrified particles
 of the corona, acting in all directions, and would cause these particles
 to separate from each other, during their ascent from the sun ; the
 amount of this diffusion would depend upon several factors, among
 others, upon the original velocity of ascent, and upon the density
 and the degree of electric potential of the repelled stuff.

  128                        Dr. W. Huggins.
     A relatively very small amount     of matter, under this diffusing
 force, would suffice to give rise to the corona, and we can see how
 the extremely attenuated state of the corona, consisting as it must
 do, of minute particles widely separated, it may he hy miles each
 from the other, may have been rapidly bronght about.
     It is now time to consider the gaseous matter which we know to be
 associated with the coronal particles, but not to form a continuous
 gaseous atmosphere.       The gas which exists with the incandescent
 particles, and which the spectroscope shows to have come from the
 photosphere, may have been carried up as gas, or have been in part
 distilled from the condensed matter which forms the coronal par
 ticles, under the enormous radiation to which they are exposed.
 Such a view of the gas which is present in the corona, would not
 be out of harmony with the circumstance        that the amount of gas
 relatively to the incandescent particles appears to vary (at the last
 eclipse in Caroline Island it seems to have been but very sparingly
 present), nor with the very different heights to which different
 bright lines may be traced at different parts of the corona and at
 different eclipses.     Gases of different vapour-density   would be
 acted upon differently by an electric force of repulsion which varies
 as the surface, and would to some extent be winnowed from each
 other; the lighter the gas, the more completely would it come under
 the sway of repulsion, and so would be carried more rapidly to a
 greater height than a gas more strongly held down by gravity.
 The relative proportions, as well as the actual amounts, at different
 heights in the corona, of the gases which the spectroscope shows to
 exist there, would vary from time to time ; they would depend in fact
also on the largeness of supply from below, in other words, upon the
state of activity of the photosphere, and in this way there would
come abont a relation probably between the corona and the promi
nences.
    The varying amount of gas in different parts of the corona is illus
 trated by the following statement in the Report on the Eclipse of
 1882, by Captain Abney and Professor Schuster : —
    "The ring in the green (1474) is particularly strong in the south
western quadrant, and hardly visible at some other points of the sun's
limb.      The yellow ring (D3) is much fainter on the whole, but more
uniform all round the sun."
    Further on (p. 270) they say — " As regards the corona, we may
perhaps point out that hitherto the position of only one true coronal
line had been fixed, though two other lines had been suspected.     The
corona during the late eclipse seems to have been especially rich in
lines.     Thollon observed some in the violet without being able to fix
their position, and Tacchini could determine the position of four true
corona lines in the red ; from the photograph we have been able to

                             On the Corona      of  the  Sun.                      129
 measure about thirty additional lines, thus increasing                 the number of
 lines considerably."*
                                                     "
     Captain Abney informs me as follows : The spectrum of the corona
 had fewer lines in the Caroline Island eclipse (1883) than in the
 Egyptian eclipse (1882), and the corona was much brighter at one limb
 than at the other in 1883.           I think I can trace reversed Fraunhofer
 lines beyond the bright lines H and K away from the moon's edge."
     It would seem probable that at the time of the eclipse of 1883, the
 amount of light-emitting gas was smaller relatively to the number
 of incandescent particles than at the time of the eclipse of the pre
 vious year. This supposition agrees with the fact that the scattered
 solar light, showing the Fraunhofer lines, was strong in 1883.
     There may be another connexion between the corona and the pro
 minences besides that of a supply of gaseous matter, namely, one due
to an increase of electric potential of the ejected matter when the
 prominences are numerous and large.
     The electric disturbances which accompany the formation of large
 sun-spots are well known to be of sufficient magnitude to be felt upon
 the earth, by causing changes in the distribution of the terrestrial
magnetism sufficiently great to affect our instruments.f                   The Astro-
    * " Phil. Trans.," 1884, pp. 264 and 270.
    t We do not know the mode in which the sun       acts upon our magnets.   The solar
action may be a direct one due to changes in the sun's magnetism, or to an electro
magnetic action due to electric currents, or to electrified matter in motion with a
high Telocity. The views suggested in this lecture of the sun's electrified state, and
of the nature of the corona may possibly throw some light on this point. Two
distinct modes of the sun's action on the magnetic needle seem to be possible : —
    (a.) The sun being a charged conductor separated from the earth, also a conductor,
by an insulating vacuum, would affect the distribution of the earth's electricity
by its power of statical induction.     As the earth rotates currents would be set up
about it to effect the redistribution of electricity required to satisfy the inducing
influence of the sun.      May we not find in these earth-currents an explanation
of some of the phenomena of the earth's magnetism ? However this may be,
the changes in the sun's statical induction which would follow from the shooting
forth of the electrified matter of the corona, may well so affect the earth-currents
as through them to bring about the disturbances observed in the needle.            The
electrified matter of the corona which leaves the sun will still go on, even when too
diffused to be visible, and will still continue to produce upon the earth the effect
due to its charge of electricity. The amount of this action will depend greatly upon
the direction of the projected matter relatively to the position of the earth.
    (6.) The other possible mode of action of the corona would be to suppose an
electromagnetic action upon the earth. The electrified coronal matter moving with
a high velocity would act similarly in this respect to electric currents.  Among other
difficulties we must consider the rapid decrease of electromagnetic action at a
distance.
    If  the sun is a charged body, then in consequence of continually parting with
matter charged with electricity of the same name as that of the sun's charge, the
sun's potential would be slowly decreasing.    This consideration would be in support,

tiomer Royal, writing of the magnetic activity of the year 1882, says :
" The month of November, which was characterised
                                                                 by the appearance
of a very large sun-spot, being particularly disturbed with remarkable
magnetic storms on November               17, 19, and 20, and many         interesting
cases of lesser disturbance."*
    We can scarcely doubt but that similar electric                  disturbances of
exceptional magnitude accompany the formation of the prominences ;
indeed these phenomena may themselves be, in part at least, electric
discharges analogous to terrestrial aurorae.           t   However this may be,
we can scarcely doubt that large electric disturbances                     accompany
them. Tacchini takes the view that electricity plays a chief part
in the prominences, and b-lieves that he is able to show a connexion be
tween these phenomena and corresponding changes in the magnetism
of our globe.    J
    Hitherto in our discussion of the forces which may be active in the
 corona, we have taken account only of the influence of electrical
changes which take place upon the sun.                Now these changes at the
 sun make themselves felt upon the earth ; we may then well suppose,
 with a high degree of probability, that the- earth,§ and especially the
of the conjecture thrown out in the last sentences of the text, that the corona was
formerly of larger extent, and that it will continue to diminish. — August 20, 1885.

    At the same sitting Professor Respighi took a different view (p. 174) and stated
 he did not consider the prominences to be of a nature to occur in periods, and that
 he could not admit a connexion- between the maxima and minima of th-e prominences
 and the elements of terrestrial magnetism.       At the following sitting, March 15
 (p. 228) Tacchini replies to the objections of Respighi, and- endeavours to show that
 Respighi has been influenced by his preconceived views of the nature of spots and
 prominences.

 1845) occur at intervals of twenty-six days, or multiples of twenty-six days.     .  .
 As this period is that of the sun's rotation relatively to the earth, it appears to»
 follow that the earth has some action on the sun, or (more probably) on some ray-
 like emanation from the sun, which causes these changes in the earth's magnetism."

tions  in which they happen to be.           The influence may be one of
attraction, giving rise to coronal extension or rays from the corona,
or to repulsion, in which case we might have what appears to us as a
rift directed towards the body.
   We have not sufficient data to furnish certain information on this
point, but it may be of interest to quote the following sentences from
Mr. Trouvelot's Report of the Eclipse of 1878*
   "
     There is a fact connected with this eclipse, which, if not due to a
singular coincidence, would seem to point to some attractive action of
the planets on the solar atmosphere (corona).            On the day of the
eclipse Mercury and Venus were in almost opposite points of their
orbits, with the sun between and almost on a line with them. while
the Earth on the same day was in a part of its orbit which formed
the apex of an equilateral triangle having for base the line joining
Mercury and Venus.        Knowing this, it is perhaps singular, and any
how very remarkable, to see that the eastern wing of the corona was
directed on a straight line to Mercury, while the western appendage
was directed on a straight line to Venus.          The coincidence was still
greater.     As in regard to the sun, the two planets were not exactly
on the    same line, Mercury being a little to the north, while Venus
was a little to the south of the ecliptic ; the solar appendages have
shown the same peculiarity, their axes being a little inclined to each
other."
   I may say that the inclination of the axes of coronal extensions on
the two sides     of the snn may be seen in the photographs of this
eclipse.    It should be stated that Professor Newcomb, who observed
the coronal     extension  towards   Venus,     says: — "I  tried to  judge
whether the western       one (ray) pointed towards the planet Venus,
then plainly visible near the horizon.       The direction was apparently
very slightlv below that of the planet."        Professor Newcomb's words
seem to show that he did not make any allowance for refraction,
which    would make the planet when near the horizon appear sensibly
higher than its true place.
   If sufficient evidence should be forthcoming in the future to estab
lish a sensible influence of the planets upon the corona, we should not

 expect to see the coronal matter in all cases moving exactly towards
 or from a planet, because this matter wonld be also under the influ
 ence of a motion in the direction of its primary repulsion, and also
 of  one   of rotation about the sun.*
     There has been some difference of opinion as to whether the corona
 is uniform in constitution from the sun's limb outwards, or whether
 it consists of two parts, which have been distinguished by the names,
 " inner corona " and " outer corona."
     There can be no doubt that at certain times, and in certain solar
 latitudes, a lower part of the corona, such as that described by Pro
 fessor Langley, extending from about 5' to 10', is so much brighter
 than the parts outside of it that it seems to form what may be called
 an inner corona.            At the same time, the photographs of different
 eclipses, and Mr. Wesley's drawings from some of them, show dis
 tinctly that all the stronger indications of structure can be traced down
 almost to the sun's           limb, and that the brighter parts within some
 6' to 10' of the limb, are not equally bright all round the sun.                      This
brighter inner part is represented very strongly in several drawings
which accompany Mr. Stone's paper on the eclipse of 1874, especially
in one by Mr. Wright.! There seems great probability that the corona
    * General Tennant, F.R.S., informs me that since this lecture was read, he has
calculated tho places of Mercury, Venus, and Mars for the eclipse of 1871 and the
eclipse of 1882.      He says : —
    " The
            positions at the eclipse of 1871 are —
                         Mercury position angle               100° 39*

Mercury is thus not far from the direction of the great prominences lettered H and
•I (see catalogue   at page 27 of my report, ' Mem. R. Ast. Soc.,' toI. xlii), and corre
sponds to the greatest extension of the coronal matter, namely, 45' in my table.
Venus is near the group lettered V, W, and X, of which group V is less only to H
 and   I  in height, and corresponds to the next greatest extension of the corona
namely, 34' 56" in my table.        The real heights of the visible extensions, allowing
for the foreshortening, would be for Mercury, 41' 3" or 45' 31", according to the
reading taken ; and for Venus, 47' 05". Any such calculation, however, implies a
 form of the coronal extension which does not exist.          The more foreshortened ray
 would, in fact, on account of its breadth, seem longer in proportion than the one
 which is seen more nearly perpendicularly to its axial direction ; and in this case
 this consideration would tend to reduce the real extension of the Venus ray. Mars
 does not seem to have any marked ray directed to him, but any such ray would be
 much foreshortened if it existed.
    " At the time of the eclipse of May 16, 1882
                                                     ('Phil. Trans.,' vol. clxxv, Plate 13),
 we should have the effects of the planets Mercury and Venus coincident, and not
 much foreshortened, in the coronal pictures. The combined effects of these planete
 are shown in the protruding angle at the upper left side of the engraved corona.
 There seems a marked protrusion of the general light thereabouts which would be
 opposite    to the planets." — August 15, 1885.

 by the eye or with a very low power, this part of the corona appears
to be marked off from the corona beyond.         It possible that a clue
                                                          is
to the real state of things may be found in the photographs of the corona
of 1878.    When these are examined the long equatorial rays seen by
eye, can be traced a     little distance beyond the bright corona, but                  it   is
 found that the corona, as a whole,    is   not drawn out at this part, so as
 to extend to several solar diameters, but that these great extensions
 consist of rays or streamers coming out from the general coronal
 mass, something in the way in which fainter rays often extend from
 the principal tail of a comet.        They may be due to a similar cause,
 namely, the electric repulsion acting upon particles which are more
 completely under its sway, either from their less specific gravity, or
 their more highly electrified condition.         The consideration presents
 itself, whether in this state of things, we have only an extreme case
 of the conditions always present in the corona, which gives rise to the
 appearances which have suggested the distinction of an
                                                                       " inner
 corona   " and an " outer corona."
    There      another question which awaits consideration,
                is                                                    namely,
 whether the corona rotates with the sun. It seems obvious that the                if
 corona     due to a supply of matter and to forces coming from the sun,
           is
 then the coronal structure and the degree of extension, which are pro
 duced by them, at any part of the sun, would continue to be produced
 by these agencies at that part of the sun, and in that sense the corona
would rotate.     In the case of the more distant and diffused parts, the
rotation could scarcely be of one and the same material object, any
more than in the sweep of         a   comet's tail at perihelion, the corona
being constantly renewed and reformed over each part of the solar
surface.    If we suppose the corona to come under the influence of an
external force as that of a planet, then we should expect the ray
drawn out towards          or the rift formed opposite to
                          it,                                  it,
                                                               to continue to
be directed to this external object, and to be independent of the solar
rotation.     The subpermanence of any great coronal form, therefore,
would probably have to be explained by the maintenance for some
time of the conditions upon which the form depends, and not by an
unaltered identity of the coronal matter         ;as in the case of a cloud
over mountain top, or of a flame over the mouth of a volcano.
       a
    We have to consider another question What becomes of the coronal
                                             :
particles  ?  Are they carried away from the sun, as the matter of the
tails of comets     lost to them
                     is           ;  or do they return to the sun         ?
    The results of eye observations, as well as of the taking of photo
graphs with different exposures, have shown that there             great pro
                                                                     is
bability that the corona has not an outer boundary, but that               lost
                                                                              it   is

134                       On the Corona   of   the   Sun.
in an increasing faintness and diffusion.            The absence of a limit is
probably true only of the faint outer parts of the corona. Within,
and especially about the distance from the sun's limb to which the
so-called " inner corona " usually extends, there is evidence of an
apparent arrest of coronal matter, due in part probably to the effects
 of perspective, and within this distance are seen numerous rays which
turn round and descend towards the sun. These returning curved
forms are well shown in Mr. Wesley's drawings of theeclipseof 1871.*
    We are led to the conclusion that many of the coronal particles
return to the snn, but that in the case of other particles which form
the stronger «oronal rays and streamers, there is no return, but that
they leave the sun, and, at the same time, separate more widely from
each other by their mutual repulsion, and become too diffused to be
visible.   The state of extreme attenuation of this diffused coronal
matter — such that the nuclei of comets pass through it without
sensible retardation, enables us to see that the corona may be main
tained at an extremely small expenditure of solar material.               Among
other considerations      it may be mentioned that an electric repulsion
can maintain its sway only so long as the repelled particles remain
in the same electrical state ; if through electric discharges the parti
cles cease to maintain the electric potential they possess, there will
be no longer any force of repulsion acting upon them, and gravity
will be no longer mastered. If when this takes place, the particle
is not moving away with a velocity sufficiently great to carry it
from the sun, the particle will return to the sun. Of course, if the
effect of any electric discharges or other local conditions has been
to change the potential of the particle from positive to negative,
or the reverse, as the case may be, then the repulsion would be
changed into an attraction acting in the same direction as gravity.
    This ceaseless outflow of extremely minute particles, very widely
separated from each other, may possibly throw some light on another
phenomenon which has not yet been satisfactorily explained, namely,
 the zodiacal light.
    The views which     I   have ventured to put forward in this lecture
would lead us to expect that a more extended and more brilliant
corona surrounded the sun in early geological time, and that if the
skies were then of their present degree of clearness, the corona would
probably have been visible about the sun-
    May the corona have been still faintly visible in the earliest ages of
the human race ? Are there any philological traces of it in the
earliest words and ideas connected with the sun ?
    On those eastern plains, where the air is of so great purity, did
early men still see faintly a true vnpr/Xion ?
    Similar considerations point to a slow secular diminution in extension

a
   Results of the Harmonic Analysis of Tidal Observations."
       By A. W. Baird, Major R.E., and G. H. Darwin, F.R.S.,
       Fellow of Trinity College and Plumian Professor in the
       University of Cambridge. Received March 19, 1885.
   The harmonic analysis of continuous tidal records, inaugurated by
a   Committee of the British Association in 1868, has now been
carried out at a considerable number of ports.           Some of the earlier
results were collected together in the Reports to the Association in
1872 and 1876, and in a paper by Sir W. Thomson and Captain Evans,
read before the Association in 1878, but the largest mass of data is
contained in the tide tables now being annually published for the
Indian ports under the authority of Her Majesty's Secretary of State
for India.
   The Report of the last Committee of the British Association, pub
lished in the volume for the meeting at Southport in 1883, is entirely
theoretical, and has been adopted in India as a manual of the method
of harmonic analysis. It is there shown how the results of the analysis
are to be presented in a form appropriate either for theoretical treat
ment or for mechanical prediction by the instrument of the Indian
Government in London. It is also shown how the scattered results,
referred to above, may be reduced to the form which has been
adopted as a standard.    Major Baird has collected the whole of the
Indian results, and those contained in the Reports of 1872 and 1876,
and, by the aid of his staff of computers at Poona, has reduced them
to this standard form. The greater part of the annexed tables is
the result of this work.
   We must refer to the Report to the British Association for 1883 for
an explanation of the method of harmonic analysis, but it will br¦
well to give a few words of explanation.
   Each one of the tides, into which the oscillation       of sea-level is re
garded as analysed, is expressed in the form —
                            fHcos(T+ u— *).
   V+u—K is the argument of the tide, and increases uniformly with
the time, so that this term represents a simple harmonic oscillation of
the sea-level with semi-range f H.

 136            Major A. W. Baird and Prof. G. H. Darwin.
    It is supposed that u stands for the mean value, estimated over the
year or period of observation, of a certain known function of the
longitude of the moon's nodes, or in a few cases of the snn's perigee ;
f stands for a factor of augmentation                  or diminution of the range of
tide due to the variability of the obliquity of the equator to the lunar
orbit, and a mean value for f estimated over the year or period of ob
servation     is adopted.       Tables for computing it and f for each tide are
given in the Report.*
    V is a known linear function of the local mean time, of the mean
longitudes of the sun, of the moon, and of the lunar perigee, and it
increases uniformly with the time ; the rate of its increase, measured
say in degrees per mean solar hour, is called the speed of the tide.
   The numerical operation of harmonic analysis gives us H and K,
which are constants peculiar to the port of observation.                   As the tide
tables are principally for the use of British sailors, H is expressed in
feet and decimals of a foot, and « is an angle less than 360°.                    The
argumen        V+u — K is such that if the equilibrium theory of tides were
true, with a water-covered globe, then K would be zero ; and K divided
by the speed is the time elapsing after any theoretical equilibrium
high- water until the next actual high- water ; we may call K the " lag
                                                                                     "
of th- tide. If the equilibrium theory were true, H would have a
value which may b- computed from the formulae given in the Report.
   If tidal observations were perfectly accurate, and if the tides were
undisturbed by the weather, H and k would be absolute constants for
each tide and for each port, whatever periods are submitted to
analysis ; and in proportion as they are found to be constant so is the
analysis satisfactory.
   A knowledge of H and K is necessary and sufficient to determine
the height of water, as due to the particular tide, at any time, past or
future.
   The lettersf 7,        7,  v   have been appropriated to the earth's angular
velocity of rotation, and to the mean motions of the moon, of the sun,
and of the lunar perigee respectively.                 Hence the rate of increase of
V or the speed of tide, is expressible by these symbols. For practical
convenience an initial has been adopted to indicate each one of the
tides ; and we here reproduce Schedule A of the Report containing
the arbitrarily chosen initial letters, the speed, and a descriptive name
for most of the tides.
   The tides involving 7 in the speed are approximately diurnal, those
containing 2¦y are approximately semi-diurnal, and those containing
37, 47, &c, are approximately ter-diurnal, quater^diurnal, and so on.
Those whose speed does not involve 7 are called tides of long period,
since the quickest of them has a period of a fortnight.

   The operations of the computers give the values of * in degrees and
two places of decimals of a degree, but as the values of K are in no
case so consistent from year to year as to present variations of less
than a degree, the tables have been abridged by the entry merely of
the nearest degree.     The values of K are printed in a different type
                                         °
from those of H, and the degree mark has been omitted.
   In the case of the ports of Toulon and Brest the results in the
Report4 of the Committee of the British Association were given in
centimetres, but they have been reduced to feet for the sake of
uniformity.
   At the head of the table for each port the epoch, or instant. at which
the analysed observations begin is noted ; at every port (excepting

                  Harmonic Analysis        of Tidal     Observations.            139
 Kathiwadar) the epoch is Oh. of (old) astronomical time, or civil
 noon, of the day specified.
    In Table I is given the latitude and longitude of the several ports.
    In Table    II  the values are given of H and K for each year or period
 analysed for the ports specified at the head ; these are the values
 deduced from the results of 1872, 1876, 1878, and from those of the
 Indian Survey.
    The initial of the tide is shown in the margin.
    The last column for each port gives the mean of the values for the
years under observation.           An inspection of the numbers from which
the mean is derived shows the degree of consistency between the num
bers obtained in the several years.             The number of results is hardly
sufficient to make it worth while to deduce a probable error for H
and K ; moreover, it would be a somewhat arduous task to do so.
    Table  III   is a summary of Table II, giving only the mean values,
together with the number of years from which the mean is derived,
and this is of much value for the theoretical discnssion of the tides.
    Table IV gives Mr. Ferrel's results from the R-ports to the United
States Coast Survey.
    The tables give altogether results for 43 ports, and for 137 periods
of observation and analysis.
    *[\Ve have to thank Mr. Edward Roberts, the importance of whose
work in this subject is well known, for having reduced the results
given in the paper of 1878, viz., those for Freemantle, Mauritius, E.
Falkland, Malta, Marseilles, and Toulon.                 In several of these the
heights were stated in centimetres, bnt they are now reduced to feet
and decimals.
    Professor Ferrel has carried out an harmonic analysis at several
ports for the United States Coast Survey. The process adopted by
him does not appear to be identical with the method of the British
Association, and there seemed to be room for doubt as to whether the
results were truly comparable with ours. In answer to an inquiry on
this point, addressed to the United States Coast Survey, Mr. Ferrel
kindly sent a memorandum to the Superintendent, Mr. Hilgard,
which has been forwarded for our information. The memorandum,
dated Washington, April 27th, 1885, runs as follows : —
    " The results of harmonic
                                        analyses of tide observations of the
United States Coast and Geodetic Survey are found in Report of the
British Association for 1872, and the Reports of the Coast and
Geodetic Survey of 1878, App. No. 11; 1882, App. No. 17; 1883,
App. No. 9.         The results for Governor's Island have not yet been
printed.
   * This  paragraph and the corresponding portion of the tables were added nn
May   15, 1885,    subsequently to the presentation of the paper.    These results of
1878 are only given in Table   III, and not also in Table II.

    " Those in the Report of the B.A. are by Sir W. Thomson. In those
of the Coast and Geodetic Survey the A's (amplitude) correspond
with Sir W. Thomson's R's, but the *'s (epochs) differ from his by
90°    in the diurnal components.               These corrections of his epochs       I
                          '                         '
introduced into my Tidal Researches in 1874, p. 44, § 28.*
    " From a reference to Schedule I, Tides of Penobscot Bay, Professor
Darwin with reason concludes that I have not applied this correction
in the diurnal component of the <f-tides. This arises from the omis
sion by oversight of a footnote to Schedule I, aa follows : —
    " ' For X1 read X1—
                            \v in the diurnal component of the K-tide.'
    " The corrections have, in all cases, been applied according to this
note.
    " In my   '
                Tidal Researches
                                      '
                                        of 1874      I  have given formula for the
correction of both the amplitudes and epochs depending upon the
position of the moon's node. These corrections reduce them to what
they would have been if the moon had moved in the ecliptic. By a
reverse method these amplitudes              and epochs can be reduced back to
any year    for    which    practical   application      of the results is required.
 In the discussion of tides in Penobscot Bay I have also given small
tables, Tables      III — VI inclusive, to facilitate these corrections, and
reductions depending upon the lunar Mode.                    The double signs, how
ever, of Tables III, V, and VI, got reversed somehow in copying and
printing ; but the signs have been used correctly in the reductions,
even in those of the Report in which the signs are given erroneously,
which shows that they were at first correct, and that the error was
introduced in copying.
    " These nodal corrections have in all cases been applied to the
results, so that in these corrected results the irregularity of long
period depending upon the moon's node is eliminated, and the ampli
tudes and epochs are the same from, year to year, except so far as
they are affected by small irregularities from abnormal disturbances
not completely eliminated.          An exception to this, however, is the case
of the St. Thomas tides, in which the reductions were not carried so
far, and these small nodal corrections             were not applied to these small
tides.    The amplitudes and epochs                are those simply belonging to
the years of observations.          .    .    .   It is certainly desirable to have
an international uniform notation.
    " should have stated sooner that in Table II, column C, 90" have

   * [Notwithstanding this assurance       I venture to think that Mr. Ferrel must be
mistaken. For example, at Sandy Hook, it looks as though it were certain that
Kj, L, X have been reduced according to one rule, and the test of the semi-diurnal
tides according to another ; for the phases differ by about 180°.        Compare again
O, K„ P with    J and Q at Penobscot Bay.— O. H.            August 12, 1885.]
   [It may be noticed that t of Sj for San Diego differs by 180° in the U.S. reduc
tion from the value in the B.A. reduction.            I have no evidence as to which is
correct.— G. H. D., October, 1885.]

the diurnal component of the K-tides."
   We give below the results above referred to by Mr. Ferrel. We
may remark, however, that the heights have been abridged by the
omission of a place of decimals, and the epochs by the omission of the
decimals of a degree. We have not, however, given quite all the
results of the United States Coast Survey. Mr. Ferrel's treatment of
Mi is not identical with ours, and it is omitted; also there is no
place vacant for some of the smaller overtides in our schedules.     The
reader especially interested in these tides is therefore advised to refer
also to the original sources.   The results for St. Thomas are derived
from a letter dated March 10th, 1885, addressed by Mr. Ferrel to the
superintendent, and kindly communicated to us.
   From the correspondence it appears that the American results
should be comparable with the others, or at least that the difference
should be insignificant. As remarked, however, in a footnote on the
preceding page, this conclusion is open to doubt. We have thought
it best, therefore, to keep these results in a table separate from the
others.]

     OBITUARY          NOTICES OF FELLOWS                 DECEASED.
   Amongst the men who have laboured earnestly and successfully to
place on a sound scientific basis the practice of engineering, the late
accomplished    occupant of the Chair of Engineering at the University
of Edinburgh, Henry Charles Fleemino Jenkin, will hold a dis
tinguished place. Born in Kent on the 25th March, 1833, the only
 son of Captain Charles Jenkin, R.N., he was sent to school in
 Scotland at the early age of seven years, where, under Dr. Burnett, of
Jedburgh, for three years, and after that for three years in the Edin
burgh Academy, the first six years of his school life were spent. In
 1846 he was placed at a school in Frankfort ; in 1847 he was for a
time in Paris ; and, finally, in 1850, he graduated as a Master of Arts
at the University of Genoa.
   He began his training as an engineer in a locomotive workshop at
 Genoa, under Philip Taylor, of Marseilles, where he remained for
about a year. He returned to England in 1851, and served a three
years' apprenticeship in the works of the Fairbairns, of Manchester.
After a varied experience of practical work, Mr. Jenkin, in 1857,
 entered the service of Messrs. Newall, in their submarine cable
factory at Birkenhead, where they were then engaged in the manufac
 ture of a part of the first Atlantic cable, and afterwards of cables for
the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. His energy and talents very
soon obtained for him the position of chief of the engineering and
electrical staff.    In this connexion Jenkin was brought into close
relation with the able engineers and electricians who were then work
ing out to a practical result the great problem of submarine tele
graphy. These circumstances determined the direction in which his
energies   were more especially      to be applied, and he became early
known    as an electrical  engineer of high standing.
   At the beginning        of 185!) he became known to Sir William
Thomson,    and entered into constant      correspondence with him in con
nexion with the testing      of conductivity and insulation of submarine
cables, and the speed of signalling through them.            After Faraday's
discovery    of the  existence  of specif c inductive capacity, and his now
celebrated,   though then ignored, determinations of it for flint glass,
shell-lac, and sulphur, the first correct determination of the specific
inductive capacity of any substance was made by Jenkin by means
of observations arranged for the purpose on some of the submarine
canles in the factory at Birkenhead.
                                                                     b

                                         11
    In  1861  Mr. Jenkin joined Mr. H. C. Ford as partner, and with
him for seven years he carried on an extensive practice in telegraphic
and general engineering.        During the last two years of this partner
ship Jenkin    held  the post of Professor of Engineering at University
College, London, and in 1868 the partnership was dissolved on account
of his appointment to fill the Chair of Engineering in the University
of Edinburgh, which he occupied till his death, teaching with much
success.
    In 1859 he began to write upon scientific subjects, encouraged
to do so, as he has himself remarked, by Sir William Thomson.             His
published papers are     in  all about forty.  in number.   Of these a large
proportion    deal with questions arising from the science and practice
of submarine electrical engineering, and were published within the
ten years 1859 to 1869 — a period of the greatest progress in submarine
telegraphy.
     Professor Fleeming Jenkin took a very important part in the work
of the British Association Committee on Electrical Standards,
appointed on the suggestion of Sir William Thomson at the Man
chester meeting of 1861, for the purpose of promoting the practical
use of Gauss and Weber's system of absolute measurement, by which
lasting benefit has been conferred on electric and magnetic science.
Jenkin was made Secretary of this Committee ; and, in conjunction
with Professor Clerk Maxwell, carried out the most important of the
experiments instituted by the Committee.
     Through having been so intimately concerned in the beginnings of
ocean telegraphy, Jenkin became associated with Sir William Thomson
and Mr. C. F. Varley in the development of the instruments by which
 the transmission of messages over long submarine cables was for the
 first time made practicable.        During later years he and Sir William
 Thomson acted as joint engineers for various cable companies, their
 latest work in that capacity being the Atlantic and other cables of the
 Commercial Cable Company.
     For the last two years he was much occupied with a new mode of
 electric locomotion, a very remarkable invention of his own, to which
  he gave the name of " Telpherage." He persevered with endless
 ingenuity in carrying out the numerous              and difficult mechanical
  arrangements     essential to  the  project, up to the very last days of his
  work in life. He had completed almost every detail of the realisa
 tion of the system which was recently opened for practical working
 at Glynde, in Sussex, four months after his death.
     His book on " Magnetism and Electricity," published as one of
 Longman's elementary series in 1873, marked a new departure in the
 exposition of electricity, as the first text-book containing a systematic
 application of the quantitative methods inaugurated by the British
 Association Committee on Electrical Standards.           In 1883 the seventh

                                       iii
edition was published, after there had already appeared two foreign
editions, one in Italian and the other in German.
    His papers on purely engineering subjects, though not numerous,
are interesting and valuable.       Amongst these may be mentioned the
article " Bridges," written by him for the ninth edition of the " En
cyclopaedia Britannica," and afterwards republished           as a separate
treatise in 1876 ; and a paper " On the Practical Application of
Reciprocal Figures to the Calculation of Strains in Framework," read
before the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and published in the " Trans
          " of that
actions             Society in 1869. But perhaps the most important of all
is his paper " On the Application of Graphic Methods to the Determi
nation of the Efficiency of Machinery," read before the Royal Society
of Edinburgh, and published in the " Transactions," vol. xxviii (1876-
78), for which he was awarded the Keith Gold Medal.              This paper
was a continuation of the subject treated in       " Reulaux's Mechanism,"
and, recognising the value of that work, supplied the elements re
quired to constitute from Reulaux's kinematic system a full machine
receiving energy and doing work.
    Professor Jenkin's activity was not, however, confined to purely
 scientific pursuits.    The very important practical subject of healthy
 houses largely engaged his attention during the last eight or ten years
 of his life, and he succeeded so well in impressing its importance on
 public opinion, that be obtained the establishment in many largo
 towns of Sanitary Protection Associations. He also took great interest
 in technical eduoation, and was always ready in word and deed to
 aid in its promotion.       His literary abilities were of no mean order,
 and as a critic he made several marked successes, among whioh his
 reviews of Darwin's " Origin of Species " and of Munro's " Lucretius "
 (the atomic theory) may be referred to as of high scientific merit.
     He was elected a Fellow of this Society in 1865 ; he was also a
 Vice-President of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, a Member of the
 Institution of Civil Engineers, and of the Institution of Mechanical
 Engineers, and in 1883 he received the honorary degree of LL.D from
 the University of Glasgow.       He died on the 12th of June, 1885, after
 a few days' illness, due to a slight surgical operation.           W. T.
     F. G.   J. Henle.    Of the great anatomists and physiologists whose
 discoveries made the middle of the present century a never-to-be-
 forgotten epoch in the history of biology, one of the greatest died
 on the 13th of last May at Gottingen.            Frederick Gustavus Jacob
  Henle was, in the earlier years of his career, the most distinguished
 of living pathologists, and, indeed, founded the Science of Pathology
  as we now understand it.         The " Manual of Rational Pathology,"
  published in 1846, was the first important work in which the observed
  clinical and anatomical facts of disease were classified and brought

                                      iv
together into a system, based on their physiological relations.' He had
already prepared the way for his reform of Pathology by his larger
work on General Anatomy, in which he, for the first time, distin
guished the tissues which make up the framework of the body from
each other, according to their chemical and anatomical characters,
availing himself, as regards the latter, of the new light which the
discoveries of Schwann had thrown upon the nature of animal and
plant organisation, and of the methods of investigation rendered pos
sible by the sudden advance which had taken place in the construc
tion of the microscope.
    As  a pathologist,   Henle soon relinquished the lead he had at first
taken    to Virchow,     who, by his personal work or by that of his
pupils, has since retained it. As years went on, Henle became more
and more a descriptive anatomist and histologist. The publication of
the greatest work of his incredibly laborious life, the " Handbuch der
 Systematischen Anatomie des Menschen," began in 1855.            In it the
student was furnished with an anatomical description of the human
body, which, at the time, surpassed all others — not even excepting
Dr. Sharpey's edition of Quain's Anatomy — in the quantity of infor
mation, new and old, it contained, in the abundance and excellence of
the illustrations ; and it was not less remarkable for the clearness of
the author's style, and the power which he possessed of so presenting
the forms and anatomical relations of the organs or parts described,
as to leave behind a vivid picture in the imagination of the reader —
for Henle's descriptions are so real and true to nature, that in reading
them one seems to have seen what is described.
    Any one of the three great works which have been mentioned would
 have been sufficient to entitle its author to a permanent position
 among the founders of modern medical science. Taken together they
 afford good ground for assigning to Henle a place scarcely inferior to
 that of his master, Johannes Miiller, or of his contemporary, Theodore
 Schwann.
    Henle begnn his career as an anatomical investigator by spending
 the year which intervened between his examination for the doctorate
 and the taking of his degree in the preparation of his thesis on the
 Anatomy of the Eye, and in other anatomical researches, of which
 the fruits appeared later, and which he undertook, under the direc
 tion and with the co-operation of J. Miiller, who was still at Bonn.
 When Muller, a year later, was called to the University of Berlin,
 Henle became his Prosector. He held this office for six years, during
 which he was associated with Muller in his multifarious professorial
 duties ; these comprising, according to the custom of the time, not
 only the teaching of anatomy and physiology, but also pathology and
 pathological anatomy.        It was for Henle a time of extraordinary
 activity.   During    his tenure of this Prosectorship he published three

                                        V
anatomical    monographs on previously undescribed species of animals
(Narcine, Bronchiobdella, Enchytrceus), one or two contributions to
descriptive human anatomy, and (in addition to the Latin dissertation
already referred to) four of those investigations into the minute struc
ture of the animal body, which afford the best justification for
placing him, as we have done, side by side with Theodore Schwann,
as one of the founders of the Science of Histology — namely, the Essay
on the Structure of the Lacteal System, which served for his " Habi-
li tat ion " Thesis, and three other papers on the Distribution of the
Epithelium in the Human Body, on the Formation of Mucus and Pns,
and on the Structure and Development of Hnman Hair.
    In 1840, when Henle was thirty years old, he received a call to the
Chair of Anatomy at Zurich, where he remained until, in 1844, he
became the colleague of Tiedemann, at Heidelberg.          The year after
                                              "
his Zurich appointment he published his General Anatomy," already
referred to ; and about the same time, in co-operation with Professor
J. Miiller, he published a zoological work on Sharks and Rays, for
which the collection of the British Museum afforded part, at all
events, of the material.
    In Heidelberg, Henle, like Miiller, taught both anatomy and physi
ology, as well as pathology.       Almost immediately after his settlement
in that university, he began with Pfeiffer, who had accompanied him
from Zurich, the " Zeitschrift fur rationelle Medicin," which, after
sharing the first place with " Virchow's Archiv" in medical periodical
literature for a quarter of a century, gave place to the new order in
1872. During the last sixteen years of its existence the Journal was
enriched by the publication in it of Henle's own annual account of
the progress of anatomical and physiological science — a fact which,
irrespectively of its other contents, will give its fifty-four volumes a
permanent place in medical literat ure. As all who were then engaged
in the study of biology know, Henle's " Berichte " had no analogy to
the half reliable and unappreciative abstracts which the enormous
growth of periodical literature have now made a necessary evil. They
consisted rather of records by a master hand of all that was worthy
of being remembered, and critical reviews of all that was worthy of
being discussed in its bearing on the development of the branches of
science to which they related.        So that whoever undertakes the Her
culean task of writing the history of that time of rapid progress in
biology which began about the time of Henle's removal from Berlin to
Zurich, will find the chief events of those thirty years continuously
chronicled (first in
                        " Miiller's Archiv,:' then in " Canstalt's Jahres-
berichte," and finally, as above stated, in the " Zeitschrift ") by one
who himself took a prominent part in them.
    In 1852 Henle was called from Heidelberg to Gottingen, and it was
here that the chief work of his life, the preparation of the Descriptive

                                     VI
Anatomy, was accomplished.        It resembles the contemporary edition
of Quain and Sharpey in including both general and special anatomy,
and in the way in which the illustrations are interwoven with the
text ; but exceeded it in their number and quantity. To the most
difficult part of descriptive anatomy, that which relates to the central
organs of the nervous system and to the viscera, Henle devoted many
years of labour, and produced a result which had never before been
approached.     The magnum opus was brought to a conclusion in 1873,
but inasmuch as by the time the first edition was completed, the third
was already in progress, it continued to the end to be an increasing
occupation, the labour of which was further enhanced by the obliga
tion to which the requirements of medical education forced upon him,
of publishing a text-book and copious atlas for students — a com
pendium of the larger work.
   The " Handbook " did not of course profess to contain a record of
researches.    It was in its end and construction a system. But during
the whole course of its publication, the author was continuously
engaged in the work of investigation. The research on the anatomy
of the kidneys, in connexion with which subject his name is most
familiar to English students of medicine, appeared in 1862 in the
Transactions of the Gottingen Academy ; those on the histology of
the central nervous system in 1867-68.        More recently he published
two important researches on his old subject, the minute anatomy of
the eye (1878 and 1882) ; and finally in November, 1884, his last
anatomical research, " Das Wachsthum des Menschlichen Nagel und
des Pferdehufes."
   To judge of Henle as a pathologist, reference must be made to his
systematic work on that subject already mentioned, the fundamental
idea of which is, that disease consists essentially in the reaction of
the living material against " abnormal external action," and that the
nature of this reaction differs in no respect, excepting the circum
stances under which it is evoked or induced, from those which exhibit
themselves in the healthy body in its relation to its normal environ
ment, so that, as Henle expressed it, " physiology and pathology are
branches of the same science."       The notion expressed in these words,
incontrovertible as it may appear now, was opposed to the teaching
of the time, which in physiology preferred to inquire into the purpose
rather than the cause of vital phenomena, and resented as a desecra
tion every attempt to refer them to chemical or physical actions ; and
in pathology spoke of diseases as if they were mischievous personalities
whose intentions it was the business of the physician to aid the
 " Schu tzender Geist " in discovering and frustrating.       Against all
 such notions Henle made uncompromising war, by showing even
 with the imperfect knowledge and means possessed in 1840, that it
 was possible to discover the causes of many diseases, not in intestine

                                         vii
strivings between rival destructive and preservative tendencies sup
posed to be resident in the body itself, but in the existence in its
environment of elements injurious to its welfare.
    At an earlier period, the absence of physical and chemical know
ledge would have rendered the success of any such attempt impossible.
As it was it was imperfect and was recognised as such by its author ;
but it was so unquestionably the beginning of that rapid development,
by which, under the influence of Virchow and his pupils, what we
now recognise as the science of pathology has come into existence,
that of this science Henle must be regarded as the founder.
    In certain directions, indeed, Henle was in advance of his successors.
If, for example, we take the opening chapter of the " Untersuchungen,"
which deals with tho etiology of contagions diseases, we find in it a
most remarkable anticipation of the discoveries in this field of inquiry
of the last fifteen years. He sets forth in the clearest language that
the material of contagium must necessarily be not only organic but
living and organised, and that it must consist of " parasitical beings
 which are certainly among the lowliest, smallest, but at the same
 time most productive which are known."
    The consideration of the reasoning which led Henle to this con
clusion, affords a striking illustration of the way in which discoveries
 made in other departments of natural science influence medicine.
 Henle's grounds were* (1) the evidence of experiments that contagion
 acts in infinitesimal quantities, and must therefore be self-multiplying;
 (2) the proof then shortly before given by Schwann that the analogous
 processes of fermentation and putrefaction are dependent on minute
 organisms : (3) tho proof recently given by Bassett Audouin that the
 mascardin of silkworms, a disease communicable through the air,
 was due to a contagium vivum; and finally (4), the consideration that
 the development of contagious diseases could be best explained by
 attributing them to a living cause.
     That Henle did not himself follow these indications may probably
 be attributed to his being engrossed by other researches.            It seems at
 first sight difficult to account for the fact that the seed sown by him
 did not fructify in the minds of some of his readers ; for when in
 1868 the investigations of Chauveau again brought the subject of
 contagium vivum to the front, it was approached from an entirely
 different point of view.
     A sketch must be given, in conclusion, of the views which Henle
 entertained and taught as to the psychological side of biology.
 Mention has already been made of his having lectured at Heidelberg
 on anthropology.         These lectures were given to a mixed academical
    * See his " Pathologische Untersuchungen,"     Berlin, 1840, pp. 17 — 20, and
 36 — 41.   The publication of this work was preparatory to that of the " Rationelle
 Palhologie."

                                         Vlll
audience in 1847-52,        and published thirty years afterwards under
the   title of " Anthropologische Vortrage."          That they dealt with
subjects very far apart from what we now understand by anthro
pology may be gathered from the titles — Faith and Materialism ;
Taste and Conscience ; The Physiology of Emotion ; The Will ;
Teleology and Darwinism; Medical and Religious Dualism; &c.
Among the most interesting are the two last enumerated.                    Like
many other biologists of the former generation, Henle, while cordially
accepting the doctrine of descent, strenuously opposed the monistic
view, which in the minds of most persons is associated with                  andit,
which refuses to find anything in the phenomena of life which cannot
be accounted for as resulting from the play of the molecular forces of
the chemical elements which take part in them.               He regarded the
organism, whether plant or animal, not as the inevitable product of
the conditions under which           originated and was developed, but as
                                    it
having independent powers of its own, which the environment is
capable of modifying or even controlling, but not of originating.            The
constancy    as  well as  the variability of  organic  structure,  he  said,  are
alike manifestations of the existence of an agent attached to matter,
but not material, and endowed with the function of " presiding over
the metabolism of the body capable of reproducing the typical form,
and of endless partition without diminution of intensity," in                waya
 which has no counterpart in the inorganic world. It               this infinity
                                                                      is
of the faculty which the organism possesses of " making the material
which composes     it  its own, and impressing upon         its stamp," which
                                                                it
 separates it   from the recognised forces of inorganic nature.           Every
 kind of organism has its " raumliches " as well as its " zeitliches
 ziel,"* which serves as the law of its existence, and the fulfilment of
 which in no way interferes with its taking its legitimate part in the
 order of nature.                                                       B. S.

Dear Sir,
   On the 5th instant    I duly received your note of the 15th July,
enclosing instructions drawn up by the Committee for observing the
solar eclipse which took place here on the 9th.
   The instructions were circulated in all quarters where they were
likely to be of use. You will observe from the enclosures that unfor
tunately both the parties equipped by Government, in their anxiety
to get as near the line of centrality as possible, encountered bad
weather, so that no observations were made which can be considered

to have scientific exactitude.       The eclipse, however, was very dis
                                     I
tinctly seen at Wellington, and have been able, with the assistance
of friends and the accounts in the newspapers, to obtain the following
information concerning it.
   Scarlet prominences were only moderately developed, and were
clustered chiefly at the equatorial and polar regions of the sun.      The
best observers agree that the corona had a very irregular outline, and
was most continuous and vivid close to the sun's limb, having the
longest expansion reaching to nearly two diameters from the western
equatorial region.      This large expansion appears to have had a
strongly marked spirally twisted structure,           while all the other
appendages consisted of radiating pyramids.       No laminated structures
appear to have been observed in any part of the corona.
   Most observers agree in describing an intensely brilliant flash or
meteor, lasting for two seconds, at the commencement of totality on
the eastern side of the sun, and exactly over the position of a large
sun-spot that was just coming into view at a few degrees south of the
sun's equator.     This flash is described as having looked like a large
electric lamp suspended at a little distance from the moon's edge. At
the close of totality another flash, similarly bright, but not so large
and pointed, was seen on the western limb of the sun in a position
corresponding with a large sun-spot that was within 1' of arc of
passing over the sun's edge.
   The following is a list of the enclosures : —
   1. Notification of the Committee's instructions.
   2. Charts of shadow path showing the position of Dreyertown and
Otahao.

   7. Three sketches taken during totality at Wellington by Mr. T.
W. Kirk. These were taken in succession as marked 1, 2, 3, the sun
being intersected by a plumb-line, and disclose the remarkable feature
that the N.W. extension of the corona shifted its position with refe
rence to the prominence.
   8. Generalised sketch from various sources, showing the outline of
the corona, the position and shape of the prominences, and the
positions, marked by red crosses, where vivid flashes of light were
seen at the moment of beginning and end of totality.         All agree that
these flashes were like electric lights, and quite dazzling, the first
being large and round, while the last seen was small and pointed.

     [The publication of a selection of the illustrations is deferred
until some additional drawings or photographs expected from New
 Zealand shall have arrived. Enclosure No. 1, giving an account of a
 lecture delivered by Dr. Hector before the eclipse, is subjoined, with
the omission of a portion at the beginning, the interest of which has
 now passed away.]
                       (Extract from Enclosure No. 1.)
     The chief interest of the eclipse will lie in the observation of the
 scarlet prominences and of the silvery light of the corona or halo that
 surrounds the sun during the period of total darkness.             The pro
 minences may     be expected  to have  great brilliancy, as for some weeks
 past the spots on the sun have shown that its surface is in a state of
 violent activity, and one of such unusual size as to be almost visible
 to the naked eye, will have reached such a position that it will coincide
  with the left hand edge of the sun at the time of the eclipse, and
  from this point unusually large flames should be looked for ; for
  observing these flames it is necessary, in order to intensify their
  light, to use a fragment of rose-tinted glass.      On the other hand, to
  observe the light of the corona to perfection, a very pale blue-tinted
  glass is necessary, so as to cut off the red light and intensify the pale
  silvery light of the corona.     A telescope of high power is quite un
  suitable to the observer, but a wide field opera glass will be useful.
  Instructions have been received from the Committee of the Roval
  Society, which relate partly to the taking of a photographic, spec

trcracopic,  and other observations that require special instruments,
bat the following extracts may be of use to most observers : — Draw
ings of the corona have only seldom proved to be of great utility.       If
such drawings are attempted on the present occasion, observers
ought to pay attention to the general outline of the corona rather
than to points of detail. A plumb line ought to be suspended, if
possible, between the observer and the sun, so as to fix the position of
 the corona in the sky as accurately as possible.       The vertical line
ought to be indicated on the drawing.        Observers will find it useful
 to draw the black disk of the sun and the vertical line before tho
 beginning of totality. . . . Observers unpractised in accurate drawing
 will obtain more useful results by paying attention to certain features
 of the corona than by attempting what can only be a very rough and
 inaccurate sketch of the corona. Definite answers as to the following
 questions, for instance, would be of great value : — (a) To what dis
 tance from the sun, estimated in solar diameters, can you trace the
 corona ?     (b) Does it extend further in some directions than in
 others, and what are the directions of greatest and least extent ?
  (c) Is there a line of approximate symmetry in the corona, and what
 is the direction of that line ?    The answers to the last two questions
 ought, if possible, to be given in angles from the vertical line, or from
 some definite great circle.
 II.   "On the Total Solar Eclipse of September 9, 1885 (in a
        Letter to J. N. Lockyer, F.R.S.)."          By A. S. Atkinson.
        Received November       19, 1885.
     I observed  the eclipse from a spot in my own ground in Nelson,
  which, as determined for the transit of Venus, is in lat. 41° 17' l-9" S.,
 and long. 173° 17' 57 5" E.
     The sky was very clear, and there was no wind, but the air was
  optically very unsteady.
     As totality was approaching, perhaps two or three minutes before,
  I tried with the telescope (5-in. Cooke, power 60) if I could see any
 thing of the corona behind the moon, but could not in the time I
 allowed myself;      I was afraid of waiting longer, as I had made
 arrangements for taking some smal I photographs, and had to super
 intend ; and as I wished also to answer the questions of the Committee
 of the Royal Society,     I thought it best to observe the main phase
 with the naked eye.
     1 may, perhaps, note here, that in finding my way with the telescope-
 to the moon's following limb, I chanced upon Jupiter, the appearance

of    hich surprised me greatly.
     y\                          It was, of course, " boiling " a good
deal, but at the moment                 I
                           caught sight of              it,
                                                  seemed to have one
                                                              it
broad uniform equatorial belt. with at least its northern edge rather
sharply marked in breadth
                        ;       seemed about one-third of the planet's
                                            it
(polar) diameter, and in colour distinctly pink. This belt disappeared
and reappeared with the motion of the air.       shifted my eye in the
                                                       I
telescope, but the breadth     and colour seemed constant on each
reappearance,  so  long  as   looked,   which was not, however, very
                                            I
long.
   As the sun was just disappearing, the most striking phenomenon
I noticed, looking straight at it, was a strongly marked pulsation in
its light those who were looking away from
              ;                                    saw waves of shadow
                                                          it
passing rather rapidly over  the  ground.    This also,     supposed, was
                                                                     I
from the unsteadiness of the air, but to me        seemed not the least
                                                         it
striking part of the great spectacle to see the  sun flickering as   were       it
before    it      went out.
     The following are my answers to the questions of the committee —                :
     a.
      I   estimated the greatest distance from the moon's limb to which
I    could trace the corona as from two-thirds to three-fourths of                       a
diameter.
     b.The corona extended much farther in one direction than in any
other.   By far the greatest feature in the corona was a broad-based
but hollow-sided cone of white light, with well-marked edges, and a
rather sharp point, the axis of which judged to be from 40° to 45"
                                                 I
                                                              "
from the perpendicular towards the west. The "least extent of the
corona, as    saw it, was the same in several places, where there was
                  I
only narrow rim of light round the moon's limb. There were other
          a
smaller but more or less similar prominences of pure white light, all
of which,     may say, gave me the idea of radiating from the sun's
               I
centre.
   c. There was, in my opinion, no line of
                                            " approximate symmetry "
in the corona.     looked right round iho sun with a view to answer
                       I
this question, and that was the conclusion     came to without hesita
                                                       I
tion.         As there was nothing to balance the large " cone," the nearest
approach to symmetry would have been obtained by taking its axis
           but
as the line,     should not have called the result of this division
                       I
" approximately symmetrical."
   The only red prominences    saw were a row of six or seven small
                                            I
ones (Bailey's beads    extending from about the vertex towards the
                                   ?)
east.  Large ones were seen by others, and   believe are those which
                                                       I
alone appear in the photographs.
   Mr. J. R. Akersten obtained for me two photographs during totality,
one immediately after     began with an exposnre of probably a little
                                   it
less than a second            ;   the other a few seconds later, with about double
the exposure.               A     third plate was all but ready when the sun

reappeared ; it was taken just afterwards,       but still shows some of the
" red flames."
   I took the duration of totality with a stop-watch, but afterwards by
a momentary inadvertence lost the record.
   I  may add that at a time which         I  estimated to be from 15 to
20 seconds after the sun's reappearance,        I could with the naked eye
easily see the coronal light   round  the preceding limb of the moon, and
called the attention of the bystanders to the fact.
   In  conclusion  I would   add as some evidence of the clear sky which
we commonly get in Nelson, that from ray own knowledge not only
the whole of this eclipse, but egress in both the late transits of
Venus, could not have      been better seen than from      this place.

III. "Report      on a Series of Specimens of the Deposits of the
      Nile Delta, obtained by the recent Boring Operations." By
      J. W. Judd, F.R.S., Sec. G.S., Professor of Geology in the
      Normal School of Science and Royal School of Mines.
      Comnranicated by desire of the Delta Committee. Received
      November       12, 1885.
   Neither of the borings made for the Royal Society, under the
superintendence of the Engineers attached to the Army of Occupation
in Egypt, appears to have reached the rocky floor of the Nile- Valley,
nor do the samples examined show any indication of an approach to
such floor.    What were at first supposed to be pebbles in one of the
samples from Tantah, prove on examination to be calcareous con
                   "     "
cretions (" race or kunkur ").
   Nevertheless these borings appear to have reached a greater depth
than all previous ones in the same district, except the boring made
near the Barrage, which is said to have attained a depth of 122 feet
without reaching the rock, and one at Rosetta which exceeded
153 feet. The deepest boring made by the French engineers in 1799,
that at Sint, attained a depth of 77 feet 7£ inches ; at a later date
M. Linant de Bellefonds (Linant Boy) carried a boring near the apex
of the Delta to the depth of 72 feet.        In the case of the excavations
made for Mr. Horner about thirty years ago, with the aid of a grant
from the Donation Fund of the Royal Society, few of the borings
exceeded 50 feet in depth ; the deepest being that at Memphis, which
reached 59 feet 10 inches.        The three borings now reported upon
have been carried to depths of 45, 73, and 84 feet respectively.
   The samples from these borings,                like those examined by
Mr. Horner, show that the delta-deposits all consist of admixtures, in

that the deposits of the Nile Valley consist of a succession of different
beds in some of which sand, and in others mud, forms the predominant
constituent.*
   The chemical composition of the Nile-mud has been investigated by
many chemists — by Regnault in 1812, by Lassaigne in 1844, by
Lajouchere in 1850, by Payen and Foinset in 1850, and by Houzeau
in 1869. At the request of Mr. Horner, Messrs. Johnson and Brazier
undertook a series of careful analyses of the muds and the sands of
the Nile- Valley deposits in Dr. Hofmann's laboratory, and the results
which they obtained are published in the " Philosophical Trans
actions," vol. 145 (1855).
   But hitherto, so far as I am aware, no detailed investigation of the
microscopical    characters of the deposits has been undertaken, and to
this investigation    Ihave therefore devoted my special attention. The
methods of examination    were determined upon after consultation with
Professor T. G. Bonmey, F.R.S., P.G.S., to whose advice and assis
tance  I  am greatly indebted ; the preparations were made in the
Geological Laboratory of the Normal School of Science and Royal
School of Mines.     The general results attained by this study of the
Nile- Valley deposits are as follows.
   The sands, when separated from the mud by washing, are found to
be made up of two kinds of grains, the larger being perfectly rounded
and polished, while the smaller, on the contrary, are often sutbangular
or angular.
  The larger and well-rounded grains may be described as micro
scopic pebbles ; their surfaces are most exquisitely smoothed and
polished, and their forms are either globular or ellipsoidal. In size
they vary greatly, being occasionally as large as a small pea. They
only very occasionally exhibit traces of deposits of iron-oxides upon
their surfaces. The great majority of the well-rounded grains consist
of quartzose materials.
  * [the   deep boring at Rosetta, of which an account has recently been sent to the
Royal Society by Colonel Maitland, R.E., shows that alluvial mud and clay occurred
to the depth of 33 feet ; thence to the depth of 94 feet various sands and clays
are recorded; from 94 feet to 123 feet "hard clay in lumps" was found; theu
various sands and clays to 143 feet ; the last 10 feet of the boring was in coarse
sand and pebbles.   A fragment of red granite, with undoubted marks of human
                     it,
workmanship upon     is said to have been obtained at a depth of 79 feet4 inches.—

    Embedding these grains in Canada-balsam, and examining them
by transmitted light, with the aid of the polariscope, we are enabled
to study their mineral characters with facility. The majority of the
grains consist of colourless quartz, though occasionally rose-quartz,
amethystine quartz, citrine, and smoky quartz also occur.                       This
qnartz exhibits unmistakable evidence of having been derived from
granitic rocks ; it is constantly seen to be traversed by bands of
liquid- and gas-cavities, and very frequently contains numerous black,
hair-like inclusions (rutile ?). Much more rarely we detect grains of
qnartz which consist of aggregates of small crystals, and are evidently
derived from metamorphic rocks. With the pure quartz-grains we find
also a considerable number of rounded particles of red and brown jasper
and of black Lydian stone, with some fragments of silicified wood.
    But in addition to the different varieties of quartz, particles of
felspar are sometimes found among these large, rounded grains.
What is very remarkable about these felspar-grains is the slight
traces of kaolinization which they exhibit ; they are in fact almost as
fresh and unaltered as the grains of quartz themselves.                    Ordinary
orthoclase and microcline are most frequent, while plagioclase felspar
is comparatively rare.            With the rounded grains of quartz and
felspar, a few examples of hornblende and other minerals, including
jade, also occur.
    But far greater is the number of mineral species, especially the
most easily cleavable ones, which are represented in the smaller, sub-
angular and angular, sand-grains. In addition to the minerals already
mentioned,       I   have   recognised several varieties of mica, augite,
enstatite ?, tourmaline, sphene, iolite (cordierite) zircon, fluorspar,
and magnetite, all in a nearly unaltered condition.
    The only fossils found in these sands were evidently derived ones ;
they include the fragments of silicified wood already mentioned, and
a waterworn nucleus of an Ammonites (Jurassic?). It is evident that
these sand-grains have been formed by the breaking up of granitic
and metamorphic rocks, or of older sandstones derived directly from
such rocks.         The larger grains exhibit the perfect rounding and
polishing     now     recognised as characteristic of ^Eolian action ;* the
smaller ones from their larger surfaces in proportion to their weight
have undergone far less attrition in their passage through the air ; but
it is fair to conclude that the sands are really " desert-sand," derived
from the vast tracts which lie on either side of the Nile-Valley, and
swept into it by the action of the wind.
   • It is hardly necessary to point out that the study of these desert-fands entirely
supports the important conclusions arrived at by Mr. H. C. Sorby, F.R.S., and
Mr.  J. A. Phillips, F.R.S., concerning the agencies by which the rounding of sand-

    The mud is a material of which it is much more difficult to study
the mineral characters than the sand, owing to the extreme minute
ness of its particles.     It is a very striking fact, however, that kaolin,
which constitutes the predominant constituent of clays, appears to
be almost altogether absent from these Nile-muds.           Chips and flakes
of quartz, felspar,  mica,   hornblende,   and other  minerals  can be readily
recognised ; and it is often evident that the unaltered particles of such
minerals make up the greater part, if not the whole mass, of the fine
grained deposits.      The mineral particles are of course mingled with
a larger or smaller proportion of organic particles.             Frustules of
Diatomaceoe occur      in these muds,    as  was pointed out by Ehrenberg,
but unless special precautions were observed in collecting the samples
it would be unsafe to draw any deductions from their presence.
    In the case of the Tantah boring we find another kind of material
besides the sand and mud.         Almost all the samples from this boring
contain angular fragments of an apparently tufaceous limestone.             In
addition to this we find minute sand-grains cemented by calcareous
matter into small pellets of various sizes, and the particles of mnd
united in the same way are thus converted into argillo-calcareons
concretions.     In a sample taken from a depth of 70 feet in the Tantah
boring, a number of irregular masses of this argillaceous limestoue
occurred ; some of these were nearly 1 inch in diameter, and were at
 first supposed to be pebbles. On examination they were found to
 contain  —
                 Calcic carbonate                          77-3
                 Argillaceous matter                       22'7
                                                          100-0
 There can be no doubt that sources of this calcic carbonate must
 exist near Tantah, probably in the form of calcareous springs.
     The striking peculiarities of these sands and muds of the Nile Valley
 appear to be capable of a simple explanation.        In countries where rain
 falls frequently and vegetation abounds, water charged with carbonic
 acid is constantly penetrating into the rocks and breaking up the
 compound silicates of which they are composed ; the silicates of the
 alkalies and the alkaline earths being decomposed and their con
 stituents removed in solution, while the silicate of alumina becomes
  hydrated and is carried away in suspension by water in the form
  of kaolin. In this way the felspars and nearly all other compound
  silicates are affected to such an extent that in most granitic and
  metamorphic rocks they show evidence of extensive "kaolinization,"
  while the clays derived from them are made up for the most part
  of the crystalline plates of kaolin. But in dry and barren tracts, like
  portions of Northern Africa, none of these agencies will operate, and the

1885.]           Report  on the Deposits  of  the Nile Delta.          217
disintegration of the solid rocks is effected by mechanical means ;
the most potent of these mechanical agents of disintegration are the
heat of the snn, causing the unequal expansion of the minerals which
build up the rocks, the force of the wind, producing constant
attrition of the disjoined particles, and torrential rains.
   This being the case, it will be readily understood that the sand-
grains will include felspar and other minerals in a nearly unaltered
condition, while in countries where the chemical agents of the atmo
sphere come into play such particles would be more or less com
pletely converted into kaolin. In the same way, the mud, instead
of consisting of scales of kaolin originating from chemical action, will
be formed of particles of the chemically unaltered minerals reduced to
the finest dust by purely mechanical agencies.
   The chemical analyses which have been made of these Nile-muds
tend to support these conclusions.          Instead of containing large
quantities of combined water, as do all the ordinary clays, then-
composition is that of a mixture of anhydrous minerals.            As the
analyses hitherto made have none of them been undertaken with the
object of estimating the exact proportions of hygroscopic and com
bined water in these muds, it would be well if some more careful
determi nation of these two constituents could be made.
   But there is fortunately a kind of evidence, derived from chemical
 analysis, which is of the greatest value from its bearing on the
questions we are now discussing — that, namely, which is obtained from
a study of the composition of the Nile-waters.
   It must be remembered that the Nile is a river of a very peculiar
and exceptional character.      The last tributary which it receives is the
 Atbara, which falls into it in lat. 17° 38' N. ; from that point to its
mouth, in 31° 25' N. lat., the river does not receive a single affluent ;
for a distance of 1400 miles, indeed, it obtains no fresh supply of water
except what is brought to it by superficial torrents after heavy rains
in Lower Egypt.         It has been clearly demonstrated that, after
receiving   the  Athara, the Nile undergoes a continual diminution in
volume in its conrse through Egypt.        This is no doubt in part due to
percolation   of the water  through  the delta-deposits, and in part to the
water being drawn off in canals for purposes of irrigation ; but a large
part of this diminution in volume must certainly be ascribed to the
great evaporation which must be going on from the surface of the
river during the last 1400 miles of its course.
   The diminution which takes place in the volume of the Nile in its
downward course is illustrated by the following estimates : —
   The French engineers in 1799 showed that at Siut, 240 miles above
Cairo, the quantity of water passing down the river per second
amounted     to 678 cubic metres at low water, and 10,247 cubic metres
during high water.

218                                 Prof.   J.   W. Judd.                    [Nov. 19,
    But at Cairo, according to M. Linant de Bellefonds (Linant Bey),
the flow per second amounts only to 414 cubic metres at low water,
and 9440 cubic metres at high water.
    If these numbers can be relied upon, the Nile in this part of its
course loses nearly 40 per cent. of its water in a distance of 240 miles
when it is low, and nearly 8 per cent. when it is in flood !
    M. Talabot has calculated that only 90,000 millions of cubic metres
of water are discharged per annum from the principal mouth of the
Nile, which gives an average discharge of 2(580 cubic metres per
second ; while M. Girard estimates that only a comparatively small
quantity escapes by the Rosetta and Damietta mouths.
    Although we shall not be able to calculate the exact loss of the
Nile by evaporation in the course of 1400 miles, through one of the
hottest and driest regions of the globe, yet we cannot doubt that this
loss is enormous.          Now the effect of this constant evaporation must
 be to concentrate the saline matters held in solution, and we might
 therefore anticipate that the waters of the Nile in Lower Egypt would
 contain an exceptionally high percentage of saline matters in solu
 tion.
    But what are the actual facts of the case P
    Dr. C. Meymott Tidy has recently made a series of analyses of the
 Nile-water taken at Cairo during each month of the year, and
 the results which he has obtained are of the greatest interest to
 geologists.       These analyses enable us to make the following com
 parisons,     which    we have arranged in tabular form* : — ¦

    The examination of this table shows that the waters of the Nile,
judged either by the proportion of solids in solution, the percentage
of lime, or by the temporary and permanent hardness, exhibits some
very remarkable anomalies.       That the variation in the quantities of
dissolved salts at different seasons of the year should be much greater
 than in the case of any of the other rivers, is not surprising when we
 bear in mind the great and rapid additions to the volume of the
 river during seasons of flood. But it is startling to find that the
 water of the Nile, instead of containing a much larger proportion of
 saline matter than other rivers — as we might anticipate from the
 enormous evaporation constantly going on from its surface — in reality
 contains far less dissolved matter than any of the other rivers here
 compared with it. This contrast is scarcely lesa striking in the case
 of the comparison with the Severn and the Shannon, which flow over
 Palaeozoic rocks, than in that of the Thames and the Lea, which
 drain areas occupied by Mesozoic deposits.
     A little consideration will show, however, that this startling and
 seemingly anomalous result is capable of a very simple explanation.
 The substances dissolved in the water of rivers is of course derived
 from the materials composing the rocks of the river-basin, through
 the action of water holding carbonic acid or other acids in solution.
 In this kind of action, rain which takes up the gases contained in the
 atmosphere, and then percolates into the interstices of rocks, plays a
  most important part.     Bain is, in fact, the great agent of chemical
  disintegration, and where rain falls the complex silicates composing the
  hardest rocks are attacked, the silicates of potash, soda, lime, magnesia,
  and iron being broken up and carried away in solution, while the
  silicate of alnmina takes its hydrated form of kaolin, and remains
  behind or is removed in suspension.
      But in districts where there is little or no vegetation and the
  rainfall is sudden and torrential, this chemical disintegration, as has
  been already pointed ont, is replaced by totally different kinds of
  action. Under the influence of variations of temperature, having
  an enormous range, the rocks made up of crystals having different
  coefficients of expansion, in different minerals and indeed in different
  directions in the same crystal, undergo mechanical disintegration, and
  the fragments thus formed are driven backwards and forwards by
   wind, being thereby subjected to constant attrition.        Of this latter
   kind of action, as   we have seen,  all the  larger particles in the Nile
   Delta deposits exhibit the most unmistakable evidence.
      Hence we are led by an examination of the composition of the
   Nile-water to the same conclusion as was reached by the study of
   microscopical characters of the muds and sands of the delta, that
   while in the rainy districts of the temperate zones, the disintegration
   of rocks is mainly effected by chemical agencies, in the desert areas

220                          Prof.  J.  W. Judd                 [Nov. 19,
of the tropica      the  same work     is almost  exclusively effected  by
mechanical forces.
   The products of these two kinds of action are, however, essentially
different.    In the former case we have produced crystals of kaolin,
which form the basis of all the true clays, a large quantity of lime-,
magnesia-, iron-, soda-, and potash-salts with silica passing into solu
tion ; while, in the latter case, the several minerals of the rock are
simply reduced to fragments of varying size and form.
   All  the observations   described   in the present report are in entire
harmony with this explanation. The comparatively unaltered con
dition of the felspars and other complex silicates in the sands ; the
absence of kaolin from the muds, and the presence of the chips and
flakes of the unattacked minerals in the muds, and finally the small
quantity of dissolved matter in the Nile- water, in spite of the enormous
concentration     it must have undergone by evaporation — all point to
this same conclusion.
   In the estimates • which have been made of the rate of sabaerial
denudation in different parts of the globe, it has usually been assumed
that this action is similar to what is seen taking place in Europe and
in North America. But the observations detailed in this report prove
that in tropical districts, where little or no vegetation exists, and the
rainfall is sudden and torrential, the disintegration of rocks, though
not, perhaps, less rapid than in temperate climes, is different alike in
its origin and in its products.
    It has often been pointed out by chemical geologists, that metamor-
phic action could not have produced many of the schists and gneisses
from sedimentary rocks, for the former are rich in potash, soda, and
other materials which have been dissolved out from the latter during
the disintegration of the rock-masses from which they were derived.
The recognition of a kind of action whereby great masses of sedi
mentary materials can be produced, rich in those substances which
are usually removed in a state of solution, is not destitute of interest
at the present time, when the question of the origin of the crystalline
schists and gneisses is one that presses for solution.

      College, Bristol.       Communicated      by Professor STOKES,
       Sec. R.S. Received August 4, 1885.
                                 (Abstract.)
   The authors describe experiments made with the object of ascer
taining whether the coincidence of the curves which represent the
vapour-pressures of stable solid and liquid substances at different
temperatures, with those indicating the maximum temperatures
attainable by the same 'ubstances at different           pressures, when
evaporating with a free surface, holds good also for bodies which
dissociate in their passage to the gaseous state.          The substances
examined were chloral hydrate, chloral methyl, and ethyl alcoholates,
butyl chloral hydrate, ammonium carbonate, ammonium chloride,
aldehyde ammonia, phthalic acid, succinic acid, nitric peroxide, and
acetic acid.
   These substances     fall into two classes, the first including bodies
giving coincident curves, viz., nitric peroxide, ammonium chloride,
and acetic acid, the second containing the remaining substances,
which do not show such coincidence.        Comparing the members of the
second class with each other as regards temperatures of volatilisation,
it is found that in those cases in which dissociation is complete, or
nearly so, the temperatures of volatilisation are independent of pres
sure and do not form a curve.      When dissociation is less complete, as
with succinic and phthalic acids, a rudimentary curve is observable,
and with aldehyde ammonia, which is much more stable, the tempera
tures of volatilisation form a regular curve resembling a vapour-
pressure curve.
   All those substances, however, give curves representing pressures
of dissociation, generally similar in form to vapour-pressure curves,
and a comparison of these curves with those representing tempera
tures of volatilisation would indicate that the smaller the amount of
dissociation the nearer the ourves approach each other both in form
and position.
   It is notioeable that in the formation of bodies of the second class
a molecule of water or ammonia is invariably broken down, whereas
with nitric peroxide and acetic acid direct union of like molecules
takes place, and there is no sueh rupture as in the previous cases.
As ammonium chloride resembles these substances in the likeness of
their behaviour to that of stable solids and liquids, it may perhaps be

conjectured that the molecule of hydrogen chloride is not broken
down in its union with ammonia to form ammonium chloride.          Should
this conjecture not be accepted as correct, it will be necessary to seek
for an explanation of the phenomena observed by some relations yet
to be discovered.

      Communicated by Professor M. FOSTEr,              Sec. R.S.      Re
      ceived September 5, 1885.
                       (Preliminary Communication.)
   Metlwd of Research. — Pieces of unstimulated leaves, and of leaves
stimulated for periods varying from 5 minutes to 72 hours, were
examined fresh, or after treatment with alcohol, picric acid, chromic
acid, or osmic acid.      The most satisfactory results were obtained
from specimens    treated  for 12 hours with 1 and 2 per cent. chromic
acid ; such strengths dissolving the tannin precipitate first formed,
and fixing the structures most successfully.       The leaves were fed
principally upon small flies or pieces of frog muscle, since these were
found to succeed best. Heat stimuli, electrical stimuli, and stimulus
produced by contact or cutting were also employed.
   General Histology. — As regards the general histology of the ten
tacles, one may notice that the gland-cells of the head are provided
with delicate uncuticularised cell- walla, which are remarkably pitted
on their upper or free surfaces ; that the rest of the epidermal cells
of the tentacles have .their exterior walls excessively cuticularised and
resistant, and that their radial longitudinal walls are freely pitted.
   Structure of the Resting Gland-Cells.— In the typical resting gland-
cell, the protoplasm is arranged in a network or reticulum. The
meshes of this reticulum are excessively close around the nucleus,
which is situated at the base .of the cell, but towards the free surface
they are much more open; the close and more open arrangement
merging the one into the other. The meshwork extends through the
whole of the cell cavity, and the interstices between the meshes are
occupied by the pink cell sap ; the whole being bounded by the
ectoplasm.     The gland-cells at the base of the head differ somewhat
in structure from the more apical cells, as also do all the cells of the
Hhort stalked tentacles which are situated at the centre of the leaf.
In neither of the three layers of cells covering the tracheidal cells of
the head could any obvious movement of the protoplasm be detected.

 230             Mr. W. Gardiner.        On the Gland-Cells        [Nov. 19,
     The epidermal cells of the stalk of the tentacles possess in the
 resting condition the following structure. In each cell there is a
  lenticular nucleus, and chlorophyll grains are present on the side of
  the wall next the vascular bundle. These structures are situated in the
 ectoplasm, and take no part in the movement of rotation. In addi
  tion to these a body, which is usually spindle-shaped or acicular, is
  present in the cell, and generally occupies such a position that it
 stretches diagonally across the cell from: end' to end, the two ex
 tremities being embedded in the cell protoplasm.           1 shall speak of
  this body at present as the plastoid, ow account of certain resem
  blances it bears as regards its microchemical reactions- to plastids.
  This name may possibly, however, not be retained. The plastoid is
 fixed to some extent by absolute alcohol or chromic acid. With dilute
 alcohol it swells up and disappears.         With iodine it becomes dis
 organised and spherical. It is best fixed by watery picric acid, and
 stains very readily and at once with Hofmann's blue. In the resting
 stage the plastoid takes no part in the movements of the rotating
 endoplasm.     It is present in all the epidermal cells of the leaf except
 the gland-cells and the cell- immediately beneath the same, and in the
 bending portionof those tentacles which execute movements, it is very
 large in the cells of the convex, and very small or even apparently absent
 in those of the concave side. Ia Dionaea it also occurs, being large
 in the cells of the upper surface of the leaf, and very small in those of
 the under.    The cells themselves of the under surface in Dionsaa and
 of the concave side in Dtosera are also smaller than the others of the
 opposite side.     The protoplasm of the tentacle cells is very clear
 and hyaline,. and the whole protoplasmic utricle is thin and closely
 pressed against the cell-wall.
     Changes in the Gland-Cells during Secretion. — The cells may be made
 to secrete by the combined stimulus of heat and moisture, by direct
 contact, or by electrical stimulus, but especially by the stimulus of
 food applied to the gland.
     The histological changes which occur are the following.            After
 some time (24 hours) a gland mounted in water exhibits a mottled
 appearance, such mottling being caused by a vacuolation of the most
 peripheral portions of the protoplasm of tbe gland-cells.         In section
 such a cell shows, that   in the course of secretion there has been  a using
up of the cell contents, and instead of the meshwork occupying the
 whole of the peripheral portion of the cell, so as tO'giwe a fairly homo
geneous appearance, large spherical cavities • ha-ve appeared in the
reticulum here and there : such cavities being occupied by the cell sap.
The sap has, moreover, assumed a much darker pink tint. Thus a
breaking down or destruction of some part of the reticulum has taken
place.    After some 72 hours' stimulation this breaking down of the
reticulum has reached to such an extent that in the peripheral portion

 before   referred to, all the central core of the meshwork has for the
 most part disappeared, and replacing it is a single large vacuole filled
 with cell sap. The ectoplasm has moreover contracted from the upper
 or free surface of the cell-wall. In no case does this destruction
 and consequent vacnolation         extend to the base of the gland-cells
 where the nucleus is situated.         The nucleus is always surrounded
 by dense protoplasm ; and there are grounds for believing that
 after very long stimulation, when all the secretion has been poured
 out, and before absorption begins,, an active growth of protoplasm
 takes    place   around     the nucleus and in the more basul portion
 of the cell.     In   certain oases the secretion can be seen under the
 microscope     to escape in drops — apparently through the pitted
 portions of the cell- wall — and the drops rapidly taking up water
 and being forced outwards, assume a rod-like form, and present a
 halo-like   appearance around the gland.         This also occurs in the
 mucilage-secreting      cells of the bladders of Utricularia.    The exact
 part taken by the layer of cells beneath the gland-cells has yet to
 be determined.        After stimulation their vacuoles are occupied by
 large drops   of  cell sap, which is of a purple or. evan black colour.
    The view here taken (which is supported by certain of the staining
 reactions) with regard to secretion is, that in. the gland-cells the
 mere peripheral network. consists of protoplasm, together with some
 formed substance derived from it, and that the outpouring of the
 secretion is caused by the repeated breaking down (owing to stimula
 tion) of the protoplasm into this formed substance, which is of a
 mucous nature, and which rapidly attracts water and so escapes, as
 the secretion to the external surface.
    Changes in the Stalk Cells. — The chief phenomena induced in the
 stalk cells either by contact by electrical stimulus or by feeding are,
 that the protoplasmic utricle swells up and encroaches on its own
 vacuole, that granules rapidly appear in the protoplasm, and that the
 movements of rotation increase in vigour.. Also the cell becomes less
 turgid, and after long stimulation the plastoid and the nucleus both
 tend   to become spherical.       These changes are most markedly exhi
 bited in tentacles stimulated with food.. The protoplasm in swelling
 up abstracts water from its own vacuole, and in so doing leaves the
 tannin in the sap, in a comparatively concentrated condition.           The
 ontlines of the protoplasmic utricle are now rendered clearer than
 before.    As previously stated, the movements of rotation become
quickened very considerably, and numerous waves with high crests
appear on the surface of the protoplasmic utricle, and are well
registered by the corresponding disturbances in the cell sap. The
phenomenon of the protoplasmic waves breaking over the nucleus with
crests reaching nearly across the vacuole is very remarkable.            The
long and narrow shape of the cells, and the combined swelling of the

 232             Mr. W. Gardiner.      On the Gland- Cells       [Nov. 19,
 protoplasm, increase of rate of rotation     and wave movements, cause
 the cell sap to be so disturbed, and as it  were churned up, that drops
 of the sap become cut off from the main       mass, and at last the whole
 of the sap is separated into numerous        distinct portions which are
 suspended in the protoplasm     as oily drops, and are carried round in
 the currents, presenting the appearance of moving droplets, pear-
 shaped bodies, and long string-like processes. The cell in this con
 dition was known to Darwin as " aggregated."            When movement
 ceases, as often naturally occurs, owing to excessive secretion, or can
 be induced by suddenly crushing the tentacle head, the variously
 shaped masses become spherical, and lie quiescent in the protoplasm.
 The aggregation produced by the action of ammonic carbonate is
 somewhat different from that brought about by feeding, and may be
 spoken of as passive as opposed to active aggregation.        In this case
 the protoplasm abstracts water from the vacuole in the usual way,
and, steadily swelling, chops up the tannin-loaded sap of the long and
narrow cells into separate globules. The rotatory movements cause
these globules to alter their form, but the movements in question are
 nothing like so vigorous as in the food-stimulated gland, and the
globules are rarely, if ever, carried bodily about.
    When the protoplasm swells and the cell becomes aggregated, the
latter always loses its turgidity, and the state of aggregation is
accompanied by a loss of water.        Injection of water into the tissue
will at once stop aggregation and restore the cell to its normal condi
tion.    Sometimes after active secretion (48 hours), the movements of
the protoplasm of the topmost tentacle stalk cells will stop, and much
of the protoplasm of each cell now collects to the end of the cell
nearest the gland.     Mounting in water will then restore the move
 ments.    It was found experimentally that the collecting of the proto
plasm to one end was occasioned by the upward passage of water to
the gland.     If a passage of water be set up in an opposite direction,
then the protoplasm collects to the opposite end.
   When the more rapid movements of the protoplasm commence
owing to stimulation, the plastoid usually becomes bent, and then
either contracts and assumes a lenticular form, or becomes separated
into two or more pieces each of which becomes lenticular. Later on
f urthor contraction ensues, and the plastoid is carried round the cell
in the protoplasmic stream. The more the cells lose their turgidity,
the more does the plastoid tend to assume a spherical form. Its
spindle-shaped elongated form may, however, be restored by again
bringing about turgidity, e.g., by injection of water into tho tissue.
Thus the plastoid may be regarded as a turgometer, since it indicates
the state of turgidity of the cell.  On account of certain experiments
and observations the author is led to believe that all differences of
turgidity in cells are brought about by the protoplasm swelling and

 1885.]          in the Tentacles  of Drosera dichotoma.               233
 becoming    porous, and that the method of establishing a loss of
 tnrgidity by solntions of neutral salts and the like involves a state of
 things essentially different from that which normally occurs.          In
 the one case the protoplasm itself undergoes change.        In the other
 the   cell sap is violently abstracted by artificial means from the
 vacuole   of a protoplasmic utricle which is endeavouring to protect
 itself from the action of the reagent.
    Movements of the tentacles may be brought about by direct contact
 and by cutting or injury, by electric stimulus, by the addition or
 withdrawal of water, and especially by the stimulns of food. In
 all these cases the stimulant upsets the existing equilibrium and
 brings about a difference of tnrgidity on the two opposite sides. Loss
 of water by plasmolysis usually induces movement, unless the salts
 employed     have a specific action    upon the protoplasm.    Movement
 may occur without aggregation,         and secretion may occur without
 movement, bnt whenever well-defined aggregation takes place, move
 ment always follows. Different strengths of the same reagent may
 bring about different reactions.        Thus a O-l per cent, solution of
 chromic acid causes both movement and secretion, while with a
  I or 2 per cent. solution neither phenomenon occurs. Among the
 curious effects of various salt solutions that of ammonic chloride may be
 noted, in that it acts markedly as a sedative, toning down aggregation
 and restoring tnrgidity.     It was very generally noticed that the ten
 tacles before becoming inflected, moved downwards and backwards,
 and that the upward and inflected movement subsequently took place.
 When a tentacle has become well inflected it can be observed that at
 the bending point the cells of the oonvex side are very turgid, with their
 plastoids spindle shaped, and that little or no aggregation has taken
 place, while in the cells of the concave side, on the other hand, there is
 well-marked aggregation and loss of turgidity ; the aggregation after a
 time extends to the convex side, the cells of which, in their turn, lose
their turgidity, and at this stage all the cells are flaccid.     Later on
the cells of the concave side first regain their turgidity, and now the
tentacle is bent back to its original position before stimulation.   From
certain observations on Dionaea and Mimosa, the author is led to
 believe that there also movement is made possible by the establishing
of sudden and different conditions of turgidity of different cells, such
differences being occasioned by the induced porosity of the protoplasm
of certain of these cells. These phenomena occur perhaps in all cases
of movement.
    The plastoid markedly decreases in size after long stimulation
in both Dionaea and Drosera.        There are therefore some grounds for
believing that it consists mainly of some reserve material or some
substance which is used up during secretion.         Whether the crystal
loids in the nucleus of Pinguicula serve a similar purpose remains to

be seen,  for at any rate a plastoid is not present. A somewhat casual
examination was also made of many organs of movement, but in them
no plastoid was observed.       In Drosera rotundifolia and other species
plastoids occur which resemble those of Drosera dichotoma.                   Strong
single induction shocks or tetanising currents cause the plastoid to
assume the spherical condition, or very frequently to break up into a
string of small spheres. A sudden blow on the cover slip also causes
the assumption of the spherical fonm. Moderately strong tetanising
shocks cause swelling of the protoplasm, and increase of rapidity of
movement and granularity.         Very strong shocks may cause the con
traction of the primordial utricle from the cell- wall, at certain small
areas, but immediate death. always ensues, since the stimulus required
is abnormally great.     The normal effect of a. regulated stimulus is to
induce a swelling of the protoplasm and a loss of tnrgidity, and in
consequence of the unequal reaction of the various cells to such a
stimulus, movement of the tentacle also occurs.

 VI. " On Variations in the Amount and Distribution of Fat in
       the Liver-Cells of the Frog."            By J. N. Langley, M.A.,
      F.R.S., Lecturer on Histology in the University of Cam
       bridge.    Received September 23,. 1885.
    I have in a previous paper* mentioned some of the changes which
occur in certain circumstances in the number and arrangement of the
fat-globules in the liver-cells of the frog.         From observations made
 since that time at different seasons of the year,           I  have been able to
ascertain certain points undetermined in. the previous account.
    Variations in the Amount and Distribution of Fat with the time of
 Tear. — The fat in the liver-cells is at its maximum amount in Feb
 ruary and March. In January it is, as a rule, somewhat less. In
 April it rapidly decreases ; from May until December it is present in
 comparatively small though varying amount.                It is usually present
 in minimum amount in September and October.
    Generally speaking, the fat-globules form an inner zone in frogs
 which have hungered more than a week.             In January, February, and
 March, however, the fat-globules are commonly more numerous in
 the outer part of the cells, often forming a distinct outer zone.

Sometimes   the globules stretch. throughout the cells.   In December,
the fat-globules may  be more  numerous  in the outer  part of the cells,
but more commonly they are absent from the outer cell-region and
form an inner zone. At other times of the year also, the fat-globules
may be present in the onter portion of the cells, but this is com
paratively rare.
  From April to November, including those months, the globules
may     be very few and small.       In         this
                                          December             is,

observed, very    rare.     In January,February, and March,         have
                                                                                  I I
always found fat-globules to be present in considerable number.
   Effect of Temperature.
                          — In December, when the fat in the liver                        is
increasing in amount, cold increases the amount of fat stored up, and
warmth decreases it.
   The increase of fat, consequent on a decrease of temperature,
occurs chiefly in the outer part of the cells.    The fat-globules which
are formed are fairly large.
   The decrease of fat, consequent on increase of temperature, occurs
chiefly or wholly at the outer part of the cells as a rule, the number
                                                           ;
of globules in the inner part of the cells     increased.
                                                is          The decrease
in the amount of fat, whilst due   in part to   a decrease in the number
of fat-globules,  isdue to a still greater degree to their decrease in
size.
   Although warmth lessens the amount of fat in the liver in winter-
frogs,    itdoes not cause the fat to disappear entirely.       The effect
varies    in some frogs which have been kept seven to ten days at
          ;
22° C, the liver may still have considerably more fat than      ordinarily   is
present in the liver in summer-frogs.
   In snmmer-frogs, in which the fat-globules form an inner zone, and
are nearly or entirely absent from the outer cell-region, neither
warmth nor cold affects to any great degree the number or position
of the fat-globules.    They usually diminish somewhat in number and
size with increase of temperature, but this      not necessarily the case.
                                                     is
Variations    of temperature    have then   much   greater effect on the
amount of fat in the liver in winter than in summer, i.e., whilst
in winter the ratio of fat formed to fat metabolised               greater    is
in the cold than in the warm, in summer this              not necessarily
                                                                   is
the case.
    Although summer-frogs have sometimes very little fat in the liver,
it   is doubtful whether the smallness of the amount        due either to
                                                                        is
 the warmth of summer or to hunger, for we have seen that warmth does
 not necessarily cause    disappearance of fat from the liver; and frogs
                          a
after long hunger    have not infrequently a fair amount of liver-fat left.
 Hence the ratio of fat formed to fat metabolised, depends in part upon
certain unknown conditions of the body, independent of temperature
or of food.

 236               Mr.  J.  N. Langley.     Variations of        [Nov. 19,
    Effect of Digestion.
                         — When frogs are fed, e.g., with worms, the fat
 in the liver at first decreases, after some hours it begins to increase
 and becomes greater than at the beginning of digestion ; towards the
 end of digestion it decreases again in amount, so that in one or two
 days the amount is normal.        Whilst the fat is decreasing in amount,
 the globules usually decrease in size ; whilst the fat is increasing in
 amount, the globules usually increase in size, and are found in the
 outer region of the cells.      Later, as the fat returns to normal, the
 globules form more and more an inner zone.
    The extent of the changes just mentioned as occurring during
 digestion, as well as the period of digestion at which they occur,
 varies very considerably at different times of the year, and in different
 frogs. Winter-frogs which have before digestion much fat in the liver,
 Bhow a decrease and subsequent increase of fat during digestion, but
 the increase is commonly not more than sufficient to bring the fat
  up to the amount present before food was given.
    In some  cases in summer-frogs, especially in September and Octo
 ber, the   effect of feeding is very slight.      There are also certain
 differences in the distribution of the fat-globules in different frogs, in
 the several stages of digestion.      Usually when there are many fat-
 globules present    in the  outer part of the cells before digestion, they
 increase in number during the first stage of digestion in the inner
 part of the cells ; but this is not always the case, whilst disappearing
 from all parts of the cell, they may disappear much more rapidly from
 the inner than from the outer cell-region.
    Further, when fat-globules are present in the inner zone only, it
may happen that, although they increase somewhat in number in the
 cells in the later stages of digestion, they do not accumulate in the
 outer cell-region, but are sparsely scattered in the outer cell-region,
and are more numerous in the inner cell-region.
    Probably these differences are to be accounted for in the following
way.
    We have    seen  that when fat is present    in considerable   amount,
it is present almost without exception in greater quantity in the outer
than in the inner part of the cells, and that in most cases, as it is
increasing in amount, whether from decrease of temperature, or from
digestion, it increases in the outer part of the cells, frequently being
found close to the basement membrane.           Hence we may conclude,
that fat is formed more rapidly in the outer than in the inner part of
the liver-cells.
    We have seen that when winter frogs are kept in the warm, it is in
the outer portion of the cells that the fat chiefly disappears, and that
in summer-frogs, fat is rarely found except in the inner cell-region.
Hence probably the metabolism as well as the formation of fat is more
rapid in the outer than in the inner cell-region.

   1885.]            Fat in    the Liver- Cells of    the Frog.                237
     Further we have seen that in winter-frogs kept in the warm, and in
 fed winter-frogs, there is commonly an increase in the number of
 fat-globules in the inner zone although the total amount of fat is
 much diminished.        Hence probably there is in certain circumstances
 a transference    of fat-globules from the outer to the inner part of the
 cells.   The amount of fat present in the liver of course depends upon
 the relative rates of formation and metabolism of fat, and as this varies
  in different circumstances, so probably the rat- of transference of fat
 from the outer to the inner cell-region varies in different circum
 stances.     To this the differences spoken of above are probably due.
  In summer frogs for example, whilst in the later stages of digestion
 fat is formed more rapidly in the outer cell-region, an accumulation
 of fat in this region may not take place, partly on account of the more
 rapid metabolism of the fat formed, and partly on account of its more
 rapid transference to the inner cell-region.
     Some of the fat-globules in the inner zone are no doubt passed out of
 the cell with the bile secreted, for some small fat-globules are always
present in the bile.
     One other conclusion we may draw with regard to the fat-globules:
 since they diminish in size under the influence of warmth, and in the
 first stage of digestion, it is probable that each separate fat-globule is
slowly metabolised in the same way that mesostate granules in
 secretory glands are metabolised.              The granules of the salivary
glands,    of the gastric   glands,   of the  pancreas,   are not dissolved as a
whole during secretion, they are dissolved steadily and gradually.
     The Effect of Peptone and of Dextrin. — From June to August,
peptone or dextrin, when injected into the dorsal lymph-sac of a frog,
produces changes like those produced by feeding ; t.e., there is at first
a decrease in the amount of fat in the liver, then an increase chiefly
in the outer part of the cells, and this is succeeded by a decrease to
the normal state, during which the fat-globules become shifted from
the outer to the inner cell-region.             The increase of fat is usually
greater    with  dextrin  than   with  peptone.     As a rule the increase in the
amount of fat takes place three to four hours after peptone has been
injected ; in twenty to thirty hours after the injection, the fat-globules
are present, as at starting, in the inner cell-region only.             The times
at which the various changes take place vary, however, in different
frogs. If frogs are kept in the warm and peptone is injected, the
effect on the fat in the liver is much less than when the frogs are at
the ordinary temperatures.            In September the effect of peptone
appears to be less than from Jnne to August.               In the winter months
I   have  not made  a  sufficient  number    of  experiments   to be certain what
changes peptone and dextrin then produce.
     Sewall has pointed out that peptone injected into the dorsal sac of
a frog, causes, in one to two hours, the stomach to be distended with

the fluid in the stomach may have something to do with the changes
in the liver which follow injection of peptone or of dextrin. But

causes little or no formation of fluid in the stomach,        attribute them

 I. "   On the Fertilised Ovum and Formation of the Layers of
        the South African Peripatus." By Adam Sedgwick, M.A.,
        Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge.         Communicated by
        Professor M. Foster, Sec. R.S.           Received October 18,
        1885.
                    The Fertilised Ovum and its Nucleus.
     The fertilised ovum of Peripatus capensis contains a central cavity
 traversed by a few strands of protoplasm.
     The protoplasm has a reticular or spongy structure, the reticulum
 being very close round the nucleus and much looser elsewhere.          The
 strands of the reticulum are composed of an apparently perfectly
 homogeneous protoplasm.        The nucleus is placed on one side of the
 ovum ; it is a large body which varies very considerably in shape and
 structure in different ova.       These variations no doubt represent
 different phases in the life-history of the nucleus.          It has been
 impossible for me with the small number (ten) of unsegmented ova
at my disposal to determine their sequence.
     The nucleus of the fertilised ovum is, however, so large and
favourable for study that I have thought it worth while to describe
three different stages in which    I have seen it.
     1. A spherical structure (diameter, 0-04 mm.) bounded by a mem
brane, which is slightly indented at one point, where it sends in a
prolongation of itself, which passes through the nucleus to become
continuous with the membrane of the opposite side. The nucleus is
made up of a fine spongework of very pale fibrils, which are continuous
with the nuclear membrane and with the septum just mentioned. In this
spongework are a number of deeply-staining more or less spherical
bodies. The nuclear membrane and septum appear precisely similar in
structure to the strands of the external protoplasmic reticulum, and
the latter are continued directly into the former.     The pale nuclear
reticulum is also similar to the extra-nuclear reticulum, differing only

240                Mr. A. Sedgwick.        On the Fertilised    [Nov. 26,
in intensity of staining. The deeply-staining bodies in the nucleus
are,  I  think, placed in the strands of the pale reticulum ; but of this
I am    not certain.
   This nucleus then consists of a simple spongework of protoplasm,
differing only from the external protoplasm in the fact that the stain
ing matter is aggregated into small masses and into the septum
already mentioned.        The apparent nuclear membrane is simply part of
the protoplasm at the junction of the modified (nuclear) and unmodi
fied (cell-substance) part of the protoplasmic network.
   2. A form closely resembling the above, except in the fact that the
nuclear spongework is stained slightly, though not quite so deeply as
some of the extra-nuclear        protoplasm.   There are only two small
deeply-staining      masses, which are not so conspicuous as in the first
form.
   We may state the difference between these two nuclei thus : in the
first form the chromatin of the nucleus is aggregated into a number
of small masses, while in the second form the chromatin is diffused
throughout the nuclear reticulum. The word chromatin being used
to denote the property which enables the protoplasm to take up and
retain the staining matter.       The extra-nuclear protoplasmic threads
possess    this property,  and may be said to possess chromatin, but it is
in a diffused form, as in the second form of nucleus.
   3. In the third form the nucleus is divided by a number of septa,
radiating from its centre, into chambers. The chambers are partially
divided up into secondary chambers by prolongations of the septa.
The septa are continuous externally with the extra-nuclear proto
plasmic reticulum. It is impossible to speak of a distinct boundary
of the nucleus in this form, and the substance of the nuclear septa
and their prolongations is exactly similar in appearance and staining
properties to the strands of the surrounding protoplasmic network or
spongework.
   A number       of chromatin masses occur in each chamber of this
radiate nucleus — they appear to lie in the offshoots of the septa into
the chambers and in delicate expansions of these. But it is impos
sible to determine exactly the relation of these chromatin globules to
the protoplasmic network in the nucleus.
   This form of nucleus is most interesting, because were it not for
the chromatin masses the nucleus would be quite undistingnishable
from the surrounding protoplasm, except, perhaps, by the fact that
the meshes of the network (i.e., network as seen in section) are rather
larger than in the protoplasm immediately around the nucleus.
   The most important, and at the same time most certain, of these
observations on the nucleus of the fertilised ovum of Peripatus, is that
the intra-nuclear and extra-nuclear reticulum are both continuous
with the so-called nuclear membrane.

   1885.]           Ovum     of  the South  A frican Peripatus.           241
     4. The last form    I  have to describe is the spindle form.  It was met
  with in an ovum of two segments.
     The spindle is of enormous size (distance between the poles 0-06 mm.).
 The protoplasmic fibres composing it are absolutely the same in
 appearance as the rest of the cell protoplasm.             The chromatin ia
  present in a very condensed form (i.e., deeply staining) as a number
  of bent rods at the equator of the spindle.        Around the poles of the
  spindle the protoplasmic reticulum is arranged in a radiate fashion.
 The spindle appears not to be composed of simple fibres running from
  pole to pole, but of the ordinary reticulum, the meshes of which are
  very much elongated in a direction parallel to the long axis of th-
 spindle.
     The facts which are most clearly brought out by the above obser
 vations, and about which I have no doubt, are —
     1. The continuity of the nuclear reticulum with the extra-nuclear
  reticulum in form 3 (and almost certainly in forms 1 and 2).
     2. The similarity in structure and continuity between the so-
  called fibres of the spindle in form 4 with the surrounding reticulum ;
 and the conclusion       I  have drawn from my observations is that the
  nucleus of the fertilised ovum of Peripatus differs from the cell proto
 plasm only in the manner in which the so-called chromatin contained
  in the protoplasmic meshwork (both of nucleus and rest of ovum)
 behaves.     In  the nucleus    it varies from a state of diffusion through
 the reticulum to a state in which it is condensed into the chromatin
 masses of form 1.
     In the subsequent stages of segmentation, the nucleus gradually
 becomes smaller until at the close of segmentation it has an oval
 form with a long diameter of 0-016 mm. It now presents the features
 described    by Flemming and other observers in the nuclei of the
 salamander.     I  have seen all through the development of Peripatus
after segmentation most of the stages figured from the salamander.
    During segmentation the nucleus generally has the third form above
 described : I have never seen it in a spherical, and only once in a
 spindle form.      I  conclude that these forms if they occur are very
 rapidly passed through.
                                The Segmentation.
    I have already    described this in a general manner in my communi
cation of May last, and with figures in the " Quarterly Journal of
                            "
Microscopical Science         of July last.
    I  then stated that the endoderm cells were connected with each
other by processes (" Quart. Journ. Micros. Sci.," xxv, Plate 31,
fig. 8).    I have now the following facts to add : —
    1. The so-called endoderm cells are at first without a distinct
nucleus, they do not get a nucleus until just before the gastrnla stage.
                                                                   B 2

242                Mr. A. Sedgwick.              On the Fertilised        [Nov. 26,
   2.  All the cells of the ovum, ectodermal           as well as endodermal,   are
connected      together      by a     fine   protoplasmic reticulum which         is
placed, as are also the cells, immediately           beneath the egg membrane,
and therefore around a central space.
    Each ectoderm cell consists of a central nucleus around which is a
close protoplasmic spongework, which at the outer parts of the so-
called cell becomes of a gradually looser nature until it runs into the
spongework of the surrounding cells.
    Each endoderm mass consists of a central denser spongework which
gradually becomes looser towards the periphery of the mass until it is
 continued into a fine reticulum.            The endoderm masses are far apart
 from each other and are connected by this reticulum.
    The continuity of the various cells of the segmenting ovum is
primary and not secondary, i.e., in the cleavage, the segments do not
completely separate from one another.               But are we justified in speak
ing   of  cells   at  all   in   this   case  ?   The  fully segmented ovum, is a
syncytium, and there are not and have not been at any stage cell limits.
I  think the cleavage should be rather described not as segmentation,
but a multiplication of the nucleus or centre of force which causes a
corresponding readjustment in the density of the network at different
parts of the ovum, but no break in continuity.
                           The Structure of the Oastrula.
    The formation of the gastrnla, which is at first solid, has been
described in my first communication to the Society on this subject.
                                              I
    The endoderm masses at first, as have already mentioned, have no
nuclei.    Nuclei first appear in them during the progress of the epibole
by which the gastrula is formed.             I  have not been able to determine
the origin   of  these   nuclei.    They    either  arise de novo in the endoderm
masses or migrate into the latter from the ectoderm.                     The proto
plasmic   network     at  the  centre    of each   endoderm    mass  is denser than
at the periphery, but is without the chromatin granules, so charac
teristic of a nucleus.         But    I  have already described a stage of the
nucleus   in  the  fertilised    unsegmented ovum in which the chromatin
granules are almost entirely absent, and in which the network pre
sents no essential difference from the surrounding network. Again,
another in which the nuclear network merges so gradually into the
 surrounding network, that it is impossible to point to any limit be
 tween them.        I  therefore think it quite possible that this central
 denser protoplasm in the endoderm masses may give rise to the
 nucleus which subsequently appears.               But on the other hand mustI
distinctly state that this is only a possible view which may be borne
in mind, but which cannot be accepted without the most overwhelm
ing proof in the present state of our science.
    The solid gastrula is a syncytium ; the ectodermal nuclei are

 1885.]               Ovum   of the South     African Peripatus.                 243
arranged round the periphery of the ovum, while the endodermal
nuclei are within.         The latter are characterised by their angular
shape, and by never presenting the karyokinetic figures characteristic
of the ectodermal nuclei.          The protoplasm of this syncytium is much
vacuolated throughout, but the vacuoles are largest in the centre.
These central vacuoles unite and give rise to the gut cavity, which
opens to the exterior through a point on the surface where the
ectodermal nuclei have always been absent.                    This opening is the
blastopore.         The blastopore, until quite late in development, is
traversed by protoplasmic           strands, which anastomose with similar
strands projecting from the protoplasm                   lining the- large central
vacuole or gut.
   The gut of Peripatus arises, therefore, as a vacuole in a multi
nucleated mass of •protoplasm, and the gastrula of Peripatus is a multi
nucleated mass or syncytium, with absolut- continuity of the proto
plasm of all parts of the ovum.
                            The Origin of the Mesoderm.
   After the definit- formation of the blastopor-, an area of proto«
plasm, placed in the ectodermal layer of the syncytium, and charac
terised by possessing several nuclei less densely packed together than
elsewhere, is distinctly visible in the middle line of the ventral surface
just behind the blastopore. I cannot be certain of the exact number
of the nuclei belonging to this area in the youngest embryo in
which I obs-rved it, as the limits of the area are difficult to
determine      by inspection of transverse sections-            However that may
be, the area ha- in transverse- section very much the appearance of the
pole cells of other forms, and i- the structure described in my first
paper     as
              "  some cells which cannot be definitely assigned to the
ectoderm or to the -ndoderm, at the hind end of the blastopore."                  Its
nuclei undergo division and give rise             to the densely packed mass of
nuclei of the primitive streak.* A part of it seems to persist for
some time in the deeper parts of the primitive streak close to the
endoderm :        I  have not yet succeeded in tracing the fate of this
portion.
   The nuclei of the primitive streak migrate forwards between the
ectodermal and endodermal nuclei, and take up their position in the
protoplasm intervening between the latter.
   These rows of nuclei are the mesodermal bands. They soon arrange
themselves into groups around a central vacuole, and so give rise to
the most conspicuous parts of the mesoblastic somites.                  I  leave the
ovum for the present at the commencement of the formation of the
-omites, merely stating that it is still a syncytium.
   *  It is possible that some of the ectoderm nuclei adjoining    this area mav take
 part in  the production ot the primitive streak nuclei.

     The facts above recorded are somewhat novel. That they are facts
  so far as Peripatus capensis is concerned I have not the slightest
  doubt.      Whether or no they are applicable to other animals is another
  question.     If they are, the following considerations present them
  selves   : —
     1.  Klein's   view of the continuity between the reticulum of the
  nucleus and the reticulum of the extra-nuclear protoplasm receives
 striking confirmation.
    2. MetschnikofE's     and Lankester's views     as  to the origin of the
  gastrula and its gut receives support.
    3. Herbert Spencer's view of the origin of the nervous system may
 perhaps not be so far from the mark as at first sight appeared.
    4s.  The connexion between the nerve and muscles and sensory
 epithelial cells receives its morphological explanation, being due to a
 primitive continuity which has never been broken.            In fact the con
 nexion between almost every kind of tissue cell is explicable as
 being the primitive condition.
    5. There is no essential difference between ducts with perforated
 cells and ducts with so-called cellular walls (inter- and intra-cellular
 ducts).
    6.   If  the protoplasm    of the body is really a syncytium, and the
 ovum until maturity      in the ovary a part of that syncytium, the separa
 tion of the generative products does not differ essentially from the
 internal gemmation of a protozoon, and the inheritance by the off
 spring of peculiarities first appearing in the parent, though not
 explained, is rendered less mysterious, for the protoplasm of the
 whole body being continuous, changes in the molecular constitution
of any part of it would naturally be expected to spread, in time,
 through the whole mass.
    Shortly, these facts if generally applicable reduce the adult body
 to a syncytium — to a multi-nucleated vacuolated protoplasmic mass,
 and embryonic development to a multiplication of nuclei and a
specialisation of tracts in this mass.

        Shipley, B.A. Communicated by Professor M. Foster,
        Sec. R.S. Received October 29, 1885.
    At    the close of segmentation   the egg of the Lamprey (Petromyzon
planeri) forms a blastosphere.         Owing to the way in which the yolk
is distributed, the segmentation       cavity is rather eccentrically placed.
It is roofed in by several rows        of small cells, while its floor is com
posed of a few very large cells        much orowded with food yolk.        The

   1885.]               and Blastopore   of the  Lamprey.                245
   small cells pass gradually into the larger ones at the sides of the seg
   mentation cavity.     All the cells of the blastosphere are crowded with
  yolk spherules, which are, however, very much smaller in the upper
  cells, where active division is going on, than in the more inert lower
  cells.   The latter may be conveniently termed the yolk cells. The
  segmentation cavity is considerably larger than that of the frog's
  ovum at a similar period.       The next stage in the development of the
  ovum is accompanied by the thinning out of the upper layer of cells,
  until the roof of the segmentation cavity finally consists of a single
  layer of cells. On this point my observations confirm those of Calberla,
  and are opposed to those of Max Scbultze, who found a many-layered
  roof covering the segmentation cavity just before invagination. The
  layer is composed of epiblastic cells, and in this respect resembles the
  many-layered roof of the segmentation cavity in the frog's ovum of
  the same stage. The lower cells of the many-layered roof seem to pass
  round to the sides and floor of the segmentation cavity, so that about
  the fiftieth hour after fertilisation the upper half of the egg consists
  of a hemispherical segmentation cavity, roofed in by a single layer of
 cells, the lower half being solid and composed of yolk cells. Viewed
 as an opaque object, the upper half is of a whiter colour than the
 lower.
     The invagination to form the mesenteron takes place in the region
 where the single layer of epiblast cells passes into the yolk cells. In my
 eggs the first trace of this invagination appeared about 130 hours after
 artificial fertilisation. The mouth of the invagination or blastopore
 is at first a wide arched slit, which subsequently narrows to a round
 hole.    From the first sign of invagination, a cavity, the mesenteron, is
present ; in this the Lamprey resembles Amphioxus, but differs from
the Frog, where the mesenteron is formed as a slit some time after the
invagination has begun. It differs from Amphioxus, however, in the
fact that the invagination is not symmetrical, being like the segmen
tation cavity, pushed dorsally by the accumulation of yolk cells at the
lower pole. The upper layer of invaginated cells retain the character
of the epiblast cells, the lower are larger, and have the characters of
the yolk cells. The former lie close against the inner surface of the
epiblast cells in the dorsal median line, here again differing from the
Frog, where a mass of cells, which subsequently form mesoderm. lies
dorsally to the invaginated cells and between them and epidermis.
There is thus no mesoblast present at the dorsal rim of the blasto
pore, such as is found in frog's egg.           Dnring these processes the
epiblastic cells have gradually enclosed the yolk cells ; this appears to
take place by the conversion of the outer yolk cells into epiblast
cells, and takes place latest in the region of the blastopore.          The
mesenteron continues to deepen, and as it increases in size the seg
 mentation cavity diminishes, and is finally obliterated.      The roof and

  246              Mr. A. E. Shipley.     On the Mesoblast        [Nov. 26,
  sides of the mesenteron consist of columnar cells, in appearance very
 like the epiblast, against the inner surface of which it is closely
 pressed.     The floor is composed of cells, which retain their yolk-like
 characteristics for a considerable time.     The mesoblast now begins to
 appear by the differentiation of two bands of those yolk cells which
 lie in the angles formed by the invaginated mesenteron and the
  epiblast.   The differentiation appears to take place from before back
  wards.    The two bands of mesoblast are separated from one another
 in the dorsal median line by the juxtaposition of the invaginated hypo
 blast and the epiblast.      They are separated ventrally by the hypo-
 blastic yolk cells which are in contact with the epiblast over the
 lower two-thirds of the egg..        Subsequently, but at a very much
 later stage, the mesoblast is completed ventrally by the downgrowth
 on each side of the mesoblastic plate-.     These proliferate cells at their
 edge,   which   grow  down   between  the hypoblastic yolk cells, and so
 complete the mesoblast ventrally. The first formation of the longi
 tudinal band appears to take place by a differentiation of hypoblastic
 cells in situ, and not by an invagination of cells.
     This account of the origin of the mesoblast differs materially from
that given by Scott.       According to his- observations,. the mesoblast is
 derived from two sources : (1) cells which are invaginated with the
 mesenteron, these form the longitudinal bands ; (2) the outer layer
 of hypoblastic yolk cells, which split off the remainder, and form the
 ventral sheet which completes the mesoblast on that side of the body.
 Since by this time the head of the embryo has raised itself above the
yolk, there are no hypoblastic yolk cells in it,, and consequently its
mesoderm is entirely derived from the first source, whereas in the
trunk the dorsal mesoderm is derived from the first source, the ventral
 from the second.
    By the time that the mesoblastic plates become separated from the
yolk cells, the neural plate becomes evident in the exterior.           This
extends from the blastopore as a low ridge,. over two-thirds of the
circumference of the egg. Its appearance is soon followed by the
separation of the anterior end from the rest of the yolk.
    The invaginated endoderm has extended round for more than half
the circumference of the egg, and its most anterior portion is included
in the head, which is by this time distinct from the rest of the
embryo.
    All this  time the blastopore has been visible at the posterior end of
the neural plate.      It has been figured in this position by Schultze,
who gives a very complete set of figures of the embryo viewed as a
whole.      The elongation of the embryo now proceeds so rapidly that
the anterior end curves round over the blastopore ; the posterior end

 conclusion  that blastopore persisted as the anus, and this view was
 supported by Calberla.     On the other hand the later observers, who
 have studied the development by means of sections, have maintained
 Benecke's view that the blastopore closes. Scott describes the neural
canal as enclosing the blastopore, and by its closure forming a
neurenteric canal, which he figures.      He states that the anus is sub
 sequently formed by a protrusion of the alimentary canal against the
 skin, which becomes open about the twentieth day. Balfour states
 that the blastopore closes, and does not form the permanent
anus.
    My observations   on the embryo    as an opaque object led me to the
belief that the blastopore remained open, and in this T have been
confirmed by a number of series of sections taken from embryos of all
stages, from the commencement of the invagination until the time
when the cloaca is definitely established.. At its first appearance the
blastopore is situated. at the posterior dorsal surface of the embryo,
but by the elongation of the embryo and the formation of the tail the
blastopore comes to occupy a position on the ventral surface.
    Scott was of opinion that the lumen e£ theinvaginated mesenteron
persisted only in the fore-gut.       This part of the alimentary canal
shortly after the invagination is- completed is raised with the head
from the rest of the embryo. This part is therefore free from the
large yolk cells, and the cells lining the mesenteron soon assume a
definite columnar character, although they continue to contain yolk
grannies for a considerable time. According to Scott and Calberla the
lumen of the mesenteron in the trunk entirely disappears, and only
appears again at a much later stage-.         My sections, however, show
that the lumen never really disappears.       At its anterior end, as is just
mentioned, its lining cells soon become columnar, and these extend
from its blind anterior end to the posterior part of what will subse
quently form the gill region.          A similar change takes place at
tbe posterior end. The cells surrounding the blastopore, and extend
ing for some distance into the alimentary canal, very early assume a
columnar character, and are in fact indistinguishable from the epider
mal cells. The cells lining the mid-gut do not assume this epithelial-like
character till a much later stage. The dorsal row are, however, more
columnar than those on the ventral side ; these latter have just the
same characters as the other yolk cells.
    At its posterior end the neural tube becomes solid, and this solid
rod soon fuses with the posterior end of the notochord, and with a
solid rod of cells which pass backwards from the hind-gut, and pro
bably represent the post-anal gut. A little further back the meso-
blastic plates join this mass of indifferent tissue ; so that we have behind
the anus, in a position corresponding to the front lip of the blastopore,
when it occupied its primitive position on the posterior dorsal surface,

 a mass   of indifferent tissue, into which pass representatives of all
 three germinal layers.     This must represent the primitive streak.
    The persistence of the blastopore to form the anus has been demon
 strated in the Amphibia, by Miss Johnson in the Newt, by Gasser in
 Alytes, and by Spencer in the Frog. The fact that it persists in the
 Cyclostomata appears to point to the fact that this is a primitive
 feature retained   in those eggs which have not become much modified
 by the presence of a large mass of yolk.      This view would be greatly
 confirmed if renewed observation on the development of Amphioxus
 should demonstrate the same fact.

                                 (Abstract.)                         •
    This paper contains an account of observations mode on the spectra
of the organs and tissues of invertebrates and vertebrates, which
 have brought to light the presence of a series of animal colouring
 matters which had not previously been discovered.
    The name histohaematins is proposed for all these colouring matters,
and that of myohoeniatin for the intrinsic pigment occurring in
striped muscle, which belongs to the same series.
    These pigments are not identical with any known decomposition
product of haamoglobin, and they are found in animals in whose
bodies no haemoglobin can be found.
    The method of examination is as follows : — The tissue or part of
organ to be examined is put into a compressorium, by means of which
any required thickness     can be obtained, it is illuminated by means of
a large sub-stage condenser, and examined with a Sorby's microspec-
troscope fitted to a binocular microscope, the binocular form being
preferred, as one tube is free for the observation of the specimen.
The source of illumination was generally an argand gas burner, some
times direct sunlight, sometimes a Swan lamp.         The objectives of the
microscope up to the one-eighth were so adapted as to enable both
fields of the microscope to be fully illuminated, which is a matter of
importance in dealing with small quantities of material, or in differ
entiating those portions of an object which give different spectra.
    The Histohamatina . — Examined in this way the organs and tissues
of invertebrates and vertebrates present a series of spectra, which are
all evidently connected with each other. From Echinoderms to man
the same appearances have been found ; thus there is a most striking

  1885.]            Myohcematin and the Ilistohwmatins.                249
 likeness between the spectra of such organs as the ovaries of a star
 fish and the pancreas, stomach-wall, kidney, and other organs of a
 cat, and between these and that of striped muscle throughout the
 whole animal kingdom.
    To give an idea of the character of these spectra and their distri
 bution is not easy in an abstract, but in general they may be said to
 consist of at least three bands — one before D, one or two between D
 and E, and sometimes one or two others nearer violet.         When one
 band occurs between D and E it replaces the two found in other cases,
 which are of great narrowness compared with other physiological
 spectra.   The band before D is always the same both in the histo-
 haematins, and in myohaematin with few exceptions.       Sometimes this
 kind of spectrum is replaced by another in which two narrow bands
 like those of reduced hsamatin occur nearer the violet than the bands
 of the latter.    It was proved repeatedly that the banded spectrum
 belongs to the deoxidised condition, and the bandless to the fully
oxidised ; accordingly these pigments are respiratory.
    Among animals in which I have found these spectra a few may be
enumerated with the organs in which they occur.         Thus in Echino-
derms the ovaries, stvmach-wall, and other parts of Uraster rtibens show
them well marked.
    In molluscs, Limax flavus, L. variegatus, Arion ater, Helix aspersa,
H. pomatia, and other slugs and snails contain them in such parts
as the nephridium, albumen gland, ovo-testis, receptaculum seminis, foot,
wall uf crop, oviduct, penis and elsewhere, and all contain myohaematin
in the muscle of the heart in both auricle and ventricle, also in the
pharyngeal muscle. In these species, as Dr. Sorby first showed, the
bile contains a kind of haematin, which is evidently connected with
the histohaematins for reasons given in the complete paper.             In
other molluscs such as Littorina littorea, Purpura lapillus, Trochus
cinerarius and zuiphinus, Patella vulgata, Limnceus stagnalis, Mytilus
edulis, Oslraea edulis, Anodonta cygnea, and others, they have been
observed by the above method of examination.
    In Arthropods, such as Homarus vulgaris, Astacus fluviatilis, Cancer
pagurus, Carcinus moenas, and Pagurus Bernhardus, they have also
been found, in such situations as the green glands (of the two first), the
stomach-wall,    liver, exceptionally in the branchiae, and elsewhere.
They are also present in insects and in spiders.
    In all these invertebrates (and others) they can be studied unin
fluenced by the presence of haemoglobin. Wherever they are seen the
corresponding tissue or organ is more or less yellow or reddish-yellow,
but sometimes almost colourless.
    On examining vertebrates I was surprised to find the same spectra
in such situations as the liver, spleen, kidney, stomach-wall, pancreas,
wall of intestine, and sometimes in the ovary. And by washing out

250                    Dr. C. A. MacMunn.            Researches on       [Nov. 26,
the blood-vessels          with salt solution,   I   found the bands became much
better marked.
  Thus : — In fishes they have           been observed     in the tench, herring,
roach, eel, and others.
  In reptiles, in Tropidonotus natriz, Bascanium               constrictor, Scincus
officinalis, Trionyx, Emys Europosa, Lacerta viridis, and Lacerta agilis.
   In Amphibians, in Rana temporaria, Hyla arborea, Bufo vulgaris,
Salamandra maculosa, Siredon pisciformis, and others.
  In  birds, e.g., pigeon, owl, turkey, goose, duck, swift, &c. The gizzard
of birds   is,
             however, mainly coloured by oxyh8moglobin.
   In Mammals, e.g., dog, cat, rat, rabbit, guinea-pig, hedgehog, sheep, ox,
pig, mouse, and man, as well as fn others.
   In all cases oxidatiou and reduction could be brought about. When
the bands are invisible they can be brought into view by dipping the
portion of organ or tissue into Stokes's fluid, or into weak solutiona
of ammonium sulphide in water; on exposure to the air they become
faint.
   Myohcematin.    — All the species enumerated and others have been
examined       for myohcematin, and in all those which possess striped
muscle    it   has been found.
   Thus in molluscs,      found in the heart and pharyngeal muscle of
                             itis
Limax, Arion, Helix, and other pulmonates.
   In Arthropods, in the cardiac muscle of BJomarus, Astacus, Cancer,
Carcinus, and Pagurus, and not in their volontary muscles (so far)                ;
also in the muscle of the cephalo-thorax of such spiders as Epeira
diadema, Tegenaria civilis (and others).
   In insects     abundantly present, especially in the muscles from the
                 it   is
thorax.    It    best marked in those which move the wings actively,
                 is
such as diurnal and nocturnal lepidopters.      So far    has been found
                                                                it
in the following insects     — Musca vomitoria, domestica, and chlora,
                                    :
Apis mellifica, Bombus terrestris, Vespa vulgaris, Hydrophilus, Dyticus
marginalis, Oeotrupes stercorarius, Lucanus cervus, Coccinella, Staphy-
linus olens, Cerambyx moschatus, Creophilus manillosus, Carabus violaceus,
Periplaneta orientalis, Oryllus domesticus, Acrida viridissima, Tipula
oleracea, Pieris rapae, and various other lepidopters and dipters.      It.
has also been found in the mouth parts of larvae.
   Among vertebrates       has been found in the heart and voluntary
                               it
muscle of all the fishes, reptiles, amphibians, birds, and mammals
enumerated    above. It    frequently accompanied by haemoglobin in
                                  is
these classes, and sometimes replaced by it. It may be apparently
absent, but its bands may be brought into view by the use of reducing
agents.
   The spectrum of myohaematin      remarkable for the sharpness and
                                            is
narrowness of its bands, in which point and the other histohaematins
                                                     it
differ from any other known animal pigment.         Three bands are

1885.]            Myohcematin and the Histohat mating.                       251
always present, one between C and D, close to D, which corresponds
to the first band of the histohsamatin spectrum, two very narrow and
sharp, of which the second is darker than the first between D and
E ; besides these there are one or two nearer violet, one covering
E and b, the other before F, which are not always present. The 2nd
and 3rd bands correspond closely to similar bands in the histo
haematin spectrum, in which they may appear joined to form one
broad band.
    The colour of the pigment giving this spectrum is yellow or
reddish-yellow, but even in very pale muscles the bands can some
times be seen, especially after the use of a reducing agent.
    Various attempts have been made to isolate myohsamatin, but
owing to the coloured constituent being joined to a proteid, it will
not go into any of the usual solvents. It has been proved by pressiug
out the plasma from frozen muscle that some of the myohaematin
 belongs to the plasma, but even after this treatment, its bands are
 seen better marked in the muscle than before.             It has also been got
 from blood-free muscle by digesting in pepsin solution, which, how
 ever, alters the pigment, as it no longer gives the original spectrum,
 but another which is remarkable, as it is imitated closely by a spec
 trum sometimes seen in insect muscle without any treatment.
 Obtained by this method, the pigment is of a yellow colour, and is
 only soluble in water.
    From the changes which the histohsematins and myohaematin
 undergo with oxidising and reducing agents, and for reasons given in
 detail in the paper, I have come to the conclusion that these pigments
 are concerned in the internal respiration of the tissues and organs in
 which they are fonnd.
    Spectrum of the Adrenals. — Another point of interest brought to
 light by these observations is the occurrence of haemochromogen in
 the medulla of the supra- renal glands of mammals; thus in this
 situation in man, dog, cat, ox, sheep, pig, guinea-pig, rabbit, and rat,
 I have found haernochromogen, the bands of which are very dark ;
 and it would appear that this baemochromogen is partially removed
 by washing out the blood-vessels with salt solution.               Hence, and
 owing   to the fact  that  elsewhere   it  is excretory,    as in the  bile, the
 haemochromogen of the adrenals appears to be excretory ; if so a
 downward metamorphosis of haemoglobin, and probably (for reasons
 given in the paper) of the histohaematins, is one of their functions.
 Hence if by disease, or by artificial removal, this metabolism is
 prevented, the incompletely metabolised pigments circulate in the
 blood, and staining of skin and mucous membrane, as in Addison's
 disease, may take place.      In the urine of Addison's disease such an
 imperfect metabolite occurs     as I have already shown.*

   To give an idea of the connexion which exists between the histo-
haematins and myohaematin,         I have here added a few wave-length
measurements.        These are given in greater detail in the complete
 paper,   and  the spectra have been mapped to the number of 70 in the

   It may be added that it is very difficult to measure these bands,
and allowing for this fact the agreement is very close, especially
as all the measurements were made independently of each other.           It
is also necessary to add that the above are what may be called typical
histohaematin spectra, as in some cases Bands 2 and 3 are joined to
each other to form one band.

IV. "On        the Geometrical Construction of the Cell of the
      Honey Bee." By Henry Hennessy, F.R.S., Professor of
      Applied Mathematics in the Royal College of Science,
      Dublin. Received October 20, 1885.
   The well-known problem of the        bee's cell occupied the         attention of
eminent mathematicians early in the last century, and it is still pre
sented as an interesting example of geometrical maxima and minima.
 In 1743 Maclaurin communicated to the Royal Society a solution of
the question, which appears in the "Philosophical Transactions,"* and
it seems that the comparison between the mathematical results and
the actual cells was effected by angular measurements.                   Long since
a simple method occurred to me for the construction of the figure
                                       I
without employing angles, and as have not been able to find it in
any publication,     I venture to submit it in this short paper.
   A structure has a regular hexagon for its orthogonal cross section,
and is terminated by three lozenges which meet in a trihedral angle ;
required the relation between the side of one of these lozenges and the
side of the regular hexagon forming the cross section of the prism so
as to give the smallest surface to the structure.               The long diagonal
of one of these lozenges is equal to the side of the equilateral triangle
inscribed in the hexagon ; if we call this E and the short diagonal e,
then —
                          E= y/3h   and e=     vV+4xs,
where    h  is the side of the hexagon, and x the difference between the
parallel sides of one of the six faces of the prism.                 The area of a
                                           -,  and that of the face of prism

   For  m,   the total surface of the structure,       we have
                        "=V[ ^3(^     + 4**)     +2(21-*)],
and hence
   This, equated to zero, gives x =

    A side of the lozenge is thus equal to three times the difference
 between the two parallel edges of the trapezium.           If a line equal to
 the side of the hexagon be bisected by an equal line at right angles,
 and the extremities of both joined, half the resulting line will be
 equal to x, so that the side of one of the lozenges is three times the half
 side of a square whose diagonal equals the side of the hexagon.          It is
 moreover   manifest   that

 possible.   As the angle at top of the trapezium has for its tangent
 h       ,-
 -=2^2, this     angle is 70° 31' 44", the supplement       of 109° 28' 16" for
 the obtuse angle of the lozenge, found by Maclaurin.
    It is manifest that E=fcv/3 and e= v^E, or the longer diagonal, is
 equal to the diagonal of a square whose side is the shorter diagonal
 of the lozenge.    Also the acute angle of the lozenge is equal to the
 acute angle of the trapezium, for the tangent of half the former
    From these results a model of the bee's cell can be easily con
structed, with the aid of a pair of compasses, as follows : —
    1. Inscribe an equilateral triangle in a hexagon ; a side of this
triangle is the long diagonal of the lozenge ; bisect this, and the
diagonal of a square erected on the half is the shorter diagonal of tho
lozenge.
    2. Draw six parallel lines at distances equal to the side of the
hexagon, and a straight line perpendicular to them from the second
of the parallel lines; inflpct a straight line equal- to a side of the
lozenge above constructed, and repeat this process until six tra
peziums are finished.

                                       (Abstract.)
     In offering     to the Royal Society some results         deduced from the
 systems      of   magnetic      observation   and magnetic      self-registration
 established     several years since at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich,
 during a portion of the time in which          I  presided over that institution,
  I think  it  desirable   to  premise  a short statement on the origin of the
 Magnetic Department of the Royal Observatory, and on the successive
 steps in its constitution.
     It appears to have been recognised many years ago, that magnetic
 determinations would form a proper part of the business of the Royal
 Observatory. When I commenced residence at the Royal Observatory,
                            I
 at the end of 1835, found in the garden a small wooden building,
 evidently intended for the examination of compasses, perhaps of the
 size of those used in the Royal Navy. But the locality was incon
 venient, and the structure was totally unfit for any delicate magnetic
 purpose; for instance, the balance- weights of the sliding windows
 were of iron. For some preliminary experiments a small observatory
 was borrowed from Captain Fitzroy, but no real progress was made
 in magnetism.
    In the beginning of 1836, a scheme for the erection of a Magnetical
 Observatory was brought before the Board of Visitors.                 The Board
 approved the plan, and recommended it favourably to the Admiralty.
 The Government Department superintending the Park gave their
consent to an extension of the grounds of the Observatory, and the
ground was inclosed in 1837. The Magnetic Observatory was built,
from my plans, in the spring of 1838.             Since that time, no alteration
has been made in the building, except in 1864, when the ground
below the east, west, and south arms, was excavated, in order to
obtain positions for the three fundamental instruments in which the
severity of the temperature-changes               would be much diminished.
Small accidental interruptions of observations occurred in 1847,
January, and        1861, July.
    The interest taken in the subject of terrestrial magnetism in the
first half of this century was occasioned principally by the enterprise
of Gauss and other German philosophers.                Magnets were, therefore,
established at the Royal Observatory, famished with apparatus adapted
to eye observations corresponding to those of Gauss, and some
    vol. xxxix.                                                          S

236              Sir G. B. Airy.         Results  from Measures of       [Nov. 26,
observations were made in concert with the Germans.                   The observa
tions to the     end   of    1847  with   these  instruments    were made   entirely
by eye ; the instruments (magnets 2 feet in length) being furnished
with     small    plane reflectors,       to  which     telescopes were directed,
and by        which fixed marks            were observed.        The observations
were made at every two hours, day and night; proper precautions
were taken for assurance of the general accuracy of the times of
observation ; and       I    do not doubt that the results interpreted from
these    observations        are  each  as   good   as   those derived    from the
succeeding system         ;   though the intervals of two hours were longer
than    I could wish.         But the labour was great, and (as measured by
the interruption of assistants' work) was expensive.
   The idea of self-registration by photography of the movements of
the intruments (an idea little entertained before that time) then
suggested      itself ; and, at the Cambridge Meeting of the British
Association in 1845, it was proposed for consideration of the
Council of that body, that the Government should be requested to
promote, by offer of a pecuniary reward, the construction                      of a
photographic self-registering instrument.               This proposal was adopted
by   the  Council    ; letters    were  addressed    by  Sir John Herschel, Pre
sident of the Association, to Her Majesty's Treasury, and by myself
to the Admiralty ; and, finally, the assistance of Dr. Charles Brooke
was secured, for forming an efficient apparatus, and making the
necessary chemical arrangements adapted to our wants.
   I   do not propose here to describe the photographic recording
apparatus.        Allusions to the construction will be found in the
Introductions to the Greenwich Observations for successive years, and
especially, and in great detail, in the introduction to the volume for
1847.     The only alteration that was made in it for several years is the
following.       Mr. Brooke had conceived that advantage would be
gained by making the recording barrel to revolve in twelve hours.
But this caused a doubling of the curves traced on the photographic
paper which is wrapped upon the barrel ; and the inconvenience
produced by this doubling was soon found to be so great that                       I
thought it necessary to alter the clock-work so as to produce a
revolution of the barrel in twenty-four hours.                 The records of the
change     of  western      declination  from   the  north,  and  of the change of
horizontal force, are made on the same barrel ; and by alterations,
first suggested by myself about 1881, and carried out by the
present Astronomer Royal (then Chief Assistant), the two curves are
now so traced that the simultaneous records of the two instruments at
all times are in close juxtaposition.
   While the observations were made by eye, at every two hours, the
means of the two-hourly readings were adopted as base for the day,
and the excess of each two-hourly reading above the mean was adopted

1885.]     Terrestrial Magnetic Force in     the Horizontal Plane.    257
as
    " magnetic inequality " of that ordinate for tbat hour ; producing
twelve measures of "inequality" for each day. When the photo
graphic system was introduced, the elevation of a pencil curve drawn
by eye so as to smooth down the irregularities of the photographic
trace above a photographic        base was measured for every hour,
producing twenty-four     measures   of " inequality."
   In the instances of excessive and rapid disturbances of the magnets
during magnetic storms, no measures of ordinates were taken for the
present purposes.
   Thus the daily measures at each hour or two hours were obtained.
   The next step was to collect for each month all the daily measures
on corresponding hours through each month, and to take their mean.
These are the measures for the hours which are actually treated in the
present   memoir.    By combining (for each month) the inequality of
magnetic horizontal force at every two hours or each hour, as
abscissa, with the inequality of magnetic declination (on the same
scale of measure) at the same two hours or hour, as ordinate, points
were   defined in every monthly curve representing completely the
 mean diurnal changes of magnetism for each month.          On the recom
mendation of the Board of Visitors of the Royal Observatory, reduced
photographic    copies of these curves were prepared by the Astronomer
 Royal for publication with the volume of Greenwich Observations for
 1884.
    The number, and the character, of the curves produced uninter
 ruptedly on this plan, and the circumstance that they are intended
 for publication in the Greenwich Observations, appear to render
 them unfit for dissemination in the Royal Society's Transactions.       I
 have, therefore, decided on the following course.       With the permis
 sion of the Astronomer Royal, I have adopted the three years 1863,
 1864, 1865, for partial exhibition of results.    (Any other years would
 have answered equally well, for general exhibition.)         For each of
 these years  I  have attached to this paper the curves for the months
 January, April, July, October, which suffice for showing generally the
 characteristic changes of magnetism for the several months. Bat
 some general account may be given, for which this is perhaps a
 suitable place.
    The form of the curves, and the position of the points on them
 corresponding to hours of solar time, leave no doubt that the diurnal
 inequality is due mainly — and, as far as I can judge, entirely —to the
 radiant heat of the sun ; and, it would seem, not to the sun's heat on
 the earth generally, but to its heat on parts of the earth not very
 distant from the magnets. In the hot months of the year, the curve,
 though far from circular, surrounds the central point in a form which,
 as viewed from that central point, never crosses itself ; and is,
 roughly speaking, usually symmetrical with regard to E. and W.

258         Terrestrial Magnetism in    the Horizontal Plane.    [Nov. 26,
But in the cold months, the space included in the carve is much
smaller in many cases, probably not more than one-sixth of what it
is in the summer months ; and the curve often crosses itself in the
most bizarre fashion with irregular loops stretching out, three
crossings in one curve occurring very frequently.           In the summer
months there is a certain degree of symmetry ; but here is, constantly,
a preponderance on the west side, which leads me to imagine that the
magnetic effect of the radiant heat upon the sea is considerably
greater than the effect on the land.
   To obtain some numerical basis for a             report, which though
exceedingly imperfect may convey some ideas on this wonderful
subject,   I have adopted the following course.     I have confined myself
to the months of     June and July as probably the two hottest, and the
months of December and January as probably the two coldest.            For
each of the curves applying to these months,           I have laid down a
system of rectangular co-ordinates, corresponding to the Greenwich
meridian and to the line at right angles to the meridian (or the
geographical     E. and W.).       The extreme north ordinate and the
extreme south      ordinate  are  measured,  and their sum is taken, and
interpreted by a scale of measure formed in accordance with the
                                                                   "
theory of the intruments ; and this interpreted sum forms the Range
                       "
of Meridian Force in terms of the whole Meridian Force. In the
same manner, the
                      " Range of Transversal Force " is measured. As the
time of each of the two-hourly or hourly records is marked on the
curve, there is no difficulty in fixing approximately on the solar
times corresponding       to the extreme N. and S. values, and the
extreme E. and W. values, mentioned above. These are all the
elements of the magnetic record which are described in the subjoined
table.
    The changes in the monthly records are very remarkahle.          Thev
leave no doubt in my mind that the diurnal magnetic changes are
 produced by the sun. But I cannot account for every change that
 takes place in the course of a day ; nor can I undertake to say
 whether we can found, on these, the theory that general terrestrial
 magnetism is a part of solar radiation, perhaps sometimes acting
 through or sometimes impeded by the masses of land and sea on
 ¦which that radiation acts.
    Still I think that a considerable step is made by the establishment
 of a connexion between terrestrial magnetism (on one hand), and the
radiation, or, at least, the visibility of the sun (on the other hand).

 VI.    " Studies    of Disinfectants        by   New Methods."            By
      A. Wynter Blyth, Medical             Officer of Health. Commu
      nicated    by    Dr. B. W. Richardson, F.R.S.                Received
       October   8, 1885.
   The object of this paper is to communicate the results of a study
of the action of disinfectant substances which has occupied the leisure
of the author for the past eighteen months. Three series of experi
ments have been made, viz. : —
   1. On the Bacterium termo.
   2. On the varions micro-organisms      in sewage.
   3.  On the disinfection of typhoid excreta.
   The term disinfectant as used throughout this paper must be con
sidered as synonymous with "germicide"; to disinfect a thread or a
drop of liquid contaminated by bacteria is, according to my view, to
kill, and to kill not by a destructive or corrosive, but by a true
poisonous action, all the micro-organisms,       so that the
                                                              " disinfected "
micro-organisms placed under the most favourable conditions for
growth are incapable of any further development.
               1. The Disinfection   of the   Bacterium termo.
   A   pure cultivation of the Bacterium termo was made in ordinary
sterile, solid, nutrient gelatin ; the somewhat fluorescent greenish
liquid to which the upper layers of the gelatin were reduced, by the
growth and multiplication of the bacterium, was submitted to the
various disinfectants in the manner to be described, and then the
bacterium was withdrawn as far as possible from the influence of the
disinfectant and planted, as it were, in fresh nutrient gelatin.          The
methods used in the sterilisation of beakers, test-tubes, &c., as well as
tbe preparation of nutrient gelatin, differed in no essential respect
from the same methods in general use in biological laboratories, and
therefore need not be described.
   The B. termo was submitted to the action of the disinfectants by
two methods, which may be called the " drop " and " thread
                                                                    " method
respectively.
    The Drop Method. — Sterilised pure water was infected with a few
c.c. of gelatin liquefied by the bacterium ; measured volumes of this
infected water were added to measured volumes of the disinfectant,
and the whole allowed to act for twenty-four hours.           A drop of this
liquid   was then  added  to from  10 — 20  grams   of the nutrient   gelatin,
first liquefying it at a very gentle heat. As the proportion of the
weight of the drop to the weight of the nutrient gelatin varied from
about 1 : 500 to 1 : 1000, the dilution was in most cases sufficient to

reduce any antiseptic or inhibitory action of the minnte quantity of
the chemical agent in the drop itself to a minimum, so as to exercise
no appreciable effect.
   The Thread Method. — In the thread method capillary glass rods
were made by drawing out ordinary glass tubing in the blow-pipe
flame, these were tipped with sealing-wax, and to the wax a little bit
of sterilised cotton wool was made to adhere.
   The end of the rod thus prepared was infected with the bacterium
by a short immersion in a pure cultivation and was then placed in the
disinfectant for twenty-four hours.             The rod on removal was soaked
for a little time in sterilised water until all trace of the disinfectant
had been removed.
   The rod thus charged and purified was next inserted into a mass of
solid nutrient gelatin in a test-tube, and put on one side at the ordi
nary temperature of the atmosphere, protected of course from external
contamination by a suitable plug of sterilised wool.                Whether the
                       was    that which   I  have               "        " or the
process used                                        called the     drop
" thread," in each case " control " experiments were made with threads
infected    with the bacterium, but which had not             been   submitted   to
disinfection.
   Alcohol, Ether,         Sfc.
                                — As it was necessary to dissolve many of the
substances experimented upon in weak alcohol, a series of experiments
were made to ascertain the influence of alcoholic and other solvents
on the life of the bacterium, and the following table gives the result.
Alcohol of         60   per cent. disinfected, but absolute amyl alcohol, pure

   Phenol and Cresol. — These experiments          were made by the  " drop "
method.
    Weighed quantities of pure crystalline phenol and of pure liquid
cresol* were dissolved in 20 per cent. alcohol in such proportion that
the strength was exactly 1 per cent. Water which had been infected
with the bacterium was measured from a burette into test-tubes, and
definite quantities of the phenol or cresol solutions added ; the volume
of the whole being kept at 10 c.c, e.g., 3 c.c. of phenol solution, and
7 c.c. of the infected water would equal 0 3 per cent., 1 c.c. of phenol
solution and 9 of the infected water would equal 0-l per cent., and so
on.     At the end of twenty-four hours nutrient gelatin was infected
by means of dipping a clean recently ignited platinum wire in the
liquid, and then inserting the wire for a second or two in the gelatin,
which had been previously liquefied.          The following short table sum

   The table gives the results obtained at the ordinary temperature,
and also at the temperature of 3.5*5°.
   The effect of a temperature of 35-5° is remarkable, and goes far to
explain the happy effects of the so-called antiseptic or Listerian
method of surgery.           The effect of the higher temperature is seen
mainly      in the   longer  period of time between the infection and the
subsequent growth, e.g., when the phenol was present in the propor
tion of 0-l per cent., under these conditions the growth was retarded to
the seventh and eighth day, and 0-2o of phenol which did not disinfect
with certainty at from 15 — 16° did so at 35-5°.
   Pyridine Series. — Pure samples of pyridine (CBH6N), picoline
(C6H7N), lutidine (C7H9N), collidine (C8HUN), parvoline (C9H1SN),
and also acridine (C13H9N), and acridine hydrochlorate were placed

within    1 per cent. the least amount of the disinfectant which has the
effect of destroying the germ life.
   The order of activity seems to be as follows : — Parvoline, acridine,
collidine, pyridine, lutidine, picoline.
   Here also the effect of the bases at the higher temperature is very
evident and marked; l-lfi per cent. of lutidine at 15-5° failed to
disinfect, for growth was evident and vigorous by the sixth day ; but
0-5 per cent. acting for twenty-four hours at 35 -5° disinfected perfectly.
Similarly, 0-l per cent. of acridine disinfected perfectly at 35-5°, but
not at the lower temperature.
    It was  probable enough that the empyreumatic    products of tobacco,
consisting to a considerable degree of members of the pyridine
series, would also be disinfectant. The smoke from an ordinary
pipeful of common shag tobacco was pulled through a few c.c. of
sterilised water.      In this tobacco-water threads infected with the
bacterium were soaked for twenty-fours, and afterwards submitted to
cultivation, but no growth resulted.
    It may not be rash to infer that the cavity of the smoker's mouth
during the act of smoking, is likely to have a disinfecting action on
any bacteria which may at that time gain access.
    Alkaloids. — Experiments were made on certain of the alkaloids by
the " thread
                "
                   method.
    The exact manner in which the alkaloids were dissolved, &c, was
as follows : — Brucine and strychnine were respectively converted into
chlorides and the neutral salt dissolved in 20 per cent. alcohol so as to
make a 2 per cent. solution.
    Sulphate of atropine was dissolved in 20 per cent. alcohol.
 Quinine sulphate was in one experiment dissolved in 20 per cent.
alcohol with the addition of a sufficient quantity of hydric sulphate
 to ensnre solution    ; but in another experiment the acid was omitted,
a saturated solution of the quinine being used instead ; this saturated
 solution was made by boiling the salt for a few minutes, and then
 allowing the solution to cool. A solution thus made equals 0-3 per
 cent, of anhydrous quinine sulphate.
     Morphine was used in the form of acetate. Theine was simply
 dissolved in the weak alcohol without further preparation.
     The results are given in the table, from which it will be seen that
 strychnine, brucine, quinine, and atropine all destroyed the bacterium
 in from 0-25 to 0-5 per cent. strength.     The saturated aqueous solu
 tion of quinine permitted growth on the sixth day when acting at
 ordinary temperatures, but when the action took place at the heat
 of the body then sterilisation was effected.
     It is noteworthy that solutions of morphine acetate of 1 per cent.
 strength seem to have no disinfecting properties.

  Potassic Permanganate. — Experiments on the action of potassic per
manganate were made by the thread method.                 As the infected thread
was immersed in a large volume of the disinfectant, the latter acted
under more favourable conditions than are likely to occur in actual
practice, in which there will be usually a quantity of easily broken
up organic matter, decomposing the permanganate,                    and thus in

   Halogens. — Since minute quantities of the halogens have a very
decided inhibitory action on growth, the thread method of investi
gation was thought more suitable. Sterilised threads were, therefore,
infected with the bacterium, and submitted for twenty-four hours to
chlorine, bromine, and iodine water of known strength, the thread
being afterwards soaked in distilled water to free it from all traces
of the halogen, and then planted in gelatin. The results are not
essentially different from those obtained by other observers, and fully
confirm the great disinfecting power of the halogens, O-Ol per cent.
solution of any of the three being sufficient to destroy the bacterium.
Of the three, chlorine is the most active.

   In  the following series of experiments an entirely different method
of procedure was adopted.            The number of colonies in a gram
of sewage or other suitable liquid was carefully determined by a
modification of known methods.
   The same sewage was then treated by substances the disinfectant
properties of which formed the subject of inquiry, and the number of
colonies capable of growing in a nutrient soil, representing the micro
organisms which had escaped destruction, again enumerated.

   The only special apparatus used requiring description is the " drop-
bottle " and the " rings and plates."
   The Drop-bottle. — The figure represents its shape and size, the
capacity is about 25 c.c. The stopper is hollow and terminates in
a pipette ; it has a pin-hole at a, which can be closed by the
finger.
   The Glass Plates and Rings. — The glass plates were 4 by 2 inches
square, the rings 4 inches in diameter, ^ inch thick, and   j inch high/
The plates had a ground surface the size of the ring thickness ; the
rings were cemented to the plates in the following manner. After
heating the rings and plates in a hot air oven for many hours a little
peptone gelatin was run on to the ribbon of ground surface, the ring
adjusted, and the whole allowed to cool in a glass chamber formed by
a small dish covered by a slightly larger one ; at the bottom of the
dish was some filter-paper moistened with a solution of mercuric
chloride.    The plates were not used until the gelatin cement had
perfectly set. I should also add that the plates were ruled by means
of a diamond into squares for the purpose of easy enumeration.
   Solid substances, such as ferrous sulphate, were weighed and dis
solved in definite quantities of the sewage ; in other cases solutions
of known strength were mixed with the sewage. The time during
¦which the disinfectant acted was, as a rule, twenty-four hours.
   The method of cultivation was as follows: — A small quantity,
whether of diluted or disinfected sewage, was transferred to the
previously cleansed and sterilised drop-bottle, the bottle and its
contents carefully weighed, then by means of the pipette stopper
one or two drops spotted on to the surface of the glass cell formed
by the plate and ring already described ; the weight of the drops was
ascertained by reweighing the drop-bottle.
   Ordinary nutrient gelatin liquefied at a gentle heat was run from
a Lister flask into the glass cell, and mixed equally with the drops by
inclining the plate in different directions.     Daring these several
operations dust was excluded as far as possible by covering the glass
cell by a second glass plate, merely shifting the plate sufficiently on
one side to allow the insertion of the nozzle of the Lister flask or the
point of the pipette. The cells thus charged were placed in the
moist chamber ; the gelatin rapidly set, and at the end of from three
to five days the colonies of growth were counted in the usual way
and their general nature determined.
   The weight of the drop or drops taken varied from 20 to 100 mgrs.,
the gelatin in which the drop was cultivated from 15 to 20 grams,
so that the minute quantity of disinfectant contained in the drop
itself was diluted from 200 to 1000 times.     This amount of dilution
with the comparatively weak percentages of disinfectants used would
reduce the action of the disinfectant on the gelatin, the cultivating

soil — to a minimum, so that practically as soon as the micro-organisms
still surviving were floated into the nutrient gelatin they were
removed from the sphere of disinfectant influence.
    Phenol and Cresol. — It is of importance to know the relative dis
infectant powers of phenol and cresol, and for this purpose the
following comparative experiment was made.                      Two quantities of
sewage were respectively treated with phenol and cresol, so that
the mixtures were equivalent to l-9 per cent., and allowed to act for
twenty-four hours ; the mean of two strictly concordant experiments
gave the following as the number of colonies which at the end of
four days could be enumerated —
                                                          No. of colonies per gram

    None of the colonies in the disinfected sewage liquefied the

phenol     were   to the other colonies as 3:5, the fungi in the cresol
experiment were to the other colonies as 1 : 7. Weight for weight,
pure crystalline phenol and pure liquid cresol seem to be about
equal in disinfectant power.*
    In another experiment 10 grams of phenol and 10 grams of cresol
were mixed respectively           with 90 grams of pure calcic hydrate.
1 gram of each of these powders was digested with 100 grams of
sewage for twenty-four hours.              The results of the cultivation were
as follows : —

to sewage in such proportion that the mixtures of sewage and iron
represented 16-4, 9-2, and 5-3 per cent. of ferric perchloride ; the three
mixtures were placed on one side at the ordinary temperature for

   It   was noted    that the colonies developed comprised all classes
of   micro-organisms   — mucors, aspergilli, bacilli, bacteria, and micro
cocci having all their representatives.
    The proportion of fungi to the other growths was carefully deter
mined with the following results : — No. 1, the number of fungoid
growths to the rest was as 1 : 48 ; in No. 2, as 1 : 5 ; in No. 3, as
1  : 4.
    Zinc Chloride. — In the same sewage which formed the subject of
the previous experiments zinc chloride was dissolved, and the solu

   Mercuric Chloride. — Equal volumes of a O-l per cent, solution of
mercuric chloride and sewage were mixed together and allowed to act
for twenty-four hours.
   To another portion of the sewage mercuric chloride was added so
as to he in the exact proportion of 0-1 per cent. ; this also was allowed
to act for twenty-four hours.
   The result was as follows : —
                                                    No. of colonies per gram

   Chloride of Lime. — A gram of chloride of lime of average quality
was added to 100 grams of sewage and placed in an incubator set at
37° ; after twenty-four hours weighed drops of the sewage were
cultivated.
   At the same time 2 grams of chloride of lime were added to
 100 grams of the sewage and digested for twenty-four hours, at the
ordinary temperature, and cultivated side by side with the above. In
each the sewage had a very distinct odour of chlorine.
   The result of the cultivation was as follows : —

   Aniline. — 1 gram of sewage was added to 99 grams of saturated
 aniline water, allowed to stand at the ordinary temperature of the
 atmosphere for twenty-four hours, and then drops weighed out and
 cultivated.

    On the fourth day of cultivation the colonies produced were calcu
lated to be equal to 33,846 per gram of the original sewage, which
 when not disinfected yielded 1,490,000 per gram.        It was noted that
 the fungi were to the other organisms as 4 : 7. About 1500 of the
colonies were of the class that liquefy the gelatine.
    Quinine Sulphate.— A saturated solution of quinine sulphate was
made by boiling the crystals with water, allowing to cool, and filtering
from the crystals which separated. The strength of this solution was
ascertained by evaporating 10 c.c. to dryness in a tared platinum dish.
It was found in this way to be equal to 0-3 per cent. of the anhydrous
sulphate.
    1 gram of sewage was mixed with 50 grams of the saturated solu
tion, and after acting for twenty-four hours drops were weighed out
and cultivated.
   The colonies developed at the end of five days were noted to bo
about one-half composed of fungi, and to equal 48,936 per gram of
the original sewage, which, as previously stated, contained 1,490,000
per gram.
    Terebene. — 20   c.c. of terebeno were added to 100 c.c. of sewage and
digested   with  frequent agitation for twenty-four hours at the common
temperature.      In this way the sewage was saturated with as much
terebene as the conditions would allow, the excess separating and
floating in an upper stratum.        A small quantity of the lower liquid
was   transferred   to   the weighing  bottle, and some drops weighed out
 for cultivation.
    At the end of four days the number of colonies were only equal to
83 per gram of the original sewage, nor did any fresh colonies make
their appearance even after keeping the cell in the moist chamber for
ten days.
   Polassic Permanganate. — Two flasks, each containing 1 gram of
crystallised permanganate, were submitted for twenty-four hours to
different temperatures, viz., the one at 18°, the other in an incubator
set at 37°.
   The sewage used was the same as in the former experiments, and
contained over a million and a quarter of centres of growth when
cultivated in its normal state.
   The sewage and permanganate which had been placed at the lower
temperature yielded on cultivation colonies of micro-organisms equal
to 171 to the gram, but that which had been incubated at 37° showed
no sign of growth.
   Ammonia,      hydroxylamine, methylamine, ethylamine. — Solutions of
ammonia, hydroxylamine, methylamine, and propylamine were made
twice the strength of normal ; that is to say, that doublo the equi
valent of ammonia (17), of hydroxylamine (33), &c, was dissolved
in a litre of water. To one volume of each of these solutions one

volume    of sewage was added, and the whole allowed to rest at the
ordinary temperature for twenty-four hours, at the end of which
time drops of each were weighed out and cultivated in the usual
manner.     The control was the same sewage diluted with an equal
bulk of sterilised water.

           3. The  Action of Disinfectants on Typhoid    Excreta.
   Eberth, Klebs, and Gaffky have each described micro-organisms
which they consider peculiar to abdominal typhus, i.e., enteric or
typhoid fever.     Gaffky has specially studied the question, and
describes, with great minuteness, the manner of growth of a bacillus
which he found in twenty-six out of twenty-eight typhoid bodies
(Gaffky,
           " Zur Oetiologie des Abdominal Typhus." " Mittheilungen
aus dem Kaiserlichen Gesundheitsamte," 2 Band, Berlin, 1884). The
bacillus grows in nutrient gelatin, in light brown colonies, which do
not liquefy the gelatin ; if a minnte portion of one of the colonies be
taken up on a needle and transferred to a drop of water for micro
scopic observation, the bacillus is seen to have the power of self-move
ment.    If the bacillus is sown on sterlised potatoes, a peculiar sort
of pellicle in about forty-eight hours is produced, formed wholly of
bacilli.   The method of growth on gelatin, on potato, and the
power of self-movement, taken together, Gaffky considers to belong
to no other bacillus hitherto described.    At the ordinary temperature
no spores were formed, but they were readily produced when the
bacillus was cultivated on potato at a blood heat.
   Gaffky, although seldom failing to find this bacillus in typhoid
bodies, could not detect it in the excreta.
   In the study of the action of disinfectants on typhoid excreta, it
was necessary to first determine the number of colonies which could
be raised by cultivation from a gram of the typhoid matter operated
upon, and also search for any distinctive organism.
   From a typical case of typhoid fever, on the tenth day of the
disease, a small quantity of the typhoid stool was obtained ; it was
very liquid, offensive, of a light brown colour, and free from blood.
A portion of this was weighed and diluted with sterilised water, so

 1885.]         Studies  of Disinfectants   by New Methods.           273
 that the solution equalled 5 per 1000. Weighed drops of this solution
were cultivated,    and the number of colonies obtained enumerated.
According to the mean of four experiments the number per gram of
colonies of all kinds in the original typhoid stool was 1,031,250.
    Of these various growths 40 per cent. were forms of mucor and asper-
 gillus, about 20 per cent. were bacilli, bacteria, and micrococci, which,
 from their manner of growth and general characters, seemed to belong
 to common and familiar forms, and were not farther investigated.
    Besides these there were some light brown colonies which grew
slowly, the one generally in almost circular spheres, the other in
 flatter irregular wart-like masses ; neither of these growths while
 cultivated on the thin sheet of gelatin-peptone in the glass cell
seemed to liquefy the gelatine, that is, within five or six days of culti
 vation, for observation could not be carried on longer than this period,
other common organisms, saeh- as B. termo, liquefying the whole mass
 and mixing up the colonies.       It was, therefore, necessary for the
 farther study of these brown colonies (which might be Gaffky's
 bacillus) to obtain of each pure cultivations. For this purpose a
minute quantity of each was transplanted into a test tube of nutrient
 gelatin by means of a sterilised platinum wire ; from this cultiva
 tion a second was produced, and from the second a third. As the
 general behaviour of the various cultivations never altered, nor could
 any foreign element be detected, the last cultivations were considered
to be pure, and from these the surface of sterilised slices of potatoes
were inoculated. The bacillus, which may be referred to as bacillus (a),
and which grew in a more or less spherical manner in the sheet
gelatin, when transferred to a test-tube of solid gelatin-peptone,
liquefies very slowly the gelatin, growing always in contact with the
air. On potato it extends as a dirty scum. The bacilli examined in
water showed no power of self-movement.           The irregularly growing
brown colony, which may be called bacillus (i>), also very slowly
liquefies the gelatin, but only along the track of the needle. A
test-tube cultivation at the end of from fourteen to twenty days has
the following appearance. Along the track of the needle there is
a cone-shaped perfectly liquid mass.         On the surface of the liquid
float little detached white-brown colonies ; at the bottom is a white
deposit composed of colonies which, having been formed on the
surface in contact with the air, have slowly sunk.       The liquid inter
vening between the deposit and upper floating colonies is perfectly
clear.   On potato the bacillus grows rapidly, forming an irregularly-
shaped brownish crust, and ultimately presents an appearance very
similar to the common wall lichen (Parmelia parietina).
    Whether these bacilli have any connexion with the typhoid state or
not, the characters described are quite different from those of Gaffky's
bacillus.
                                                                T 2

 274                           Mr. A. W. Blyth.                        [Nov. 26
    Whatever their significance      may be, they were for this particular
sample   of excreta  distinctive,  and   moreover had such a special manner
 of growth that they could be readily recognised by the unaided sight,
 so that their presence or absence in the succeeding experiments could
 be easily noted.
   The disinfectants     first experimented    upon were some       in common
use, such as ferrous sulphate, cresol, and potassic permanganate.
    Ferrous Sulphate. — To the 0'5 per cent. typhoid water crystals of the
 sulphate were added and allowed to remain at the ordinary tempera
ture for twelve hours, crystals at the end of that period were still
undissolved,    so that in effect the solution was saturated.
   Of this liquid   a quantity equal to 125 mgrms. of the original typhoid
stool was taken for cultivation.          Growth was rapid ; at the end of
three days fifteen colonies were counted, composed of common
liquefying bacteria and bacilli ; besides these, there were sixty-five
others which did not liquefy the gelatine, i.e., within the same time,
among which were to be found both kinds of the light brown bacilli
above described.      The total number of colonies calculated per gram of
the original typhoid matter, which had escaped destruction, were thus
640.
   Cresol. — The crude carbolic acid of commerce, so largely used for
disinfecting purposes, is a mixture of phenol and cresol with small
quantities of other tar principles.       The cheapest carbolic acid may be
considered impure cresol, all phenol that the manufacturer                   can
possibly crystallise out having been removed ; hence in the following
experiments with Calvert's cresol some information is obtained as
to the value of the disinfection of typhoid matters as ordinarily
performed.
   An exact   1  per cent. solution of cresol was made in typhoid water,
and drops weighed out, at the end of fifteen minutes, three hours,
and twenty-four hours respectively.
   The number of colonies per gram of the original typhoid matter
appearing at the end of four days' cultivation was as follows          : —
                                                       No. of colonies per gram

   The brown colonies were not detected in the last cultivation, but
were present in the others.
   The experiments were next extended to the amines and to the
pyridine series, substances, the action of which on Bacterium termo
and on sewage had already been studied.

   Ammonia, hydroxylamine, and the amines. — The same strength of
solution of ammonia and the amines employed in the treatment of
sewage was also used in the experiments on typhoid matter.
   The   0-5 per cent. of typhoid stool was diluted with an equal volume
of these solutions,     with of course the result that every 100 parts
contained     by weight one-tenth       of an equivalent of ammonia,
hydroxylamine, and the amines, and 0-25 per cent. of typhoid matter.
   As a control one volume of typhoid water was diluted with one
volume of sterilised water and cultivated side by side with the others.
 At the end of four days the colonies were enumerated, the light brown
 bacilli (a) and (b) were present as well as representatives of all others
seen in the control.

   The order in which the different amines stand is pretty well the
same as in the similar experiment on the disinfection of sewage (see
ante), but none of them seem to be strong disinfectants.
   The Pyridine Series. — 2 per cent. solutious of pyridine, C5H5N,
picoline, C6H7N, lutidine, C7H9N, and parvoline, C9H13N, were made in
20 per cent, alcohol.       Equal volumes of these solutions were then
mixed with equal volumes of the 0-5 per cent. typhoid water, and after
the end of twenty-four hours weighed drops were cultivated.
   Pyridine. — The quantity taken for cultivation of the typhoid water
was equivalent to 0-5 mgrm. of the typhoid stool. After four days'
cultivation three colonies developed, two of these were common
moulds, the third a common bacillus.
   Picoline. — After four days' cultivation, a quantity of the solution
equivalent to 0-885 mgrm. of typhoid yielded fifteen colonies, five of
which were identical with the light brown bacillus (a) already
described.
   Lutidine. — After four days' cultivation, a quantity of the solution

of which seemed of a common kind.

equivalent to 0 85 mgrm. of typhoid stool yielded five colonies, five of

   Summary. — From the three series of experiments certain general
conclusions may be drawn ; these are as follows : —
   1. The relative merits of phenol and cresol as a disinfectant are
fairly equal, as shown by experiments on- Bacterium termo and on
sewage, so that preference for one or the other must be determined
from considerations apart from degrees of activity.*
   2. Ferrous sulphate as a disinfectant of Bacterium termo, of sewage,
and of typhoid excreta is shown to be unreliable.                      Even strong
solutions fail to destroy all classes of micro-organisms.               Considering
the extensive    use  of  ferrous   sulphate   in cases     of  typhoid fever, and
that in both scientific and popular manuals ferrous sulphate is
confidently recommended as a disinfectant of specific excreta, it seems
important to accentuate the fact that my experiments are in their
result wholly opposed to the popular view and custom.
   3. The experiments       on the amines clearly show that the disin
fectant action of members of that series differs in degree according to
the displacement of hydrogen by methyl, ethyl, propyl, or hydroxyl.
 The connexion       between chemical constitution and disinfectant
action is also seen in the experiments on the pyridine series, but is not
so marked.
   4.  Other things being equal, the shorter the time a disinfectant
acts, the less the disinfection ; this was shown very clearly in the
experiments    on typhoid excreta treated with cresol for varying
periods of time.      It, therefore, necessarily follows that even when
strong disinfectants are poured on to specific excreta, and the whole
within a few minutes thrown into a drain or cesspool, which by
great dilution more or less removes the excreta from the sphere of
disinfectant influence, no true disinfection has been accomplished.
   5. Disinfection is far more efficient at 35-5° to 37°, the temperatures
at which development and growth of micro-organisms                   is most active,
than at ordinary temperatures.          This is shown in the experiments on
Bacterium termo with phenol, cresol, lutidine, collidine, and potassic
permanganate, as well as in the experiments in the treatment of
sewage with chloride of lime and potassic permanganate.

   The President then addressed the Society       as follows : —
   At  the earliest opportunity after my return to England last spring,
I offered my very grateful acknowledgements to the Society for the
kindness with which the Fellows had condoned my enforced absence
from my post during the winter. And         I should not venture to occupy
your time by recurring to the subject, did not the return of St.
Andrew's day admonish me that duty and inclination alike require me
to offer my especial thanks to the Treasurer for the cheerful readiness
with which he took upon himself the burden of my duties, and the
efficiency with which he discharged them on our last Anniversary.
   On the last occasion on which I had the honour to address you, it
was my painful duty to commence by lamenting the death of a very
eminent member of the Society, who was, at the same time, one of
my oldest and most intimate friends.         I deeply regret to find myself
once more in this position.        The lamentable accident which has
deprived the Society of one of its oldest and most distinguished
Fellows, Dr. Carpenter, has robbed me of a friend, whose kindly
sympathy and help were invaluable to me five-and-thirty years ago,
and who has never failed me since.
   You are all acquainted with Dr. Carpenter's great and long continued
services to science as an investigator and as an expositor of remarkable
literary skill ; and there must be many here who, having worked with
him in the University of London, of which he was so long Registrar,
are familiar with the high integrity, the energy, and the knowledge,
which marked him as an administrator. He was a man of varied
accomplishments outside the province of science, single-minded            in
aim, stainless in life, respected by all with whom he came in contact.
   Within the last few days, Physics has lost an eminent representa

 tive in Dr. Thomas Andrews, of Belfast. Among the cultivators of
 Chemical Science we have to regret the decease of Mr. Field, who
 was one of the original members of the Chemical Society ; of Mr.
 Weldon, and of Dr. Voelcker, whose names are well known in con-
nexion with manufacturing and agricultural chemistry.         In Biology,
we have lost Dr. Davidson, whose elaborate monographs on the fossil
Brachiopoda are remarkable examples of accurate malacological work
combined with artistic skill ; Dr. Gwyn Jeffreys, the veteran explorer
of our marine molluscous fauna, and a high authority on conchology ;
and Dr. Morrison Watson, whose early death has cut short the career
of an anatomist of much promise.            Mineralogy has suffered a
similar loss by the premature death of Dr. Walter Flight. In
Engineering Science, we have to lament the deaths of Mr. Barlow
and Professor Fleeming Jenkin.       I may be permitted to dwell for a
moment upon the latter name, as that of a most genial and accom
plished man and a valued personal friend, with whom it had been my
privilege to be associated for a time in his well-directed and successful
efforts to improve the sanitary condition of our cities.       The elder
generation of English geologists will remember the keen interest
which the Earl of Selkirk took in their pursuits.      The death of Lord
Houghton robs ns of a connecting link with all the world.
    Three very distinguished names have disappeared from the ranks
of our foreign members: that of Henle, of Gottingen, among whose
many merits must stand that of ranking next after Schwann among
the founders of histology; that of the venerable Henry Milne-
Edwards, of Paris, one of the most distinguished members of the
school of Cuvier, and admirable no less for his contributions to
zoological philosophy than for the extent and the precision of his
additions to our knowledge of facts ; and lastly, that of Von Siebold,
of Munich, whose remarkable investigations into the phenomena of
parasitism and of sexless reproduction brought about the solution of
some of the most difficult problems of zoology, while it would be
difficult to exaggerate the influence of his wonderfully accurate and
comprehensive
                 " Handbook " on the progress of invertebrate zoology
forty years ago.
    On the 1st of December last year the total number of Fellows of
the Royal Society amounted to 519 ; of these 473 were on the home
and 46 on the foreign list. Deducting Her Majesty, our Patron, and
four other Royal personages, the number on the home list was 468.
At the present moment, we have 45 foreign members ; while the total
strength of the home list (deducting Royal personages) is 465, or
three fewer than twelve months ago. The number of deaths in the
home list during the past year is 20.     This is a larger mortality than
that of last year ; and it still exceeds the number of Fellows added
to the Society by election, which during the past year was 16;

280                         Anniversary Meeting.                 [Nov. 30,
namely,       the statutory 15 Fellows   elected in the ordinary way and
1    Privy Councillor.
   As the Treasurer observed in his address on the last Anniversary,
it is obvious that we are rapidly approaching a state of equilibrium
between our losses and our gains ; and under the present conditions
of election, the strength of the home list may be expected to remain
somewhere botween 460 and 470.
   While our number thus tends to remain stationary,       the list of can
didates for the Fellowship, though it has fluctuated a     good deal from
year to year, has, on the whole, become longer, until,     at present, the
candidates are more than four times as numerous            as   the annual
elections sanctioned by our rules.     This state of things has given
rise to comment, both within and without the Society, on more than
one occasion.   It has been said that any restriction upon the number
of our Fellows is unwise, inasmuch as we narrow our influence and
diminish our revenues thereby ; and, by way of a still more uupleasant
suggestion, it is hinted that, by such limitations, we lay ourselves
open to the charge of a desire to arrogate to ourselves the position of
the elect of science.
     With respect to the first objection   I to point out, that the
                                               venture
influence of the Society upon the advancement of science is not by
any means measured either by its numerical strength or by the
amount of the funds at its disposal.
  And, as to the second charge or insinuation, if it is worth while to
meet it at all (which may be doubtful),         I
                                         am disposed to think that,
in another than the invidious sense of the words, it is highly desirable
that the Fellows of the Royal Society should regard themselves, and
be regarded by others, as the elect of science. An organisation which
was the direct product of the new birth of science in the days of
Gilbert, of Galileo, and of Harvey ; which was one of the earliest of
the associations founded for the sole purpose of promoting natural
knowledge ; and which has so faithfully performed its functions that
it is inseparably associated with all the great strides which science
has made for two centuries, has insensibly and without effort become
a recognised representative of men of science in these islands : as
such, on the one hand, it is consulted by the Government on scientific
questions ; and, on the other hand, it claims the right to be heard by
the Government on all questions of scientific interest.     I believe it to
be impossible that the Society should discharge the functions which
it has not sought, but which have thus devolved upon      it,satisfactorily,
unless    really does consist, in one sense, of the elect of science that
         it                                                         ;
is to say unless every care   is taken to keep its scientific character at
the level of its scientific reputation, and to ensure that it shall be not
the mere figure-bead of the scientific body, but a living association of
representative men engaged in all branches of scientific activity.

1885.]                      Presidents Address.                      281
   Those among my hearers whose memories go back forty years will
remember that, at that time, the Society was in great danger of losing
its scientific character, though it would doubtless have taken it a long
time, and a good deal of perversity, to get rid of its scientific reputa
tion. It had become the fashion to append F.R.S. to a name, and
the scientific members were in danger of being swamped by the
invasion of dilettanti. The aim of our eminent colleague, Sir William
Grove, and his friends, who fought the battle of 1847, and thereby,
to my mind, earned the undying gratitude of all who have the
interests of science at heart, was not to create an academy of im
mortals, but to save the Fellowship of the Society from becoming a
sham and an imposture.         And they succeeded in their object by
carrying a measure of reform which embodied two principles —
the first, that of the practical responsibility of the Council for the
elections, the second, that of the limitation of the number of can
didates annually elected.     The result of the steady adherence of the
Society to these principles for thirty-eight years is that, year by
year, the Society has approached more and more closely to that
representative    character which,  I cannot but think, it is eminently
desirable it should possess.
    During a great part of this time    I   have enjoyed more and closer
opportunities than most people of watching the working of our
Bystem.      Mistakes have been made now and then, no doubt, for even
members of Council are fallible ; but it is more than thirty years
-ince the propriety of the selections made by the Council has been
challenged at a general meeting ; and     I  have never heard a question
raised as to the conscientiousness with which the work is done, or
as to the desire of the Council to mete out even-handed justice to
the devotees of all branches of science.          I am very st'ongly of
opinion that if the Royal Society were a " Chamber of Science,"
subject to dissolution, and that after such dissolution a general
election, by universal suffrage of the members of all scientific bodies
in the kingdom, took place, an overwhelming majority of the present
Fellows would be re-elected.
    Such being my conviction, it is natural that      I should express a
fervent hope that the Society will never be tempted to depart from the
principles of the method by which, at present, it recruits its strength.
It is quite another question, however, whether it is desirable to
retain the present limit to our annual addition or to increase it.
   There is assuredly nothing sacred in the number 15 ; nor any good
reason that I know of for restricting the total strength of our home
list to 460 or 470 ; so long as our recruits approve themselves good
soldiers of scieoce the more we enrol the better.         And if   I may
pursue the metaphor, I will add that I do not think it desirable that
our corps should consist altogether of general officers. Any such

282                       Anniversary Meeting.                   [Nov. 30,
exclusiveness would deprive us of much useful service, and seriously
interfere with the representative character in which our strength
lies.    I think we ought to he in touch with the whole world of science
in the country, and constitute a microcosm answering to that macro
cosm. Those who are in favour of making a change observe that the
limit of fifteen was fixed nearly forty years ago ; that the number
of those who occupy themselves seriously with science and attain a
position which would .undoubtedly have brought them into the
Society at that time, has increased and is constantly increasing ; and
that it is undesirable that we should be compelled to leave out of our
body, year after year, persons whom we should be very glad to see in
it.   On the other hand, it is to be recollected that a change once made
can hardly be revoked, and that, in view of the importance of such a
step, the Society will do well to make sure of the consequences before
taking it.
    I have thought it desirable to raise the question, not for the purpose
of suggesting any immediate action — for my personal opinion is that,
at present, no change is desirable — but in order that the attention of
the Fellows may be directed to a matter which I think is sure to
come before them in a practical shape before many Anniversaries go
by. And, whenever that time arrives, I think another problem may
possibly offer itself for solution.     Since this Society was founded,
English-speaking communities have been planted and are increasing
and multiplying in all quarters of the globe — to use a naturalist's
                                               " world wide." Wherever
phrase, their geographical distribution is
these communities have had time to develop, the instinct which led
our forefathers to come together for the promotion of natural know
ledge has worked in them and produced most notable results.            The
quantity and quality of the scientific work now being done in the
United States moves us all to hearty admiration ; the Dominion of
Canada, and our colonies in South Africa, New Zealand and Australia,
show that they do not mean to be left behind in the race ; and the
scientific activity of our countrymen in India needs no comment.
    Whatever may be the practicability of political federation for more
or fewer of the rapidly growing English-speaking peoples of the globe,
some sort of scientific federation should surely be possible. Nothing is
baser than scientific Chauvinism, but still blood is thicker than water ;
and    I  have often ventured to dream that the Royal Society might
associate itself in some special way with all English-speaking men of
science ; that it might recognise their work in other ways than by the
rare opportunities at present offered by election to our foreign Fellow
ship, or by the award of those medals which are open to everybody ;
and without imposing upon them the responsibilities of the ordinary
Fellowship, while they must needs be deprived of a large part of its
privileges. How far this aspiration of mine may be reciprocated by

not know :    I make it public, on my own responsibility, for yonr and
their consideration.
    I am anxious to call the attention of the Fellows to an alteration in
our rules, in virtue of which it is hoped that the valuable library of
the Society will be made more extensively useful to them by being
accessible up to a later hour than heretofore, and by better provision
for the comfort and convenience of those who desire to read or writo
in the Society's rooms.
    The funds of the Society have been augmented in various ways
dnring the past year.
   A few weeks ago, our distinguished colleague Sir William Armstrong
wrote to me proposing to make a very handsome, indeed,         I may say,
munificent contribution to our finances. The precise form which the
gift should take was left open to discussion, and it was only at the
meeting of Council to-day that the matter was finally settled by the
letter addressed to me, on behalf of Sir W. Armstrong, by Captain
Noble, which I proceed to read to the Society : —
    " Referring to the communications which have passed between
yourself and Sir W. Armstrong with regard to a proposed gift by
Sir William to the Society, I have had some discussion with Sir
W. Armstrong as to the form which his proposed donation should
take.
    " Sir W. Armstrong is
                             very anxious that the Scientific Relief Fund
Trust should be raised from £7,600, the amount at which I think it
now stands, to £20,000, and he has authorised me to say that if the
Fellows, with the assistance if necessary of other friends of science
outside of the Society, see their way to raise £6,500, he will himself
give a second £6,500, thus making up the desired sum.
    "The only condition, or rather request, that he makes in connexion
with this gift is that, in the event of any Fellow being in such circum
stances as to make the payment of his subscription burdensome to
him, the Council for the time being will order the payment of such
subscription out of the income arising from the Relief Fund."
    The President and Council have accepted Sir William Armstrong's
generous gift, and have offered him their hearty thanks for it ; they
have already been promised contributions by other Fellows of the
 Society, and they trust that there will be no difficulty in making up
the sum required.
    The value of the fee for the Croonian Lecture has been increased
from £2 18*. 9d. to about £50 a-year, by the falling in of certain
 leases.

Darwin Memorial.        I  am happy to say that Mr. Boehm's admirable
statue was formally and publicly accepted by H.R.H. the Prince of
Wales, on behalf of the Trustees of the British Museum, last
summer, and now adorns the entrance hall of the Natural History
Museum at South Kensington. The balance of the sum raised,
amounting to £2,000, has been handed over to the Royal Society, and
the interest thereof will be employed under the name of the " Darwin
Fund for the Promotion of Biological Research " in any way the
President and Council may think fit.       I sincerely trust that this fund
may be increased from time to time, as the Donation Fund, founded
by Dr. Wollaston, has been ; and that its beneficent influence on the
progress of biological science may thus keep green the memory of the
great man whose name it bears, in the way which, assuredly, would
have been most agreeable to himself.
     I am sure that  I  may express your acknowledgments to Mr. James
Budgett for the repetition of his liberal donation of £100 in aid of the

   We are indebted to the subscribers to the Henry Smith Memorial
for the marble replica of the bust by Mr. Boehm of that eminent
mathematician and most accomplished scholar, which now ornaments
our library. The Fine Art Society has presented Mr. Flameng's etching

    Among the presents to the Library, I may particularly mention the
second volume of Professor G. Retzins' valuable and splendidly
illustrated work " Das Gehdr-organ der Wirbelthiere " ; and " Les

respective authors; and four volumes of the "Challenger" Report,

appeared since the last Anniversary.         Only one part of the Philoso
phical Transactions has been as yet published ; but two other parts
 (Parts I and  II for 1885) are passing simultaneously through the press.
    The possibility of devising means by which papers read before us
may be published more rapidly, has seriously engaged the attention
of the Officers of the Society, and        I trust that, before long, the
Council may have some well-conceived plan for achieving that end
brought under their consideration.      While all will agree in deprecating
unnecessary retardation, it must be remembered that a certain delay is
absolutely necessary, if the Committee of Papers is to discharge with
due care its important function of arriving at a sound judgment,
after considering the opinions of responsible specialists on the merits
 of each paper submitted to it. In substance,        I do not think that we

   The preparation of copy for the Catalogue     of Scientific Papers,
decade 1874 — 85, now approaches completion.     A total of 290 series
have been indexed, giving 85,000 title slips, written, checked, and
distributed.    This number, which is within 10,000 of that contained
in the two volumes of the preceding decade, nearly exhausts the
material in our own library ; it remains to supplement this by
reference to other libraries.
   At the meeting on the 18th of June last, our Fellow, Professor
Roy, communicated to the Council the project entertained by himself,
Dr. Graham Brown, of Edinburgh, and Mr. Sherington (G. H.
Lewes Student, Cambridge), of proceeding to Spain with a view of
investigating the nature of cholera, and requested the assistance of
the Royal Society.
   In view of the great practical importance of such an investigation,
and the desirableness of making a new attempt to solve a problem
about which highly competent inquirers have arrived at contra
dictory results, the President and Council resolved to do everything
which lay in their power to assist Dr. Roy and his colleagues.
The Secretary was instructed to inquire of the Spanish Minister
whether the proposed investigations would be agreeable to the Spanish
authorities, and whether Dr. Roy might expect to obtain facilities and
assistance.    On the receipt of a courteous and sympathetic letter
from his Excellency, the Secretary was further instructed to inform
the Foreign Office of Dr. Roy's expedition, and to request that Her
Majesty's Government would afford him and his colleagues all the
assistance in their power.      Moreover, £150 was granted from the
Donation Fund in aid of the expenses of the undertaking, which
were shared between the Royal Society and the Society for the
Advancement of Medicine by Research.
   I  am sure the Fellows of the Society will join with me in con
gratulating Dr. Roy, Dr. Brown, and Mr. Sherington on having
returned safe and sound from an adventure in which the interest of
scientific inquiry must have been heightened by a considerable spice
of personal danger.     Dr. Roy has furnished me with a brief pre
liminary report of the work done, the substance of which I proceed
to lay before the Society.
   The member of the Commission met with very serious difficulties
in their attempts to study the pathology of cholera in Spain, where
they spent three months ; but owing to the powerful support which
 was given them by the English Embassy in Madrid, they were

28b-                       Anniversary Meeting.                  [Nov. 30,
able   eventually to pursue their studies    in   a satisfactory manner.
At   Aranjuez and Madrid they obtained       free access to the cholera
hospitals, and made nearly thirty autopsies of typical cholera cases
within very short periods after death.         From all of these cases
they were able to obtain material for cultivation and thus to make
a large series of investigations      on the different forms of micro
organisms which are found in the tissues and intestinal contents of
cholera    cases.   Owing, however, to the impossibility of obtaining
animals for     inoculation, and reagents of various kinds, they were
unable to complete their inquiry in Spain, and they were obliged to
leave the investigations of certain points until their return to
England. They have directed their attention chiefly to the relation
which the comma bacillus, first described by Koch, bears to the
cholera process, and they hope to be able to make important addi
tions to our knowledge of this important subject.             They are at
present engaged in completing their work, and in the course of a
few weeks they hope to be able to present their report to the Royal
Society.
    The Marine Biological Association, to the funds of which the
 Royal Society made a substantial contribution last year, is making
good progress.      A site for building has been granted by the War
 Office, at Plymouth ; plans have been prepared, and if the Treasury
will follow the precedent which it has so largely and beneficially
 adopted in educational matters, of helping those who help them
 selves, as I am glad to say my Lords seem inclined to do,     I trust that,
 before long, the laboratory will be in working order.
    The prosecution of the borings in the Delta of the Nile, to which
 reference has been made on previous Anniversaries, have unfortunately
 been hindered by various obstacles.        Quite recently    I  have been
 favoured by Colonel H. Maitland, R.E., with an account of the
 borings made near Rosetta, in which a depth of 153 feet was reached
 without apparently attaining the bottom of the fluviatile deposits ;
 and I hope that circumstances may shortly permit the resumption of
 the original project of carrying a line of borings across the Valley of
 the Nile on the parallel of Tantah or thereabouts.
    In the meanwhile the Committee in charge of the investigation
 has presented a report by Professor Judd on the results of the exami
 nation of the borings formerly made. I have been favoured by
 Professor Judd with the following brief summary of these results,
 which have been fully set forth in a paper read at the first meeting
 of the Society after the recess.-
    Although two of the recent borings in the Nile Delta have attained
 depths of 73 and 84 feet respectively, yet neither of them has reached
 the rocky floor of the old Nile Valley, nor, indeed, have they afforded

  1885.]                     President* Address.                       287
  any indications of an approach to the solid rock. The samples of
 the Delta deposits obtained by these boring operations are found to
 be iu all cases mixtures, in varying proportions, of Nile mud; or
 material carried in suspension by the river and desert sand, or parti,
 cles swept in from the surrounding districts by the action of winds.
 The study of these materials by the aid of the microscope has
 revealed a number of facts which may be made the basis of generali
 sations of considerable interest to geologists.
    The minerals present in these sands and muds are found to be such
as characterise the granitic, and highly crystalline metamorphic rocks ;
 there can be litle doubt, therefore, that the vast regions included
within the Nile basin are in the main composed of rocks belonging to
those classes, or of sedimentary deposits derived directly from them.
    Of still greater interest is the fact that the fragments of felspars
and other complex silicates in the Delta deposits exhibit but slight
 evidence of kaolinisation or other chemical change.        This points to
 the conclusion that, in the rainless districts drained by the Nile, the
disintegration of rocks is effected by mechanical rather than by
chemical agencies. A very striking confirmation of this conclusion
is afforded by the study of the composition of the waters of the
Nile, our knowledge of which has been greatly advanced by the recent
researches of Dr. C. M. Tidy.      In spite of the circumstances that the
¦waters    of the Nile must undergo great concentration during its
passage of 1,400 miles through regions of exceptional            heat and
drought, it is found that those waters actually hold in solution little
more than one-half the percentage of mineral matter which is present
in the river waters of temperate and rainy regions. The chemical
 disintegration of rocks being so largely due to the action of rain and
vegetation, it is not surprising to find that where these agencies are
almost entirely absent the rocks exhibit but few signs of chemical
change.
    The Krakatoa Committee, which is now rather a large one, con
sisting of thirteen members, has been steadily at work during the
year ; and the discussion of the very varied and large mass of data
has been undertaken by sub-committees, dealing respectively with
the following branches : —
      Geological — including eruption and earthquake phenomena, and
         the geological features of the distribution of dust and pumice.

     With the exception of the last-named       Sub-Committee, viz., that
 upon    Tidal Waves,   of which  the work has been  delayed by the illness
  of Sir F. Evans, all the reports are now in a forward state, and there
 seems to be every prospect of the work buing concluded in the course
 of a very few months.
     The question    of the proper administration of the funds adminis
 tered on behalf of the. Government by the representatives         of the
 Royal Society and of other scientific bodies, who constitute the
 Government Grant Committee, has frequently been debated with
 much care by the President and Council, who are held responsible for
 the final assignment of the grant by the Government.
    On the 20th of May last the Council determined, once again, to
 devote special attention to the subject, and on the 25th June the
minutes will inform you that the following resolutions were passed : —
    " That in every    case  of renewed application for a personal grant,
after such grant has been received by the applicant in two consecutive
years, the application be made not less than three months before it is
to be considered, accompanied by a full statement of the case from
the applicant, and that before being presented to the Committee, it be
referred by the Council to two referees, who shall report to the
Council on its merits."
    "That the Secretaries be instructed to return to the applicants for
aid from the Government Grant such applications as do not in all
particulars comply with the conditions laid down in the circular to
applicants."
    It is very desirable that our intention to enforce the latter resolu
tion strictly should be widely promulgated.       I may add that we have
considerable reason to complain that too frequently those who have ob
tained grants through the Committee make no report of the work done
to the Society, but leave information on that head to reach us as it
may through the publications in which the results obtained by the
grantees are made known.
    Nineteen   large royal quarto volumes of the Official Reports on the
 Scientific Results  of the "Challenger" Expedition have now been issued
from the press. These contain thirty-seven zoological, three botanical,
 and eight physical and chemical reports, together with the narrative
 of the voyage, which contains the general scientific results of the
expedition.      Six more volumes are now passing throngh the press, a
 considerable part of each being already printed off.       The work con
 nected with the remaining memoirs is in a forward state. The whole
 of the investigations and the manuscript will be completed during the
 next financial year, and in the course of the year 1887 the whole of

  In the Treasurer's address last year the Society was fully informed
of the action taken by the President and Council in the matter of
the position of this country with respect to the international " Bureau

                           am happy to be able to report to the Society
that. last December, we received a letter from the Treasury, stating that
my Lords had asked the Secretary of State to instruct the British
Ambassador at Paris to make known to the Comité International des
Poids et Mesures that Her Majesty's Government were willing to
join the Convention on the terms described in our Secretary's letter
of the 18th August, 1884, and that the proposal had been accepted.

attainment of its object — the advancement of technical education in

fulfilling its purpose in the most satisfactory manner, and its day and
evening classes are so numerously attended that an extension of the
building     isunder consideration.    About 250 technical classes in
different parts of  the kingdom are now affiliated to the Institute, and
some of them are already developing into efficient technical schools.
The assistance which the Institute      enabled to afford to these classes
                                             is
is restricted by want of means but there can be no doubt that far

years ago.
   Large additions have been made to the equipment of the Central
Institution at South Kensington. The engineering laboratory and
the extensive chemical and physical laboratories are organised, and
the systematic instruction of students has commenced.    Scholarships

to and accepted by the Governors of       number of public and other

     The City and Guilds Institute is the outcome of the perception of
  the necessity for technical education, in the interests of industry, by
  the wealthiest city and the wealthiest guilds in the world ; it may,
  therefore, seem singular that the chief obstacle to the proper
  development of the important schools which it has founded                  is
  poverty.      Such,    however,   I understand to be the case.  The  Central
  Institution requires an assured income of at least £15,000 a-year if
  it is to work properly; but the joint resources of the City and Guilds
  of London, at present, appear to be able to afford it only a precarious,
  annually-voted, subsidy of £9,000 a-year — far less, that is to say, than
 the private income of scores of individual Londoners. In Germany,
 a similar institution would demand and receive £20,000 a-year as a
 matter of course ; but Englishmen are famous for that which a
 perplexed Chancellor of the Exchequer (I think it was) once called
 their " ignorant impatience of taxation," and there is no occasion
 on which they so readily display that form of impatience                   as
 when they are asked for money for education, especially scientific
 education.       I am bound to add, however, that my experience on the
 Council and Committees of the Institute has left no doubt on my
 mind that my colleagues have every desire to carry out the work they
 have commenced thoroughly ; and that the money difficulty will dis
 appear along with certain other difficulties which,        I  am disposed to
 think, need never have arisen.
     Such    are the chief matters of business, if I may so call them,
which     it is proper for me, in my Presidential capacity, to bring before
the Society.        But it has been not unusual, of late years, for the occu
pant     of  the  Chair    to offer some observations of a wider bearing for
the consideration         of the Society; and I am the more tempted to
trespass upon         your    patience for this purpose, as it is the last
occasion on which           I shall be able to use, or abuse, the President's
privileges.
    So far as my own observations, with respect to some parts of the
field of natural knowledge, and common report, with respect to others,
enable me to form an opinion, the past year exhibits no slackening in
the accelerated        speed with which the physical sciences have been
growing,      alike in  extent and in depth, during several decades. We are
                                      "                          " march of
now so accustomed to this unhasting but unresting
physical investigation ; it has become so much a part of the customary
course of events, that, with every day,        I might almost say with every
hour, something           should be added to our store of information
respecting the constitution of nature, some new insight into the order
of the cosmos should be gained, that you would probably listen with
incredulity to any account of the year's work which could not be
summed np in this commonplace of Presidential addresses.

   Nor shall    I be charged with innovation if     I add that there is no
reason to snspect that the future will bring with it any retardation in
the advance of science.       The adverse influences, which, in the middle
ages, arrested the work commenced by the older Greek philosophers,
are so much weakened that they no longer offer any serious obstacle to
the growth of natural knowledge ; while they are powerless to prevent
the extension of scientific methods of inquiry and the application of
scientific conceptions to all the problems with which the human mind
is confronted.     If any prophecy is safe of fulfilment, it is that, in the
twentieth century, the influence of these methods and conceptions
will be incomparably greater than it is now ; and that the inter-
penetration of science with the common affairs of life, which is so
marked a feature of our time, will be immeasurably closer. For good
or for evil, we have passed into a new epoch of human history — the
age   of science.
   It                                I
       may seem superfluous that should adduce evidence in support of
propositions which must have so much of the nature of truisms to
you who are sharers in the work of science and daily witnesses of the
effects of its productive energy.         But the proverbial tendency of
familiarity to be incompatible with due respect is noticeable even in
our appreciation of the most important truths, and our strongest con
victions need furbishing up now and then, if they are to retain their
proper influence.      I   certainly cannot accuse myself of ever having
consciously entertained a low estimate of the past work or the future
progress of science ; but, a few months ago, enforced leisure and the
attainment of an age when retrospection tends to become a habit, not
to say a foible, led me to look at the facts anew ; and     I  must confess
that the spectacle of the marvellous development of science, alike in
theory and practice,       within my own life- time, appeared     to me to
justify a faith, even more robust than mine, in its future greatness.
   For, if I do not greatly err, the greater part of the vast body of
knowledge which constitutes the modern sciences of physics, chemistry,
biology, and geology has been acquired, and the widest generalisations
therefrom have been deduced, within the last sixty years ; and fur
thermore, the majority of those applications to scientific knowledge to
practical ends, which have brought about the most striking differences
between     our present civilisation and that of antiquity, have been
made within that period of time.
   To begin with the latter point — the practical achievements of
science.     The first railway for locomotives, which was constructed
between Stockton and Darlington, was opened in September, 1825, so
that I have the doubtful advantage of about four months' seniority
over the ancestral representative of the vast reticulated fetching and
carrying organism which now extends its meshes over the civilised
world.    I  confess it fills me with astonishment to think that the time

when no man could travel faster than horses could transport him,
when our means of locomotion were no better than those of Achilles
or of Kamses Maimun, lies within my- memory.            The electric tele
graph, as a thing for practical use, is far my jnnior.      So are arms
of precision, nnless the old rifle be regarded as such.       Again, the
application to hygiene and to the medical and surgical treatment of
men and animals, of our knowledge of the phenomena of parasitism,
and the very discovery of the true order of these phenomena, is a
long way within tho compass of my personal knowledge.
   It is unnecessary for me to enumerate more than- these four of the
many rich gifts made by science to mankind during the -last sixty
years.    Arresting-the survey here, T would ask if there is any corre
sponding period in' previous history which can take credit for so many
momentous applications      of scientific knowledge to the wants of
mankind ? Depredators of the value of natural knowledge are wont
to speak somewhat scornfully of these and such-like benefactions as
mere additions to material welfare.         I
                                           must own to the weakness of
believing   that  material welfare  is  highly desirable in itself, and I
have yet to meet with the man who prefers material .illfare.          But
even if this should be, as some may say, painful evidence of the
materialistic tendencies incidental to scientific pursuits, it is surely
possible, without much ingenuity, or any prejudice in favour of one
or other view of the mutual relations of material and spiritual
phenomena, to show that each of these four applications of science
has exerted a prodigious influence on the moral, social, and political
relations of mankind, and that such influence can only increase as
time goes on.
   If the senseless antipathies, born of isolation, which formerly
converted neighbours, whether ¦they belonged to adjacent families
or to adjacent nations, into natural enemies, are dying away, im
proved means of communication deserve the chief credit of the change ;
if war becomes   less frequent,   it will
                                     be chiefly because its horrors are
being   intensified beyond bearing by the close interdependence and
community of interest thus established between nations, no less than
by the improvement of the means of destruction by scientific inven
tion. Arms of precision have taken the mastery of the world out
of the hands of brute force, and given it into those of industry and
intelligence. If railways and electric telegraphs have rendered it
unnecessary that modern empires should fall to pieces by their own
weight as ancient empires did, arms of precision have provided against
the possibility of their being swept away by barbarous invasions.
Health means not merely wealth, not merely bodily welfare, but
intellectual and moral soundness ; and    doubt I    since the time of

 of cheeking them, even though, as yet, unfortunately, it be only in a
few cases.
   But though these practical results of scientific work, during only
two generations, are calculated to impress the imagination, the
Fellows of this Society know well enough that they are of vastly less
real importance than the additions which have been made to fact
and theory and serviceable hypothesis in the region of pure science.
But it is exactly in these respects that the record of the past half
century is so exceptionally brilliant.        It is sometimes said that our

safe basis, of the greatest of all the generalisations of science, the
doctrines of the Conservation of Energy and of Evolution.
    As for work of less wide scope, I speak in the hearing of those
•who can correct me if     I  am wrong, when I say that the larger moiety
of our present knowledge of light, heat, electricity, and magnetism,
has been acquired within the time to which I refer; and that onr
present chemistry has been in great part created, while the whole
science has been remodelled from foundation to roof.                It may be
natural that progress should appear most striking to me among
those sciences to which my own attention has been directed, but               I
do not think this will wholly account for the apparent advance
                                                                           " by

leaps and bounds       of the biological sciences within my recollection.
The cell theory was the latest novelty when           I began to work with
the microscope, and       I  have watched the building of the whole vast
fabric of histology; I can say almost as much of embryology, since
Von Baer's great work was published in 1828.                   Onr knowledge
of the morphology of the lower animals and plants, and a great deal
of that of the higher forms, has very largely been obtained in my
time ; while physiology has been put upon a totally new foundation
and, as it were reconstructed, by the thorough application of the
experimental method to the study of the phenomena of life, and by
the accurate determination of the purely physical and chemical com
ponents of these phenomena.           The exact nature of the processes of
sexual and nonsexual reproduction has been brought to light.               Onr
knowledge     of geographical      and  geological  distribution,  and  of  the
extinct forms of life, has been increased a hundredfold.            As for the
progress   of  geological    science, what  more   need  be said than  that the

   This brief enumeration of the salient achievements of science in
the course of the last sixty years is sufficient not only to justify
what I have said respecting their absolute value, bnt to show how
much it excels, both in quantity and quality, the work produced
in any corresponding period since the revival of science. It suggests,

 as  I have said, that science is advancing           and  will continue to advance
 with accelerated velocity.
    It  seems to me,      in fact, not only that this is so, hut that there are
 obvious reasons why it must be so.                   In the first place, the inter
 dependence of all the phenomena of nature is such that a seemingly
 unimportant discovery in one field of investigation may react in the
 most wonderful manner upon those which are most widely remote from
it. The investments of science bear compound interest. Who could have
imagined that a curious inquiry iuto the relations of electricity with
magnetism would lead to the construction of the most delicate instru
ments for investigating the phenomena of heat ; to means of measuring
not only the smallest intervals of time, but the greatest depths of the
ocean ; to methods of exploring some of the most hidden secrets of life ?
What an enormons revolution would be made in biology, if physics
or chemistry conld supply the physiologist with a means of making
out the molecular structure of living tissues comparable to that which
the spectroscope affords to the inquirer into the nature of the heavenly
bodies.     At the present moment the constituents of our own bodies
are more remote from our ken than those of Sirius, in this respect.
In the next place, the vast practical importance of the applications
of scientific knowledge has created a growing demand for technical
education based upon science.              If this is to be effective, it means the
extension of scientific teaching to all classes of the community, and
the encouragement and assistance of those who are fit for the work of
scientific investigation to adopt that calling. Lastly, the attraction of
the purely intellectual aspects of science and the rapid growth of a
sense of the necessity of some knowledge of the phenomena of nature,
nnd some discipline in scientific methods of inquiry, to every one who
aspires to take part in, or even to understand, the tendencies of
modern thought, have conferred a new status upon science in the
seats of learning, no less than in public estimation.
    Once more reverting to reminiscence, the present state of scientific
education surely presents a marvellous and a most satisfactory con
trast to the time, well within my memory, when no systematic
practical instruction in any branch of experimental or observational
science, except anatomy, was to be had in this country; and when
there was no such thing as a physical, chemical, biological, or geolo
gical laboratory open to the students of any University,* or to the
pupils of any school, in the three kingdoms.                    Nor was there any
University which recognised science as a faculty, nor a school, public
   * This  statement  has been challenged,   so far as chemistry is concerned, on behalf
of the University of Edinburgh      ; but Sir Lyon Playfair informs me that, at the
time to which    I  refer, the practical instruction did not go beyond " mere testing
exercises for medical students."    (T.H.H. Dec. 10, 1885.)

or private, in which scientific instruction was represented      hy much
more than the occasional visit of a vagrant orrery.
   At   the present moment, any one who desires to obtain a thorough
scientific training   has a choice among a dozen institutions ; and
elementary scientific instruction is, so to speak, brought to the doors of
the poorer classes. If the rich are debarred from like advantages it is
their own affair ; but even the most careful public school education
does not now wholly exclude the knowledge that there is such a tiling
as science from the mind of a young English gentleman.          If science
is not allowed a fair share of the children's bread, it is at any rate
permitted to pick up the crumbs which fall from the time-table, and
that is a great deal more than I once hoped to see in my lifetime.
    I have  followed precedent in leading you to the point at which it
might be fair, as it certainly would be customary, to end by congratu
lating you, as Fellows of the Royal Society, on the past progress and
the future prospects of the work which, for two centuries, it has been
the aim of the Society to forward.         But it will perhaps be more
profitable to consider that which remains to be done for the advance
                                                   "
ment of science, than to " rest and be thankful in the contemplation
of that which has been done.
    In all human affairs the irony of fate plays a part, and in the midst
of our greatest satisfactions, " surgit amari aliquid." I should have
been disposed to account for the particular drop of bitterness to which
I  am about to refer, by the sexagenarian state of mind, were it not that
I  find the same complaint in the mouths of the young and vigorous.
Of late years, it has struck me, with constantly increasing force, that
those who have toiled for the advancement of science are in a fair
way of being overwhelmed by the realisation of their wishes. We
are in the case of Tarpeia, who opened the gates of the Roman citadel
to the Sabines, and was crushed under the weight of the reward
bestowed upon her.       It has become impossible for any man to keep
pace with the progress of the whole of any important branch of science.
 If he were to attempt to do so his mental faculties would be crushed
by the multitude of journals and of voluminous monographs which a
too fertile press casts upon him.     This was not the case in my young
days.     A diligent reader might then keep fairly informed of all that
was going on, without robbing himself of leisure for original work,
and without demoralising his faculties by the accumulation of unas-
similated information. It looks as if the scientific, like other revolu
tions, meant to devour its own children ; as if the growth of science
tended to overwhelm its votaries ; as if the man of science of the
future were condemned to diminish into a narrower and narrower
specialist, as time goes on.
    I am happy to say that      I do not think any such catastrophe      a

296                          Anniversary Meeting.                   [Nov. 30,
necessary consequence of the growth of science ; but           I do think it is
a tendency to be feared, and an evil to be most carefully provided
against.      The man who works away at one corner of nature, shutting
his   eyes   to all the rest, diminishes his chances of seeing what is to
be seen     in that corner; for, as I need hardly remind my present
hearers, that which the investigator perceives depends much more on
that which lies behind his sense organs than on the object in front of
them.
    It  appears to me that the only defence against this tendency to
the degeneration of scientific workers, lies in the organisation and
extension of scientific education, in snch a manner as to secure
breadth of culture without superficiality ; and, on the other hand,
depth and precision of knowledge, without narrowness.
    I  think it is quite possible to meet these requirements.      There is no
reason, in the nature of things, why the student who is destined for a
scientific career should not, in the first place, go through a course of
instruction such as would ensure him a real, that is to say, a practical
acquaintance with the elements of each of the great divisions of mathe
matical and physical science ; nor why this instruction in what (if I may
borrow a phrase from medicine)          I may call the institutes of science,
should not be followed up by more special instruction, covering the
 whole field of that particular division in which the student eventually
proposes to become a specialist.          I say not only that there is no
 reason why this should not be done, but, on the ground of practi
 cal experience, I venture to add that there is no difficulty in doing
 it. Some thirty years ago, my colleagues and             I framed a scheme
 of instruction     on  the  lines just indicated,  for  the students of the
 institution which has grown into what is now known as the Normal
 School of Science and Royal School of Mines. We have found no
 obstacles in the way of carrying the scheme into practice except
  such as arise, partly, from the limitations of time forced upon us from
 without; and, partly, from the extremely defective character of
  ordinary education.       With respect to the first difficulty, we ought, in
 my judgment, to bestow at least four, or better, five, years on the
  work which has, at present, to be got through in three. And, as
 regards the second difficulty, we are hampered not only by the
 ignorance of even the rudiments of physical science, on the part of
 the students who come to us from ordinary schools, and by their very
 poor mathematical acquirements, but by the miserable character of
 the so-called literary training which they have undergone.
     Nothing would help the man af science of the future to rise to the
 level of his great enterprise more effectually than certain modifica
 tions, on the one hand, of primary and secondary school education,
  and, on the other, of the conditions which are attached by the
  Universities to the attainment of their degrees and their rewards

    As   I ventured to remark some years ago, we want a most favoured
    nation clause inserted in our treaty with educators.                   We have a
    right to claim that science shall be put upon the same footing as
    any other great subject of instruction, that it shall have an equal
    share in the schools, an equal share in the recognised qualification
    for degrees, and in University honours and rewards.                    It must be
    recognised     thai science, as intellectual discipline, is at least as
    valuable, and, as knowledge, is at least as important, as literature,
    and that the scientific student must no longer be handicapped by a
    linguistic (I will not call it literary) burden, the equivalent of which
    is not imposed upon his classical compeer.
        Let me repeat that I say this, not as a depreciator of literature, but
    in the interests of literature. .The reason why our young people are
    so often scandalously and lamentably deficient in literary knowledge,
    and still more. in, the feeling and the desire for literary excellence,
    lies in the fact that they have been withheld from a true literary
    training by the pretence of         it,which too often passes under the name
    of classical instruction. Nothing          is  of more importance to the man
    of science than that       he  should   appreciate the value of style, and the
    literary work of the school would be of infinite value to him                taught
                                                                         if
                                                                         it

                                I     do   not  believe   that thisis   to  be  done by
    what     called forming oneself on classical models, or that the advice

    expression   of  clear  thinking,   and   it can  be attained  only  by  those who
    will take infinite pains,     in the  first place, to purge their own minds of
    ignorance   and     half  knowledge,      and, in the second, to clothe their
    thoughts in the     words   which    will  most fitly convey them to the minds
    of others.        can conceive no greater help to our scientific students

    than that they should bring to their work the habit of mind which                  is
    implied in the power to write their own language in a good style.
    But this      isexactly what our present so-called literary education so
    often fails to confer, even on those who have enjoyed its fullest
    advantnges     ; while the ordinary schoolboy has rarely been even made
    aware that its attainment      isa    thing to be desired.
     I   venture to lay these last observations before you, because we have
    heard a good deal lately of schemes for the remodelling of the Univer
    sity of London, which has done so much, through its Faculties of
    Science and Medicine, to promote scientific instruction. As a member
    of the Senate of the University         am necessarily greatly interested

of science and of medicine by the matriculation examination ?
  And again, in the interests of science, will any change be satis

university ? And, by that last term, I do not mean a mere co-operative
society of teacher-examiners, but a corporation which shall embrace
a professoriate charged with the exposition and the advancement of
the higher forms of knowledge in all its branches.
   The future both of pure science and of medicine in this country
is,
 I    think, greatly interested in the answer which Fellows of this
Society, after due meditation, may be disposed to give to these
questions.
I     have to announce    an unusually large number of changes    in the
staff of the Society.
   Last December we regretted to receive the resignation of Mr. Walter
White, so long our Assistant Secretary, whose faithful and efficient
services, continued for more than forty years, are well known to all
the Fellows of the Society.  The minutes of the Council record our
appreciation of Mr. White's services, and our endeavour to give as
snbstantial form as possible to our hearty recognition of his deserts.

The vacancy thus caused has been filled up by the appointment of
Mr. Herbert Rix, whose work since he has held the office of clerk
has been such as to justify the confidence of the officers, not only that
the functions hitherto discharged by the Assistant Secretary will be as
well performed as heretofore    but that,
                                   ;        the interests of the Society
                                                if
should demand    it,we may throw still more important duties upon him.
I receive the most favourable reports of the efficiency of Mr. James
who has been appointed to the office of clerk in place of Mr. Rix.
    Notwithstanding my release from all serious work, my health
remained so very indifferent for some months after my return to
 England, thatI   felt  my duty to the Society to bring the question of
                         it

the Council which met on the 20th of May. My colleagues were kind

hardly say how willing    I should have been to retain my honourable
office,ifI   could have done so with due regard to the interests of
the Society, and perhaps    may add, of self-preservation.

 to do so,  I must, for a long time yet, be content to lead a more or less
 anchoritic life. Now it is not fitting that your President should
 bo a hermit, and it becomes me, who have received so much kindness
 and consideration from the Society, to be particularly careful that no
 sense of personal gratification should delude me into holding the
 office of its representative one moment after reason and conscience
 have pointed out my incapacity to discharge the serious duties which
 devolve upon the President, with some approach to efficiency.
     I beg leave, therefore, with much gratitude for the crowning honour
 of my life which you have conferred upon me, to be permitted to
 vacate the chair of the Society as soon as the business of this meeting
is at an end.
    As I am of opinion that it is very undesirable that the President
 should even seem to wish to exert any influence, direct or indirect, on
 the action of the Fellows assembled in General Meeting, I am silent
 respecting the proposals embodied in the new list of the officers of
 the Society which my colleagues and I have unanimously agreed to
snbmit for your consideration.
    The President then proceeded to the presentation of the Medals : —
    The Copley Medal is awarded to Professor August Kekule of
 Bonn, whose researches in organic chemistry, extended over the last
five-and-thirty years, have been fruitful of results of high importance
in chemical science. The great work of Professor Kekule's life,
 that which has raised him to the highest rank among the inves
 tigators of the day, is his general theory of the constitution of
carbon compounds, in which the now universally accepted conception
of the constitution of those compounds was first clearly and definitely
stated.
    A development of the fundamental theory led Kekule to the dis
covery of the constitution of an exceedingly numerous and very com
plex class of compounds, which he has named the aromatic compounds,
and his theory of the constitution of the aromatic compounds has
suggested and guided innumerable         investigations.   The marvellous
success obtained by many of his followers and pupils in building up
artificially complex substances which had defied the efforts of all pre-
viorj investigators, affords tangiblo evidence that Kekule's labours
have given us a deeper insight into the order of nature.
    One of the Royal Medals is awarded to Professor Hughes, F.R.S.,
for a series of experimental investigations in electricity and magnetism,
which are remarkable alike for ingenuity of contrivance, for the
simplicity of the apparatus employed, for the delicacy of the indica
tions afforded,     and for the wide applicability     of the instruments

invented to researches other than those for which they were originally
designed.
     The microphone, the induction balance, and the sonometer, are
instruments by which inconceivably minute electrical and magnetic
disturbances not only make themselves loudly audible, but may be
 definitely measured ; and their application has opened up new lines
 of inquiry.
     The other Royal Medal is awarded to Professor E. Ray Lankester,
 F.R.S., for his labours, now extending over more than twenty years,
 in the field of animal morphology (especially invertebrate anatomy
 and embryology) and of paleeontology.
     Professor Lankester has been active in many directions, and has
 everywhere left his mark, not only as an energetic teacher and accurate
 worker and a philosophical thinker; but as one who, in times when
 the example is more than ever valuable, has always been careful to
 remember that speculation         should be the servant and not the
 master of the biologist.
     The Davy Medal is awarded to Professor Stas of Brussels.
     Professor Stas' great research, for which it is proposed that
  the Davy Medal be awarded to him, is that on atomic weights.
  There are probably no researches in chemistry, the results of
  which appeal so little to the imagination, and which are so little
  applauded as those on atomic weights, yet for difficulty and import
  ance they are hardly surpassed by any. The determination of these
  fundamental constants of chemistry has engaged the attention of
  many of the leading chemists, and, before the time of M. Stas'
  experiments, an immense amount of careful labour had been bestowed
  on finding methods for the more accurate and complete purification
  of the compounds employed for the purpose.
      The indefatigable and conscientious care which M. Stas has
   devoted to the re- determination of a certain number of the most
  important atomic weights, and the marvellous skill with which he has
   overcome the various difficulties which successively presented them
   selves, render his memoir on the subject one of the most remarkable
   and valuable of chemical monographs.
      I regret to say that the state of M. Stas' health has not permitted
   him to be with us to-day, but the representative of his Sovereign, the
   King of the Belgians, in this country, has kindly consented to receive
   the medal for him.
      M. le Baron Solvyns,     I request your Excellency to be so good as
   to receive the medal awarded to M. Stas ; and to assure him of the
   pleasure which it gives the Royal Society to show their sense of his
   high merits, by asking his acceptance of this memorial of his illustrious
   predecessor, Humphry Davy.

       Report of the Kew Committee for the Year ending
                            October 31, 1885.
   The operations of The Kew Observatory, in the Old Deer Park,
Richmond, Surrey, are controlled by the Kew Committee, which is
constituted as follows :
                     Mr. Wairen de la Rue, Chairman.
   Captain    W. de W. Abney,           Vice-Adm. Sir G. H. Richards,

   Capt. Sir F. Evans, K.C.B.           Mr. R. H. Scott.
   Prof. G. C. Foster.                  Lieut. -General W. J. Smythe.
   Mr. F. Galton.                       Lieut.-Gen. R. Strachey, C.S.I.
                               Mr. E. Walker.
    The work at the Observatory may        be considered  under  the fol
lowing heads : —
    1st. Magnetic observations.
    2nd. Meteorological observations.
    3rd. Solar observations.
   4th. Experimental,     in connexion  with any of the above depart
            ments.
    5th. Verification of instruments.
    6th. Rating of Watches.
    7th. Miscellaneous.
                        I. Magnetic Orservations.
    The Magnetographs have been in constant operation during the
year, and in accordance with the usual practice, determinations of
 the scale values of all the instruments were made early in January.
    As regards magnetic disturbances, no very exceptional variations
 have been registered.      The principal perturbations occurred on the
 following dates :— November 2-3, 1884; March 15-16, May 13 and 27,
 and   June 25-26, 1885.
    In Feb'Tiary the Kew 9-inch Unifilar Magnetometer by Jones was

                        Report    of the Kew      Committee.                315
 sent to Messrs.    Elliott Brothers, London, for the purpose of having
 Mr. Whipple's       arrangement       for steadying the Collimator Magnet
 fitted, and at the same time a rack and pinion adjustment was
 attached to the small telescope employed in viewing the collimator
 scale, in order to bring the scale more readily into focus.
     The values of the ordinates of the different photographic curves
 determined in January were as follows : —
                                                '

     Information on matters relating to terrestrial magnetism and
 various data have been supplied to Dr. Wild, Professor Mascart,
 Dr. Van der Stok, Mr. R. H. Scott, Professor W. G. Adams, Dr. Rijcke-
 vorsel, Professor Riicker, and Dr. Atkinson.
    The monthly observations with the absolute instruments have been
 made as usual, and the results are given in the tables forming
 Appendix I of this Report.
    The following is a summary of the number of magnetic observations
made during the year : —
          Determinations    of Horizontal Intensity                  34
                 ,,            Inclination                         127
                 ,,            Absolute Declination                  53
    International Polar Commission. — The magnetic observations made
during the year September, 1882, to August, 1883, at Fort Rae, North
America, by the expedition under Captain Dawson, R.A., have been
fully reduced and prepared for publication, on the plan adopted by
the International Polar Commission at their Meeting at Vienna in
1884, by the Observatory staff during extra office hours, and the
 work is at present passing through the press. The readings of the
Kew Magnetographs have also been reduced on the same plan at the
cost of the Polar Committee of the Royal Society, and copies
forwarded to Dr. H. Wild, President of the Commission.                  Special
scales were constructed for the tabulation of the Kew curves on the
C.G.S. system by Mr. Baker, the magnetic observer.
    Krakatoa Eruption. — The Krakatoa Committee                 of the Royal
Society having entrusted          to   the  Kew     Committee the  data which
they have collected relating to electrical and magnetical phenomena
•which occurred about August 27, 1883, the date of the eruption of
Krakatoa, the curves of the magnetographs of the Observatories at

316                    Report  of the Kew   Committee.
Batavia, Colaba, Lisbon, Mauritius,         Melbourne,   Paris, Stonyhnrst,
and Zi-ka-wei have been carefully compared with each other,            and a
report thereon will shortly be submitted to the Committee.
                     II. Meteorological      Orservations.
   The several self-recording instruments for the continuous registra
tion respectively of atmospheric pressure, temperature, and humidity,
wind (direction and velocity), bright sunshine, and rain, have been
maintained in regular operation throughout the year.
   In February the barometer tube was removed for a short time
from the barograph, and a carefully divided glass scale substituted in
its place, which was then photographed with the view of re-deter
mining the scale value of the instrument, and also of measuring the
amount of distortion the curve undergoes              by shrinkage of the
gelatinized paper during        the  photographic   operations, to which it
is subjected, subsequent to its reception of the luminous image.
   In September the action of the barograph was observed to be some
what sluggish, and an examination of the instrument showed an
obstruction of the air- vent in the cistern due to an accumulation of
dust.    This was removed, and there has since been no want of
sensitiveness on the part of the barometer.
   The standard eye observations for the control of the automatic
records have been duly registered during the year, together with the
daily observations in connexion with the U.S. Signal Service
synchronous system.        A summary of these observations is given in
Appendix II.
   The tabulation of the meteorological traces has been regularly
carried on, and copies of these, as well as of the eye observations,
with notes of weather, clond, and sunshine have been transmitted
as usual to the Meteorological      Office.
    The following is a summary of the number of meteorological         obser
 vations made during the past year : —

                      Report   of the Kew   Committee.                  317
    In   compliance with a request made by the Meteorological Council
 to  the  Committee, Mr. Whipple visited Falmouth in May in order to
 superintend the removal of the meteorological instruments from the
 old Observatory to the new building recently erected near that town
 by the Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society ; he has since inspected
 the instruments at the Aberdeen, Stony hurst, and Glasgow Observa
 tories, and the Anemographs at Yarmouth and Sandwick.
    Mr. Baker visited the Valencia and Falmouth Observatories for the
 purpose of inspection dnring his vacation.
    With the sanction of the Meteorological Council, weekly abstracts
 of the meteorological results have been regularly forwarded to, and
                 " The Times " and " The Torquay Directory." Data
 published by
 have also been supplied to the Council of the Royal Meteorological
                         "
 Society, the editor of Symons's Monthly Meteorological Magazine,"
 the Secretary of the Institute of Mining Engineers, Messrs. Gwilliam,
 Rowland, and others.       The cost of these abstracts is borne by the
 recipients.
    Electrograph. — The difficulty of maintaining the potential of the
 charge of this instrument constant, mentioned in last year's Report,
 having greatly increased, in spite of all measures of precaution which
were taken, the Meteorological Council were in July informed of its
unsatisfactory condition.       They accordingly gave instructions to
discontinue its working, and it is intended to draw up a report on
the results which may be obtained from the eleven years' curves of
variations of atmospheric electricity now available for discussion.
                         III. Solar Orskrvations.
    The sketches of Sun-spots,   as seen projected on the photoheliograph
screen, have been    made  on 170   days, in order to continue Schwabe's
enumeration, the results being given in Appendix II, Table IV.
    Transit Observations. — 320 observations of solar and 102 of sidereal
 transits have been taken, for the purpose of keeping correct local time
at the Observatory, and the clocks and chronometers have also been
compared daily.      The Observatory Chronometer, Breguet 3140, has
been cleaned and readjusted.
    The following clocks, French, Shelton K. 0., and Dent 2011, and
the chronometers, Molyneux No. 2125, and Breguet No. 3140, are
kept carefully rated as time-keepers at the Observatory.
                        IV. Experimental Work.
   Photo-nephograph. — The experiments with the photo-nephographs
having proved satisfactory, and a report to that effect having been
presented to the Meteorological Council,
                                               it was decided in June to

318                    Report  of the Kew    Committee.
take frequent pictures for the purpose of determining the rate of
motion of clouds. Accordingly the telegraph cable uniting the two
stations was buried in the ground (permission having previously been
granted by the lessee of the Old Deer Park), and the stands and
electrical fittings were made fixtures.
    A quantity of photographic plates, prepared in accordance with
Captain Abney's formula, were also obtained from a manufacturer,
and certain arrangements made in the photographic laboratory of the
Observatory for their convenient manipulation. Blank forms for
the computation of the cloud positions and motions were also drawn
up and printed.
    Between July 6th, when the installation of the apparatus was com
pleted, and the date, when the experiments were brought to a close,
in accordance with the instructions of the Meteorological Council,
168 cloud negatives were obtained on 23 days, from these 62 approxi
mate determinations of the rate and direction of motion of clouds
at heights varying from 3,000 feet to 50,000 feet have been secured.
    A detailed report of the work is being drawn up for presentation
to the Meteorological Council.
    Solar Railiation Thermometers. — The Committee           have made a
great    number   of experiments   on  the   construction and exhaustion of
the solar radiation thermometers, and the Superintendent is engaged
on a report to be communicated to the Royal Society.           The general
result would indicate that solar radiation as measured by the black
 bulb thermometer in vacuo has hitherto been considerably under
rated.
     Baili/'s Wind Integrator.
                               — This instrument, after working success
 fully with electrical counters for some time, was simplified by the
 inventor by the substitution of mechanical counters.          These being
 found to work satisfactorily, Mr. Baily removed the instrument in
 May for the purpose of exhibiting it at the International Inventions
 Exhibition.
     The spare Beckley Anemograph to which it was attached has been
 dismounted, and together with the de la Rue recorder (see report for
 187!)) has, by direction of the Meteorological Council, been forwarded
 to Mr. Munro to be reconstructed           as a Beckley recorder    of the
 original type.
     Electrical Anemograph. — The Meteorological Council having granted
 a sum of money for experiment,            and placed at the disposal of
 Mr. W. Preece, F.R.S., Superintendent of Telegraphs, an old
 Beckley Anemograph of the 1858 model, that gentleman had it
 fitted up by Mr. Kempe, of the Chief Engineer's Department,
 G.P.O., so as to record electrically, and it was erected on the Experi
 mental House of the Observatory.            The velocity attachment has
 worked most satisfactorily for the past six months, neither batteries

                       Report    of the Kew    Committee.
 nor connexions having needed the slightest attention.          The direction
 gear has, however, occasionally required readjustment of its orienta
 tion after strong winds have blown, and is now undergoing alteration.
     Hand Anemometers. — A number of these instruments, intended to
 show the velocity of the wind during a brief period of observation,
 have had their scale values determined by direct comparison with the
 Standard Anemograph of the Observatory.
    Range-finder g. — Facilities have been afforded to Dr. Ristori,
 F.R.A.S., by the employment of the Cooke apparatus, for the purpose
 of graduating some new range-finders invented by Mr. Nordenfeldt,
 and constructed by Mr. Casella, the cost of the experiments being
 defrayed by the inventor.
                     V. Verification of Instruments.
    The following magnetic instruments        have been verified,  and their
constants determined : —
        2   Unifilar Magnetometers       and   an Inclinometer    for Elliott
           Brothers, London.
        1  Unifilar Magnetometer with two Collimating Magnets, and
           an Inclinometer for the Admiralty, London.
        1  small-pattern Fox Circle for the Bureau of Navigation,
           United States Government, and an ordinary Inclinometer
          for Dover, Charlton.
   3 pairs of Inclinometer Needles have been purchased on commission
and verified for Dr. Wild and the Mauritius Observatory.
    One Unifilar and an Inclinometer are at present undergoing
examination for the Falmouth Observatory.
   The total number of other instruments tested in the past year was
as follows : —
          Barometers,   Standard                                  54
                „       Marine and Station                        98

        Dark Glasses, unmounted                              235
   Besides these, 38 Deep-sea Thermometers have been tested, 32 of
which were subjected, in the hydraulic press, without injury, to
pressures exceeding two tons on the square inch.      55 Thermometers
have been compared at the freezing-point of mercury, making a total
of 10,361 for the year.
   Duplicate copies of corrections have been supplied in 43 cases.
   The    number   of instruments rejected on account of excessive
error,  or which from other causes did not record with sufficient
accuracy, was as follows : —
        Thermometers,   clinical                              52
               „        ordinary meteorological                 4
        Various                                               97
   3 Standard Thermometers have also been calibrated, and supplied
to societies and individuals during the year.
   1 Evaporation Gauge, 4 Thermograph Thermometers,         1 Sunshine
Recorder, 2 Gauge Barometers for comparing Aneroids, 1 Electrical
Anemometer,    and  1 Richard Thermograph were also tested.
   There are at present in the Observatory undergoing verification,
2 Barometers, 222 Thermometers, 100 Hydrometers, 24 Sextants, and
1 self-recording Aneroid.
   Sextant Testing Apparatus. — In consequence of the increasing
number of sextants sent to the Observatory for examination it was
found desirable to provide a special accommodation in the building
for the work. As the room known as the Pendulum room was
unoccupied,   and the masonry pier fitted up in it as a support for
pendulum apparatus was no longer required, it was resolved to
convert the apartment into a sextant room, and accordingly the pier
was removed, and the Cooke testing apparatus dismounted from the
South Hall and re-erected on its site. Four careful redeterminations
were then made of the angles between the collimators, and they
were found to have been unaffected by the transfer of the apparatus
to the new position.
                        VI. Rating of Watches.
   The arrangements for rating watches mentioned in previous
Reports have been continued during the year with great success, and

                       Beport   of the Kew   Committee.                           321
 up to the present 367 watches have heen tried, of which 39 were
submitted by the owners, and 328 by the manufacturers or dealers.
   The 302 watches received during the year were entered for testing
in the following classes : —
   For class A, 254 ; class B, 38 ; and class C, 10. Of these 72 failed
to gain any certificate; 6 passed in C, 60 in B, 110 in A, and 6
others obtained the highest possible form of certificate, the class A
especially good.
   Owing to numerous         requests from manufacturers and others, a
system of awarding marks to class A watches, indicating the degree
of relative efficiency exhibited during trial, was adopted, being based
upon    plans already in use in the Geneva and Tale Observatories.
In it the number of marks awarded to a watch that only just succeeds
in obtaining an A certificate is 0, but to an absolutely perfect watch
would    be 100, made up as follows : —40 for a complete absence of
variation of daily rate, 40 for absolute freedom from change of rate
with change of position, and 20 for perfect compensation for effects
of alteration of temperature.
   As, however, the trials already in use do not comprise a test for the
going of travellers' or explorers' watches, experiments are in progress
with a view of constructing apparatus to test the behaviour of watches
when kept in motion, as in the case of daily wear and travelling, in
order to make a special examination on this point for watches sub
mitted for trial by the Royal Geographical Society.
   A series of tests for pocket chronographs has also been introduced
by special request of the Cyclists' Union.
   In Appendix    III  will be found a table giving the results of trial of
the watches which have gained the highest certificates in each class.
   The following table will indicate the nature of the trials to which
ordinary certificates refer : —
                                                  For certificate of Class
     Position of watch during test.

   Photographic Paper, fyc — This has been supplied to the Observa
tories at Alipore, Colaba, Falmouth, Glasgow, Mauritius, Stony-
hurst, St. Petersburg, and Toronto, and to the Meteorological Office.
    History of  the Observatory * — A paper giving a history of the Kew
Observatory from its earliest foundation down to the present date has
been compiled by Mr. R. H. Scott, a member of the Committee, and
                  "
printed in the Proc. Roy. Soc," vol. xxxix, p. 37.
   Dowson Gift. — The Committee are indebted to Mr. E. T. Dowson,
F.R. Met. Soc, for the presentation of a large collection of weights
and measures formed by the late Mr. James Yates, F.R.S., member
of the Metric Committee of the British Association, with books
and pamphlets bearing on the Metric System.                  At the request of
Mr.    H.  J. Chaney,    Warden    of the  Standards,      a  number of these
works, copies of which were not to be found in the Library of the
Standards Office, were handed over by the Committee to that Depart
ment.
    The Observatory has also been presented by the Rev. John Rigaud,
B.D., Fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford, with a framed sketch
portrait of his father, Stephen Peter Rigaud, Esq., M.A., F.R.S.,
Savilian Professor of Astronomy and Radcliffe Observer, who, in the
early part of the present century, during the Oxford vacations, was
in the habit of relieving his uncle, the Rev. S. Demainbray, of his
             " The
charge as           King's Observer at Kew."
    Exhibition. — A number of instruments of interest were exhibited
at the Sixth Annual Exhibition of the Royal Meteorological Society,
which was devoted to sunshine recorders and actinometry, and held in
the rooms of the Institution of Civil Engineers in March last.
    International Inventions Exhibition. — The Committee have exhibited
in Groups 27 and 29 at this Exhibition articles of which the following
is the description as given in the Official Catalogue : —
    " Forms and papers illustrating the methods
                                                        employed at the Kew
 Observatory, Richmond, in examining, rating, and certifying as to
the performance of watches, pocket chronometers and chronographs
for the manufacturers and general public."
    "

                         Report of the Kew Committee.                  323
  following papers before the Aberdeen Meeting of the British Associa
  tion : —
     " On the Errors of first class Sextants, as determined from the
  Records of the Verification Department at the Kew Observatory ; "
 and " On the Behaviour of first class Watches whilst undergoing
  Tests in the Rating Department of the Kew Observatory."
     At the request of the Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society, the Kew
  Committee have undertaken         the purchase and trial of a set of
 Magnetographs      now    in course of construction   for the Falmouth
 Observatory, on a new plan, the designs and specification for which
 have been prepared by Mr. Whipple, as the Royal Society grant was
 inadequate to provide for instruments of the ordinary Kew pattern.
     By the kindness of Captain Rung, of the Meteorological Institute,
 Copenhagen, the Superintendent has been able to procure two spe
 cimens of his apparatus for whirling thermometers.       These, with the
 necessary thermometers, have been forwarded to Dr. Doberck, the
 Government Astronomer at Hong Kong.
     Magnetic Disturbances. — By permission of the Committee, Mr. W.
 Lant Carpenter has visited the Observatory for the purpose of
 extracting certain magnetic information from the tabulations, in order
to assist Professor Balfour Stewart in his investigations on Terrestrial
Magnetism.
     Workshop. — The machine tools procured by grants from the Govern
ment Grant Fund or the Donation Fund for the use of the Kew
Observatory have been kept in thorough order.         In consequence of
the increased number of clinical thermometers submitted for verifica
tion, a new specially constructed Galton testing apparatus has been
purchased at a cost of 381., as well as a duplicate Hall-marking
apparatus.     Accommodation has been fonnd in the workshop for the
assistants engaged in the new department specially devoted to the
examination of this class of instruments.
    Library. — During the year the Library has received, as presents, the
publications of —
    26 Scientific Societies and Institutions of Great Britain, and
    78 Foreign and Colonial Scientific Societies and Institutions.
    House, Grounds, and Footpath. — These have all been kept in order
during the year. A step ladder has been set up to give more con
venient access to the roof of the Sun-room for the purpose of testing
Anemometers.       The dome has also been lifted and its fittings
readjusted.     The  necessary external repairs to the building, as well
as an examination and cleaning of the drains, have been effected by
Her Majesty's Commissioners of Works.
    The Committee has addressed a memorial to Her Majesty's Com
missioners of Woods and Forests, through the President and Council
of the Royal Society, with the object of securing free passage to the

326 Report of the Kew Committee.
                       Report  of the Kew  Committee.                    327
                                APPENDIX I.
Magnetic Observations      made at the Kew Observatory, Lat. 51° 28' 6" N.
    Long. Oh  lm 15" 1   W.,for the year October 1884 to September 1885.
   The observations of Deflection and Vibration given in the annexed
Tables were all made with the Collimator Magnet marked KC1, and
the Kew 9-inch Unifilar Magnetometer by Jones.
   The Declination observations have also been made with the same
Magnetometer, Collimator Magnets 101 B and N E being employed for
the purpose.
   The Dip observations were made with Dip-circle Barrow No. 33, the
needles 1 and 2 only being used ; these are 3£ inches in length.
   The results of the observations of Deflection and Vibration give the
values of the Horizontal Force, which, being combined with the Dip
observations, furnish the Vertical and Total Forces.
   These are expressed in both English and metrical scales — the unit in
the first being one foot, one second of mean solar time, and one grain ;
and in the other one millimetre, one second of time, and one milligramme,
the factor for reducing the English to metric values being 0-46108.
   By request, the corresponding values in C.G.S. measure are also given.
   The value of log jtsK omployed in the reduction is 1•64365 at tem
perature 60" F.
   The induction-coefficient /i is 0'000194.
   The correction of the magnetic power for temperature ta to an
adopted standard temperature of 35° F. is
                 0-0001194(*o-35)+0-000,000,213(*o-35)8.
   The true distances between the centres of the deflecting and deflected
magnets, when the former is placed at the divisions of the deflection-
bar marked     1•0  foot and 1-3 feet, are 1-000075 feet and 1-300097 feet
respectively.
   The times of vibration given in the Table are each derived from the
mean of 12 or 14 observations of the time occupied by the magnet in
making 100 vibrations, corrections being applied for the torsion-force
of the suspension-thread subsequently.
   No corrections have been made for rate of chronometer or arc of
vibration, these being always very small.
   The value of the constant P, employed in the formula of reduction
   In each observation of absolute Declination the instrumental        read
ings  have  been   referred to marks  made   upon  the stone obelisk erected
1,250 feet north of the Observatory as a meridian mark, the orientation
of which, with respect to the Magnetometer, was determined bv the
late Mr. Welsh, and has since been carefully verified.
   The observations have been made and reduced by Mr. T. W. Baker.

 " Contributions to the Chemistry of Chlorophyll." By Edward
       Schunck, F.R.S. Received April 30, 1885. Read May 7,
       1885.
                            Action of Acids on Chlorophyll.
    Every one who has worked with chlorophyll must be familiar with
the peculiar effect produced on the addition of acids to its solutions.
 If an alcoholic solution be taken, the colour of the solution changes
when an acid is added from bright green to yellowish-green, and the
spectrum at the same time undergoes alteration. After standing
some time the solution gives a dark green deposit, which, after
separation from the greenish-yellow liquid, shows when dissolved in
boiling alcohol or ether, the spectrum of so-called
                                                                 " acid chlorophyll."
    This change is attributed by some to a simple modification of the
chlorophyll ; others consider it due to the formation of products of
decomposition.         The latter view is, I have no doubt, the correct one.
    In order to obtain the products due to the action of acids on chloro
phyll, I find it best to use hydrochloric acid. Fresh green leaves of
 any kind are extracted, without undergoing any preliminary treat
 ment, with boiling spirits of wine.              The extract, which should be of
 an intense green, is poured off from the exhausted leaves, and
 allowed to stand for a day or two.               During this time, a light green
somewhat slimy deposit is formed, consisting chiefly of wax and
fatty matters coloured by chlorophyll.
     On examining this deposit closely, it will almost invariably be
found to contain, interspersed in the mass, small, red, glistening
crystals.      These crystals consist of a body first observed by Hartsen,*
and called by him,
                            " chrysophyll," a name which it would be well
                                                                                       to
retain.f      The   deposit     having    been  separated by filtration, a current
of hydrochloric acid gas is passed into the dark green filtrate.                    This
produces      at once    a  dark   green    almost  black   voluminous     precipitate,

which increases in quantity on standing.           After the precipitate has
settled, the liquid appears greenish-yellow; it shows the spectrum of
acid chlorophyll, due to the presence of colouring matters from the
precipitate, these being not entirely insoluble in alcohol, but it also
contains yellow colouring matters which darken the blue end of the
spectrum, as well as- other bodies extracted from the leaves which
have no connexion with chlorophyll.
    The dark green precipitate is now filtered off and washed with
spirits until the filtrate appears nearly colourless.       It contains besides
impurities, which are chiefly of a fatty nature, two distinct colouring
matters identical with the phyllocyanin and phylloxanthin of Fremy.
These names I see no reason to change. They have been retained by
Tschirch,* one of the latest writers on the subject. The method                 I
adopt for separating the two substances is essentially the same as
that of Fremy. I have tried other methods, but they have led to no
result.    The use of alkaline solvents is to be avoided, since both
colouring matters are changed by the action of alkalis. The crude
product of the action of the acid is first treated with ether, in which
nearly the whole dissolves.           The insoluble matter having been
filtered off, the filtrate is mixed with about its own volume of fuming
hydrochloric acid. The mixture, after being well shaken, is left to
stand, when it separates into two layers, an upper yellowish-green
one, containing phylloxanthin and a great part of the fatty matters,
and a lower dark blue one, containing phyllocyanin.                  This is the
experiment of Fremy, which is so often referred to in memoirs on
chlorophyll, as having led him to the conclusion that chlorophyll was
a compound or mixture of a blue and a yellow colouring matter.                  I
propose first to give an account of phyllocyanin, the colouring matter
of the blue layer.
    The two liquids obtained in the manner just described are
separated in the usual way, and the lower blue one is agitated with
fresh ether, the process being repeated until the ether appears nearly
 colourless, and the phylloxanthin has been removed.               After a short
 exposure, to allow the ether contained in it to evaporate, it is mixed
 with water, which produces a dark blue precipitate.             This is filtered
 off, washed to remove hydrochloric acid, then dissolved in boiling
 glacial acetic acid. This solution on cooling gives a crystalline
 deposit of phyllocyanin, which is filtered off and recrystallised from
 acetic acid.   If, on decomposing a little of it with boiling dilute nitric
 acid, nothing is left undissolved, the product may be considered pure,
 but if yellow oily drops appear on the surface of the boiling acid, the
 process of crystallisation from acetic acid must be repeated.                The
 product is finally filtered off, washed with acetic acid, and dried.
    By the process just described, I have obtained phyllocyanin from

grass, from ivy leaves, from the leaves of the common thorn, and
from the fronds of Pteris aquilina. No difference could be dis
cerned between the different specimens obtained.
                         Properties of Phyllocyanin.
   When dry, phyllocyanin has the appearance of a dark blue mass,
which may easily be reduced to a fine powder.              It resembles indigo,
but when rubbed with a hard body it remains blue, and does not
exhibit the coppery lustre which characterises indigo. Under a lens,
small white glistening points are seon dotting the mass, produced by
reflexion from crystalline surfaces.         Examined under the microscope,
it is found to consist almost entirely of elongated rhomboidal, or
irregularly six-sided crystalline plates, which are generally opaque,
but when very thin are translucent and then appear olive-coloured by
transmitted light. Phyllocyanin is insoluble in water. It dissolves
in boiling alcohol, but a great part of the substance dissolved separates
out on the solution cooling, as a voluminous                 mass, consisting of
microscopic   crystals.    It is  more   soluble in   ether,  glacial acetic acid,
benzol, and carbon disulphide than in alcohol, but the best solvent is
chloroform, which takes up large quantities of phyllocyanin even in the
cold.   A minute quantity of the substance imparts an intense colour
to any of these solvents, especially chloroform.          It is only on diluting
largely  that these  solutions    lose their opacity.    They then appear of a
dull green or olive colour, and show the well-known and often
described spectrum of
                           " acid chlorophyll," consisting of five bands of
various intensity. The solutions fluoresce, but not so strongly as
solutions of chlorophyll.
   When the ethereal solution is mixed with concentrated hydro
chloric acid, the whole of the phyllocyanin is taken up by the acid,
yielding a dark greenish-blue solution, which sinks to the bottom.
Should phylloxanthin be present, it will be found in the upper
ethereal layer, which then shows a yellowish-green tint, and an ab
sorption spectrum differing from that of phyllocyanin. The lower
greenish-blue solution shows when sufficiently dilute five absorption
bands, the spectrum, in fact, of the hydrochloric acid compound of
phyllocyanin, which differs widely from that of phyllocyanin itself.
   Phyllocyanin is almost insoluble in boiling petroleum ether, and
nearly insoluble in ligroin.       It dissolves easily in warm aniline.
   Phyllocyanin   contains    nitrogen, but is free from sulphur.
   Action of Heat.   —  When heated on platinum, phyllocyanin gives
off an acid smell, then swells up considerably, evolving gas which
burns with a smoky flame, and leaves a voluminous charcoal, which
burns away slowly, a hardly visible trace of ash being left.                When
heated slowly between two watch-glasses, it swells up slightly, and

               (Contributions  to the Chemistry  of Chlorophyll.         351
  becomes charred.        On the lower glass there is left a black mass
  which imparts no colour to boiling chloroform, and seems to be simply
  charcoal.    On the upper glass, there is found a small quantity of
 brownish sublimate, which, under the microscope, is seen to consist
 partly of crystalline needles, partly of regular rhombic crystals which
 are honey-yellow by transmitted light.
     When slowly heated in an air bath to 160°, phyllocyanin remains
 apparently unchanged.        It is still completely soluble in chloroform,
 the solution showing the usual absorption bands.         On heating, how
 ever, to    180°, complete decomposition takes place, but without any
 change of volume in the substance.         The charred mass now imparts
 to boiling chloroform only a very faint green tinge, and when heated
 in a tube, gives off no empyreumatic products, only a slight odour
 of hydrocyanic acid.
     Action of Oxiditers. — On adding a little nitric acid to a boiling
 saturated solution of phyllocyanin in glacial acetic acid, the solution
 immediately becomes yellow, but without evolution of nitrous
 fumes.      It deposits nothing on cooling and standing.           On the
 addition of water it gives a dirty green flocculent precipitate, the
 filtrate from which is still yellow, but shows no absorption bands.
 The precipitate dissolves easily in alcohol, giving a yellow solution,
 which shows a spectrum differing from that of phyllocyanin.
     Phyllocyanin itself, treated with boiling dilute nitric acid is
rapidly decomposed and dissolved with evolution of nitrous fumes.
 The solution evaporated in the water-bath leaves a residue which,
 treated with water, dissolves in part.          The filtrate has a bitter
 taste, and leaves, on evaporation, a soft yellow residue, in which, on
 standing, some colourless crystalline needles are formed. The portion
 insoluble in water dissolves easily in alcohol, giving a yellow solution
 which, on evaporation, leaves a residue having a crystalline ap
 pearance, but not really crystalline when examined under the
microscope.
     A hot concentrated     solution of phyllocyanin in glacial acetic acid
 becomes, on the addition of a little chromic acid, yellowish-green,
 but deposits nothing on cooling.         The solution gives with water a
dull green precipitate, the filtrate from which is yellow, and shows no
absorption bands, while the precipitate itself, treated with ether, gives
a solution which differs somewhat as regards colour and absorption
bands from a solution of phyllocyanin.
    Phyllocyanin treated with a watery solution of chromic acid, to
which a little sulphuric acid has been added, iB decomposed with
much effervescence, giving a green solution, which, after evaporation,
leaves a residue yielding to solvents only amorphous products.
    Insolation. — I will introduce here what I have to say regarding the
effect of insolation on phyllocyanin, because there can be no doubt

that the    effects observed are due to oxidation.        Anyone who has
observed the ease and rapidity with which a solution of chlorophyll is
bleached on exposure to light and air would be struck with the
extraordinary permanence           exhibited by phyllocyanin under the
same   circumstances.       A moderately strong solution of phyllocyanin
when exposed to sunlight retains its colour for a long time, the last
trace disappearing only after many weeks' exposure.
   In order to observe the changes which take place, it is best to
take   a chloroformic solution       of phyllocyanin and expose it to
sunlight in    a loosely-stoppered   bottle, the stopper being occasionally
removed, and the contents shaken.           The green colour of the solution
gradually    becomes     fainter, the  absorption bands of phyllocyanin
remaining visible. After some time the colour changes to yellow, but
the solution still shows a strong band in the red, corresponding to
band   I  of phyllocyanin. At length this band also disappears, and
there is now nothing to be seen but the total obscuration at the
blue end of the spectrum, which most yellow solutions show.                In
one experiment the chloroformic solution was exposed to alternate
bright sunlight and diffused daylight from the middle of April to the
middle of June, when it was filtered from a flocculent yellow deposit
which had formed.         A further exposure to the middle of August was
required to cause the entire disappearance of the band in the red.
   Several products are formed during this process of insolation.        The
first consists of a flocculent yellow deposit, which gradually separates
from the chloroformic solntion.        This deposit, after filtering off and
washing    with   chloroform, is found to be easily soluble in alcohol and
caustic alkali, but insoluble in boiling water, in which it simply melts ;
insoluble also in ether, ligroin, and carbon disulphide. The alcoholic
solntion is yellow, shows no absorption bands, and leaves, on spon
taneous evaporation, a residne which has a somewhat crystalline
appearance, but is found to be amorphous when examined under the
microscope.        The chloroformic filtrate leaves, on evaporation, a
residue, which, on treatment with hot water, dissolves only in part.
The part left undissolved by water resembles the product deposited
from the chloroformic solution.           It melts in boiling water ; it is
easily soluble in alcohol, the solution being yellow and leaving, on
evaporation, a pale yellow brittle amorphous residue ; it is insoluble in
ether and carbon disulphide. The watery filtrate from this second
product. after treatment with animal charcoal, which deprives it of
most of its colonr, leaves, on evaporation over sulphuric acid, a pale
yellow transparent gum-like residue, in which nothing crystalline can
be detected, and of which the following are the most characteristic
reactions : —
   Heated on platinnm it is decomposed, giving off acid fumes with
an odour like those from heated tartaric acid, leaving much charcoal ;

             Contributions to   the Chemistry   of Chlorophyll.         353
its watery solution   has a  strong acid reaction and a sonr and at the
same time very bitter taste ; the solution gives no coloration with
ferric chloride ; it evolves ammonia when boiled with caustic potash,
and it reduces Fehling's solution on boiling.
   It appears, therefore, that by insolation, phyllocyanin yields pro
ducts which resemble, if they are not identical with, those due to the
action of nitric and chromic acids. It is possible that some of these
products may be contained in faded autumnal leaves after the chloro
phyll has disappeared, but their indefinite character would render
their identification very difficult. Green leaves, in becoming yellow,
pass through a stage in which they yield when treated with alcohol
tin extract which, though quite yellow and non-fluorescent, shows a
strong absorption band in the red. Of this fact I was forcibly
reminded when watching the progressive changes of phyllocyanin
during insolation.
   Action of Chlorine. — On passing a current of chlorine gas through
a chloroformic solution of phyllocyanin, the first effect observed is a
change of colour in the solution from dull green to a bright grass-
green, the latter colour closely resembling that of a solution of chlo
rophyll. The solution shows au absorption spectrum which coincides
neither with that of chlorophyll nor with that of phyllocyanin.
   On standing for a day or two the solution loses its bright green
colour, and acquires a reddish hue, with a green tint at the edges
where the thickness of the liquid is less.        It now shows the same
number of bands as a phyllocyanin solution, but the bands are all
nearer the red end.       On evaporation it leaves a greenish-brown
amorphous residue.      On passing more chlorine through the chloro
formic solution of phyllocyanin the green colour seen at first dis
appears, the solution becomes yellow, at last pale yellow, all the bands
characteristic of phyllocyanin at the same time disappearing.          The
liquid leaves, on evaporation, a yellow amorphous residue like resin.
This, after heating in the water-bath to drive away all traces of
hydrochloric acid, is found to contain chlorine.       It does not dissolve
in boiling water, but merely softens.      It is easily soluble in alcohol,
the solution being yellow and showing much obscuration in the blue
of the spectrum, but no absorption bands even when very dilute.
It dissolves only in part when treated with caustic potash lye.
   Action of Bromine. — On the addition of a little bromine to a chloro
formic solution of phyllocyanin, the solution acquires a bright grass-
green colour, and now shows four absorption bands.           On adding an
excess of bromine to the solution, heating and evaporating, an olive-
coloured amorphous product, containing bromine, is obtained, which
dissolves easily in alcohol.    The solution is brownish-red, and shows
a spectrum similar to that of phyllocyanin, but having the bands all
nearer the red end.

354                           Mr. E. Schunck.
   Action of Acids. — A mixture of 1 part of concentrated hydrochloric
acid with 9 parts of absolute alcohol, dissolves phyllocyanin easily.
In daylight the solution appears dark bine, green at the edges ; in
artificial light it appears purple. It shows a spectrum differing from
that of phyllocyanin, and more nearly resembling that of chloro
phyll, especially as regards the fourth and fifth bands, which are
extremely faint, whereas with phyllocyanin they are very intense;
the spectrum is, in fact, that of the hydrochloric acid compound of
phyllocyanin. On adding water to the solution, unchanged phyllo
cyanin is precipitated, but if the solution be evaporated, it leaves a
residue green by transmitted, blue by reflected light, which is no
longer phyllocyanin, for it dissolves in alcohol with a brownish-green
colour, and the solution shows a spectrum identical with that of the
product formed by the action of alkalis on phyllocyanin, and cha
racterised by two bands in the red, and two fine, bnt distinct bands
in the green, which will be referred to presently.
   Phyllocyanin is soluble in concentrated hydrobrotnic acid.
   It dissolves in concentrated sulphuric acid, giving a grass-green
solution, which shows a spectrum resembling that of the hydrochloric
acid compound.       On the -addition of water, unchanged phyllocyanin
is precipitated, but if the solution be left to stand for some time, tl'e
phyllocyanin contained in it is changed, and the precipitate with
water now consists of several products, one of which shows the same
spectrum as that formed by the action of hydrochloric acid.
   Phyllocyanin is not in any way affected by treatment with a boiling
watery solution of phosphoric acid.       On the addition of phosphorie
acid to a boiling alcoholic solution of phyllocyanin, the latter acquires
a purplish tint, butane spectrum remains the same, and the solution
on cooling deposits unchanged phyllocyanin.
   Phyllocyanin shows no tendency to combine with oxalic, tartaric,
or citric acid, but these acids do affect it to a certain degree, that is,
they induce decomposition at temperatures at which the substance
itself remains unchanged.       Mixtures of finely powdered phyllocyanin
with oxalic, tartaric, and citric acids remain unaltered when heated in
the water-bath.      After being heated in an air-bath to 130°, the oxalic
acid mixture no longer contains phyllocyanin, the latter being com
pletely charred and decomposed, wbercas the tartaric and citric acid
mixtures show only slight indications of change at that temperature.
On being heated to 155°, and kept at that temperature for some time,
the tartaric and citric acid mixtures are found to contain products
which differ from phyllocyanin, without having properties such as
compounds of the latter with acids might be expected to show.
Under the conditions described, therefore, phyllocyanin shows no
tendency to combine with weak acids.
   Action of Alkalis. — When phyllocyanin is treated with very dilute

            Contributions   to the Chemistry    of Chlorophyll.           355
canstic potash or soda-lye, it dissolves entirely.  The solution has the
same colour as other phyllocyanin solutions, and shows a similar
spectrum, but with the bands less distinctly marked.        It gives pre
cipitates of various shades of green, with earthy and metallic salts,
such as the chlorides of barium and calcium, lead acetate, and copper
acetate.   These might, perhaps, be regarded as compounds of phyllo
cyanin, and be called phyllocyanates.        Nevertheless  it is easy to
show that by mere solution in alkali, phyllocyanin undergoes a com
plete change.    If the alkaline solution be mixed with an excess of
acetic acid, and then shaken up with ether, the precipitate with acid
dissolves in the ether, the solution having the colour of a phyllocyanin
solution, and showing the characteristic absorption-bands ; but if the
solution be left to stand in contact with excess of acid for some time,
its colour changes from olive to a brown or smoke colour, and it now
shows quite a different and very elegant spectrum, characterised by
two bands in the red, one of which is thin and nearer the red end
than the first band of phyllocyanin, and two very fine but distinct
bands in the green, the third and fourth bands of phyllocyanin
having disappeared, while the fifth still remains.       Since phyllocyanin,
before solution in alkali, is not changed appreciably by acetic acid,
even on boiling, it is evident that by the action of alkali it is in some
way metamorphosed, so as to be liable to further change when acted
on by the acid.      In preparing this product of the successive action
of alkali and acid, care must be taken to operate in the cold, for if
hot alkaline lye be used, an entirely different product is formed.           It
is deposited  from   a  boiling alcoholic   solution in microscopic crystals,
which are quite opaque, even in a strong light, and resemble crystal
lised phyllocyanin. In none of the various memoirs on chlorophyll
that have come under my notice have I seen any spectrum figured or
described at all resembling that of the solutions of this substance.
The spectrum is distinctly seen, even in exceedingly dilute solutions.
    The next product of the action of alkalis on phyllocyanin is formed
when hot alkaline lye is employed.          In order to obtain  it, a solution
of phyllocyanin in boiling alcohol      is   mixed with alcoholic potash or
soda, and boiled.      On standing, the solutiou yields a semi-crystalline
deposit of a fine purple colour by reflected light, consisting of a potas
sium or sodium compound of the product formed. This             isfiltered off,
washed with alcohol, and then dissolved in water.               The solution
gives   with   acetic   acid a   green    flocculent  precipitate, which     is
filtered off, washed, and dissolved in boiling glacial acetic acid.
This solution on standing deposits small crystalline rosettes, which
are green by transmitted light, and of a fine purple by reflected light.
The solutions of this substance have a dull purple colour, and exhibit
a distinct spectrum, characterised by a broad very dark band in the
green.

    I shall return to these products on a future occasion.
    Phyllocyanin does not dissolve very readily in ammonia.
    Action of Aniline. — When a solution of phyllocyanin in aniline is
slowly evaporated, a residue is left consisting partly of dark granules
of phyllocyanin, partly of pale purplish-brown crystalline needles,
arranged in tufts and rosettes.     The latter may be either a compound
with aniline, or a product of the action of aniline on phyllocyanin at
the ordinary temperature ; it- is formed in minute quantities only. A
more energetic action takes place at- higher temperatures.         When
aniline and phyllocyanin are heated together in a sealed tube to
 130° and kept at that- temperature         for some time, a complete
 change takes place.      The contents of the tube on being poured into
alcohol dissolve in part only, a crystalline mass being left undissolved,
the filtrate from which is greenish-brown,       and shows the peculiar
spectrum of the first product of the action of alkalis on phyllocyanin.
The crystalline mass on the filter dissolves partly on treatment with
boiling alcohol, and the filtered liquid deposits on cooling a quantity
of white crystalline needles in star-shaped groups, which are soluble
in ether and chloroform, but insoluble in dilute acids and alkaline
lyes.    The portion of the crystalline mass left undissolved by boiling
alcohol dissolves in chloroform.       The solution is red, and shows a
very characteristic spectrum, consisting of three fine but very dis
tinct bands in the red, of which the central one is the strongest, one
very dark band covering the yellow and part of the green, which,
when the solution is so far diluted as to show only two bands in the
red, splits up into two nearly equal bands, and lastly, one dark band
at the edge of the green and blue. The chloroformic solution leaves,
on evaporation, a semi-crystalline residue, having a purplish hue.
    It might be supposed that on- treatment with ammonia, phyllo
 cyanin would yield products similar to those formed by the action
 of aniline, but this is not the case.    When phyllocyanin is heated
 with strong liquor ammonite in a sealed tube to 140°, bodies are
 formed which are similar to if not identical with those due to the

    Compounds of Phyllocyanin. — From what has been stated above, it
may be inferred that phyllocyanin plays the part of a weak base, that
is, it combines with strong acids, the compounds however being un
stable, and easily decomposed even by water.           Like other weak
 bases, it may also act as an acid, though for reasons before men
tioned, it may be doubted whether, in combining with bases, it does
so without undergoing change.         Notwithstanding its nearly neutral
character, however, phyllocyanin is capable of yielding compounds of
great comparative stability, into which metals and acids, especially
organic acids, enter as constituents.
    When phyllocyanin is dissolved      in boiling glacial acetic acid, it

crystallises out unchanged on the solution cooling.                The same
happens when freshly precipitated cupric oxide or zinc oxide is added
to a boiling alcoholic solution of phyllocyanin ; the solution deposits
phyllocyanin, and there are no indications of any combination taking
place between the phyllocyanin and the metallic oxide.
   A very different effect is observed when either of the two oxides
is employed along with acetic acid. When cupric oxide is added to
a solution of phyllocyanin in boiling acetic acid, the solution acquires
at once a deep greenish-blue colour,. and it no longer contains un-
combined phyllocyanin, for its spectrum is different, and on standing
it deposits lustrous crystals, which doubtless consist of a compound
of which phyllocyanin, acetic acid,. and copper are essential con
stituents.    If zinc oxide be employed, a similar effect is observed ;
the liquid acquires an- intense green colour, and now contains the
corresponding acetate of phyllocyanin and zinc.
    The same phenomenon is seen when ferrous oxide, manganese
oxide, or silver oxide, or one of the corresponding               acetates is
taken,   solutions  of   various     shades of green being obtained, which
contain    phyllocyanin compounds,         but no similar compounds are
formed     when potassium,         sodium, barium, calcium, magnesium,
or lead acetates are employed, for on adding the acetate of any
of the last-named         metals to an acetic acid solution of phyllo
cyanin, the colour of the latter remains unchanged, and phyllocyanin
is deposited, just      as if no metallic acetate were present.        Acetic
acid is, however,     not the only acid which yields the reaction.          If
palmitic, stearic, oleic, tartaric, citric, malicr or phosphoric acid be
employed, it takes place just as with acetic acid, but, in some cases,
time is required for its completion.        The process results, there can be
little doubt, in the formation of compounds analogous to those with
acetic acid.    To obtain these compounds, it is only necessary to add a
little of the freshly precipitated metallic oxide, and an excess of one
of the acids named, to a solution of phyllocyanin in boiling alcohol,
keeping the solution boiling for several hours, then filtering and
adding water, in which the compounds are insoluble.              The precipi
tated compounds, which are generally of a bright green, are filtered
off and washed before treatment with reagents.
    The following is an enumeration of the compounds obtained in the
way just described : —

   It wonld, of course, be easy to extend this list by taking a greater
variety of acids and metallic oxides.
   Nevertheless, strange to say, several compounds, the existence of
which might have been anticipated, are not formed under the same
conditions as those above enumerated.           Phyllocyanin does not enter
into combination when its alcoholic solution is boiled with cupric
oxide and oxalic acid, zinc oxide and oxalic acid, zinc oxide and
tartaric acid, ferrous oxide and tartaric acid.        I could also see no in
dication of double compounds of phyllocyanin hydrochloride with
the chlorides of platinnm, mercury, or copper being formed, but on
the other hand, a double sulphate of phyllocyanin and copper seems
to exist.    Attempts to form compounds by heating mixtures of
phyllocyanin with glycerin and various fatty acids, at a temperature
of 130°, led to negative results.
   The various compounds above enumerated have a number of pro
perties in common, though the several classes differ, inter se, in some
important particulars.
   They all dissolve more or less easily in alcohol, ether, chloroform,
benzol and carbon disulphide, in fact in all the solvents which take
up phyllocyanin and chlorophyll, but they are all insoluble in water,
with the exception of the phyllocyanin manganese acetate, which
dissolves readily therein.        The solutions have a green colour, varying
from grass-green, like that of chlorophyll solutions, to a fine bluish-
green or blue, and they show peculiar spectra.            The alcoholic solu
tions remain quite unchanged when sulphuretted hydrogen is passed
through them, no precipitate is formed, and the solutions,                  on
evaporation, leave the various compounds with their original proper
ties unchanged.    It is only on incineration that the presence of the
metallic constituents is detected, the copper compounds leaving, after
being burnt, cupric oxide ; the zinc compounds, zinc oxide, the iron
compounds, ferric oxide. Lastly, they are all soluble in dilute alkaline
lyes, and arc again precipitated unchanged on the addition of acetic

              Contributions    to the   Chemistry of Chlorophyll.         359
acid.     These  reactions    make    it somewhat doubtful whether these
compounds are to be considered as double salts in the ordinary accep
tation, and whether the metallic constituents may not rather be con-
tained in them somewhat in the same way as the iron in hsetnatin.
    I  have still a few remarks to make on the distinctive properties
characterising the three principal groups of these compounds, the
cupric, zinc, and ferrous groups.
     Of these, the cupric compounds are the most beautiful, and, at the
same time, the most stable.         Their solutions show a brilliaut colour,
inclining more to blue than green, and spectra with four absorption
bands, the position of which varies somewhat according to the acid
employed.       They are not decomposed by treatment with strong acids.
if an alcoholic solution of any one of them be mixed with a large
quantity of hydrochloric acid and boiled, the colour is not changed,
and on adding water, and then shaking up with ether, the ethereal
liquid which rises to the surface shows the same colour and the same
spectrum as the original alcoholic solution.         The phyllocyanin cupric
acetate is the most beautiful of the series. It is best prepared by
 adding cupric acetate to a solution of phyllocyanin in boiling acetic
 acid.     The crystalline mass which separates out on standing is
 filtered off, treated with dilute hydrochloric acid to remove any
 excess of cupric acetate that may be present, and then redissolved in
 glacial acetic acid boiling.         The solution on cooling deposits the
compound in crystalline scales, which are elongated, pointed at the
 ends, of a pale greenish-blue by transmitted light, and of a brilliant
 purple, with a semi-metallic           lustre, by •reflected light ; it much
 resembles crystallised      indigo-blue.       The other cupric compounds
 yield only microscopic crystals.
     The zincic group of compounds yield solutions of a brilliant green,
 showing spectra of five bands. These compounds are distinguished
from the preceding by their instability in the presence of strong acids.
 If an alcoholic solution of any one of the zinc compounds be mixed
 with hydrochloric acid. and boiled, its colour changes to bine. On now
 adding water, the blue colour disappears, and a precipitate is formed
 which on shaking up with ether dissolves. The ethereal solution
 has the colour and shows the absorption spectrum of phyllocyanin
 solutions. The zinc compounds are therefore decomposed by hydro
 chloric acid, yielding phyllocyanin again as one of the products of
decomposition.
     The behaviour    of  phyllocyanin towards        zinc   oxide in the pre
sence of organic acids may serve to explain a peculiar phenomenon
first observed by Church* and subsequently described by Tschirch.
The former took chlorophyll that had become olive-brown on standing,
iind, acting on it with zinc powder in the water-oven, obtained a body
                         • " Chemical News," xxiviii, 168.

 yielding bright green solutions, which he took to be regenerated
 chlorophyll.    Tschirch acted on Hoppe-Seyler's chlorophyllan with
 zinc powder, and observed the same phenomenon, the conclusion at
which he arrived being the same, viz., that chlorophyll is reproduced
from chlorophyllan by the reducing action of zinc. I think, however,
that what Tschirch obtained was, in reality, a zinc compound, and
would have been formed just as well by using zinc oxide. Chloro
phyllan is probably an impure substance, containing, it may be, some
fatty acid, together with phyllocyanin, so that by the action of zinc
oxide on the mixture a compound similar to those above described
may be formed.
   I have tried the experiment with the precipitate produced by treat
ing a chlorophyll solution with hydrochloric acid, which probably
differs very little from chlorophyllan, dissolving it in boiling alcohol,
adding zinc oxide and boiling for some time, when a bright green
liquid was obtained, which might have been taken for a solution of
chlorophyll, but evidently contained a zinc compound of the same
character as those formed directly from phyllocyanin by a similar
process. The spectrum was identical with that of the zinc compounds
from phyllocyanin.
   The ferrous group of compounds yield solutions of a pure green,
like that of chlorophyll. They are not, however, strikingly fluo
rescent, and when exposed to sunlight in open vessels they retain
their colour unchanged for a long time. The group may be divided
into two sub-groups : the first sub-group comprising compounds
into which one of the fatty acids — acetic, palmitic, or oleic acid —
enters as a constituent ; the other sub-group, such as are formed by
the action of citric, malic, or phosphoric acid.   The members of the
first sub-group show, in solution, the same spectrum, consisting of
four ill-defiued absorption bands, with much obscuration throughout.
To the other group belongs a spectrum consisting also of four bands,
which are, however, differently placed and more distinct than with
the first sub-group.     If a small quantity of hydrochloric acid be
i;dded to an alcoholic solution of any one of the iron compounds the
solution acquires a blue tint, and the bands are now found to have
shifted considerably towards the blue end. This effect may be due to
the removal of a portion of the iron, and the formation of compounds
with less iron. If a member of the second sub-group be taken, the
phosphate or the malate for instance, then on the addition of hydro
chloric acid a spectrum is obtained which closely resembles the
ordinary chlorophyll spectrum as regards the number, position, and
relative strength of the bands. The members of the first sub-group
undergo a further change by treatment with an excess of hydro
chloric acid and boiling, but the resulting product is not phyllo
cyanin.

    All the members of the iron group of compounds undergo a peculiar
change by the action of ether. When the alcoholic solution of any
one of them is mixed with its own volume of ether, the green colour
gradually fades and gives place to yellow.         All the bands except
that in the red disappear, while another fine band further in the red
makes its appearance.       At length the two bands in the red also
vanish, and nothing is now seen but a considerable obscuration at the
blue end, due to the presence of a yellow colouring matter in solu
tion. The change resembles that which is seen on exposure of a
chlorophyll solution to air and sunlight ; it takes place, however,
quite as readily in a closely stoppered bottle, kept in the dark, as in
an open tube exposed to light. It is effected more rapidly by ordinary
methylated ether than by pure ether. Benzol and acetone act in the
same way as ether, but chloroform and carbon disulphide are without
effect.
   The phyllocyanin manganese acetate, which is obtained by adding
manganese acetate to a solution of phyllocyanin in glacial acetic acid,
differs from the compounds previously described by its solubility in
water.    It also dissolves easily in alcohol, but less readily in ether
and benzol. Its solutions are green, like those of the iron compounds,
and show a peculiar spectrum.       It is not changed by treatment with
boiling hydrochloric acid, and its alcoholic solution remains unaltered
when mixed with ether or benzol.

 I. " Preliminary Results of   a Comparison      of certain simultaneous
       Fluctuations of the Declination at Kew and at Stony hurst
       during the Years 1883 and 1884, as recorded by the
       Magnetographs    at these Observatories."            By the Rev.
       Stephen Joseph Perry, F.R.S., Director of the Stony-
       hurst Observatory, and Balfour Stewart, LL.D., F.R.S.,
       Professor of Physics at the Owens College, Manchester.
       Received October 31, 1885.
    From a comparison made by Messrs. Sidgreaves and Stewart
 (" Proc. Roy. Soc," October, 1868), between a few prominent simul
taneous changes of declination at Kew and at Stonyhurst, it appeared
that the ratio between the magnitudes of such changes was not con
stant, but depended to some extent upon the abruptness of the dis
 turbance.
    With the view of examining into this matter, we have made             a
somewhat more detailed    comparison,    selecting  for this purpose  some

 1885.]      Fluctuations  of Declination   at Kew aud Stonyhurst.      363
of    the best marked fluctuations during the years 1883 and 1884, both
 large and small, abrupt and non-abrupt.
    There are two ways in which such a comparison may be made, the
 first of these being to measure the vertical difference in the declina
 tion curve between the two turning points of a fluctuation.         This is
 the method which we have pursued in this investigation. It is, how
ever, subject to the objection that the course of the curve between
 two such points is not precisely a straight line, and hence that this
 course embraces different values of abruptness.
     On the whole, however, this method as we have used it appears to
 us to lead to definite, and we think not inaccurate, results.          The
 other method would be to compare together the simultaneous rates of
 change of the declination at the two observatories, selecting for this
 purpose such portions of the records as present the appearance of
 constant slope, that is to say are straight lines.
     This method we have not hitherto pursued, but it is possible that
 we may do so, and compare it with the other in a contemplated
 future research.
     It is unnecessary to give a description of the magnetographs at the
 two observatories, suffice it to say that both declination magnets are
as nearly as possible of the same size and weight, being about
 tyb inches long, 0'8 inch broad, and O'l inch thick.
     The scale of the arrangement is, however, different at the two
observatories in such a manner that at Kew 1 mm. of scale = 0'87',
 while at Stonyhurst 1 mm. of scale = 1"18'.          It would thus appear
 that equal vertical curve-differences at Kew and at Stonyhurst are to
-each other very nearly in the proportion of 1 to 1•3.          This is the
proportion     which  we  shall use in the present paper.
    For the Kew results, we are indebted to the kindness of the Kew
Committee ; of Mr. Whipple, Superintendent of the Kew Observatory ;
and of Mr. Baker, the magnetical assistant there.

 1885.]    Fluctuations  of Declination  at Kew and Stonyhurst.          3(59
   We do not know of a single instance in which the fluctuation is not
in the same direction at hoth observatories.
   We have given the G.M.T. of the commencement and end of each
fluctuation at each observatory.      Practically speaking, the times at
both places are so nearly simultaneous that we do not feel justified in
asserting that they are not quite so.        Occasionally, however, there
are indications that certain short period fluctuations are not precisely
of the same duration at both places.           In what follows we have
rejected such cases ; also we have adopted the durations as recorded
at the Kew Observatory, rejecting however all cases when these are
less than five minutes, inasmuch as an accurate measure of duration
is essential to our method.
   Let us now, simply as a conjecture which may be of service in
indicating the best method of treating the observations of Table I,
suppose that in these disturbances two causes are in operation, and
that the result is due partly to true magnetic changes, and in part to
secondary currents caused by these changes.
   Let K denote the whole observed value of the disturbance at Kew,
and of this let k denote the portion due to strictly magnetic change,
also let ak<p(f) be the portion of the whole disturbance caused by
fcecondary action, a. being a constant which may conceivably be either
positive or negative, and t denoting the duration.            Hence K =
k(l + a<j)(t)).  In like manner let S denote the whole Stonyhurst
change.
   We are, perhaps, justified in putting S = k(8 + 70(f))i          /3 and   7
being constants.
   Hence    we shall have    jj=^"r"?0M

   It  thus appears that the value of — will, according   to this or indeed
                                      K
according to any probable hypothesis of this nature, be independent
of the values of S and K, and be a simple function of the duration.
   These reasons have induced us to construct the following table (II),

    From Table       11 we may deduce the following conclusions            : —
    (1.) In    the very great majority of cases the angular value of the decli
          nation disturbance is greater for Stonyhurst tluxn for Kew.
                        S
    (2.) The ratio — is certainly greater for disturbances of           short than for
          those of long duration.        Our observations are not, however, suffi
          ciently extensive to enable us to represent this ratio graphically as
          a function of the duration.
    (3.) As far as we can tell from a limited number of observations the
          value of the above ratio does not depend on the magnitude of the
          disturbance.
    We trust to make on a future occasion a more complete comparison
 between the simultaneous magnetic fluctuations as derived from the
 curves of the two observatories.
    Note. — It might be desirable to add a few words in fuller explanation of the
 method adopted.
    This method is founded on the implied belief that disturbances are indications of
 the way in which the magnetic earth rights itself with regard to the forces acting
 upon it. Our experience is that such disturbances never occur singly, but very
 frequently as couplets or sets of couplets. There is no such thing as a magnetic
 tableland separated from another by a single slope.        We have rather a rise and
 then a fall, or it may be a fall and then a rise, and in the end the state of things,
 after the disturbance has run its course, is not greatly different from that before it
 began.   This duality, as well as the results of this paper, would lead us to imagine

  1885.]       Fluctuations     of Declination    at Kew and Stonyltur.it.          378
  that secondary currents must have an influence, perhaps a powerful one, in causing
  disturbances.
     In order to fix the mind, let us here imagine that this secondary current influence
  (exhibited probably in the shape of an earth current) is opposed in direction to the
  true magnetic change.      We should, therefore, expect something of the following
  nature.
                              ¦\kHr-:
                                  V      1\     Ar-^HI-:
                        ED   or E'D' = magnetic change, first movement.
                        DF   or D'F' = magnetic change, second movement.
                         DC or D'C' =— .
     In the first of these diagrams AB denotes a true magnetic descending change,
 ¦while  ACB is the observed disturbance couplet. In the second A'B' denotes a
 true magnetic ascending change, while A'C'B' is the observed disturbance couplet.
     In our various measurements, therefore, it is assumed that we pass from a point
 of no disturbance, A or A', to another, C or C, in which there is a magnetic change
 and a superposed secondary current change, or from a point in which these two
 forces act to a final point, B or B', of no disturbance. Now the maximum earth
 current force will depend upon the maximum rate of magnetic change.          This maxi
 mum rate we cannot tell, but we may imagine it to bo proportional to the mean
 rate of magnetic change, being possibly represented     in an approximate manner by
the expression —

 functions of the text would be replaced by the expressions     (taking both branches of
the curve) —
                                       s
    It would  appear from this as well as from the diagrams that the first turn of a
couplet should bo less than the second.
    The results in our paper cannot, therefore, be regarded as a final analysis, but
merely as being of sufficient interest to demand a fullor inquiry. — November 4th.

II.   " On the Magnetisation of Steel, Cast Iron, and Soft Iron "
       (being the investigation for which the Watt Prize of 1884
       was awarded by the Senate of the University of Glasgow).
       By John W. Gemmell. Communicated by Sir William
       Thomson, Kt, LL.D., F.R.S. Received October 31, 1885.
    The experiments, of which the following is a description, with their
 results, were performed in the Physical Laboratory of the University
of Glasgow, and had for their object the finding of the difference
 between specimens of iron and of steel with respect to the intensities
of their total and residual magnetisation due to different degrees of
magnetising force.
    The specimens consisted of (1) wires of " soft Scotch " iron, of
 " common wire," of " charcoal iron," and of " soft steel ;" and
                                                                    (2) bars
of cast iron and of malleable iron.       The wires were 31 cm. long and
 0po cm. in diameter, and weighed    respectively 39-8o, 39 9, 4l-5, and
 38-5 grams.    The bars, two of which were of cast iron procured from
 different foundries, were 15-25 cm. long, and of section 1 cm. square.
The cast iron bars weighed each 114 grams, and the malleable iron bar
 125 grams.
    The arrangement of the apparatus employed in the investigation is
shown in the accompanying diagram (fig. 1). The magnetising coil,

of 600 turns each of silk-covered copper wire, wound on a brass tube
of the same internal diameter as the wires. It was placed on a con
 venient stand with its axis horizontal and at right angles to the mag
netic meridian. For the experiments on the bars the coil was 21 cm.
 in length, and consisted of five layers of 155 turns each of insulated

1885.  J    Magnetisation   of Steel, Caxt Iron, and Soft Iron.        375
copper wire wound on a copper case of square section just fitting the
bars.
    The magnetising current passing through the coil was obtained from
a battery of Thomson's tray Daniells, by means of which any desired
current above 0*25 of an ampere could be employed.          To obtain cur
rents ranging from 0 to the minimum (0-25) to be got by the battery, a
resistance-box, capable of inserting any resistance up to 10,000 ohms,
was placed in the circuit with a single cell.
    The strength of the current was measured by one of Sir William
Thomson's graded galvanometers, represented at G, a full description
of which will be found in Mr. Andrew Gray's " Absolute Measure
ments in Electricity and Magnetism."
    A reflecting magnetometer, M, of the well-known form devised by
Mr. J. T. Bottomley, was used to measure the intensity of magnetisa
tion. In the experiments on the wires it was placed due magnetic
east of the coil, at a distance of 1 metre from the middle point of its
axis, and in such a position that if the axis were produced it would
pass through the centre of the mirror.         In the experiments on the
bars its position was due magnetic north of the coil.
    A framework, holding a lamp L, and having a scale S of half-
millimetre divisions attached to it, was placed in front of the mag
netometer at such a distance that the scale was exactly 1 metre from
the magnetometer needle. The light from the lamp, passing through
a tube T in front, in which a fine wire is vertically fixed, is reflected
 from the mirror to the scale, and the deflection read by the image of
 the fine wire in the middle of the spot of light.
    The results in these experiments were got by beginning with a
feeble magnetising current, which was increased step by step until the
 maximum obtainable was reached. It was then gradually diminished
to zero, when the direction of the current was reversed, and the same
 process of increasing and diminishing repeated.
    The magnetometer readings taken while the current is flowing repre
sent the effect upon the magnetometer needle of the      joint electromag
netic action of the current passing through the coil, and the magneti
sation it produces in the wire or bar. Hence the effect due to the
 magnetisation of the wire or bar alone is obtained by subtracting from
the total effect the magnetic effect of the coil. This last is propor
 tional to the current flowing, and was found by experiment to be for
the "wire" coil 0-0385, and for the " bar

 of the magnetometer scale per division of the galvanometer scale.
    The results of the investigation are shown in the accompanying
 curves.   The abscissae are divisions of the galvanometer scale, and are
 therefore proportional to the magnetising forces.      The ordinates are
 divisions of the magnetometer scale, and are therefore proportional
 to the magnetisation produced.       The curves marked A represent the

total, and those marked B the residual magnetisation.             Beginning at
zero, we pass to the right, gradually increasing the magnetising force
until we reach our limit. Then returning, we pass through zero, and
with the opposite magnetising force proceed to the left limit, from
which we again return to zero.
   The first experiments were made upon the wires, the results of
which are given in Curves I, II, III, and IV. These wires were after
wards annealed and retested, with the results shown in Curves V to
VIII inclusive. The remaining Curves IX, X, and XI, contain the
results obtained from the bars.
   The results given by the curves maybe reduced to absolute measure
by means of the figures on each, which were obtained in the following
manner    :—

by 0-3604, and those of XI by 0 3287.
   The magnetising force is evaluated by the equation —

where n is the number of turns of wire in the coil per centimetre
of its length, and C the current strength in c.g.s. units passing
through it.
   The abscisses of the curves are scale divisions of the galvanometer,
with its magnetometer at the platform division 32, or the readings at
other divisions reduced to those of this division. Thus the abscissae

approaches very near to the former.    With regard to retentiveness,
the " charcoal iron " shows the least, and the " soft steel " the
greatest.
    Passing on to curves V to VIII inclusive, we find that the general
effect of annealing the wires has been to lower their retentiveness,
and to raise their magnetisability for all forces.      In the " soft Scotch
iron  "  wire little difference has been made ; but in the others the
-ffect is very marked, and is most noticeable in the " charcoal iron "
 wire with respect to its magnetisability, and in the case of the " soft
       " wire with
steel                respect to its retentiveness.   Comparing the results
of these eight experiments then, we find that the specimen which has

inferior to the first in respect of magnetisability. The malleable iron
bar exhibits a very much higher magnetisability than the cast iron
bars ; and its residual magnetisation was so low that it could not be
observed with the same arrangement of apparatus.
   These are the main points in a comparison of the results of the
experiments.     A study of the curves, however, reveals many points
of interest, one or two of which    I may here indicate.
   The curve beginning from the zero of magnetisation was not obtained
in all the experiments, the wires having been previously magnetised
in a preliminary test ; but in those cases in which the smallest mag
netising forces were employed, the curve of results is seen to be for
a short distance concave towards OY.
   Returning again to the small magnetising forces after having pro
ceeded to the limit, we find the curve first becoming concave towards
OY, and then convex just before it crosses that line. On the negative
side of OY, it remains concave for but a short distance, and is convex
when it crosses the line of zero magnetisation, remaining so both in
the direct and the return curves until we again near the zero of
magnetising force, when it becomes concave for a short distance up
to zero.    To show these points clearly, the central portion on an
enlarged scale has been affixed to each set of curves.
   Turning to the curves for the residual magnetisation, an interesting
point at once presents itself. This is a loop between the direct and
return curves, more or less marked in most of the diagrams, but best
seen in No. IV.     A similar loop is seen in the curves of total magnet
isation in Nos. V and VII, and there seems to be a tendency to form
such a loop in all these curves.    Regarding that part of the positive
return curve which represents the effects of the small magnetising
forces, we see that the residual magnetisation first begins to take a
greater value, and then diminishes again just before the zero of
magnetising force is reached.
   I shall defer any discussion of these anomalies until   I have made a
further observation of them under conditions more suitable for their
special investigation.

   It occurred to me that a stndy of the action of water on ammonium
carbamate, with reference to the influence of time, mass, and tempera
ture, wonld be of interest as tending to throw light upon the laws
which govern    a chemical  action of the simplest type in the liquid state
—the    action consisting of the direct union of two simpler molecules
to form one more complex —
                 COCNHgXONHJ + OHjrrCCKONHJj,
There are but few such actions which can be investigated, where all
the substances are in the liquid state and all extraneous matter
absent.

presence of sodium hydroxide, yields one-half of its nitrogen in the
free state, the other half remaining in the form of sodinm carbamate —
  2CO (NH3)   (ONH   J + 3NaC10 +    2NaOH= 2CO(NHs) (ONa) + 3NaCl
                               + 50HS+N3.
Sodinm hypobromite at once decomposes sodium carbamate, evolving
its nitrogen in the free state —
       2CO(NH2) (ONa) + 3NaBrO + 2NaOH= 2CO(ONa)2+ 3NaBr
                                + 3H20 + N3.
This, in fact, may be claimed as a specific reaction for carbamates —
no other substance yet investigated will yield nitrogen when treated
with a hypobromite after the completed action of a hypochlorite.
Urea evolves but half its nitrogen with a hypochlorite, in presence of
caustic alkali, but the other half remains as a cyanate, which is not
acted upon by a hypobromite.*
    Based upon this reaction, then, we have a direct and simple method
of determining the amount of carbamate existing in a solution at any
given time.
    Since, under the action of a hypochlorite, ammonium carbamate
yields one-half of its nitrogen (i.e., that present as ammonium), it is
evident that any excess over and above this half which is evolved
from its solution, is a measure of the water which has been assimilated
converting the carbamate into carbonate.
    For the sake of convenience we may express the hydration which
occurs in terms of the ratio of the number of molecules of water
assimilated to that of the molecules of ammonium carbamate taken.
Let V = the total volume of nitrogen contained in the ammonium
carbamate taken, and V1 = that evolved by the action of a hypochlo-
rite on its solution.      Then the above ratio evidently =            —L—V
                                                                       2V
 (since  one atom  of nitrogen evolved in      excess   of the half total corre
sponds to one molecule of water assimilated, and two atoms of nitrogen
originally present represent one molecule of ammonium carbamate
taken).
    The ammoninm carbamate used in these experiments was prepared
 by the direct union of carefully dried ammonia and carbon dioxide.
 The apparatus employed in the estimation of the evolved nitrogen
 was similar to that described in a former paper on the action of
  Hypochlorites in Urea.*
    Experiments were undertaken with a view of investigating to what
extent the action is influenced by (1) time, (2) mass, (3) tempera
ture, and (4) to study the reverse action, namely, the dehydration of
 normal ammoninm carbonate into ammonium carbamate.

After about 24 hours 47-96 c.c. of nitrogen were obtained.
    It is evident from these results that the action, which proceeds
rapidly at first, becomes progressively slower, and finally reaches a
limit short of complete hydration.
    The time required to reach a determinate state of hydration is
evidently greater for a strong solution than a weak one, i.e., decreases
as the relative number of water molecules increases.

    Another experiment was made in which the ratio of the molecular
weights was nearly 1 : 1, namely, 0-2614 gram ammonium carbamate
with 0-0632 gram water.                After standing for two days, 49-52 c.c.
nitrogen (corr.)      were     obtained   — theory for total nitrogen requiring
75 0 c.c.     The hydration was therefore 0 3187.
    It follows from the above results that the hydration is a function of
the number of water molecules present.                So far the minimum hydra
tion corresponds to the case in which the substances are present in
about equal molecular proportions, and is in this respect analogous to
the combination of iodine with hydrogenf and of phosphorus trichlo
ride with chlorine.      J    From analogy it was to be expected that the
hydration would again increase as the ratio of the ammonium carba
mate molecules to those of water increased ; but the experiment
cannot be made under the same conditions as those above, since with
any appreciable excess of the carbamate the water is insufficient to
completely      moisten the solid.

which occur at about 20 — 22° C, from which the temperature varied
but little throughout the experiments.

   In  order to gain some idea as to the effect which temperature
might have upon the action, two equal volumes of an arbitrary solu
tion of ammonium carbamate were taken and kept in sealed vessels,
one at the temperature of the room — about 15° C, and the other in
melting ice. After about five hours the solutions were examined by
the hypochlorite method, taking care to keep the apparatus in each
case as nearly as possible at the respective temperatures.

   The hydration is therefore, in all cases, less at the lower tempera
ture.
   The minimum hydration will probably occur at a sufficiently low
temperature, and when the substances are present in equal molecular
proportions. A mixture was made of 0-6199 gram ammonium car
bamate with 0-1424 gram of water — corresponding almost exactly to
equal molecular weights.         This mixture was kept in a sealed tube
placed in a block of ice for 18 hours, when it may be safely assumed
that the equilibrium state was arrived at. It was then examined by
the hypochlorite method (the apparatus being kept at about 0° C.
throughout), and yielded 95-90 c.c. of nitrogen (corrected). Theory
for total nitrogen requires 177-1 c.c, so that the hydration is repre
sented by 0 0830.
    Probably, at a sufficiently low temperature, the hydration would be
practically nil, when the substances are present in molecular pro
 portions —i.e., ammonium carbamate and water would practically not
combine at all — resembling the cases of phosphorus trichloride and
chlorine, &c, at sufficiently high temperatures.

     These results indicate that normal ammonium carbonate undergoes
 dehydration into carbamate when in solntion, and that the dehydra
 tion is greater as the relative number of water molecules is less.
     The instability of normal ammonium carbonate, and the difficulty
 of obtaining it free from adhering impurities has, for the present,
 prevented me from making more extended observations on this part
 of the subject.       It seems not unlikely, that if the same relative
 number of molecules could be started with, the same equilibrium
 state between carbamate, carbonate, and water, would be arrived at
 for the same temperature, whether ammonium carbamate or normal
 carbonate were initially taken — that is, that the curves of hydration
 and dehydration would meet at the same point.          I hope before long to
 be able to make experiments in this direction.
    Since there is this tendency for ammonium carbonate to become in
 part dehydrated in aqueous solution, and for the system to come to a
 state of equilibrium where the carbamate and carbonate co-exist, it
 seems probable that the hydrolysis of urea, under the action of
ferments, Ac, may be less simple than is usually represented — that
the reaction, instead of being simply CO(NH,)2 + 2HsO=CO(ONH4),,
may be of the following type : —                                  •
MCO(NH2)2+(2n-m)HsO=mCO(NH3)(ONH4)-r(n-m)CO(ONHJ2.
    I  propose to attack this subject by the same method as those
employed above.
    By means of the actions of sodium hypochlorite and hypobromite
it is evidently possible and easy to estimate quantitatively urea,
carbamic    acid,   and   ammonia,     when all are present      in the same
solution.
    Take two equal portions of the solution to be examined, treat one
with sodium hypobromite, and let the volume of nitrogen evolved
(corrected for loss) =VV
    Treat the other portion with sodium hypochlorite, and let V2 =

   A   preliminary trial of this method with a mixture of urea and
ammonium carbamate gave very satisfactory results.
   It appears to me that no really satisfactory method has hitherto
been known by which carbamic acid could be detected and estimated
in presence of urea and ammonia,        so that the process indicated above
may perhaps be of service in investigations       bearing on the formation
of urea in the animal body, and its origin, whether             carbamic or
otherwise.

IV. " On       the Relation of the Reptiliferous Sandstone of Elgin
        to the Upper Old Red Sandstone."                   By Professor John W.
        Judd, F.R.S., Sec. G.S.           Received November 19, 1885.
    The question of the geological age of the yellow sandstones of the-
district lying to the north of the city of Elgin has been, as is well
known, the subject of very animated discussions among geologists.
Some have even gone so far as to assert that the evidence on the
question, which has been adduced by palaeontologists, is absolutely
incapable of reconciliation with that relied upon by stratigraphists.
    Until the discovery of fossils in the beds in question, it was quite
natural to suppose that these white and yellow sandstones, which
locally assume reddish tints, are part and parcel of the Upper Old
Red Sandstone — a formation presenting somewhat similar mineral
characters, and covering a considerable area in the district.                Thi-
was the view which was taken by Murchison and Sedgwick, Dr. Mal-
colmson, Dr. Gordon, Mr. A. Robertson of Inverugie, Captain Brick-
enden, Mr. Patrick Duff, Mr. Martin, and indeed of all the geologists
who at first studied the relations of the rocks in Morayshire.
    But when fossils, which proved to be of great interest and impor
tance both to the geologist and the biologist, were detected in this
formation, a careful re- examination of the evidence relied upon by
these geological pioneers was called for. The nature of these remark
able fossils was indeed calculated to awaken the gravest doubt as to
the correctness of the commonly received opinions concerning the
position in the geological series of the strata which yielded them.
    In 1844 Mr. Patrick Duff obtained from the quarries .at Lossie
mouth, near Elgin, a cast of portion of the dermal covering of an
organism of considerable size. Drawings of this fossil were sent by
Mr. A. Robertson, of Inverugie, to Agassiz, and were by that natu
ralist described under the name of Stagonolepis Roberteoni*               Agassiz
regarded the fossil as the impression of the scales of a ganoid fish allied
 to Megalichthys and Glyptopomus.             Six years later, in 1850, Captain
 Brickenden obtained, from quarries in the same rock, at Cummings-
town, a series of remarkable footprints, which were believed by most
palaeontologists to indicate the existence of reptiles at the time when
the beds were deposited ; and in the following year Mr. Patrick Duff
 obtained from the Spynie quarries the skeleton of a small Lacertilian,
 which wrr described by Mantell under the name of Telerpeton
 Elginense.^      Shortly after this, many more footprints were detected

in the quarries about Cummingstown and Hopeman, and casts of the
dermal armour of Stagonolepis were obtained from Findrassie, a little
to the south-west        of Spynie.
    In 1858, Professor Huxley made the important announcement that
Stagonolepis was not a fish, as supposed by Agassiz, but a Crocodilian ;
at the same time stating that he had recognized the remains of a third
species of reptile among fossils sent to him by Dr. Gordon from
Lossiemouth ; this new reptile subsequently received the name of
Hyperodapedon Oordoni.*
    In 1867 the same author was able to demonstrate from fresh and
better preserved specimens which had been discovered at Lossie
mouth, that Telerpeton was not only a true Lizard, bnt one of a very
specialised type ;t and two years later he gave a full description of the
structure and zoological position of Hyperodapedon, showing it to have
been a Lacertilian having affinities with the recent Sphenodon and the
Triassic Rhynchosaurus ; he was also able to announce the discovery
of remains of the          same   genus in the Keuper of Warwickshire and
Devonshire, and in the Maledi (Trias) beds of India.J
    The year 1877 was marked by the publication of Professor Huxley's
Monograph on Stagonolepis, in which he referred to an interesting
cast of a jaw from the Findrassie quarry, to which he gave the name
of Dasygnathus longidens. This rather obscure fossil, it was shown,
might possibly be referable. to the fishes or Labyrinthodonts, though
it  presents some points of resemblance with the Dinosaurs. §
    In the year 1884 I saw in the Elgin Museum the cast of a skeleton
which had recently been obtained from a quarry newly opened near
 Elgin, and to be more particularly referred to in the sequel. This
fossil appeared to me to be so different from all the remains hitherto
found in the formation, that I obtained an impression of it and sub
mitted it to Professor Hnxley, who recognised in it certain characters
distinctive of the Dinosauria.              From the same quarry a skeleton
apparently belonging to another lizard, distinct alike from Telerpeton
and Hyperodapedon, with portions of the skeleton of the last-men
tioned genus, were also obtained.
    Returning to Elgin in the autumn of the present year,                I was told
by my friend Dr. Gordon that another reptilian specimen, including
the skull and some other parts of the skeleton, had been found in the
same quarry. On examining this specimen                      I at once saw that it
exhibited the characteristic features of Dicynodon, and my opinion on
the subject was confirmed by my friend Dr. Traquair, F.R.S., of

Edinburgh, who, at my request, proceeded to examine the specimen.
A second example of the same genus has since been discovered, and I
trust that ere long a full description of this interesting addition to
our British fossils will be given by Dr. Traquair.
    In addition to these facts, I may add that casts of teeth, undis-
tinguishable from those of Ceratodus, were some time ago obtained
from the Spynie quarries.
    The present state of the palaeontological evidence concerning the
age of the beds then is as follows.          The strata have yielded the
remains of no less than four orders of reptiles, all of them belonging
to forms very different to any which have been found in Paleozoic
rocks.     The Lacertilia are represented by Telerpeton, Hyperodapedon,
and an undescribed form ; Crocodilia by Stagonolepis ; Dinosauria
by an undescribed skeleton and possibly by Dasygnathus ; and Dicy-
nodontia by two individuals belonging to the type genus of the order.
In addition to these we have a great number of footprints differing
so greatly in form and size that they must probably have been made
by creatures of very different proportions and organisation.        Professor
Huxley in his later researches on the subjects of these footprints* points
out the necessity of the greatest caution in any attempts to correlate
them with either of the reptiles whose skeletons have been found in
 the same formation ; indeed, he hesitates as to whether the most per
 fectly preserved of them should be referred to Amphibians or to
 representatives of one or other of the orders of Reptilia.           Among
 the less perfect of the markings in these         and   other rocks of the
 Elgin district, there are not a few concerning which I have serious
 doubts whether they are to be ascribed to vertebrate animals at all.
     It will be seen from this summary that the palaeontological evidence
 in favour of the Triassic ago of the Elgin sandstones is now absolutely
 overwhelming.      Besides the remains of Hyperodapedon and Bicynodon,
 genera which appear to be confined to Triassic strata, in districts so
 widely separated as South Africa, India, the Ural Mountains, and the
  British Islands, we have Stagonolepis, a crocodile with Mesozoic
 affinities, the highly organised Telerpeton, and Dinosaurs ; the last
  mentioned having never been found in any rocks older than Trias.
  Ceratodus, too, has usually been regarded as having commenced in
  the Trias, though it must be admitted that difficulty may exist in
 separating the cast fonnd at Spynie from Ctenodus, which occurs in
  the Carboniferous, or Dipterus, which occurs in the Devonian.
     There are certain facts concerning the distribution of these fossils
 in the formation where they occur, to which it may be instructive to
 refer as bringing out into strong relief the imperfection of the
 geological record.     The footprints, which are so abundant at Cum-
  mingstown and Hopeman, would appear to have been seldom, if ever,

found in the quarries where the bones and scutes occur. All the
specimens of these bones and scutes which have been obtained at
Lossiemouth seem to have occurred in a single course of rock at the
bottom of the quarries, where the useful building stone ceases.       All
the specimens obtained from this locality seem to belong to Stagono
lepis, Hyperodapedon, and Telerpeton.     In the new quarry near Elgin,
however, neither Stagonolepis nor Telerpeton has been found, but
Dinosaurs and Dicynodonts occur.
   Let us now inquire what is the nature of the stratigraphical
evidence which has been regarded as opposed to the palaeontological
arguments in favour of the Triassic age of this formation. At the
outset it is necessary to bear in mind two very important circum
stances.    First. The exposures of the Reptiliferous Sandstone and
of the Upper Old Red in the district are more or less isolated, the
greater part of the country being thickly covered by drift and other
superficial deposits.    Secondly. The whole of the rocks in the district
exhibit evidence of having undergone great disturbance ; this is
shown by their steep inclinations, and by the foldings and fractures
which can often be recognised in the quarries opened in them.
    The Reptiliferous Sandstone makes its appearance at the surface in
two parallel ridges, ranging from north-east to south-west for a dis
tance of about nine miles. The most northerly of these ridges extends
from Brandenburgh to Burghead.            Although the rocks are well
exhibited both in sea-cliffs and in reefs on the shore, the only fossils
obtained from them are the footprints of the Cummingstown and Hope-
man quarries, near the south-western extremity of the ridge, and the
remains of Stagonolepis, Telerpeton, and Hyperodapedon, found in a
single bed at Lossiemouth, at its north-eastern end. A tract of about
three miles wide, thickly covered by superficial deposits, completely
isolates the northern or coast ridge from the southern one, which is
known as the Quarry wood ridge. In this Quarry wood ridge the Reptili
ferous Sandstone is only found along its northern face for a distance
of about three miles. The southern slope of the ridge is composed of the
ordinary rocks of the Upper Old Red Sandstone, containing Holo-
ptychius nobilissirnus Ag., with species of Glyptopomus and Pterichthys.
 There is no evidence of the occurrence of Triassic strata, either along
the southern slopes of the Qnarrywood ridge or in the district lying
 still further south about the city of Elgin. The localities in which
the sandstone containing reptiles has been found along the northern
slope of the Quarry wood ridge are as follows : — At Spynie, which
may be regarded as a north-eastern      prolongation of the Quarrywood
ridge, the deep quarries have yielded Telerpeton, Hyperodapedon, and
 Ccratodus.    At Findrassie Wood, a mile and a half further to the
 south-west, a quarry now abandoned, has yielded Staganolepis and
 Datygnathus.     Lastly, the quarry near the top of the ridge, above

                               Prof.   J. W. Judd.                        [Dec. 10,
New Spynie Church, and a mile and a half still further to the south
west than Findrassie, has yielded Hyperodapedon and another lizard
with a Dinosaur and a Dicynodont.
   The difference in mineral characters between the Triassic Sand
stone on the northern side of the Quarrywood ridge and the Upper
 Old Red Sandstone on its southern face is certainly not a very
striking or well-marked one. But this is a circumstance at which no
geologist who is in the habit of studying the Old and the New Red                   .
 Sandstone will be surprised.       Nevertheless, a careful study of the two
sets of rocks shows that there are appreciable differences between them,
 and, as a matter of fact, practised observers like Dr. Gordon seldom
find any real difficulty in pronouncing at a glance whether any par
ticular mass of building-stone belongs to the " reptiliferous
                                                                           " or the
" holoptychian " formation.        It must be admitted, however, that occa
sionally the pale-pink Old-Red rock assumes a nearly white colour,
while tho white or yellow " reptiliferous " rocks locally acquire reddish
tints, undistinguishable from those of the "holoptychian
                                                                       " sandstone.
   In both the coast ridge and the Quarrywood ridge, as was well
pointed out by Dr. Gordon, the Reptiliferous Sandstone is seen to be
covered by a very peculiar and easily-recognisable              deposit, known as
the   " Cherty rock of Stotfield." It has been frequently suggested
that the preservation of these two sandstone ridges, and thus of the
whole peninsula between Burghead Bay and Spey Bay, was in all pro
bability due to the presence of this remarkable rock, which offers such
resistance to the ordinary agents of denudation.*                The rock consists
of a more or less intimate admixture of siliceous and calcareous mate
rials, including also crystallised patches of galena, blende, and pyrites ;
it has yielded no trace of organic remains. Sir Roderick Murchison
compared the
                  " Cherty rock of Stotfield " with the Cornstones of the
Old-Red rocks, with which, however, it has but little in common ;
and some confusion appears to have arisen from bands of true Corn-
stone, which occur in Upper Old Red Sandstone to the south of Elgin,
having been taken for the Cherty rock of the Trias.
   Professor Harkness, in 1864, was able to show that the positions in
which the Cherty rock and the Reptiliferous Sandstone occur in the
neighbourhood        of Elgin are such as can only be explained by the
existence of great faults. At a later date,         I showed how numerous are
the indications of disturbance in the district —evidence of tilting of
the beds, of actual contortion, and of fracture occurring in many of
the quarries.       In the New Bishopmill Quarries, for example, the
effects  of  a fault,  in throwing side by side beds of valuable freestone
and other sandstones unsuitable for building purposes, is very clearly
seen, and similar evidence is found all over the area where these beds
occur.      On the north of the coast-ridge I have shown that beds of

 Inferior Oolite are seen faulted against the Trias of Stotfield,* and
 the same is probably the case also at Burghead.                      In the great
 " Scars" or reefs which lie off this coast red sandstones are seen, and
 I  have been assured that scales of Holoptychius occur in them.                  If
 this be true, then the whole of the Mesozoic strata, forming the
 peninsula between Burghead Bay and Spey Bay, consists of rocks
 which are actually let down by trough-faults and synclinal folds into
 the midst of a tract of the Upper Old Red Sandstone.                  The presence
 of such great lines of dislocation is unquestionable, and in the paper
 referred to   I  have endeavoured by means of dotted lines to indicate
 the approximate position of some of them.              It must be remembered,
 however, that    in   a  country so deeply covered by drift as Northern
 Morayshire, the working out of the relations of the rock-masses by
 tracing their outcrops at the surface is an almost hopeless task.
    As throwing an entirely new light on the age and relations of the
 Reptiliferous Sandstone of Elgin,          I   was able in the year 1873 to
 show that strata identical in character with that deposit and with the
 Cherty rock of Stotfield occur on the northern, as well as on the
 southern side of the Moray Firth. At Dunrobin, in Sutherland, the
 yellow sandstones are seen covered by the Cherty rock, and this in
 turn is overlain in apparently conformable sequence by the various
 members of the Lias and Oolite. The whole of the Mesozoic strata
 of Sutherland are seen to be thrown by a great fault against the
 Lower Old Red Sandstone and the Crystalline rocks of the Highlands.
    Although it is certain, however, that some of the cases of juxta
 position between the Old Red and the Triassic strata must be due to
 faulting, yet there are reasons for believing that the latter strata
 lie directly and unconformably upon the former.                  But, as was re
 marked by Dr. Gordon in 1877, " the district is so covered by drift
 that no junction of the Holoptychian and the Reptiliferous strata has
 been laid bare."
    It was therefore with the greatest interest that in the summer of
        I
_1884 learned from that veteran geologist, whose important services
 to science have extended over a period of more than half a century,
 that the bones of reptiles had at last been detected in the same
 quarry with the remains of Holoptychius.              On repairing to Elgin       I
 received the greatest assistance in investigating the matter from Mr.
 J. Gordon Phillips, the intelligent and energetic curator of the Elgin
 Museum.
    It appears that about the beginning of 1882 an old stone-pit, known
 as " the Millstone Quarry," and situated near the summit of the
 Quarrywood ridge, immediately above the church of New Spynie, had
 been reopened, and extensive excavations had since been carried on
 there.   The beds here present a somewhat similar character to those

of Lossiemouth and Spynie, consisting of white or pale-yellow sand
stone, containing occasional black particles composed of iron and
 manganese oxides.       The sandstones of this pit are generally much
coarser in grain than those at Lossiemouth and Spynie, and they some
times even pass into a grit.       In some of the beds, particles of fel
spar occur   in such   profusion  as  almost to cause the rock to assume
                          "
the appearance of an arkose."          That these rocks really belong to
the Reptiliferous Sandstone has been confirmed by the finding, np
to the present time, of no less than six skeletons of reptiles, and

   The Reptiliferous Sandstone, both of the coast ridge and of the
Quarrywood ridge, not unfrequently contains scattered pebbles of
                     '-
quartz ; but at the     Cutties' Hillock Quarry," as the new pit is now
called, this feature is more strikingly exhibited, and such quartz-
pebbles become very abundant, especially in some of the lower beds.
As the excavations    were carried downwards,     indeed, the coarse sand
 stone was seen passing into a conglomerate, called by the workmen
the " pebbly-post."     This bed of conglomerate was found to be from
3 feet 6 inches to 4 feet thick, and, it being considered desirable to
determine  if other courses of freestone fit for building purposes under
lie the " pebbly-post," a trial-shaft was opened at the bottom of the
quarry.
   It was discovered in this way that the " pebbly-post," which in it-
lower portion becomes more perfectly conglomeratic, and contains
pebbles of white and purple quartz up to the size of the fist, rests on
beds of pink and red sandstones, very finely laminated, and exhibiting
evidence of much false-bedding.       These beds are strikingly different in
character from the coarse-grained, white sandstones lying above the
" pebbly-post," in which the bedding is usually indistinct and im
perfect.   The stone lying below the conglomerate was found to be
nnsuited for building purposes, and the trial-shaft, after being carried
to the depth of 13 feet in the bottom-rock, was abandoned; very
fortunately, however, the last blast which was fired in it revealed a
remarkably fine specimen of Holoptychius, which has been identified-
by Dr. Traquair as H. nobilissimus, and is now in the Elgin Museum.
   It unfortunately happened that no careful geological . study wa-
made of the beds exposed in the trial-shaft at the time when it was
            I
open ; but was able, with the assistance of Mr. J. Gordon Phillips,
and of Mr. Watts, the very intelligent lessee of the quarry, aided by
an inspection of the materials thrown out, to substantiate the above
facts and to add the following details : —
   The red and finely-laminated sandstones of the Upper Old Red
Sandstone are directly overlain by the bed of quartzose conglomerate.
This latter bed, which is from 3 feet 6 inches to 4 feet in thickness,
contains fewer and smaller pebbles in its upper part, and thus

 graduates insensibly into the coarse Reptiliferous Sandstone, which
forms a number of courses, each from 3 feet to 4 feet thick, and are
 exposed to a depth of over 20 feet. The Reptiliferous Sandstone in this
 pit section exhibits evidence of considerable disturbance ; its beds dip
to the north-east at an angle of about 15°, while, at one part of the pit,
there are indications, in great slickensided surfaces and a slight dis
placement of the beds, of a small fault.       In these upper sandstones
remains of a least six reptiles have up to the present time been dis
covered, five of them occurring in one course of stone, while the
remaining one came from the bed immediately below.             The forms
represented in this pit are Hyjperodapedon,          and another lizard,
Dicynodon, and a Dinosaur.
   The characters of the sandstones above the bed of conglomerate are
very distinct from those of the sandstones below it.       The former are
very   fine grained and  have their lamination  very strongly pronounced,
exhibiting much false-bedding; while the latter are usually much
coarser and seldom show any trace of stratification.     The colours, too,
are very distinctive, but this is a character upon which it would be
unwise to place much reliance.       Examined in thin sections, under the
microscope,    I found that the two sandstones present well-marked and
constant differences.
    These facts all point to the conclusion that the Reptiliferous Sand
stone of Elgin passes downwards into a bed of conglomerate, which
rests unconformably upon the strata of the Upper Old Red Sandstone.
                                             I
   During a visit to Sutherland last year, also obtained evidence that
a precisely similar relation in all probability exists between the
Triassic rocks and the Upper Old Red Sandstone on the northern side
of   the Murray Firth.
    Some years ago Dr. Joass of Golspie found remains of Holoptychius
in the sandstones which crop out in reefs on the shore at some distance
southward from that place. Between these reefs of Upper Old Red
Sandstone and those of Dunrobin, where           I  was able in 1873 to-
identify the Reptiliferous Sandstone and the Cherty rock overlying it,
the rocks are wholly concealed. But Dr. Joass showed me masses of
a conglomerate which are frequently thrown up by the waves on the
Golspie shore, containing yellow and purple quartz-pebbles, and
identical in character with the rock of the "pebbly-post"          in the
Cutties, Hillock Quarry near Elgin. There can be little doubt that
 the bed from which these fragments are derived lies between the
Trias and the Upper Old Red Sandstone of the Sutherland coast.
    The Royal Society long ago testified its sense of the importance of
determining the age and relations of the remarkable strata of Elgin,
by appointing a Committee and making a grant from the Donation
Fund to aid in securing new specimens of the fossils. Seeing, then,
that an opportunity offered itself for determining the exact relations

the Council of this Society for a grant to be applied in excavations
directed to uncovering the line of junction between the two beds.
   My request having been acceded to, the kind intervention of Dr.
Gordon obtained for me the permission of Thomas Yool, Esq., of
Leuchars, the factor of the Earl of Fife, on whose property the quarry
is situated, for carrying out the necessary work. The Messrs. A. and
W. Watt, the lessees of the quarry, not only rendered mnch valuable
advice and assistance, but kindly undertook the personal superintend
ence of the necessary operations.     In making a careful examination
                                       I
of the pit, after it had been opened, had the great advantage of the
aid and judicious counsel of Professor T. G. Bonney, F.R.S:, Pre
sident of the Geological Society.
   We were able to observe that, while the conglomerate of the
" pebbly-post " graduates insensibly into the overlying Reptiliferous
Sandstone, it is sharply divided from the red sandstones below.      It
was unfortunately found that, owing to the imperfect bedding of the
upper series and the prevalence of oblique lamination in the lower
one, it was impossible to obtain decisive evidence of a discordance of
dip between them. But the line of junction between the two sets of
strata, which was exposed for a distance of 10 feet only, showed
every appearance of being an eroded one. We came to the conclusion
                                                       "
that while the upper series having the " pebbly-post for its base, is
certainly perfectly distinct from the lower one, there can scarcely be
the smallest doubt that the former rests uncomformably upon the
latter ; in other words, the evidence points to the conclusion that
during the vast periods of the Carbiniferous and Permian, the Upper
Old Red Sandstone of the Elgin area was upheaved and denuded, and
that subsequently the Upper Trias beds were deposited unconformably
upon the eroded surface.
   As the question of the age and relations of these interesting rocks
may now be considered as definitely settled, it may be well to give a
brief resume of what is known concerning the interesting patches of
Triassic strata in the east of Scotland, from which such important
palseontological treasures have been derived.
   There is reason for believing that the Trias of this district does
not exceed 200 to 300 feet in thickness.       At present it is known
to occur only in the coast ridge, 9 miles long and about 1 mile
broad, and on the northern slope of the Quarrywood ridge for a
distance of about 3 miles.      Outlying patches, like the Boar Rock
in Spey Bay, show that its superficial extent has been greatly reduced
by denudation and the deposit of drift upon it. Similar beds covering
only a very small area however, make their appearance on the
northern side of the Moray Firth, between Dunrobin and Golspie.

 glomerate, very similar to that which occurs in the Poikilitic of the
 west coast of Scotland, and of many parte of England.             This, by
 the gradual diminution in the size and number of the pebbles, passes
 occasionally up insensibly into a coarse grit, containing scattered
quartz pebbles, and, finally, into the very fine-grained white or yellow
sandstone which constitutes the bulk of the formation.
    In the whole of this deposit, organic remains are very sparsely dis
 tributed. The extensive sea-cliffs and shore-reefs of the coast ridge
 have not yielded a single specimen, nor have any fossils been found in
 similar situations in Sutherland. Many of the largely worked quarries
 have proved equally barren. Several quarries in immediate proximity
 to one another have, however, yielded footprints, and a single band
of soft rock in the Lossiemouth Quarries, situated at the depth of
about 100 feet from the top of the sandstone series, has yielded many
 remains of Stagonolepis, Hyperodapedon, and Telerpeton.          It is not
improbable that it is a bed on about the same horizon which has
yielded Telerpeton, Hyperodapedon, and Ceratodus at Spynie, and
 Stagonolepis and Dasygnathus at Findrassie.           The new quarry at
Cutties' Hillock, however, is certainly opened in beds lower in the
series, and, indeed, near its base.     The only form up to the present
found in this lower division which is common to it and the higher
strata is Hyperodapedon, but the lower beds have also yielded a
Dinosaur, a Dicynodont, and a new species of Lacertian. There are
good grounds for anticipating further important discoveries in this
part of the series, as large quantities of stone are now being taken
from the quarry in which it is exposed.
    The beds of the Reptiliferous Sandstone are often seen to be traversed
vertically by masses of a hard quartzite-like rock, which are known to
the quarrymen as " keys." Such masses are seen rising through the
sandstones in the sea-cliffs, and in many of the quarries, where, being
unfit for building purposes, they are either avoided in the quarrying
operations, or are broken up to serve as road-metal.          A key of this
kind is present   in the quarry   at Cutties' Hillock.  Microscopic  exami
nation of these quartzite-like masses shows them to consist of the
ordinary white or yellow sandstone, in which silica has been deposited
in the form of quartz upon and between the individual grains. As
in the case of the " crystallised sandstones," and many quartzites,
the secondary silica is in crystallographic continuity with the quartz
grains on which it is deposited ; this is clearly shown when thin
sections of the rock are examined by polarised light, the orientations
of the original and the secondary quartz, as exhibited by their optical
characters, being thereby rendered manifest.
    Overlying the Reptiliferous Sandstone is the very remarkable cal
careous and siliceous rock, known as the
                                               " Cherty rock of Stotfield,"
the peculiar characters of which have been already indicated.            At

present this member of the series is only seen as a number of isolated
patches, and we have no evidence as to whether it ever constituted a
continuous deposit.    Its thickness is never great, and probably in no
case exceeds  30 feet.

organic remains, even when studied under the microscope, is evidently
a chemical and not an organic deposit. Its appearance and characters,
indeed, strongly suggested that, like very similar deposits in Hun
gary, it may have been formed by geysers, an idea which was
entertained by Sir Charles Lyell.      If this be so, it is impossible to
avoid entertaining the suggestion that the formation of the keys may
have been due to the rise of heated water containing silica in solution
along the joint planes of sandstones below.     Some support is afforded
to  this suggestion by the fact that  where,  as at Stotfield, the Cherty
rock is largely developed, there the quartzite " keys " are particularly
numerous in the underlying sandstones.
    It may be of some interest to add that the Trias of the district of
Scania in Southern Sweden contains rocks quite undistinguishable in
their mineral characters from the Pebbly Conglomerate, the Repti-
liferous Sandstone, and the Cherty rock of the Trias of Eastern
Scotland.

       the Muscular Contractions which are evoked by Excitation
       of the Motor Tract." By V. A. Horsley, M.B., B.S.,

       London, and E. A. Schafer, F.R.S., Jodrell Professor of

    The following note gives the results of a large number of experi
ments which we have undertaken, in order to determine the character
of the muscular contractions which result from excitation of the several
parts of the motor tract, especially with reference to the rhythm
with which the skeletal muscles respond to such excitation.
    For the purpose of our experiments we may consider the motor
tract under four heads, viz. : — 1. Its commencement in the nerve-
cells of the cerebral cortex.     2. The connexion of these cells with
the lower nerve-centres by the nerve-fibres in the corona radiata.
3. Its continuation along the medulla oblongata and medulla spinalis
 (including the nerve-cells of those structures). 4. Its peripheral con
tinuation along the motor nerves.

1885.]      Experimental Researches in Cerebral Physiology.                   405
   Methods. — Our method        of proceeding      has  been to excite these
several parts in succession, and record the contractions of one of the
limb muscles upon a moving blackened surface, either by directly
•connecting the tendon with the lever of a myograph, or by Marey's
method of transmission by tambours and indiarubber tubing, the time
being simultaneously recorded upon the moving surface by a clock
marking seconds.        Usually the rate and duration of the excitation
were also recorded      by a small electromagnet.         Besides the contrac
tions resulting from electrical excitation, we have frequently obtained
an accidental record upon the moving surface of spontaneous or
voluntary contractions of the muscle the responses of which to elec
trical excitation of the cortex cerebri we were preparing to record,
and we have thus been able to compare these records of voluntary
contractions in animals both with the results of electrical excitation
of the several parts of the motor tract in the same animals, and with
records of voluntary contractions in the human subject.                We have
also studied in the same way the epileptoid contractions which are
often found to follow a period of electrical excitation of the cortex
cerebri in animals, and have compared these epileptoid contractions
with numerous others recorded by one of us from cases of true epi
lepsy and other affections of the nervous system         (in man and animals)
accompanied by rhythmic muscular movements.
   Results. — It was somewhat vaguely stated by Franck and Pitres,*
and   has generally been admitted by other authors, that so far as
regards the rhythm of muscular response, the result of exciting either
the cerebral cortex or any other part of the motor tract is precisely
the same as that which is well known to be the case with the excita
tion of the motor nerve, namely, that for all rates of excitation the
rhythm of muscular response is identical with the rhythm of excita
tion. Our experiments on the contrary show that this statement only
holds good for low rates of excitation up to about ten or twelve per
second, but that for all higher rates of excitation of the cortex
cerebri, corona radiata, or medulla spinalis the muscular response does
not vary with the rate of excitation, but maintains a constant rhythm
which is independent of the excitation rate and approximates to ten
per second.
    The muscle-curves which we have obtained from different mammals
as the result of successive excitation of the cortex cerebri, corona
radiata after removal of the superjacent cortex, and of the cervical
cord after section below the medulla oblongata, are very similar to one
another, and exhibit along their course, both at the commencement
and during the whole extent of contraction of the muscle, small but
distinct undulations following one another at the rate of about ten

 per second, with very considerable regularity, although in a few
 instances the rhythm may be a little slower or faster than these (eight
 to thirteen- per second are the extreme variations recorded). These
 undulations have the same rhythm and character whatever the rate
 of excitation (unless this be allowed. to fall below about ten per
 second).      Moreover, precisely similar nndulations are always visible-
 upon    the  myographic curve of all voluntary or spontaneous contrac
 tions (including reflex contractions) both in the lower animals and in
 man.
     It is further noted that in the record of the contractions of epilepsy
 there can frequently be seen marked upon the larger curves, produced
 by the relatively slow clonic spasms, smaller undulations succeeding
 one another with a rhythm of eight or ten per second.                 In some cases
the clonic contractions themselves may attain this rate, but they are
 then always simple and without any indications of smaller waves.
     In  a very few instances ont of a very large number of experiments
 there occurred npon the tracings obtained as the result of rapid exci
tation of the cortex cerebri, corona radiata, and medulla spinalis.
besides the usual well marked undulations of the rate of about ten per
second, other very minute waves upon these undulations correspond
ing in rhythm with the rate of excitation.                   These were the only
occasions in which we have obtained results at all similar to those
mentioned by Franck and Pitres.
    The accompanying           tracings will serve to indicate the general
nature of our results.           Tracings A, B, C, and D are all taken from
the same animal (dog). Tracing A shows the myographic curve
obtained during excitation of the cortex cerebri (sigmoid gyrus), as
well as the succeeding epilepsy.              Tracing B was that obtained on
excitation of the subjacent corona.             Tracing C resulted from excita
tion of the cut spinal cord.         Tracing D from excitation of the motor
nerve.      The excitation was produced by varying the current through
the primary coil of a sliding inductorium by a metallic reed vibrating
thirty times per second in the case of A, C, and D, and forty per
second in the case of B.            The vertical lines mark seconds.               E i-
the tracing of a voluntary muscular contraction in man (opponens
pollicis).
    Conclusions.   — The    main conclusions to be drawn from the results
of our experiments appear to be these : — 1. That the normal rate of
discharge of nervous impulses from the motor nerve-cells of the
spinal cord along the motor nerve-fibres is approximately ten per
second.*        2. That in the case of nervous impulses reaching these
   •  This conclusion is supported by the fact that the rhythm of a clonus (.e.g., ankle-
clonus) depending upon the activity of the spinal cord is also about 8 or 10 per
second, and that the rhythm of strychnine-tetanus in the frog, as indicated by the
electrical variations of the muscle-current, has about the same rate (Lovcn).

 impulses is generated in the cells of the cerebral cortex, or in the cells
 of the lower nerve-centres.        4. That the slower rhythm which is often
 exhibited in epileptoid contractions is the result of a further summa

                                 (Abstract.)
    The paper contains an account of a number of measurements of
 the well-known " dark rings
                                  " of
                                       quartz. Each ring is due to one
 wave being retarded in the quartz behind the other by an integral
 number of wave-lengths, so the measurements give the directions
 through the plate of quartz corresponding         to a series of known
 retardations.   The relative retardation is, especially in a crystal of
 weak double-refracting power like quartz, mainly dependent on the
 distance between the two sheets of the wave surface.           Thus my
 observations   really give the separation between the two sheets at
 various points, and it is in this separation that the peculiarities of
 quartz are most strongly marked, and the various expressions put,
 forward by theory most widely divergent.
    With a plate cut at right angles to the axis, I obtained values of
 the separation from 0=4° to 0=39° — 0 being the angle between the
 ordinaiy wave normal and the axis — and with a plate cut parallel to
 the axis I obtained values from 0=53° to 0=90".

is the influence of the refraction effects.           This is discussed at some
length in the paper, and is shown to be in all probability negligible.
    The measurements were taken with a spectrometer fitted up as a
polariscope, whose great focal length and finely graduated circle were
of much service.
    I found it convenient to treat separately the region near the axis,
where the      abnormal    form of the wave surface of quartz is most
obvious.     I have compared my results with nine different theories,
each of which gives an expression of one of the two following forms.
                            Ds=Pi»sint0 + Do3.
                            D2  = Pj9 sin4 0 + D02 cost 0.
    Here D is " the number of wave-lengths by which one wave lags
behind the other in air, after the light has traversed normally a
plate of quartz one millimetre thick, the normal to whose faces makes
an angle 0 with the optic axis." D0 is the value of D when 0=0,
and is known from the rotatory power, and Pl and P2 are constants to>
which the theories assign different values. By inserting the observed
values of D and 0, I obtained values of Pl and P3 from each ring.
The results from one plate about 20 mm. thick were as follows : —
0            4° 24'    5° 514/    6° 51$'    T  40$'    8° 234/   9° 38'   11° 41'

    Similar results were obtained from a second plate about 27 mm.

   From these figures concluded that the second expression was the
correct one, and that P2=15-30 + -01.              There is a considerable dis
crepancy    in  the  case   of  the  first  ring, of which two possible ex
planations are given in the paper.

Thus Sarrau alone succeeds in explaining the observations satisfac
torily.
    For the larger values of 0, I calculated on Sarrau's theory what
valne of a — b was required to give the retardation observed in each
ring, and obtained as follows : —
  <p           15° 14'     18° 21'     23°  16i'    28° 7i'   32° 7'     35° 31'    38° 36'

    The observations on the plate cut parallel               to the axis gave —
  <p           53° 58'    57° 11'       64° 45'    72° 13'    79° 53'    83° 40'     H5° 37'

    In this last set the retardation amounted to about                300 wave-lengths,
so   that the bands corresponding to the two D lines were consider
ably separated, and the bands seen were consequently ill defined.
Fortunately, however, a large angular error only produced a small
change in a — b, so that these results arc far more accurate than those
of the other two sets.          For <p>o0° the rotatory term is negligible, and
 Sarrau's theory is reduced to the simple Huyghenian construction.
 So our observations show that for 0 > 50° the Huyghenian construc
 tion represents the wave surface in quartz with great accuracy.
     From 0=15° to 0=50° there is a slight but persistent increase of
 a— b with 0. It is shown in the paper that this maybe satisfactorily
accounted for by using the more general form of Sarrau's wave
 surface, viz., (s3 — a-) (s3 — a3 cos3 0 — Ir sin- 0).

     Here  s  is the wave velocity and <i, h, g2, fv               gl are constants, g2
 depending on the rotatory power.                    Up to this    point we have been
 supposing /, and gx are negligible. If now we                     make S^a2g.2(gl—f1)
 = -00033(a3— fc2)3\3, we find that Sarrau's theory                agrees with observa
 tion throughout within the limits of experimental error, even in the
 case of the first ring.

    It is composed mainly of two sheets of basalt with remains of a
 third sheet, on some eminences and along the shore of Loch Laigh.
 These are almost horizontal, with a slight dip east, up Loch Scridain,
 and a considerable dip in the same direction up Loch Laigh.          The
 upper sheet is not less than 40 to 50 feet think, crystallised into rude
 massive columns, now much         fissured and weathered, whilst the
lowest presents a thickness of 60 feet, visible above low water, the
 upper two-thirds being amorphous, and the rest fashioned into slender
and most perfect columns, bent in every direction, like those of the
Clam-shell cave at Staffa.      The beds are so exceedingly horizontal
towards the seaward direction, that no one can doubt the columnar
 basalts of Staffa and the Treshnish Isles, Geometra and the mainland
of Mull, being on the same horizon, if not parts of the same sheet.
Between the two great lava beds at Ardtun is intercalated a bed of
sedimentary deposit, reaching a maximum of 60 feet thick, and con
sisting of pale very fine-grained clay and limestone at the base, theu
sand and gravel, black laminated shales, whinstone, gravel, and
laminated sands.     The gravels are made up of flint, pebbles, and
subangular rolled fragments of older lava beds, in a matrix of broken-
down volcanic material.        They present all the ordinary lines of
current bedding, beautifully weathered out, and the pebbles are
drifted precisely as in ordinary river gravels.
    There can be no question whatever, indeed, but that the gravels are
the deposits of the waterway of a river, and the shales, its overflows
and backwaters.     The river must have been of some magnitude, as
its deposits traverse the whole seaward face of the headland, and their
extension inland seems to be marked by the occurrence of two beds of
coal, which have, to a small extent, been worked, one near Bunessan
and the other nearer Ardtun village.         An intrusive sheet of fine
compact basalt rises on one side of the head, cutting a devious way

  1885.]       Age  of  the Tertiary Basalts of     the Atlantic.        413
 through each bed in turn, and dipping beneath the sea at the other
 extremity.    On the coast, near the centre of the head, occurs a small
 chine, apparently due to the weathering out of a vertical dyke, which
 has cut through the gravels and shales, and left them in a very
 accessible position ; it was here, accordingly, that T resolved to excavate
 them.                                            .
    With the assistance of the Duke of Argyll's energetic factor, Mr.
 Sinclair, men and tools and a barrel of powder were forthcoming,
 and after a few days' work and the removal of a mass of the intensely
 indurated shingle bed, to the extent of perhaps hundreds of tons, many
 square yards of the whinstone and the underlying black shales were
 exposed. The large specimens of Platanites aceroides and Onoclea
 hebridica, now exhibited, were the results.     The new specimens of the
 latter, including fertile as well as barren fronds, give a very different
 idea of its growth to what would have been imagined from those
 formerly known, and we see that the pinnte were produced on very
 long and stout naked stems. The ravine, however, proved an unfor
 tunate selection, for the whinstone became poorer in fossils as we got
 farther in, and the underlying black shales, though crowded with
 leaves, proved so squeezed and full of slickensides or faulted surfaces,
 and, consequently, so brittle as to be practically valueless for collect
 ing purposes. The lighter limestone is wholly absent at this spot.
 From the condition of the shales and calcined appearance of the
 gravels — here of a steely-grey colour, intensely hard, with pure white
 and occasionally cherry-coloured flints, it is evident that the ravine
 must be the site of an old dyke, and if proof were wanting of a violent
 upthrust at this spot, it is to be found in the upturned edges of the
 bottom bed on the west face.       The succession of beds in the section
 we had been so laboriously working at in the ravine, in no way pre
 pared me for the discovery    I made subsequently, that within 100 yards
there existed, many feet below the lowest sedimentary bed present in
the ravine, a deposit of limestone, rivalling in fineness and texture
the celebrated lithographic stone of Solenhofen, and containing, as
expressed by Professor Newberry, "most exquisitely preserved leaves."
On removing some tnrf, in order to obtain a true section, I was over
joyed to find this deposit, so completely different in character to any
previously seen in the basalts. It may seem strange that it should
have been overlooked by the many geologists who have visited the
spot ; but the beds are in a very inaccessible position, and to work
them    dangerous, until sufficient had been worked away to afford
standing room. Quarrymen could not be induced to work there at
all, but two boatmen did not make any objection.
   It is too early to attempt as yet to give any account of the new
flora, which seems to differ considerably from that of the shales above.
Very large leaves of many kinds occur in the clay at the base, which

was so friable, however, that only fragments could be secured.      The
leaves in the limestone are smaller and very sparsely scattered through
it ; there are, moreover, no cleavage planes, and hence much patience
is required to obtain and develop them.         I
                                           have obtained about twenty
species of dicotyledon from    the   it,
                                   most prevalent being Qrewia crenata,
Hr., and Corylus MacQuarrii, Forbes, and Acer arctictim, Hr., all of
which are also found in beds of the same age in Greenland.           There
are no ferns and only three conifers,     large variety of Guilago adiau-
                                           a
toides, Unger, a   new Podocarpns, the most northerly species       believeI
yet  found,  and Torus  Campbelli.   The fragments    from  the clays show
about eight additional species, and altogether     should judge that both
                                                     I
floras were very rich. All the conifers occur also in the shales, and a
specimen of Guilago has long been in the collection at Inverary.        The
most characteristic plants of the shales are those described by the
Duke of Argyll and Edward Forbes, Platanites aceroides and Rham-
nitcs multinervis.    Taxites Campbelli       not, as affirmed by Heer,

identical   with Sequoia Langsdorfii,  but  appears to be a true Taxw.
Some other leaves are certainly referable to Protophijllum, and we have
representatives apparently of leaves determined as Alnm, Cornus,
Derchenia, Populus, and Corylus — but among them there are none, so
far as can ascertain, that have ever been found in European beds of
      I
Miocene age.     This  is  point, however, upon which
                            a                              do not wish to
                                                                  I
insist at present, farther than to say, that the flora seems to bear a
prima facie resemblance to cretaceous floras of America rather than to
any yet known from Europe. The resemblance of the Conifer® to
those indigenous to China at the present day,        too remarkable to be
                                                          is
overlooked.
   It has become evident that the fluviatile rocks of the British
basalts are of far greater extent and importance than had hitherto
been imagined.     Before the complete account of them, which hope              I
later on to prepare, can be proceeded with, their position in the series
has to be fixed, their lateral extension to be mapped.
   The first of these points    fortunately not difficult to settle.
                                     is                                The
base of the basalts    isexposed at Burg Head on the opposite side of
Loch Scridain, resting upon Jurassic rocks and fragmentary masses of
chalk. The base of the series seems formed of two immense sheets
of ash, the lowest of which      full of scoriae, and about 100 feet above
                                     is
these, resting upon columnar basalt, in every respect similar to that
of Ardtun Head, are fluviatile beds, sands and clays from        to 12 feet9
thick. Overlying     these   a bed
                                is of rudely   columnar basalt, and taking
account of all the circumstances, there cannot be much doubt about
the fluviatile series on both sides of the loch being upon the same
horizon. The beds are, in fact, seen to be horizontal to the west as
far as the eye can reach. The horizon of the Ardtun gravels would,
therefore, seem to be about 150 feet from the base of the series.

  1885.]                 On Trichophyton tonsurans.                      415
 Taking into account the superior thickness of the basalts in Mull, and
 above all the presence of ash beds at their base, it seems probable that
 they were nearer the vents than Antrim, and that their lowest beds
-are at least not newer, so that the Mull leaf-beds at 150 feet from
 the base should be much older than the Glenarm and Ballypaladv
 leaf-beds at 600 feet from the base.
     The horizontal extent of the fluviatile beds of Mull is more difficu'f
 to estimate,     Gravel is mentioned as present at Loch Truadh, to the
north-west, and at Carsaig to the east. In the latter locality it is,
 perhaps, thicker and more extensive than at Ardtun.          The horizon
should also be found in two of the Treshnish isles and round the
 north-west coast of Mull, and there can be little doubt but that
 deposits of plants exist in many localities besides Ardtun.          Black
 shales, with identical leaves, have been found in Canna, and leaflets
•of Taxm or a similar foliaged conifer at Uig.
     Though the fluviatile beds at Bourg are unfossiliferous, a very
interesting relic of the Eocene vegetation occurs there, for a large
tree, with a trunk 5 feet in diameter, has been enveloped as it stood
 to a height of 40 feet, by one of the underlying lava beds.    Its solidity
and girth enabled it to resist the fire, but it subsequently decayed,
leaving a hollow cylinder filled in with debris and lined apparently
 with the charred wood. There is also the limb of a larger tree in a
 fissure not far off.     The wood proves to be coniferoas, belonging
 possibly to the Podocarpus whose leaves are so conspicuous in the
 beds above.

        (" Proc. Roy. Soc," vol. 33, p. 234.) By George Thin, M.D.
        Communicated by Prof. M. Foster, Sec. R.S.               Received
        December 3, 1885.
     In the " Proc. Roy. Soc," vol. 33, p. 234,  1881, a paper   of mine is
published on
                 " Trichophyton tonsurans."
    Since the time that the investigations recorded in that paper were
made, the study of parasitic fungi has been greatly facilitated by the
introduction    by Dr. Koch of gelatinised meat juice as a medium for
cultivation,   and having again studied the development of tricho
phyton with     the advantages derived from the use of this medium, 1
believe that    two results which    I have obtained   might   be  usefully
published as a supplement to the paper referred to.
    The gelatinised meat juice which        I used was peptonized and
neutralised, and trichophyton grew on it readily and with certainty.
    In my previous experimeats (in which      I used vitreous humour) J
had succeeded     in  growing  the fungus when the hairs containing thj

41()                 A  New Form        of Spectroscope.            [Dec 17,
spores were floated on the surface of the fluid, but          I had not suc
ceeded in finding evidence of growth when the hairs were submerged.
This result must have been due to some accidental cause which
escaped undetected, as   I have found that trichophyton grows when the
hait's are entirely submerged in the gelatinised beef juice, and the
spores are excluded from contact with the air.
    In my previous paper      I described a number of experiments which
appeared to show conclusively that trichophyton is not related to the
ordinary fungi {Penicillium, Mucor, &c.) with which it had been up to
that time confounded.         The experiments with gelatinised meat juice
confirm that view.                                        I
                       In many instances in which cultivated tricho
phyton    on this medium    I never once observed organs of fructification
or appearances that suggested that it could be identified with common
fungi. , As regards Penicillium glaucum with which, from the abund
ance of its spores in the atmosphere of laboratories, cultivations are
most likely to be, and are most often fouled, the difference can be
shown by a very simple experiment.
    A layer of the gelatinised meat juice is poured over a pure slide
and allowed to cool under proper precautions.           Ringworm hairs and
                          "        "  in parallel lines on the surface of the
penicillium spores are       sown
medium, and the slide is put in a moist chamber at ordinary tempera
tures.    If the slide is examined in from twenty-four to forty-eight
hours the penicillium will be found to be growing with great rapidity,
whilst the mycelium of trichophyton has made in comparison very
little growth. Repeated crops of penicillium may be grown up to the
stage in which the characteristic         organs of fructification are fully
developed, whilst during the same time the trichophyton mycelinm
grows steadily and slowly, with no distinct signs of spore formation
and no trace of organs of fructification.
    I may add that, in a recent letter to me, Br. Koch states his convic
tion that trichophyton is a distinct and independent kind of fungus.

                  F.R.S.    Received     December     5, 1885.
    Some two or three years ago, when the sun-spot work carried on
at Kensington revealed the different behaviour in different spots of
 lines visible in the spectra of the same element, it seemed desirable
 to extend similar observations to metallic prominences, and, if
 possible, in such a way that comparisons over a considerable reach of
spectrum should be possible.
    It then struck me that a grating cut in half, with one part movable,
would afford a ready means of doing this.

   Circumstances prevented the realisation of this scheme till quite
recently, when I put into Mr. Hilger's hands a grating presented to
me by Mr. Rutherfurd.
   The result is excellent.  It is possible to observe C and F, for
instance, together quite conveniently, with either a normal or a tan
gential slit. The only precautions necessary are to see that half of
the light passing through the object-glass falls on the half grating,
and that the rays which come to a focus on the slit plate are those
the wave-lengths of which are half way between the wave-lengths of
the two lines compared.

   When a drop of ink falls into water from not too great a height, it
descends through the water as a ring, in which there is evidently
considerable rotation about the circular axis passing through the
centres of its cross sections ; as the ring travels down through the
water inequalities make their appearance : more ink seems to collect
in some parts of it than in others, and as these parts of the ring
descend more rapidly than the rest, it assumes some such appearance
as that shown in fig. 1. These aggregations as they descend develope
                                   Fio.   1.
fresh rings in the same way as the original ring was developed from
the drop.    The ring is thus split up into several rings, each of which
is connected with its neighbours by threads of ink affording a very
pretty illustration of the continuity of motion in a liquid (see fig. 2).
       As the secondary rings descend they develope other rings just as
    they were developed from the original one, and the process of repro
    duction seems to go on indefinitely.
       It is not every liquid, however, which, when dropped into water,
    gives rise to rings, for if we drop into water any liquid which docs
    not mix with  it, such as chloroform, the drop in consequence of th

418          Prof. J. J. Thomson and Mr. H. F. Newall.           [Dec. 17,
surface tension remains spherical as it descends. In fact, we may sa y
 that, with some few exceptions to be noticed later, rings are formed
only when a liquid    is dropped into one with which it can mix.      This
is important,   because surface tension has been supposed to play an
important part in the formation of these rings; it is difficult, how
ever, to see how any appreciable surface tension can exist between
liquids that can mix, and as far as our experiments go they tend to
show that it is only the absence of surface tension which is necessary
for their production. . There are, as we shall show later, many cases
 where rings are formed under circumstances in which there is no-
possibility of capillary action, such as when the liquid into which the
drop falls is the same as the drop itself. As capillarity was found not
to be involved in the production of the rings, it seemed interesting to
investigate the subject further, and the following investigation was
undertaken with this object.      As the result of our experiments we
have been led to a theory of the production of these rings of which
we shall now give a brief sketch in order to render the sequence of
our experiments more intelligible.
   Let us suppose that a spherical drop falls into a liquid ; the motion
of the liquid surrounding the drop will at first be much the same as
if a solid sphere of the same size were to fall into the liquid. Now,
when a sphere moves through a liquid the tangential velocity of the
liquid is different from the tangential velocity of the sphere, so that
the liquid flows past the sphere.   If the sphere be fluid as well as the
medium in which it moves, there will not be an absolute discontinuity
in the motion, but only a very rapid change, so that there is a finite
alteration in an exceedingly small distance.     This alteration is equiva
lent to a vortex film covering the sphere, the lines of vortex motion
being horizontal circles, and if the liquid be viscous the vorticity in
the film will diffuse inwards and outwards.          As the drop falls the
resistance makes it get flatter and flatter until it becomes disk-shaped ;
by this time, however, it is full of vortex motion, and as the disk-
shape is an unstable arrangement of vorticity, the disk must break up
into the stable arrangement — that of an anchor ring.            This is a

 1885.]       On the Formation      of   Vortex Rings by Drops.             419
rough outline of the theory we adopt.            It will be seen that the most
important property     of   the   liquid   concerned      is its viscosity — the
viscosity must he such that when the drop has become disk-shaped
there should be enough vortex motion in it to cause it to break up ; if
the viscosity is too small the vortex motion in it will not have had time
to spread far by the time the drop has become disk-shaped, and so the
drop will continue to flatten and get into thin sheets with streaks of
vortex motion in it instead of breaking up into a ring, whilst if the
viscosity is too great the vortex motion will be dissipated before the
drop becomes disk-shaped.
   We shall now give the experiments which led us to form the
conclusions.    We began by investigating the change in the shape of
the drop before it became disk-shaped.
               Shape of the Drop before it becomes a Ring.
   To study the change of shape of the drop            as   it falls through the
liquid we have had recourse to instantaneous            illumination, and have
used for this the bright spark formed at breaking in a mercury cup a
circuit containing an electromagnet. It was necessary that we should
be able to illuminate the drop at any point of its fall, and it was
obviously convenient to make the actual fall of each drop start a set
of processes which should       result in the spark.          The figure shows
diagrammatically the arrangement we           have  used.

held down, and so the electromagnet circuit                made by the dipping
                                                                    is
of the platinum tip into the mercury cup.               The spring and counter
poise of the relay and the mercury cup have been '-set" so as to
tjive the spark at break at about the moment required.                 When the
drop detaches itself from the tube the equilibrium of the balance                     is
npset, the counterpoise sinks, and so breaks the relay circuit, which
consequently breaks the electromagnet circuit at the mercury surface,
tind the spark so produced illuminates the drop at some point in its
descent.    This point may be varied by altering the "setting" of the
relay  and  mercury cup.
   Various liquids were used for dropping fluorescein dissolved in
                                                                :
weak ammonia gave very good results for two or three drops when
dropped into water, but          soon diffused through the column of water,
                                  it
and the drops were then no longer clear, as the efficient rays had been
absorbed at the surface of the column.             Milk gave excellent results        ;
 but even when considerably diluted               disagreeable to work with on
                                                     it   is
account of the greasiness that accumulates in the dropping tube, and
of the cloudiness produced in the column.             A weak solution of nitrate
of silver dropped into a column of weak sodic chloride solution was
 found to do best, as very good rings are formed, and the precipitate
 may be discharged by the addition of a few drops of ammonia.                The
 results figured below are those obtained in this way.

1885.]       On the Formation   of Vortex Rings  by Drops.           421
   We have observed a great number of drops at many different points
of their fall through the column into which they have been dropped,
and at any given instant have found that a few definite forms repeat
themselves.     Thus we are led to believe that the conditipns of fall.
though seemingly not altered, vary in a few deBnite ways, so that
successive drops do not always pass through the same series of phases.
Indeed, simple observation in continuous light shows clearly differences
in the perfection of formation of the rings under apparently similar
conditions. We have found a set of forms for a particular instant.
and from the various sets taken for successive instants, separated by
small intervals, we have picked out series of forms which strike us as
continuously derivable from one another.

   It will be seen at a glance from the figures that the variations are only
in the unimportant parts, whilst the essential parts are recognisably
the same.     At the early stages the drop is more or less spherical ;
but as it descends, it gets flatter and flatter, as we might expect
since its motion is resisted, and at one of the stages becomes almost
disk-shaped, and passes        very quickly from this into the ring
shape.
   This change of shape, we imagine, is due to the presence of th-
vortex motion, the distribution of rotation in the ring being a stabl-
arrangement of vortex motion, whilst that in the disk is not.           The
vortex motion in the drop has travelled from the boundary, diffusing
according to the same laws as those which govern the conduction of
heat, the quantity corresponding to the diffusivity in the conduction of
heat being in this case fi/p, where fi is the coefficient of viscosity and
p the density of the liquid.     If p/p be very small, the vortex motion
will not travel far into the drop, whilst if it be large it will all hav-
diffused before the ring has become disc-shaped.        In neither of these
cases should we expect the disk to change into a ring, and it will be
seen later on that as a matter of fact it does not.
                Effect of Dropping   one Liquid into another.
   A  drop does not always make a ring when it falls into a vessel con
taining liquid. We have tried the effect of letting a drop of on-
liquid fall into a vessel containing another liquid for a good many
substances.     The results are given in the following table : —

   It will be seen from the tables that a drop of one liquid only makes
a ring when let fall into another liquid, when the two liquids can mix,
and, therefore, when the surface tension is very small.
   The following experiment shows that an exceedingly small amount
of surface tension is sufficient to prevent the formation of the rings.
Absolute alcohol dropped into benzene gives rings ; water gives
globules : to about 10 c.c. of absolute alcohol water was added drop
by drop, the mixture was stirred, and a drop was let fall into ben
zene.   Until after the third drop of water had been added, little
change in the appearance was noticed ; a ring was formed, and this
subdivided into secondary rings, and so on. After the fourth drop
was added, very small globules began to appear after a good manv
subdivisions. After the fifth drop was added, the ring first formed
subdivided not into rings but into flattened globules.    After the sixth
or seventh drop was added, the appearance of the primary ring
changed ; there seemed to be a more definite surface to it ; in fact a
small surface tension had sprung up. The globules formed on subdi
vision of the ring were quite disconnected from one another, whereas
before there had been trails or festoons followiug each.         After the
seventh or eighth drop of water was added, the formation of the
primary ring seemed uncertain ; the flattened globule, if large, broke
up irregularly into smaller globules without the intervention of the
ring shape. This experiment shows that if a liquid A forms spheres
when let fall into another B, then A may be diluted with mora
than 1000 times its volume of some liquid, which has no surface ten
sion with B, before it loses the property of making spheres.
   The most striking proof, however, that the formation of the rings
does not depend on surface tension, is the fact that the riDgs are
formed when the liquid of which the drop is made is the same in all
respects as that into which it falls.    If we take a vessel full of water,
and raise from it by means of glass tubing enough water to make a
drop, then, when this drop falls back again into the vessel from the
proper height, it forms a ring. After a little practice, it is easy to
distinguish the ring from the rest of the liquid, and this may be done
still more easily if we mix some insoluble powder with the water.
                       Experiments with one Liquid.
   We found on trying different liquids that they behaved very
differently when treated in the way we have just described.        In some
of them a distinct ring was formed by the drop, whilst in others the

424         Prof.  J. J. Thomson and Mr. H.        F. Newall.     [Dec. 17,
drop after falling into the liquid   seemed to spread through it without
assuming    any definite shape.      We found when we used various
liquids  that if the drops  were let  fall under similar circumstances, the
results depended only on the value of fi/p (the kinematic coefficient of
viscosity for the liquid).   This is shown in the following table, where
the behaviour of the drop and the value of fx.jp are given for several
liquids, which we have divided into classes.       The viscosity coefficient
fi has been determined    by Poiseuille's transpiration method; that is,
from the time in which a constant quantity of liquid flows under
constant pressure through a fine capillary tube.      To test the character
of the rings formed in the case of any particular liquid, drops of it are
let fall into a column of it from three different heights : 1st, such
that the drop just touches the surface of the liquid column at the
moment it detaches itself from the tube ; this height of fall is
denoted in the table by " fall = 0" ; 2nd, such that the tube is held
-A inch above the surface of the column ; 3rd, such that the tube is
held ^ inch above the surface.        In describing the character of the
rings we have used terms which it will be well to define. " Splash "
denotes the irregular spread of the drop through the liquid column ;
it takes place with whirls and eddies irregularly, and is difficult to
represent, but the figure (5) would probably recall the appearance to

 one who had seen the reality.     " Uncertain " expresses that a ring or
 a splash is formed, one as often as the other.
                                                       " Blob " denotes the
 appearance of a drop that does not break and spread through the
 column, but remains within its boundary ; the figure (6) represents

 but that it is a question whether it ever leaves the state of a blob.

     These experiments indicate that the nature of the motion, after the
 drop has fallen into the liquid, depends upon the value of fi.jp. Now
ft/p is a quantity of the dimensions of the product of a length and a
velocity, so that nothing can depend upon the absolute value of this
quantity, but only on the ratio of it to the product of some length
and velocity in the system.                   The most obvious length in the
system with which fi/p can be connected is the size of the drop or
ring. If this is so, diminishing the size of the drop when fijp is kept
constant ought to produce the same effect as increasing fi/p when the
size of the drop is kept constant.                  Now if we take a liquid from
Class I, the effect of increasing fijp sufficiently would be to make it
behave like one in Class II, that is, give very much better rings, so
that for a liquid of this kind we should expect that small drops would
make better rings than large ones.                 To test this, we repeated the ex
periments      with    the liquids     of Class  I, using much smaller drops than
we used before, and we found that now they made rings much more
readily and certainly, in fact, with this sized drop, they deserved to
be put into Class II.               If we try the same thing with liquids in
Class III, we find that the rings are worse with small drops than
with large.        On the other hand, increasing the size of the drop when
fi/p is kept constant, should have the same effect as diminishing fijp
when the size of the drop remains constant, so that if we repeat the
experiments with liquids from Class IV, using larger drops than
before, we should expect to get better rings. Experiment showed
this to be the case. Large drops were obtained by dipping a piece of
glass tubing into the liquid (e.g., strong sulphuric acid), and then
raising the tube after closing the top with the finger ; on removing
the finger, a considerable quantity of liquid flows through the tube,
making a large ring. The velocity with which fijp would be most

 naturally connected is the velocity of the drop ; it is not possible,
however, to alter this very much without introducing great dis
 turbance into the liquid.
    These results admit of very easy explanation, if our theory of the
formation of the rings is correct.       According to this, the reason that
the liquids in Class    I do not make rings, is because the vortex motion
 has not penetrated sufficiently into the drop to make it break up,
 when it becomes disk-shaped.           If, however, the drops be made
 smaller, the vortex motion has a better chance of filling it before it
 becomes disk-shaped, and so causing it to break up into a ring.
When fijp is very large, as is the case for liquids of Class IV, the
 vortex motion is dissipated so quickly, that though the drop may
have been filled with vortex motion, this has all diffused away before
the drop reaches the disk-stage.        If we make the drop larger, it will
 take longer to get full of vortex motion, and there may be enough left
 in, by the time it gets disk-shaped, to cause it to break up into a ring.
 There is another way in which the formation of rings by liquids of
 Class IV may be promoted : suppose that, instead of letting a drop
fall into a column of the same liquid, we let it fall into another
liquid for which fijp is smaller; then since this liquid is a worse
conductor of vortex motion than the drop, the vortex motion will not
diffuse so readily into the surrounding liquid.           Thus we should
expect the drop to form a ring more readily than before ; and we
have found this to be the case.           Thus, for example, drops of sul
phuric acid    I from Class IV, let fall into either sulphuric acid   II  of
 Class  III or sulphuric acid     III  of Class II, give rings. Similarly
with solutions of sugar, of caustic potash, and of glycerine.
    These  effects are sometimes masked        by the effects produced by
difference of density ; for if   the drop is much heavier than the liquid
into which it falls, it will     fall faster, and this will promote the
formation of the ring. If we guard against this source of error, we
may see that if a drop does not make rings when it falls into a column
of the same liquid, it will not make rings when it falls into a column
of another liquid of the same density, but for which fijp is greater ;
but it may make rings if fijp be less than for the drop.
                       On the Splitting up of the Rings.
    When a ring has travelled some little distance through the liquid,
its outline generally becomes irregular, and after a time takes the
corrugated appearance shown in fig. 1.           The corrugations become
more and more marked as the ring falls, nntil the appearance is that
represented in fig. 8, 7 : the drops at the bottom of the bends develop
rings in the same way as the ring itself was originally developed.
This process of subdivision is repeated several times, until the ring
 assumes the appearance shown in fig. 7.

    The separate rings always reniain connected with each other by
threads of liquid ; this shows that there is no surface tension ; for if
there were, these threads would break up into drops.            The only
stage at which the motion is discontinuous is when the drops are
changed into rings.      The change from the ring shape to stage 2
(fig. 1) occurs quite gradually, and there is nothing analogous to the
separation -which takes place when a cylinder of liquid splits up into
drops.    We have made a great many experiments on the subject, and
have arrived at the conclusion that two conditions are necessary for
the splitting up of the rings.
    1. The liquid forming the ring must be of density different from
that of the liquid into which it falls.
    2. There must be motion in the liquid into which the drop falls.
    We suppose that the splitting up takes place in the following way.
In consequence of the motion in the column of liquid the ring gets a
little uneven, more of the liquid collecting in one part of the rinp
than another.     Now, if there is plenty of vortex motion in the ring,
this irregularity will not be permanent, as the anchor ring with
uniform cross section is the stable form for the motion, so that unless
the disturbing force is too great, the ring will oscillate about the
anchor-ring shape, and the irregularity will not increase. If, however,
the vortex motion in the ring be small, it may not be able to balance
the disturbing forces and the irregularities will increase.      The dis
turbance is due to the resistance of the liquid in the column, the
places where the liquid in the ring has collected falling faster than the
remaining portions of the ring ; the ring consequently takes in time
some such appearance as that shown in fig. 8 (7 and B).      The thicker
portions will behave now as the drop did when it fell into the column,
and they will develop rings in just the same way.

                                 Fig. 8.
   The observations on which we base these conclusions are the
following : —
   We have never seen a ring break up when the liquid forming the
ring was the same in all respects as that surrounding it.      If the
temperature of the drop be different from that of the column, or if so
much powder has been added to the drop as to make the difference of
the density appreciable, there is breaking up.
   The number and size of rings into which the original ring breaks,
and their manner of distribution round its circumference, are quite
irregular.

430         Prof. J. J. Thomson and Mr. H. F. Newall.          [Dec. 17,
   When the liquid into which the drop falls has been allowed to rest
for some hours, a ring will go much further and will last much
longer without splitting up, than when it follows on a succession of
rings. Some rings of very dilute permanganate have thus been ob
served to last for as long as ten minutes.
   When there is little difference in the density of the drop and the
liquid into which it falls, the ring does not break up until there is no
vortex motion in it.
   When, however, the difference in density is large, the ring may
break up while it is still rotating.
   If a tube be drawn out into a fine capillary and be filled with sul
phuric acid, and held so that its capillary end is just beneath the
surface of a column of water, a fine stream of acid flows down ; and
on it marked headings appear.      Each bead gives rise to a vortex ring,
and the rings so formed behave in characteristic       manner (fig. 9.)
                                   Fio. 9.
Here there seems strong evidence of a tension between the acid and
the water, but the appearances are to be explained by differences of
velocity in the stream, brought about by motion in the column of

  1885.]        On the Formation    of   Vortex Rings by Drops.           431
  water, or by vibrations communicated to the capillary tube.          If the
 experiment be made with all care to avoid vibration, the stream falls
 unbrokeD through a column of 8 inches of water: whilst if a tap
 be given to the acid tube a break occurs in the stream, in consequence
 of a momentary stop in the flow of acid, a small bead is formed, and
 from it a ring. If no care is taken to avoid vibration the beads will
  follow one another very rapidly. It may be objected that if there
 existed a surface tension, it would only be when disturbances were
  communicated that headings would appear.            But in such a case, the
 resolution into drops would be complete, and small spherules would
 be formed      between   the larger drops.       In fact, however, the con
 nexions between the headings        are fine filaments of acid, so that the
 headings are never really separated from one another.              We have,
 moreover, convinced      ourselves of the correctness of this explanation,
 by allowing a stream of cold water with lycopodium powder to flow
 from a fine tnbe into a column of slightly warm water ; similar cessa
 tions in flow and formations of headings may be observed ; the rings
 are not well formed, but this is to be expected, for the conditions are
 not nearly   so favourable.
       Experiments    with  two Liquids  between which there is Tension.
    When there is a very small tension between the liquid of the drop
 and that in the column, some very interesting results are obtained .
 In a few cases a ring is formed for a moment, but is almost imme
 diately broken up into drops and spherules.            As instances of such
 cases we may mention strong caustic potash solution dropped into
 paraffin oil : strong sulphuric dropped into turpentine or into paraffin
oil : a certain mixture of turpentine and alcohol dropped into paraffin
 oil : a mixture of alcohol and chloroform dropped into water : and
the mixture of alcohol and a few drops of water dropped into benzene
 (see above, p. 423).      In most cases the drop falls through the liquid
shaped like a disk, and in the first part of its course changes its shape
very considerably.      These changes may be well observed in the case
of a drop of sodium sulphate solution falling through paraffin oil;
they are shown in fig. 10.
    At first the drop is nearly spherical («) ; then it becomes flattened
(ft) ; next it becomes quite flat underneath or sometimes even hollow
(7), the top remaining curved. During all this time the velocity of
the drop has been changing. The top now gets flatter and flatter
(<\ e' t)i while it begins to bulge out at the bottom till the drop is
saucer-shaped (ij, 0), hollow at the top, and rounded at the bottom, and
we perceive that it is followed close on by a vortex ring in the liquid of
the column.      It now moves with constant velocity through the liquid
as though   it  met  with no resistance, differing in this respect from the
case where the drop falls as a ring, when its velocity — unless th

difference of density is very great — continually diminishes.       We see
the reason for this to be that the vortex at the back of the disk since
it tends to make the liquid move along its stream lines, will increas-
the pressure in the rear and thus diminish the resistance.        In fact we
see that what the vortex does is to make the conditions very much
the same as if the saucer-shaped drop were moving in a stream
flowing with the same velocity.     The existence of the following vortex
is shown in a very beautiful    manner  in the next stages represented at
< and K in the figure : the edges of the saucer-shaped         disk become
thinned   out to such an extent  by the action of the radial streams   above
and below, that they are drawn out into fine filaments which imme
diately break up into small spherules, and these are carried round in
the vortex behind the drop.
    These latter stages are best shown in the case of a certain solution
 of oleate of soda let fall into a special sample of paraffin referred to
above (p. 426), and the changes are represented in fig. 11.
   If only a small drop of oleate is let fall, the steady state is reached
before the spherules are detached, and the drop falls in the shape

and persists until so much of the drop has been whirled off into the
following vortex that the form a is reached again, and the velocity
of fall never attains such a value as to bring about the thinning out
of the edges. If a still larger drop is let fall, the forms Cv C2, and Cs
are assumed, in which the thin cylindrical part at the edge is at first
vibrating up and down, until the steady phase, C3, is reached : this
will by degrees be reduced to the form b, but the column of paraffin
was not long enough for ns to observe the final form a. If a still
larger drop of oleate is used, the vibrations of the cylindrical part, d,
are so great that the drop is torn asunder and such disturbance is
produced in the column that a steady fall is not attained.          These
results may be obtained by increasing the strength of the oleate
solution and keeping the size of the drop constant.
   One more case of interest may be described, namely, that of drops

of carbonate of soda dropped into paraffin oil. The phases are repr-
sented in fig. 12. The earlier ones are somewhat similar to those
above described.     But the phase shown at e is different.       Here it
seems quite a chance, as it were, that the disk does not break into a
ring.   The instability is immediately shown by the oscillations, which
 begin at  this point and continue in a regular manner through a fall
of more than 3 feet.        An attempt is made to show this in th-
phases £,     6.  A thickening appears at one side, and the opposite
edge thins off considerably, and these irregularities travel regularly
round the drop   as it falls through the column.
       Effect of the Height of  Fall on the Formation of the Ring.
   We have found that alteration of the height from which a drop falls
before reaching the surface of the column modifies the formation of
                                   Fig. 12.
the rings considerably.      Good rings are formed only within small
limits of height — from about 1 to 3 inches, according to the size of the
drop.   Above 3 inches it is only when the drop falls back into the
•column after rebound that a ring is formed, and that very irregularly.
 But within the limits for any particular size of drop rings are much

better formed from some heights than from others. We have observed
many cases, varying the size of the drop, the liquid of which it is
composed, and the tension of the surface, and have found that the
variations in goodness of the rings — where goodness is judged by the
length of path in the liquid — depend on the variations in the shape of
the drop at the moment it touches the surface. Curves were plotted
out, absciss© being taken equal to the height of fall, and ordinates
equal to the depth to which the ring goes without breaking up. The
carves show two or more maximum points : the abscissa values for
these differ from one another by lengths which may be reduced to time
intervals.   We find that there is very fair agreement between the
intervals so calculated and the periods of vibration of the drop about
the spherical form.      With small drops of water there are several
maxima close together, but more widely separated as the fall gets
longer (fig. 13).     The equivalent intervals are about -fe of a second,
                                   Fig. 13.
 whilst the period of vibration of a drop of the size used is about
 Jff of a second. With as large drops as can be formed from a tube
 there are only two maxima separated by an interval equivalent to

of a second.      The period   of vibration of such      a drop was calculated
to be  Jj-  of a second.
   The effect of diminishing the tension wonld be to increase the
period of vibration.      In experiment we have observed that the separa
tion of the maxima is much greater in the cases of paraffin and of
turpentine and of alcohol.        But difficulties were experienced in the
fact that drops of these liquids when let fall from small heights up
to about half an inch, generally assumed the spheroidal state.              Equal
drops of water and       of weak   oleate  of  soda  solution   were  let fall into
water, and it was found that the separation of maxima was nearly
twice as great for the oleate as for the pure water.
   In the case of large drops, drops let fall from a point midway
between the points to which maxima correspond are nearly always
broken up without the formation of a ring. In the case of small
drops rings are nearly always formed, but the depth of their paths in
the liquid varies from about half an inch to 5 inches.

            Influence   of Labour        upon the Discharge    of Nitrogen.        443

   As in the experimental researches previously published on the sub
ject of the present paper, the methods employed have been for the
most part entirely different from those -which                 I
                                                     have found best
adapted to the purpose,          I
                              have after much consideration judged it
inexpedient to lengthen an already long communication by giving an
account of them.
   The scope of my inquiry has been strictly limited to one question,
viz., that of the influence of labour in modifying the normal relation
between food and excreta.            I   have made no attempt to investigate the
mode     in which nitrogenous products came into existence in the
 organism.
    The only published experiments of any importance which bear
 strictly on the subject of inquiry are those of Dr. Parkes,* contributed
 to the Royal Society in 1867 and 1871, and those of Dr. Austin Flint,
on the pedestrian Weston, 1871. f The results of these two investi
 gations were as follows : —
    Dr. Parkes found that during or immediately after severe labour,
 the discharge of nitrogen was more or less increased ; the increase,
 however, was so inconsiderable- that it might well be questioned
whether it could not be accounted for as dependent on the more
perfect absorption of food, for although the diet of the soldiers
experimented upon was carefully regulated, and the nitrogen it con
tained determined by analysis, with the result that before work the
quantity of nitrogen taken in considerably exceeded tire quantity
discharged, the two became practically equal during the work period,
consequently if the whole period of observation is taken into account,
the nitrogen discharged is found to be more than balanced by that of
the food.
   Dr. Austin Flint, on the other hand, found that over the period of
work the increase of discharge was so large that no such explana
tion appeared to him admissible ;              if,
                                        however, comparison      made        is
of the intake with the output of nitrogen during the whole time of
observation, comprising the three periods of five days each before,
during, and after labour,       found that the two are unequal, the

difference in- favour of the nitrogen                     of   the     food amounting          to
217 grains in a total of 5075.
  These results were subjected to careful experimental criticism in
1876,* by Dr. Pavy, who showed as the result of his own analyses
that the immediate effect of labour in increasing the nitrogen output
of the body is more than compensated                  by the concomitant                 and sub
sequent intake.
     It is further to be   considered that whatever results had been obtained
by Dr. Austin    Flint, they could not have been received without some
misgiving, for his methods of research were insufficient as bases for
quantitative statement ; thus the nitrogen of the urine was throughout
determined by a process which is known to be liable to errors of
variable amount, which no care on the part of the worker is adequate
to guard against. So also as regards the intake of nitrogen.   Dr. Flint's
estimates were for the most part founded, not on analyses of the
material actually used, but on calculations based on the percentages
given in M. Payen's tables, t percentages which are known to be at
best only approximately correct ; moreover, the diet of Weston was of so
complicated and variable a composition, that even if each constituent
had been analysed, the result would still have been open to question.
   The circumstances under which Dr. Austin Flint had to make his
observations probably made it impossible for him even to attempt to
secure uniformity of diet. In this respect the conditions of Dr. Parkes'
experiments were immeasurably          superior ; fully recognising that
uniformity was essential, he fed his men in the simplest possible way.
He was not, however, able to accomplish this without employing a
diet which was so different from that to which as soldiers they were
accustomed that, however satisfactory its elementary composition
might be, it could scarcely be considered as natural.
   Notwithstanding this difficulty, the experiments of Dr. Parkes
           to say the least, highly probable that the immediate effect of
         is it,
render
labour    to increase the discharge of nitrogen, they leave     undecided           it
whether or not this increase occurs at    the  expense of stored material
independent of any concomitant or subsequent increase of intake.
   If this be so, the results of experiments conducted under natural
conditions and by perfectly accurate methods, ought to show that                              if
the nitrogen output were graphically represented during the course of
it by curve, in the construction of which the quantity of nitrogen in
         a
the food was taken as base line or axis, the part of such output curve
corresponding to the previous period would be a more or less horizontal
line below the level of the axis. That corresponding to the period
during or immediately following work will show an elevation, followed
by   adepression of less amplitude but longer duration, corresponding

the present inquiry to determine whether a result in this form can be
invariably obtained or not; its value, if obtained, would lie, not of
course in its affording evidence that increased expenditure of nitrogen,
consequent on work, is balanced by diminished expenditure afterwards
(for this has been already shown, and has in itself very little signifi
cance), but in its proving that the increase is not and cannot be an
effect of increased intake, that the over-expenditure of nitrogenous
material which work determines is exclusively expenditure of pre
viously stored material, and consequently that the degree of effect
produced by work will vary according to the state of the body in
respect of storage at the time at which the work is done.
    The subject-matter of the present paper will for the sake of clear
 ness be discussed under the following heads : —
    (1.) Plan of Experiment.
    (2.) Observations on Pulse, Temperature, Respiration, and Body-
 Weight, before, during, and after work.
    (3.) Experimental Diet.
    (4.) Methods of Collecting Excreta.
    (5.) Methods of Analysis of Pood and Excreta.
    (6.) Nature of the Work done.
    (7.) Detailed Statement and General Summary of the Quantitative
 Results of Experiments.
    In the concluding paragraphs an attempt will be made to set forth
 the inferences to which the experiments lead, and to indicate the direc
 tion which must be given to further inquiry.
                           The  Plan of Experiment.
    I  always began an experiment with the intention that it should
 extend over at least nine days, which         I  divided as follows : — Pour
 days' ordinary occupation, one day work, and a second period of four
 days' ordinary occupation, or more if       I   thought it necessary for the
 complete subsidence   of any  effects  produced by the work. In addition
          I
 to this usually prepared myself some days (ten or twelve) before,
 by living exceedingly regularly, and always having the same kind,
 and as nearly as possible, without weighing, the same quantity of
 food ; further, in order to get rid of what in a former paper* I have
 called reserve nitrogen, I have found it necessary somewhat to increase
 my daily exercise for a few days before commencing an experiment,
 or, as in my later investigations, to take the additional precaution of
                        • " Journal of Physiology,"  vol. i.

 446                  Mr. W. North.     The Influence of
 abstaining from food for thirty-six hours. Judged by the results,
  this seems to bring about the desired effect more rapidly and with
  greater certainty than increased exercise, and has the advantage of
 not causing such great systemic disturbance — at least in my own case.
     In the paper above referred to I have stated my belief as the result
 of experiment in the possibility of storing in the body a certain
 amount of nitrogen, which, when occasion arises, is discharged again,
 and T found in these experiments that my mode of life, and particu
 larly the amount of food which I had been taking in the previous
 week, materially influenced the effect produced by the inanition :
 that is to say, that in the one case, in which I had not been living up
 to my usual standard of diet for some little time before the fast com
 menced, the nitrogen curve began to descend immediately and very
 rapidly to its minimum ; whereas in the second, in which the reverse
 condition pertained, that is to say, when for a week before the experi
 ment I had been living somewhat more generously than usual, the
 nitrogen curve descended more slowly, and the general effect of the
starvation upon me was very much less ; I would lay particular stress
upon these facts, although beyond the use of the term
                                                            " store nitro
gen," I have attempted no explanation of them, because they will be
found to have a very important bearing upon the results of the experi
ments which form the subject of this paper.
    Having thus, in one way or the other, i.e., either by starvation or
increased exercise and regulated diet, prepared myself,     I  put myself
upon the special experimental diet, going about my work, and living
just as usual, except that my meal-times and the quantity of food
taken daily were regulated with great exactness.
    In the earlier experiments  I  performed the whole of the analyses
myself, and in all     I  have personally weighed, prepared, and cooked
every    article of my diet.
    The analyses of food, urine, and faeces, made in 1882 and 1883,
were made for me by a skilled assistant, and      I may take this oppor
tunity to remark,    that with my present mode of experiment, the labour
involved is so great as to render it quite impossible for any one to be
at the same time the subject of the experiment and the analyst, apart
from the fact that for many reasons it is very undesirable.
    Observations on Pulse, Temperature, Respiration,  and Body- Weight.
    These were made regularly twice a day, immediately on waking in
the morning, and just before going to bed at night.
    The Pulse. — The observations were made in two positions, standing
and lying, the difference between the two being, I think, a fair index
of the condition of the nervous system.          The morning observation
was made immediately on waking, and before any movements had

             Bodily Labour upon     the Discharge    of Nitrogen.         447
been made which might excite the heart.            The standing observation
was made by getting out of bed as quietly as possible, and standing
upright for two or three minutes, during which          I connted my pulse,
until  I found that the quickening produced by the movement had sub
sided.    I then made the observation, often repeating it two or three
times.    At night I remained standing for five or six minutes before
counting the pulse, and on lying down the same precaution was
observed.
   Respiration. — Observations    in the two positions were also made
morning    and  evening, the same  care being taken to ensure accuracy.
   I found it was not by any means an easy matter to count the respi
ration without affecting its rate by the very act of doing so. The
plan eventually adopted was to stand with my watch in my left hand,
and my left wrist lightly pressing against the lower ribs ; with a little
practice   I  was able in this way to count the respirations           almost
unconsciously.     The figures given in the tables are as a rule the
mean of at least two observations.
   Temperature. — This was observed by means of a pair of clinical
thermometers, which had been carefully compared, and found to read
accurately together.     The figures all indicate Fahrenheit degrees, and
are something less than one-tenth of a degree too high ; this being the
error of the instruments, no readings were taken under five minutes,
and most of them were over ten.             I previously found by careful
experiment    that three  minutes   would    suffice for either of the ther
mometers to attain the maximum temperature.
   The observations were taken in the mouth and axilla, great care
being taken to secure the proper position of the instruments ; any
doubtful observations were always repeated.          I occasionally also took
the temperature of the rectum.         Besides the morning and evening
observations, I took the temperature of the mouth frequently during
the exercise and at other times, when for some reason or another I
have thought it desirable to do so. The exact times at which all these
observations were made, together with notes on any which seemed to
require explanation, will be found recorded in the tables.
   The Body-Weight. — This was taken morning and evening on an
Avery's machine, weighing to ounces. On the days of exercise                 I
made two additional observations, one just before starting, and another
on returning.
   There are several points connected with the accurate determination
of the body-weight which are of very great importance in all investi
gations of this kind, and which may not be out of place here.
   There is of course no difficulty whatever in determining the body-
weight at any given time, but      I  have learned from long experience
that it is not so easy to make what I may call a " fair " observation.
It will be obvious from an inspection of the tables that the variations

448                   Mr. W. North.      The Influence of
of my own body-weight were often very considerable, and this is
especially the case between the evening weight and that of the follow
ing morning ; variations daring the day may be very largely dne to
food and drink, particularly the latter.        This loss of weight during
sleep is due to two causes, loss by the skin and lungs, and loss by the
kidneys, as    I  always emptied the bladder before taking my weight.
Making all allowance       for the urine, it is clear that whilst sleeping
I frequently   lost  1 to 1^ lbs. in weight, and on some occasions even
more, by the skin and lungs alone. During the day I have frequent ly
observed even greater loss from this cause.
   The object of frequent and regular observations of the body- weight
in all investigations of this kind is to determine whether or no there
exists a relation between loss of tissue and discharge of nitrogen.
The weight of prote-id which would represent the greatest increase in
the nitrogen discharge      I  have ever observed is very small compared
with the variation of body-weight from' other causes, and is very
liable to be overshadowed by them, if indeed we ought to consid-r
ourselves in any degree capable of distinguishing between the two.
   There are a number of circumstances which affect the body-weight,
and which    I think it would be well briefly to consider.        They may be
divided roughly into two categories, external and internal.
   External Conditions. — The condition of the atmosphere, height of
the barometer, external temperature, and the nature of one's occu
pation.
   It is a matter of common observation that the amount of sensible
perspiration varies very materially with meteorological conditions,
and I have good reason for believing that not merely the sensible
perspiration is affected, but also indirectly the total loss through the
skin.
   Speaking for myself, and      I have often heard the same remark made
by others accustomed to severe physical exertion, a low barometer
and the depressing conditions which so often accompany it pro
foundly influence the effect of such exertion upon the body- weight ; I
can only suppose that this is due to the mental effect produced
reacting on the vasomotor system.           Nor is this all.      I think that
there is evidence in the results of my experiments, that this effect
manifests itself in another way,* which unfortunately seriously com
plicates the problem I have set before me for solution. This vaso
motor action affects the blood supply not merely of the skin, but also
of the internal organs, and especially the kidneys, causing not only a
great increase in the quantity of urine, but also an increase of
excretory activity, which has for result an incontestable increase in
the amount of nitrogen in the urine.            This makes it exceedingly
important in estimating the value of results obtained to take very
                 * E. Smith : "Health and Disease," 1875, p. 157.

            Bodily Labour upon        the  Discharge  of Nitrogen.           449
carefully into consideration all these conditions which directly or
indirectly affect not only the quantity, but the quality of the urine.
   Internal Conditions. — These are very various, and hardly admit of
accurate scientific description.         There is, however, a phrase the
meaning of which is well known          to athletes, viz., " to feel fit," which
will serve to illustrate my meaning. I have observed repeatedly that
when I have undergone any considerable physical exertion for which
at the outset I did not feel this " fitness," or, to use another phrase,
when I was "out of condition," there was invariably a much greater
loss of weight than when     I was " in good condition."
   No doubt atmospheric conditions have a very powerful influence
for or against this "fitness" for exertion, but independently of these
are mental and nervous states probably exceedingly complicated in
their origin, but none th- less powerful in the influence they have
upon the metabolic phenomena of the body.
   The body-weight in these experim-nts was always taken after
emptying the bladder, so that the difference between the evening
weight and the weight next morning expresses the total loss by skin
and kidneys.      I attempted to eliminate the error caused by the con
tents of the reQtum, but very soon found that it was impossible to
regulate and control the bowels with the same precision with which
the urine can be regulated ; so that if we wish very accurately to
determine     the significance of these differences of body-weight, we
must take careful note of the times at which the faeces were passed,
but for reasons which will be stated under the head of the faeces the
difficulty is only th-n very partially overcome.          Enough has I think
 been said to show how exceedingly difficult it may be to determine
 with even moderate accuracy the nature of the loss or gain in body-
 weight, and how careful we should be in accepting arguments founded
on small variations.
   Daily Occupation, Meals,    8fc.
                                    — The day generally began about 9 a.m. ;
the variations from this time will be found in the tables of tempe
rature.   Breakfast followed as soon as I could prepare it. I had no
mid-day   meal,  but was accustomed to take a portion of the bread to
the laboratory at University College, in which most of my time was
spent.    I  dined at or about 6 p.m., and spent the evening in reading,
weighing and preparing food, &c. The necessities of my work some
times kept me up very late.            This was unavoidable, as       I  was not
able  to devote  my whole   time    to these experiments.       At  first I used
to bake my bread every evening for the following day ; but in the
later experiments 1 gave up every alternate evening to this work, as
           I
I found saved time by the arrangement. Supper was taken at
various times after 11 p.m.
   Arrangements on Days of Exercise. — Under ordinary circumstances,
that is to say, when the walk could bo easily accomplished between

450                Mr.  W. North.       The Influence of
the breakfast   and dinner hour, or at the most an hour or so later,
the exercise did not entail any material alteration in the arrang-e-
ments already described ; but when the distance to be walked ex
ceeded   30  miles, the time required for its performance was too
great to admit of even approximate adherence to the rules as to
meal-times, &c, described in the previous section.        For instance, on
the occasion when the distance to be walked was close upon 50
miles, it was necessary to go some little distance by train as usual, in
order to get out of London before commencing the march.               This
involved getting up at 4 a.m.,       breakfasting before I started, and
walking to a railway station to      catch a train, so that I might be on
my road by 6 a.m. I did not          return perhaps until 8 p.m. or even
later, my sole food during the      journey being one-half of my daily
allowance of bread.
   Before starting  I had the following operations to perform : — Obser
vations on pulse,    temperature and body-weight naked, and body-
weight when fully equipped for the journey, in order that I might be
able to estimate the load carried.        After this I had to prepare and
eat my breakfast and put on my kit again before I could start.          On
returning my first duty was to weigh myself "all standing" and then
naked ; the differences between these observations and those taken
in the morning gave me the actual loss of weight sustained and the
mean load carried, because, as       I  need hardly point out, the load
brought   back is somewhat   differently constituted from that taken out
in the morning, being lighter by the weight of bread consumed and
heavier by the urine and faeces brought back.
   Having made these observations on my body-weight,            I took my
pulse, temperature, and respiration, at all events in the standing posi
tion, had a cold bath, after which I sometimes made further obser
vations on pulse and temperature, and then prepared my dinner, of
which by this time    I was generally greatly in need. On the days of
exercise I always combined dinner and supper, so that at the latest
the last ingestion of food for the day was certainly not later than
usual, and often an hour or two earlier.
   During the actual progress of the walk,       I frequently observed my
pulse, temperature, respiration, the length of my stride, and average
pace.
   I havo thought it necessary to state thus explicitly my manner of
proceeding on a day of exercise, becanse it may possibly be urged
that the results I have obtained may be thus accounted for ; that is
to say, it may be urged that whereas an ordinary day was one of
twenty-four hours, the day of exercise was on two occasions at all
events longer by four hours, and the day before the exercise was
shortened by the same amount.           I am obliged to admit a certain
 amount of justice in this objection, but I would urge, on the other

             Bodily Labour upon       tJie Discharge  of Nitrogen.        451
hand, that     I  was careful always to dine rather earlier on the day
before the exercise, and to consume all my remaining bread at that
meal, leaving only a cup of cocoa to be taken later to complete the
day's allowance, and this        I  generally took between 8 and 9 p.m.,
instead    of at 11 p.m. as on other days; so that I think       I  may safely
say   that  my   food had  at  least  the   usual time for  digestion and the
products to pass into the urine.
                                           I
    It may possibly be asked, why did not adhere to my ordinary
 meal times and arrange for the consumption of my dinner on the
 road ?    I would reply, that the object of these experiments was to
determine the effect of muscular labour upon the nitrogen contained
in the body, and not the disposition of material supplied to the
organism whilst in a state of great activity.         This I consider to be a
different problem from the one actually before us, and which will
require investigation by somewhat different methods from those
which I have adopted in these researches. True I have found it
necessary to eat something during the work, but this was only the
same as was eaten on other days on which no work was done.
    The Diet. — In all experiments of this kind, the diet is of prime
importance.       Our ordinary food-stuffs do not lend themselves readily
to analysis, are very variable in their composition, and are in many
respects very unsuited to the purpose.
   The conditions which the diet for such researches must satisfy are
these : —
   (1.) It must be of such a nature as to resemble as nearly as pos
sible the ordinary food of the individual experimented upon.
   (2.)  It  must admit of being accurately sampled for analysis.
   (3.)  It  must keep for such a length of time that one experiment at
least can be made with the same material.
   The ordinary components of a mixed diet do not satisfy the last
two conditions in any sense whatsoever, and the extreme difficulty of
determining the ingesta accurately led me, after many trials, to use
special methods of preparing the following articles for the purposes
of these researches    : —
                                 Bread.
                                 Meat.
                                 Green vegetables.
                                 Potatoes.
                                 Milk.
                                 Fat.
                                 Apples.
                                 Cocoa.
   Bread.  — In order to secure perfect uniformity in the quantity and
quality of this article,   I  took a sufficiency of one sample of flour to

452                       Mr. W. North.        The Influence    of
last for several experiments, and this was weighed out into pap-r
bags in quantities sufficient for each day's consumption, an allowance
of 10 grams on each day's quantity being made for loss in the
process of making.            This fignre was arrived at by actual experiment.
It will    be obvious that by this method, the bread being always made
in the same way and from precisely the same quantities of the same
ingredients, analysis of the flour was sufficient to determine the daily
quantity of        each constituent,      the weight of the bread itself being
quite immaterial.           I  may add that it was raised by means of bicar
bonate of soda and tartaric acid, and baked in tins to avoid possible
loss in the process, and that the greatest care was taken to ensure the
consumption of the whole daily quantity by keeping                  it in paper bags,
 so that no crumbs were lost.
     In this way I secured absolute uniformity as regards bread.
     Meat. — The difficulties to be evercome in order that the meat migbt
 be made to         fulfil the conditions already laid down were much more
 serious than in the case of bread.             They were, however, successfully
 met by my friend Mr. Stephen Darby, of Leadenhall Street, to whom
 I would here express my great obligation for the service he has ren
 dered me in this matter. The process of preparation is briefly this : —
     A large quantity, 80 to 100 lbs. of selected lean beefsteak, was
 carefully freed from all obvious fat, tendon, Ac, cut into pieces about
 the size of a Barcelona nut, and dried upon a steam floor for some
 time, then cut into still smaller pieces and dried again, and the pro
 cess repeated until the material was dry enough to be finely ground
 in a mill.       The resulting powder was exceedingly dry, of about the
 consistency of building sand, practically insoluble in water even
 after very prolonged boiling, but readily attacked by very dilute
 hydrochloric acid (0-2 per cent.), and apparently very easy of diges
  tion.
      I found that the insolubility of the material somewhat interfered
  with the palatability of the soup made from it (in which form it was
  always taken but by the addition of vegetables and seasoning).                 This
  difficulty   was   surmounted,      as was  also another,   viz.,  that  the powder
  would not remain in suspension unless something were added to
  thicken the soup.            It will be obvious that this meat powder fulfils
  the required condition almost perfectly.              It will keep almost inde
  finitely (I have used some recently which was made nearly four yeais
  ago).      It is of uniform composition, and can be very readily analysed
  — one analysis therefore sufficing for            a very  large number of expe
  riments.
      Potatoes. — There is no difficulty as to these, " Edwards' patent
  desiccated potato" fulfilling every condition perfectly.
      Gfreen   Vegetables.   — These were for a long time           a source of very
  great trouble.          At first  I  used ordinarv fresh vegetable, which was

            Bodily Labour upon               the    Discharge       of Nitrogen.           453
very unsatisfactory.    Nearly all the experiments recorded in this
                                                       " dried
paper have been made with what is known as                     julienne,"
which, though in many respects greatly superior to fresh vegetable
for the purpose of these inquiries, in that it is possible to sample and
analyse    it,
            fairly    open to the objection that
                         is                                           it
                                                      requires prolonged
soaking and careful cooking, otherwise        exceedingly indigestible.
                                                          it   is
   During the progress of the last experiment, Mr. Darby prepared
for me, at my suggestion, a quantity of vegetables of various kinds,
by thorough cooking, draining away the water, carefully drying the
residue, and reducing     to a very fine powder.
                               it                   The product      supe             is
rior to the dry julienne in many respects.       It    already cooked is                   ;   it
possesses much more flavour, and being in a fine powder,       very easily       is
digested.   I intend to use vegetables so prepared in all future expe
riments.
  Milk. — This presented no difficulty.  was informed by the makers
                                                       I
that a  "case" of condensed milk was invariably the product of one
operation, and in consequence the various tins in     would contain        it
milk of similar composition.    Actual analysis showed this to be the
case.
   The milk was weighed in small tared beakers (50 grams in each),
the whole of the contents of a tin being weighed out at the same time,
in order that no change by evaporation might take place in the com
position of the milk. When used, after scraping out as much as
possible with a spoon,      boiled the beaker in the water to be used for

   Preparation of Foods. — My method of preparing the soup, the chief
nitrogenous food of the day, was as follows : — 20 grams of julienne
were weighed out the night before, and set aside in a dish, and covered
with about 250 c.c. of water to soak. By 6 p.m. on the following day
it was sufficiently soaked to be ready for cooking, and was then
poured into a saucepan, care being taken that none either of the
vegetable or water was lost.          To this was added salt and dried meat
(60  grams),   and   the whole    boiled   for twenty minutes or half-an-hour,
and kept constantly stirred, so that nothing should adhere to the
sides of the saucepan, get burned, and so be lost.                      When suffi
ciently cooked it was poured into           the   basin from   which it was to be
eaten, and the saucepan carefully cleaned with a little boiling water,
which was then added to the soup. By these precautions I found no
difficulty in securing the consumption of the whole of the material.
    The potatoes were cooked according to the directions given by the
makers, a small portion of fat being added.                   I found that when
properly cooked there was not the slightest difficulty in removing
them from the saucepan completely.
    The apples were stewed in the dish with the water in which they
were soaked, together with the 15 grams of sugar, and from this dish
they were eaten, so that nothing was lost.
         Remarks on some Considerations involved in the above Diet.
    My diet during these experiments was compared with my ordinary
 food, a very concentrated one, and ou this ground alone it has been
 suggested to me that it was very objectionable, and could not nourish
 me in the same way as my ordinary food.                 To this 1 can only reply
 that during the whole course of these experiments                        I  enjoyed
 exceedingly good      health,  and   provided      I was   careful   about  my diet
 for a few days after the conclusion of an experiment,                I  experienced
 no  ill effects whatsoever     ;  on the contrary       I  have found on several
 occasions that my general health was decidedly benefited by adopting

456                   Mr. W. North.       The Influence of
the diet, not for experimental bnt entirely personal reasons, and            I
have often done so.   All that has been done [to any of the articles
which comprise my diet table is to remove the great bulk of the wat-r,
and that in snch a way as to produce no alteration in the food-stuff,
 except in form.    I think the figures prove beyond a doubt that the
food was exceedingly well digested.          The only fault  I   have to find
 with it is that there is so little indigestible material in it,  that it  fre
 quently caused slight constipation and irregularity of the bowels,
 which somewhat interfered with the exactness of the experiment.
The sensations experienced after a meal of dried meat and vegetables
are,
   I    think, worth recording.
    Immediately after the meal there was a sense of satisfaction this  ;
was replaced in about an hour by      a    sense of hunger, sometimes very
marked     ;and this gradually disappeared and gave place to the con
sciousness that an amply sufficient meal had been taken.
    The Fluid Food.— »-Nothing in my experience          so difficult to regu
                                                        is
late as the supply of fluids to the body during experiments of this
kind. Variations of external temperature, and            a number of minor
circumstances over which we have little or no control, lead to the con
sumption of drinks of various kinds at irregular times, which no
doubt have      avery considerable effect upon the constitution of the
urine, if  not upon the general metabolism of the body.         No doubt the
strict regulation of the fluids consumed would tend in some degree to
increase the accuracy of the experiment, but       itwould at the same time
cause an amount of discomfort to the individual experimented upon,
which would in many cases,    I    think, counterbalance the supposed gain
in accuracy.
   Without any special effort on my part,     I    think I  may say that my
fluid ingesta regulated themselves.        The water used for making the
cocoa or the soup was practically a constant determined by the size of
the cooking vessels used. Besides the fluid thus taken,      I   think shall
                                                                       I
be near the truth    if
                      I    say that on ordinary days     a pint of water was
drunk. (No alcohol was taken in any form during these experiments,
and though     Ihabitually take very little,  it was my custom to abstain
entirely  for several days   before  commencing an experiment.)
   On the days of exercise there was undoubtedly an increase in the
fluids ingested, for I  allowed myself three pints of soda-water during
the day, and on more than one occasion      Ihave suffered considerable
distress from the apparent insufficiency of this allowance.
   It an accepted fact that under ordinary circumstances the inges
      is
tion of large quantities of fluid causes an increase in the nitrogen
eliminated by the urine, and possibly some of the increase which            I
have observed on days of exercise may be due to this cause but con ;
sidering the vast increase in the loss by the skin under such circum
stances,
       I       am inclined to regard the effect to be attributed to this

             Bodily Labour upon        the  Discharge   of Nitrogen.         457
 cause as comparatively    insignificant, and to consider the extra fluid so
 taken   as only serving  to maintain the normal balance of fluids in the
 body.
                      Method of Collecting the Excreta.
    My unit of time,  as before stated, was a period of      twenty-four hours,
 commencing immediately before breakfast each day ; the urine passed
 in this period was therefore collected and mixed. For the collection
 of the urine I used a pair of 40-oz. wide-mouthed stoppered bottles,
 which for convenience of carriage, and in order that I might have
 them always with me, were placed in a basket having a partition, and
 the1 lid of which was secured by a padlock,            to prevent interference
 with the contents by other than myself or my assistant.
    For the collection of the   faeces   1 used flat-bottomed Bohemian glass
 basins, about 2 inches deep, and 6 inches in diameter, with flat plates
of glass for covers. These fitted into wooden boxes sufficiently stout
 to protect the contents from breakage in travelling, the lids being
 tnade to fit very closely, and secured almost hermetically by means of
 four thumbscrews.       The dishes and covers were all weighed most
 carefully, and the weight scratched upon them with a diamond, and
the   cases were made to fit so tightly that they might be carried in
any position without risk of losing the contents ; these were used for
carrying the faeces from my own rooms to the laboratory, and also
 when on the march.
                     Mode cf Collecting during Exercise.
    As the exercise consisted of long pedestrian expeditions into the
country, I was obliged to adopt some means of carrying my receptacles
 with me. The plan first used was to pack the urine bottles in felt
jackets, to prevent breakage in an ordinary tourist's knapsack, the
stoppers being carefully greased, and tied in, the foeces box I strapped
 to a belt at my waist.     But this arrangement I very soon found to be
both unsafe and very uncomfortable, and I substituted an ordinary
military valise, in which     I   carried the bottles inclosed in thick felt
jackets as before. The faeces box being strapped in the place in which
 the soldier would carry his canteen, a haversack for my bread, and a
 |»air of thermometers carried in separate special pockets, so as to be
accessible at once, completed my equipment.
    I may remark in passing that the question of a comfortable knap
 sack is a very important one, as anything which causes discomfort
 may very seriously increase the internal, if not the external work of
the body.     I have tried almost every form of knapsack, and have
found the modern military valise far superior to any other form.            The
 position of the load is such that the strain is equally distributed, and
 there is no galling or sense of local weariness on taking it off after a
 long day's inarch, and above all it leaves the respiration perfectly

   The urine and faeces of the previous day were carried to the labo
ratory every morning by myself, and were analysed after the follow
ing methods.
                 Methods of Analysis of Urine and Faces.
   The urine was passed directly into the wide-mouthed bottles already
described, and after the specific gravity had been taken, was poured
into a large measuring cylinder, and the amount noted. Distilled
water was then added, in order to bring the quantity to a round
number of cubic centimeters, e.g., if the original quantity was 1320 c.c,
 water would be added to make it up to 1400 c.c. After the whole
had been thoroughly mixed, the analysis was proceeded with.
   This plan was adopted to avoid the risk of arithmetical errors in
the subsequent calculation of the results of the analyses.
   Nitrogen. — This was estimated by combustion with soda-lime, after
the Munich method.         10 c.c. of urine were taken and evaporated
with a small quantity of well-burned Calais sand and a trace of oxalic
acid, over a water-bath at the boiling temperature, in exceedingly
thin hemispherical glass dishes. When thoroughly dry the dish and
its contents were pulverised in a mortar — all precautions being taken
to prevent loss — mixed with soda-lime, and the analysis proceeded with
in the usual way. The estimations were made by titration with
cochineal as indicator.
   Instead of glass tubes I have used wrought-iron ones, carefully
tested under hydraulic pressure up to 300 lbs. on the inch.
   Objection has been made to the use of iron tubes, on the ground
that when hot there is a danger of their leaking, and that the corks
burn.    I have found these difficulties to be more imaginary than real,
and with a little practice and the use of ordinary care I have obtained
 the most excellent results.    Recently I have made a number of experi
ments, in which the urine, instead of being evaporated with oxalic
 acid as above described, was introduced directly by means of a pipette
into a tube already charged with 2 or 3 inches of soda-lime, and a
small quantity of cane-sugar at the end. This latter method ulti
mately proved equally satisfactory with the former, but it requires
great caution and careful watching during the process of heating, to
prevent the sudden development of steam in quantity sufficient to blow
the acid out of the bulbs ; but this accident can be avoided without
 very great difficulty.   I  have found it desirable, particularly when
the latter method is used, to employ bulbs considerably larger than
those generally sold for the purpose, and to have a small additional
 bulb blown, from which the point takes its origin. This is a great
safeguard against the effects of possible splashing.

       Chlorides. — None of the special methods in   use  for the estimation of
   chlorides in urine are satisfactory.     Direct titration with silver, with
   potassic chromate as indicator, is practically worthless, and the time
   required and the risks involved in the method of estimation in the
   ash render it impracticable when time is of any consequence.          I have
   therefore adopted the simpler plan of diluting the urine with 5 or
   6 volumes of water, and precipitating with argentic nitrate in the
   presence of a minimum of nitric acid, and washing and weighing the
  chloride formed.      The results when the operation is carefully con-
  ducted are most satisfactory.
      Sulphates.  — These were estimated gravimetrically     in- the usual way
  by precipitation from the boiling urine with barium- chloride and a
  minimum of hydrochloric acid.
      Phosphates. — The ordinary uranium process was used, and          I  need
 only remark of it, the absolute necessity which exists for the use of
  perfectly fresh ferrocyanide solution.     In order to secure this I find it
  best to keep a quantity of the finely powdered crystals, and dissolve
  them as required on the testing tile.
     I have made no attempt to estimate any of the individual nitro
 genous bodies in the urine, but have confined myself strictly to the
 consideration of the total nitrogen, and the variations which it under
 goes under various circumstances, without complicating the problem
 by attempting to discriminate between the various bodies which go to
 make up the total which, as a matter of fact, our present methods will
 not allow us to do with enough accuracy to make the investigation
 worth the immense amount of additional labour which it would
 involve.
                     Methods Used in the Analysis of Faces.
     The collecting apparatus has been already described, and          I  need
only now say of it that it was thoroughly satisfactory in every
respect.
     On arrival at the laboratory the cases are opened^ the glass dish
and cover removed, and together with their contents carefully weighed,
the difference between the total weight and the weights- marked on
the dish and cover giving the weight of the faeces.            The cover was
then removed, and a sufficiency of methylated spirit ponred upon them
to cover them.        This completely destroyed all objectionable smell,
and rendered the material safe from decomposition.
    I  did not estimate the nitrogen in each day's faeces, but divided an
experiment into three periods : the period before the work, the period
of the work, and the period after the work. Each sample as passed
was placed with the alcohol in a large porcelain dish over the water-
bath, and after being well broken up with a glass paddle, was rapidly
dried, and the residue by constant stirring reduced to a dry granular
                                                                 2 H 2

mass,   which was occasionally removed very carefully to a mortar and
broken up, in order to hasten the process.          The products were sepa
rated into three lots, as above stated, and stored in a well stoppered
bottle till the analysis could be made. The total amount of dry
matter yielded by the faeces was determined, and the calculation of
the analyses made from this.
    The nitrogen was estimated by the soda-lime process, the material
being reduced to an exceedingly fine powder, and burned in an iron
tube 3 inches longer than those used for the urine, in order to secure
the complete decomposition of any undigested albuminoids which
might be present.
    Phosphates were estimated after partial incineration in a platinum
capsule by the magnesia method, and weighed as pyrophosphate.
    Chlorides. — The precipitate yielded on addition of a few drops of
argentic nitrate to a watery extract of the dry material rarely
amounted to more than a perceptible         cloudiness,  and consequently  no
figures appear in the analyses.
    Sulphates. — The same is still more true of the precipitate yielded by
the addition of barium nitrate and hydrochloric acid to the same
solution.      It was often an open question whether there was any pre
cipitate at all, so small was the quantity of soluble sulphate present.
 This led me to consider in what form the sulphur might exist, and in
 the light of Lepine's experiments on the sulphur in the urine,         I was
 led to try the effect of powerful oxidising agents on the sulphur
 compounds which might be present, and              I  very soon found that
 nothing short of combustion in a stream of oxygen would completely
 decompose them.         The consequence of this was that after a series of
 experiments I found myself unable to devise a method by which the
 combustion could be accurately carried out, and at the same time with
 sufficient rapidity to enable the work to be completed in the time at
 my disposal.       I regret exceedingly that this should have been the case,
 as the results of complete determination        of the sulphur, both in the
  urine and foeces, would have been most interesting.
     Ash. — In the process of incinerating the faeces for the estimation of
  the phosphates, the ash was always roughly estimated, and so regu
  larly did the phosphates vary with the amount of ash, that as soon as
                      I
  this was known was able to make a very fair estimate of the quantity
  present.
     When    I  began these researches   I had the intention of determining
  accurately    the  composition  of each  day's feces, but it soon became
  obvious that the results could be of but little value, and might
  possibly be very misleading, from the extreme difficulty of deciding
  how far those passed on a given day belong to the day before, or
  contain something which should be credited to an earlier day, or even
  to the very day on which they were passed.            I  have attempted by
                                                                            «

 various artificial means to distinguish one day from another by eating
something indigestible, and attempting to use the position of this
body as a line of demarcation between one day and the next, but all
attempts have hitherto proved futile.
      This difficulty presents itself with the greatest force at the begin
 ning of an experiment, because from the concentrated nature of my
 diet, it is liable and as a matter of fact almost always at first induces
 slight constipation.
                    I
      Now that adopt the plan of fasting from twenty-four to thirty -six
 hours before commencing an experiment, this difficulty is diminished ;
 nevertheless in one or two cases I have found that having taken a large
 quantity of milk on the day before starvation, in order that by the colour
 of the dejecta        I might have some guide to their distribution and origin,
 that the     first   faeces passed after the fast, sometimes not till the second
 day of the experiment, would contain traces of this milk, although the
 bowels had been freely moved in the twenty-four hours after it was
  taken.      1 fear we must admit the impossibility of completely empty
  ing    the intestines    each day, and be content with results obtained as
  they are throughout these experiments by the method of averages.
  Even when the bowels are moved regularly every day at the same
 hour, the amount of dry material is by no means constant, and even
  when it happens to be the same, the amount of nitrogen contained in
  each day's- quantity may be very different.
       Microscopic examination showed that digestion of my experimental
  diet was very complete, the undigested matter consisting almost
  entirely of fragments of vegetable fibre, and a few starch grannies
   (generally burst). Repeated examinations of a watery extract, pre
  pared by boiling the dry material, failed to show the presence of
  either starch or sugar in any appreciable quantity. On one occasion
  on which I suffered slightly from diarrhoea, the extract of the ash
  contained an almost weighable amount of chlorides, and the amount
                                                     "
  of sulphates rose to what might be called strong traces."
       The whole of the analyses of food and excreta were done at least
  twice, and whenever a very discordant result was obtained, a third
  analysis was always made ; the figures given in the tables are therefore
  invariably the mean of at least two results, closely agreeing.

       Nitrogen. — The soda-lime process was used in all cases, every caro
   being taken to ensure complete combustion, by very slow burning
   and the use of extra long tubes. The great concordance of the results
   is,  I think, a satisfactory answer to most of the objections which can
   be urged against the method.           The following are examples : —

     Sulpltates were determined in the ash in the usual way. The deter
  minations have little bearing on the results of the experiments,
 except in so far as they show that the sulphuric acid in the urine has
 its origin chiefly from sulphur taken into the body in some other
 form.     The determination of the total sulphur in the food would have
 been of little use unless the total sulphur of the excreta had been
 determined also, and, as before stated, this was found to be quite
 impossible.
     The Work. — Perhaps of all the considerations   involved in researches
 of this kind, the nature of the work done presents the greatest diffi
 culties.    We are obliged to choose between certain ordinary forms of
 exercise   and  the use of machines for the purpose.          Each has its
 advantages and disadvantages, and in all it is well nigh impossible
 to determine with any reasonable approach to accuracy the total
 amount of work done.       The external work does admit of calculation
 within limits, but our information with regard to the internal work
 of the body is scanty and unreliable in the extreme, and in the present
 state of our knowledge all that can be done is to eliminate the diffi
 culty by making the internal work, as far as possible, a constant.      It
is manifestly unfair to compare walking with the lifting of heavy
 weights or either with rowing or bicyling ; in none of these forms of
labour are the same muscles used, and it is not only possible, but
very probable, that different individuals use their muscles differently
in each case ; nay, more, that the same individual, unless he is con
stantly practising, does not use exactly the same muscles on different
occasions.     Walking exercise is, perhaps, the least objectionable of
all, and probably for this reason it has found most favour with inves
tigators of this problem, and for this reason  I  have adopted it in these
experiments.
    It might  appear that the same distance walked over the same roads,

            Bodily Labour upon          the   Discharge   of Nitrogen.       463
in  the same time, and under as far as possible similar conditions,
would represent equal amounts of work done, but a very little expe
rience will suffice to show that such is not the case, and the results of
my own experiments will, I think, bear out this opinion.       Although
accustomed from childhood to this particular form of exercise, and
though the actual distances walked in these experiments was almost
always well within my powers, I can say with truth that, measured
by my own sensations,      I have never before so fully appreciated the
effect of what is called " training."   For this reason, I have confined
myself strictly to the consideration of gross results.    When the dis
tances were short, the effect produced was exceedingly variable, and
in the final experiments of 1879 and 1882, when the labour was tole
rably exhausting, all that we can say      that the effect on the dis
                                                   is,
charge of nitrogen     beyond all doubt
                      is                  but that bears no sort of

relation to the work done in previous experiments.
   In each succeeding walk the average pace per hour increased very
percept.bly, and yet  I am confident that this increase of pace did not
by any means involve a proportional increase of internal work        in      ;
                   "                         must confess that see no

     I  gradually got into training."              I                     I

                                   it

daily a   very large amount of exercise, until as         were the bodily

machinery had learned to work uniformly, and then suddenly in
creasing  it very considerably.      In my own case, a daily walk of 30
miles, increased to 50 every      tenth  day, would express my meaning           ;
and even this were kept up for two months or more, should expect
          if                                                      I
the effect of the longer marches to become .less and less marked.
The gist of the whole matter is, that we have to deal with a machine
which has a most marvellous power of accommodating itself to the
work put upon   it,  and this introduces a factor into the investigations
of which we are at present wholly ignorant; indeed, the problem                  is
thereby rendered so complicated, that the hope of finding any expla
nation of the phenomena observed           somewhat distant.
                                              is               As regards
this particular form of    exercise,  assuming  that      done

most favourable conditions, the following points must be considered
in interpreting the results —  :
   (1.) The individual who       the subject of experiment.
                                   is
   (2.)  The  distance  walked.
   (3!) The pace.
   (4.) The load carried.
   (5.) The external conditions, such as temperature, &c.
Each! must b« carefully worked out in turn, and a very large
number of experiments made before we shall be justified in arguing
from the results obtained in one case to those of another.
   Nor is  this all. Some men are, so to speak, much more economical

4(54               Mr. W. North.       The Influence of
machines    than others, i.e., differences of weight and all else beinp
taken into consideration.     One man will do a given amount of work
npon   a  given diet, which   to another would be simply impossible,   i
have had ample opportunity for observing this in the training o»
boats' crews in Cambridge, and I was particularly struck by the com
plete absence of any relation between body- weight and the amount of
solid food consumed when no restrictions were placed upon the diet
as regards quantity.
   I hope in future experiments to be able to reduce the errors intro
duced by the work very considerably by the use of a work machine
so contrived that the external work done can be measured fairly
accurately, and the internal work to some extent regulated. Absolute
results cannot, I think, be hoped for, but much may be done n the
way of rendering one experiment comparable with another, wlich at
present can hardly be said to be the case.
   I introduce here a scries of experiments made in 1879; which,
though not made with snch accuracy of method as the later series of
1882 and 1883, tend very materially to conlirm the results then
obtained.

much water as it would absorb, and eaten with the apples. The
potatoes were baked in the usual manner.             The sugar and salt used

was probably fairly uniform.
   Nothing excepting; the nitrogen was estimated' in the food-stuffs,

                            The 1882 Series of Experiments.
   The following tables exhibit the whole of the results of the obser
vations made during these experiments ; for convenience of reference
1 have designated them by letters, as follows : —
   Table      A. — Quantity, specific gravity, and chemical composition                             of
     the urine.
   Table B. — The time of passing,                      quantity, and composition            of   the
     faeces.
   Table C. —The total daily discharge of nitrogen by urine and                               faeces.
   This table requires        a  brief explanation.                  In order   to distribute the
faeces as evenly as possible              over the experiment, which, as                    I   have
explained      before,  is   very     difficult     to   do satisfactorily,      I have  assumed,
as I have endeavoured to show                      I   have some right to assume, that
generally speaking each quantity of faeces represents a day.                               Oh this

              Bodily Labour upon         the  Discharge    of Nitrogen.           471
                I
assumption have set back the faeces, so that in Table C they appear
opposite the day to which they probably belong.                  In some cases this
has not been possible.         On the whole       I think   this plan is better than
the alternative one of dividing them equally over the whole time, or
considering them quite separately.
   Table    D shows the daily state of what             I  may call the debit and
       credit account of the body as regards nitrogen.              The fluctuations
       of the     " store nitrogen

       from it.
    Table E gives the daily discharge of PjO* by urine and fseces, on
       the same assumption as that made in constructing Table C.
   Table F shows the results of all observations on pulse, respiration,
       temperature, and body-weight.
    Table O gives the mean daily value of the observations recorded in
       Table F.
   Table H shows the amount of work done, and the loss of weight
       sustained    in consequence.
   I   had originally intended to enter wpon the question of the force
value of the food and its relation to the energy expended during the
work. At the best it would only have been an estimate based on
Professor Franklanrl's* tables, and the data from which the work of
the body, both internal and external, are so inexact and untrustworthy,
that under the circumstances           I have thought it best to content myself
with a simple statement of the number of miles walked, and the time
occupied in the performance of the work. It will be sufficient here
to say that the general truth of the conclusions drawn from the
classical experiment of Professors Fick and Wislicenus is confirmed by
the results of these experiments in every case.
   It is to be understood that except when otherwise stated, the diet
was that given in the table accompanying the section in which the
diet was discussed, and that no exercise was taken except such as was
involved by my ordinary occupation.
                   Experiment    I,  1882.   May iAth     to June  1st.
   The figures in Table A point conclusively to the fact that the work
done on May 28th caused a considerable increase in the nitrogen dis
charged by the urine.          The average daily discharge on the four days
before    the work    was  14-15    grams, whilst during the remaining five
days it rose to an average of 15-74 grams, and the increase not only
affected the discharge on the day of the work, but every succeeding
day.     There was apparently no tendency to return to the average dis
charge before the work, and it would seem as if the exertion had simply
served to give tone and regularity to the nitrogen discharge.
   *  "The Origin    of Muscular Power,"    "Phil.  Mag.," No. 215, September, 1866.

472                   Mr. W. North.      The Influence  of
    The average daily elimination by urine and faces combined is :
first four days, 16-64 grams; last five days, 17-88 grams.
    Despite this increased discharge, there were remaining in the body
2-77 grams of nitrogen known to have been taken in as food.                The
figures of Table E are interesting, as showing that up to the day of
work the body was steadily accumulating nitrogen, which was as
steadily given out in the period after the work ; it is perhaps a matter
of regret that the experiment was not prolonged for a few days, in
order to observe whether the ratio of the ingesta to the excreta would
have returned to that existing beiore the work.      It is worthy of remark
that though the exercise increased the discharge, the amount of nitro
gen retained in the body during the period after the work was greater
than before it.
    The average daily discharge by the faces was : first fonr days,
 2-48 grams    ; last five days, 2-15 grams, clearly pointing to increased
absorption by the intestines.
    The Phosphoric Acid. — Comparison of the ingesta and excreta shows
 an excess in the latter of 2-60 grams.        There can be,    I  think, but
little doubt that this was due to the diet before the experiment com
 menced, the difference in the P2Os of the ingesta and excreta for the
 first four days, i.e., the period before the work, being 272 grams, after
 the work the daily discharge was 3-84 grams, and the daily entry
 8 87 grams, or, allowing for error of experiment, practically the same,
 since it would appear from the consideration of the phosphoric acid,
 that the effect of the work was to regulate the daily discharge.
     The agreement of the figures may be accidental, but considering
  that they are the sum of a number of separate analyses, this can
  hardly   be the case, and this   I think tends to justify the distribution
  of the faeces according to the plan which 1 have adopted.
     The sulphuric acid was undoubtedly increased after the work to the
  extent of 0-24 gram per diem. The bulk of this excess was excreted
  on the day of work itself, as the following figures show : —

          H2SOi four days before work                      2-76 grams.

  that- is, an increase     on the day of work of 0-66 gram           above the
  average of the whole of the rest of the experiment.

     The Nitrogen. — The work produced a very obvious increase on the
 day on which it was done, which was continued and was even more
 marked on the day following ; the average daily discharge before the
 work was 15*22 grams, after the work 1 7-95 grams, despite this
 increased excretion.          The reserve at the end of the experiment was
 only T54 grams         less than on the day before the work ; in the previous
 experiment     the   diminution      in the reserve amounted to l-23 grams.
                               —
    The Phosphoric Acid. There was an excess of phosphoric anhydride
excreted over that ingested over the whole experiment amounting to
0-5 gram,      a quantity probably well within the errors of experiment ;
still it is worthy of remark that the difference during the first four
days amounted to 0-56 gram, which would seem to indicate the
previous diet as an explanation.
    The , Sulphur ic Acid. — As in             the first experiment there is an
undoubted increase after the work, the excess amounting to l-42 grams
over that which would have been excreted had the average of the first
four days been maintained.

                Experiment       III.      July 5th    to  July  17th.
   This was in reality two experiments in one, and must be considered
in two separate periods, viz., from Jnly 6th to July 12th inclusive, and
from July 6th to July 17th inclusive.
                                      1st  Period.
   The Nitrogen. — Again an unmistakable increase in the nitrogen
discharge is to be noticed.          The daily average after the work exceeds
the average before the work by l-26 grams; the reserve of nitrogen
was reduced from 1l-62 grams to 10-41 grams, a loss of T21 grams,
which was more than made up the next day. The close correspon
dence   with the diminution occurring in Experiments                         I and II  is
worthy of note.
   The Phosphoric Anhydride. — The increased discharge after the work
is very marked, but the total quantity ingested in the time is by no
means accounted for, as the following figures show                 : —

i.e., the work consumed V96 grams of the balance accumulated in tlie
three days which preceded it.
    The Sulphuric Acid. — A daily increase of 0-25 gram followed the
work. Reference to the tables shows that the daily increase was —

                                      2nd Period.
  The period " before the work " is in this case only one of com
parative rest, because it includes the work done on July 9th.
  The Nitrogen. — Despite the fact that July 9th was a day of exercise,
and     that   a   considerable        in the nitrogen discharge then
                                   increase
occurred, the daily difference between the nitrogen discharge before
the work of July 13th and that of the period after it is no less than .
5-68 grams, or a total excess on the average before the work of
22-72 grams, and this great increase notwithstanding comparison of
the ingesta and excreta from July 6th to July 16th, both inclusive,
shows a balance in favour of the ingesta of 6-30 grams.       The figures
of Table E indicate, however, that the drain on the store was hardly
over when the fast of July 17th began.                    I
                                               regret exceedingly that               I
did not continue the observations for three or four days before fast
ing, as it would have afforded an excellent opportunity for observing
the retention of nitrogen in the body, which seems to be the natural
consequence of a previous excessive discharge.      Even if we take the
day of fast into our calculations, it leaves only 3-93 grains of nitrogen
to be accounted for, which may, I think, be fairly disposed of as a
portion of a previously existing reserve.
   The Phosphoric Acid. — Over the whole period, July 6th to July 16th
inclusive, there is a balance of T24 grams not accounted for in the
excreta, and even       if we include the day of fast, the ingesta and excreta
practically exactly balance one another.   There                  is,
                                                     however, no doubt
whatever in this experiment, that the severe labour produced a very
marked increase in the phosphoric anhydride excreted, not only on
the day of work but for two or three days after.
   The sulphuric acid, like the phosphoric acid, was nearly doubled on
the day of work, and very markedly increased for the three succeeding
days.

                Experiment III, 1882.  July  6th   to  July   16th.
   Two work days were introduced into the experiment, with the
view of testing the effect of muscular labour upon the elimination of
nitrogen at a time when it might be supposed that the reserve of
nitrogen had been considerably drawn upon by previous exercise, anil
before there was time to accumulate a fresh store.

   I was prevented from observing my body-weight at the end of the
journey, as      I did not return to town the same evening, and a
weighing machine was not accessible.
   The loss of weight may, I think, be reckoned at about 4 lbs.,
considering the difference between the weight before starting and
the weight taken the next day.

   This journey was one of the greatest efforts             I  have ever made
in the course of these experiments.       The first 16 miles was covered
in 3 hours 10 minutes, during the greater part of which time it rained
heavily, and the roads were consequently in very bad condition. I
was excessively tired on my return, but by no means exhausted.           Food
and rest soon dissipated the effects of the walk, and the next morning
I was none the worse for the exertion, with the exception that I
was a little stiff, and suffered all day from intense thirst.           I may
here remark that on every occasion on which I have sustained con-

            Bodily Labour upon      the Discharge     of Nitrogen.          4yl
              Experiment,  February oth    to March 3rd,    1883.
    This experiment was conducted entirely for the purpose of deter
mining the amount of the nitrogenous reserve, of the existence of
which, in one sense or another, I now feel thoroughly assured.
    The plan adopted was, after having lived on the experimental diet
for some time, to abstain from food once or twice, in order to see
whether the amount of nitrogen discharged during a twenty-four
hours' fast was much influenced by the amount of food which had
been taken for some days previously.           I think I may say in start
ing, that the result was a negative one, that is to say, that the
amount discharged in a twenty-fonr hours' fast seems to be prac
tically a constant under ordinary circumstances.
    It further seemed to me probable, or at all events possible, that as
now nearly six years have elapsed since the original observations
were made which determined           my experimental        diet, I  might be
habitually taking more or less food per diem than I did six years ago.
    In order to test this, from February 6th to February 13th inclu
sive I collected my excreta, whilst living upon such a diet as I have
been accustomed to during that period, without any regard to experi
mental considerations.      I ate, drank, slept, and worked as though no
experiment were in progress, and in order to avoid any possible
influence which such observations might have had upon my mode of
       I
life, abstained from noticing the variations of body- weight, tempera
ture, nitrogen discharge, &c., as I have found that when I am obliged
to make such observations myself,       I  cannot avoid the effect of con
sideration of them upon my daily life. For instance, I feel quite
certain that had     I known that on any particular day the nitrogen
 discharge   was higher  or lower than   I  might have expected, the know
 ledge of it would unquestionably have affected the amount of food 1
should have taken on the following day.          This may seem a somewhat
extraordinary admission to make, but nevertheless I am convinced of
its truth. During the whole of this first period, therefore,              I was
careful not to inform myself of the results of the analyses.                 On
 February   14th  and  15th   I abstained   from  all  food   whatsoever.    On
 February 16th    I began the ordinary experimental diet, and continued
 it until February 26th. On February 27th          I again abstained from all
 food, returning on the 28th to my diet, which was continued until
 March 3rd. This experiment then naturally divides itself into two
 parts, the period of ordinary diet and the period of experimental
 diet, and we have to consider the effect of the fasting in each case.
    Inspection of the figures, particularly those which show the daily
 discharge of nitrogen by the urine, suffices to demonstrate the great
 similarity which exists between my ordinary food and my experi
 mental diet.
                                                                  2 K  i

   Imay incidentally remark that dnring these six years the variations
of my body- weight have been very insignificant, which is,           think,                           I
an additional proof that, at all events as far as food is concerned,   have                               I
lived, without knowing      almost according to rule, though
                                                 it,               will                                   it
appear in the sequel that my ordinary diet was in some respects rather
more generous than the experimental one.
  With this introduction we may proceed to discuss the analytical
details of the experiment.

                 Division   I.    February 5th        to February     15th.
    The nitrogen of the urine from February 5th to February 10th
inclusive, presents very little that is worthy of remark, unless it be
that the sixth and seventh were apparently days of small elimination,
the ninth and tenth          of moderate, and the eighth one of excessive
discharge.     The    daily average from February 5th to February 10th
inclusive was 14-94 grams; the averages of the experiments of 1882
wore as follows : —
                                     I. 15-03 grams.
                                    II. 14-62        „
                                  III.  14-58        „
giving an average for the three experiments of 14-74 grams, showing
I think that my assumption that the diet during the 1st division of
the 1883 experiments was very nearly the same as the special experi
mental diet, is justifiable.
    On February 11th, a day of fast, the discharge by the urine was
9- 63 grams, on February 14th 9 30 grams, on February 15th 9 26 grains,
on February 27th 8-66 grams ; also days of abstinence from food.

               Bodily Labour upon   the   Discharge      of Nitrogen.        499
    It
     is curious to observe how on these days of fast, despite different
circumstances,  and the fact that the fast of February 15th was pre
ceded by a fast on the previous day, how great is the similarity in
the daily discharge, for again on July 5th, 1882, a day of fast pre
vious to commencing an experiment, the discharge was 9-10 grams,
and on July 17th, at the conclusion of the same experiment, 9-46 grams
were discharged.
  This gives an average discharge on fast days of 9-23 grams of nitro
gen by the urine.
  Now turning to the table showing the daily balance of nitrogen in
the food «nd excreta, we find in the first part of this experiment that
assuming, as I have endeavoured to show we have some right to
assume, that the daily ingestion of nitrogen was practically the same
as during the experimental diet, it will be seen that I started with
a deficit of 0-69 gram, which became a balance of 3-0l grams on
February 10th. After considerable fluctuations on the 8th and 9th,
the fast of February 11th reduced the balance to a deficit of 8-37 grams,
that is to say, 1T38 grams were removed from the body, and it is a
very extraordinary fact, though I fear accident has something to do
with      that the total nitrogen discharged on February 11th by urine
         it,
and faeces amounted to 1T38 grams precisely.            Supposing this to be
a  fact, and not a  mere  coincidence,  the whole    of the  nitrogen excreted
on February 12th should be represented by the difference between
the supposed ingesta and this deficit of 1T38 grams, that               to say,
                                                                        is
6*26 grams       all that the body can afford
                 is                                 but this
                                                     ;          isnot the case.
 In this case as in other instances the deficit         not made up at once,
                                                         is
 but slowly     ;1*94 grams were retained         on February 12th, and
 l-85 grams on February 13th, thus reducing the deficit to 4-58 grams.
 On February 14th the fasting raised       itagain to 15-16 grams, and the
fast of February 15th to 24-42 grams, and this closes the first period.
    Whatever may be the value of calculations based on this hypothesis
of similarity of nitrogenous ingestion,          is,
                                                it       Ithink, only fair to
 assume that there was a deficit, put       even
                                           it     as  low   as 10 grams.    On
 February 15th      began the experimental diet, with the exception of
                    I
 so  much  as reduced  the daily ingestion of nitrogen to 17-05 grams, and
 despite the apparent needs of the body, out of 17-05 grams taken in,
 16-65 grams were discharged.        Again on February 17th the deficit
 reached its maximum of 25-l6 grams, gradually diminishing up to
 February 24th, when        itamounted to only 9-68 grams, whilst on
 February 25th the excretion was so small, that the deficit fell to
4-99 grams, to be increased on the following day to 5-29 grams.            The
 fast of February 27th brought        it  up to 13     95  grams,    which  was
 reduced on March 1st to 6-21 grams, rose again to 7-30 grams on the
 2nd, and fell to     50 grams on the 3rd, the concluding day of the
                        5
experiment.

  I may here remark that the total nitrogen value of the food omitted
on February 16th and 17th, and on March 2nd, was 8-60 grams ; exact
particulars are stated in the table already given. So that had the full
diet been taken on these days there would have been a balance of
3-1 grams   in the body, or rather it would have been possible. During
the whole of the latter part of this experiment, that is from Feb
ruary 10th onwards, my sensations were such as I have learned to
associate with the repair of waste, and it would have been exceedingly
interesting to have continued the experiment yet another ten or twelve
days, in order that I might have had the opportunity of investigating
the effect of muscular labour, or of starvation upon my body, at this
time presumably in a state of nitrogenous equilibrium.
   I do not feel justified in again subjecting myself to prolonged star
vation, that is to say starvation extending over four or five days ; but
I think that similar results can be obtained, as far as the nitrogen is
concerned, by mere twenty-four hours' abstinence from food, provided
that the discharge of nitrogen has been observed for a sufficiently
long time previously, and has been so regulated that we can with
some degree of certainty assume that there is a deficiency of this
readily dischargeable nitrogen in the body. That there would be a
considerable discharge of nitrogen there can be no doubt, but the
source of it could hardly be the same as in the well- or I might say
over-fed body.
   It   is,
        Ithink, a somewhat extraordinary fact that, on the assump
tion we have made that the nitrogenous value of the diet from
February 5th to February 15th was about the same as the expe
rimental diet, with a deficit of 15-16 grams, a further starvation
of twenty-fonr hours should have produced almost identically the
same result as     day's starvation, taken haphazard on the day on
                          a

condition,   and I shall not be satisfied that this is not the case nntil  I
have examined the effect of     living for several days on a diet whoso
daily nitrogenous    value   shall be only 9 grams, the other consti
tuents remaining as far as possible the same.       I should expect to find
that twenty-four hours' starvation would result in a discharge of a
smaller quantity of nitrogen, say 5 grams, which might be found
to be tolerably constant under similar conditions.         When this had
been determined, two or three days of a non-nitrogenous diet would
probably suffice to indicate approximately the daily nitrogenous
waste of the body from other sources than food.        We have no infor
mation of any importance as to the minimum of nitrogen required by
the body daily in order to maintain it in health, and I feel sure that
experiments on the plan indicated would throw considerable light on
the subject.
                                 Conclusion.
    The results which have been now put on record, whilst they con
firm the conclusions of Dr. Parkes, show that the disturbance pro
duced by very severe labour is much more immediate and of much
greater intensity than that which Dr. Parkes observed, the expla
nation obviously being that in his experiments the exertion imposed
on the soldiers who were made the subjects was inadequate.
    It has been further shown that, just as in Dr. Parkes' experiment
on the effect of privation of nitrogenous food, the diminution of the
nitrogen stored in the system was followed by retention, i.e., by a
state of things in which the intake was greater than the output; so
after the disturbance of the nutrition of the body, which is produced
by severe labour, the immediate effect of which is obviously to dimi
nish the store of nitrogenous material in the system, there follows a
corresponding diminution of discharge, so that the result is the
 same, namely, that in Dr. Parkes' words,
                                                " an insufficient supply at
 one time must be subsequently compensated," whether the insuf
ficiency be due either to privation or to exercise.
    A third result of importance is this : that this storage of nitrogen
 is the expression of a tendency of the organism to economise its
 resources, which is much more constantly operative than has hitherto
 been supposed.
    Thus it appears that whenever the subject of experiment was put
 upon the regulated experimental diet, without the imposition of more
 exercise than belongs to an ordinary active life, accumulation took place
 even when the daily supply of nitrogen did not exceed 17'6 grams,
 an amount which cannot be regarded as more than adequate to the
 normal requirements of the organism.             This tendency to store
 nitrogen is therefore a normal endowment of the living body, and,
 if so, the " retention" which follows starvation or exercise must be

502      Influence  of Labour   upon the Discharge    of Nitrogen.
regarded as a mere exaggeration of this tendency, and not as a new
process which is set up in the living tissue to compensate for a pre
vious disturbance.
   In this, as in other respects, it is obvious that the knowledge which
has been gained is only partial.
   If, with a nitrogenous income of 17-6 grams per diem, accumu
lation takes place under normal conditions of life, the minimum
adequate supply of nitrogen must be below this. We have no means
of stating at present what this adequate supply is, but we have
reason to believe that it would be found to differ materially in dif
ferent individuals, and in the same individual in different states of
health.     If we could ascertain to what point the supply of nitrogen
in any individual could be diminished, without drawing upon hiH
store of nitrogenous material, we should have in this result a perfectly
reliable chemical criterion of what may be termed nutritive vigour.
   No attempt has hitherto been made to carry out such observations
on the human subject, nor do any experimental            data exist which
would justify even a guess at what the results of a properly conducted
investigation would be.
   What is first required is to ascertain for how long and in what
quantity nitrogen continues to be stored on the diet already men
tioned, the period of observation to be at least a fortnight.         This
having been accomplished, the         next  step would be to repeat the
observation with diets containing less nitrogen than the amount
above stated, but otherwise similar to it.
    We should then be in a position to inquire how far the increase of
nitrogenous output, which has been shown to be the immediate
 result of labour, is dependent on previous storage, and whether, in
conditions of nutrition which involve absence of storage, the effect
of severe labour manifests itself in an increased discharge, and finally
whether in this case such work can be undergone without producing
other disturbances.
    A collateral inquiry, which is scarcely less necessary than that
 which has just been indicated, must as soon as possible be under
taken as to the effect of varying the relation between the time at
 which food is taken and that at which the work is done.
    It has not yet been possible to attempt to enter on this inquiry,
 which obviously could not be combined with any other. Its import
 ance lies in this, that it would, if successful, afford information as
 to the question whether or not the organism is capable of at once
 applying the nitrogenous material of food to meet increased expen
 diture determined by work.
    In the investigations hitherto conducted by me the work done has
 consisted exclusively of walking.       At a future period  I hope to sub-
 stitute other methods of labour, the employment of which will render

ft   possible to vary, as may be expedient, not merely the amount of
work done per diem, but the distribution of the work in time. In the
realisation of this purpose       I anticipate great advantage from the use
of the work machine, which             I have been able to construct for the
purpose of my inquiry by the liberality of the British Association.
    In  conclusion,   I would   draw attention to the results relating to the
influence    of work on the discharge of phosphates and sulphates by
the urine.
   As regards phosphates, it has been shown that no increase occurs
unless the exertion is very severe. As regards sulphates, it mani
fests itself distinctly in many cases, the output of sulphates being in
general terms proportional to that of nitrogenous material.
   It is a matter of regret that the total sulphur of the food was not
estimated.      It is known that the percentage of sulphates contained
in the food was insignificant as compared with that excreted in the
nrine, and consequently almost all of the discharge must have been a
product of oxidation.
    I  beg, in conclusion, to state that the expenses of the present
research, which have been extremely heavy, have been defrayed by a
grant of the British Medical Association.                   I desire to express to
the Association my most grateful            thanks.

comparison of the two tables shows, that with the exception of plati

and nickel are very conspicuous, the former at the top and the latter
at the bottom of both lists.
    Mr. Shelford Bidwell has also brought forward* very strong1 evi
dence in favour of his assertion, that the " Hall effect " can be ex
plained by the joint action of mechanical strain and certain

a matter     of considerable interest to ascertain whether cobalt would
act like iron or nickel as far as the effect of stress on the electrical
resistance is concerned, and I endeavoured — for some time in vain —
to obtain either wires or strips of cobalt suitable for the purpose in
view. At length, through the courtesy of Mr. Wiggin, jun., Birming

I was able to make the necessary experiments.

   t  Mr. Wiggin informed    me that he found it impossible to draw wires of cobalt,
as the  metal was so hard that it destroyed the tools with which it was brought into
i-ontacl. Messrs. Johnson and Matthey were also good enough to attempt to draw
for me wires of cobalt, but they too failed through a like cause.

    The density of the metal was determined by means of a specific
gravity flask, some pieces having been previously broken off for the
purpose, and was found to be S-231 at a temperature of 16° C. The
same pieces were well annealed, and the density at 16° C. was then
found to be 8-259. The mean section as determined from the mass of
the strip 29-65 grams, the length, and the density, was for the unan-
nealed metal 0-06168 square centimetre, and this value, agreeing as
it did fairly with that got by gauging, was assumed to be correct.
    The modulus of longitudinal elasticity was determined by holding
the strip in the centre and rubbing it along its length with a resined
glove.     The note obtained was very high in pitch, but the results of
the measurements        of the number of vibrations         obtained by the use of
the syren agreed very well with each other.*
                                   Experiment    I.
    The lower double octave obtained by rubbing the strip longitudi
nally was taken on a monochord ; the syren was then raised to the
pitch of the monochord, and the number of vibrations counted for
two minutes at a time.

    In this experiment the monochord was retuned twice, and it will be
 observed that the mean value does not differ from any of those forming
 it by so much as 0-15 percent. From these last observations the value
 of " Young's modulus " for the unannealed cobalt was ascertained to be
 2005 X 108 grams per square centimetre.               The same strip was then
 well annealed, and three results, equally as concordant as the last,
 were obtained when the strip was thrown into longitudinal vibrations.
 The value of " Young's modulus
                                         " of the metal in the annealed con
 dition was 1817 X 10s grams per square centimetre.

 dit ion, passing through two apertures in a table, were secured at their
 upper extremities to two clamps, A, and the lower extremity of the
 one to be stretched was fastened to the clamp B, over which passed
 the double     hook S, connected with a stout lever of hard wood. A
 scale-pan weighing 2 kilos. was suspended at the end of the lever,
 and by loading and unloading this very carefully the strip was sub
jected to any required alteration of stress. Short pieces of insulated
copper wire were soldered to each strip at D, and the junction, C, of
these pieces was united with one terminal of the galvanometer.          Two
other pairs of similar wires were soldered at K, and one of each pair
was connected      as usual with resistance coils, and the other with one
pole   of a single Leclanche  cell. The two sets of resistance coils, which
in this case were about 10 ohms each, were united by a platinum-
iridinm wire traversed by a sliding-piece connected with the other
terminal of the galvanometer.          The mode of experimenting was pre
cisely the same, and the same      precautions were taken as in the earlier
experiments.*
    When the strip had been sufficiently tested in the unannealed con
dition it was well annealed, and in this new condition again experi
mented on ; but whereas before the stress used was not sufficient to
cause any permanent elongation, the strip was now permanently
lengthened and the permanent alteration of resistance thus caused
was measured as well as the temporary alteration.             The following
experiment was made on the annealed metal when stressed for the first
time after the annealing.

   In this experiment the numbers given for the load represent the
number of kilograms on the end of the lever,* and, when multiplied by
4908, will represent the actual stress on the strip. After a rest of two
days with all the stress off, except that produced by the weight of the
lever itself, t the resistance had decreased, so that the sliding-piece
had to be shifted from 41 divisions to the right of the zero-point to
45   to  the left, or through 86 divisions ; so that the total permanent
increase     of resistance was now represented by 87 divisions instead of
 173 divisions.          The strip was now tested again with the following

                       Remarks on Experiments            II and  III.
   From the third column of Experiment                  II  may be gathered that the
resistance of the cobalt decreases up to a certain degree of loading, and
then begins to increase.             The maximum decrease becomes less and
less, at first rapidly, and then more slowly as the permanent strain
due to the loading becomes greater and greater until a load of 18
kilos.* had been employed.                  The point of loading at which the
maximum decrease occurs becomes higher and higher, gradually
increasing from 8 kilos. to about 13 kilos.
         * This   does not include the stress due to the weight of the lever.

510                  Mr. H. Tomlinson.         The Influence      of
    The sixth column shows that the temporary alteration of resistance
is of the nature of a decrease, but the decrease becomes less and less
as the permanent strain increases, at first rapidly, and afterwards
more slowly, until the load of 18 kilos. has produced its permanent
effect. Moreover, we learn from this column that when a load of
12 kilos. had been employed the temporary effect per kilogram is
always greater for the highest load than for the smaller ones, so that
for the loads 16, 18, and 20 kilos., when employed for the first time, we
get about twice the temporary decrease per kilogram which is obtained
 with the loads 2 and 4 kilos. Experiment III, however, teaches us
that ultimately, when all the loads have been applied a great number
of times, the temporary decrease is exactly proportional to the load in the
case of the loads 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 kilos., nor is there any sign, as
 was the case with nickel, that the decrease of resistance           would
 ultimately be changed to increase when the stress was increased
beyond a certain limit.        The greatest total stress on the strip,
including that caused by the weight of the lever itself, was 1860 kilos.
per square centimetre, whereas with nickel the point of loading where
the above-mentioned limit was reached, was about 1500 kilos. per
square centimetre.* It would seem probable that there is a limiting
 stress beyond which, as in nickel, the resistance begins to increa'e
 with the load, but it is evident from what has been said that this
 limiting stress is much higher for cobalt than nickel.
    From the last values recorded in the sixth column of Experiment
III   it was calculated that the decrease of resistance per unit produced
 by a stress of 1 gram per square centimetre at the temperature
 of 16° C. is 386 8 X 10-12. The ratio of the decrease of resistance
 per unit to the increase of length per unitf is 0'703, and, if we
  assume the ratio of lateral contraction to linear elongation to be
 0'250, the ratio of the decrease of specific resistance per unit to the
 increase of length per unit of the stress is 2-203. All the values
 just given are much less than the corresponding ones in the case of
 nickel.
    With the cobalt in the unannealed state temporary traction also
  produced decrease of resistance, but, as might be expected from what
  has been said above with reference to the effect of permanent strain,
  the amount of decrease per unit was less than with the annealed
  metal. J  The decrease of resistance per unit produced by a stress of

1    gram per square centimetre            was for the unannealed cobalt
242 -3 x 10-12.       The ratio of the decrease of resistance per unit to
the increase of length per unit is 0-486, and the corresponding ratio
in the case of specific resistance is 1-986.
    Not only is cobalt remarkable for having, like nickel, its resistance
decreased by longitudinal traction, in spite of the increase of length
and diminution of section which is caused by the stress, but it also
presents a peculiarity not seen in nickel or indeed in any of the
other metals hitherto examined, namely, the extreme persistence with
which the same load when applied again and again continues to
produce permanent increase of resistance.             With few metals is this
persistence anything like so noticeable with such stresses per square
centimetre as have been here employed, for we may observe from the
last two experiments that though a load of 22 kilos. had been twice
used on the lever, and afterwards a long rest given to the strip,
20 kilos., after having been put on and taken off fifteen times, still
continued to produce          permanent      increase of resistance.*         Even
16 kilos. continued to produce a permanent effect, so that it would be
only after a very large number of loadings and nnloadings that the
increase of resistance on taking off the load would be equal to the
decrease of resistance on putting on the load. The permanent
increase of resistance caused by the above-mentioned loads also was
greater the longer the time during which the stress was maintained.1)-
      The Effect of Permanent Longitudinal Extension           on the Specific
                               Resistance of Cobalt.
    We have seen that cobalt behaves like nickel as far as the effect on
the specific resistance of temporary longitudinal stress is concerned,
and that both iron and nickelJ are decreased in specific resistance by
moderate longitudinal strain.          This it appears is the case with cobalt
also.    The distance between the points where the copper wires at the
upper and lower extremities             of the cobalt strip were soldered,
was before stretching 49-8 cm. and after the stretching 50 cm.
The specific resistance before the stretching was 2289 X 10-8, and
after the stretching 2231 X 10-s, so that there was a decrease of
specific resistance of 2-6 per cent. for a permanent lengthening of
1*8 per cent.       The permanent decrease of specific resistance per unit
divided by the permanent increase of length per unit, is for iron
0-02, for cobalt 1*44, and for nickel 2 37 ; so that the permanent
  * This was afterwards found to be the case when the same load had been put on
and taken off some fifteen times more.
   t This " running down " is also explained with other metals, but not to the same
extent, as regards persistency with such comparatively small stresses per square
centimetre.

512                 Mr. H. Tomlinson.          The Influence     of
decrease of specific resistance as well as the temporary                decrease    is
greater with nickel than with cobalt.
 The Effect of Longitudinal Traction and of Longitudinal Magnetisation
                    on the Thermo-electric Properties of Cobalt.
     It will  be seen   that contrary to the expectation of myself, who had
 regard to the relationship which apparently exists between the
 " rotational coefficient " of Hall and the alteration of specific resis
 tance cansed by traction, cobalt behaves like nickel and not like iron.
 I now, therefore, turned to examine the effect of traction on the
 thermo-electric properties of the metal, for the purpose of ascer
 taining whether the strip would act in respect to these properties
 like iron or nickel. According to Bidwell* cobalt acts like iron, but
 it appears that this experimenter did not subject his bar of cobalt to
 traction but to torsion, and finding that copper under torsion behaved
 similarly to copper under longitudinal traction, assumed that cobalt
 would do so likewise. The above-mentioned assumption is hardly,                      I
 think, justifiable, and the following experiments show that cobalt is
 altered by traction in a manner similar to nickel, provided the metals
 are not at the same time under the influence of any magnet ising stress.
                                      Experiment  IV.
      The two strips of cobalt in the unannealed condition were clamped
  together at their centres, the clamp projecting to a distance of about
  3 inches from and at right angles to the strips.                One of the strips
  could be stretched as before by means of the lever, and insulated
  copper wire soldered near the lower extremities of the two strips
  served to connect them with the galvanometer.                The clamp was then
  heated at the extremity furthest away from the strips, and the heat
  conducted along the clamp to the strips was such that in a short time
  a temperature, as judged roughly by the touch of about 60° C, was
  attained, stress of moderate amount was then put upon the lever, and
  this caused a current from stretched to unstretched through the
   heated junction : consequently stretched cobalt is thermo-electrically
  positive to unstretched cobalt.        As soon as the needle of the galvano
   meter was fairly steady, the stress was removed and a deflection in
   the opposite direction ensued.            The temporary stretching and un-
   stretching were repeated several times, but always with the same
   result as regards the direction of the deflection.               The unannealed
   cobalt therefore under mechanical stress behaves thermo-electrically
   like nickel.f

      t In this experiment the strips were under the influence of the eaith's vertical
   magnetic stress, but this last is so much smaller than that due to the helix, that  I
   have not deemed it necessary to take it into account.

                                    Experiment V.
    The strips were now dismounted and the same one as had been
used before was placed iu the axis of a magnetising helix,* especially
designed to prevent the heat of the helix from reaching the metal to
be magnetised.         The two ends of the strip, which projected about
8 inches from either end of the helix, were connected with the galvano
meter, and the clarup before used was now at one end of the helix and
just outside. The temperature was raised to about 60° C, and as
Boon as the galvanometer needle had become fairly steady the helix
was excited by a single Leclanche cell.f A deflection of the galvano
meter needle at once indicated a current from unmagnetised cobalt to
magnetised cobalt through the hot junction, and proved that longi
tudinally magnetised cobalt is negative to unmagnetised cobalt.                        The
unannealed      cobalt,   therefore,    under magnetic stress, behaves thermo-
electrically in a manner similar to iron. The helix in this experi
ment was too far from the galvanometer to affect the latter directly,
and a reversal of the magnetising current produced a thermo-electric
 current in the same direction as before.               The magnetising force was
 in this case equal to 4w X 90-6 X 0-478 X C in absolute units, where C
expresses the magnetising current in absolute units.                       The electro
 motive force of the cell waa 1*5 volts very nearly, and the resistance

    This last result has an important bearing on the question whether
 Bidwell's explanation of Hall's phenomenon is correct, because,
 though unmagnetised cobalt is certainly rendered thermo-electrically
 positive by longitudinal mechanical stress, the case may be different
 when the metal is magnetised, as in Hall's experiment.}
    Nor indeed would it be safe to assume, without further experiment,
 that mechanical stress will produce the same effect either in nature
or amount on the electrical resistance§ or on the thermo-electric pro
perties of magnetised iron, nickel, and cobalt, as it does on the same
metals when not under the influence of magnetic stress.

the thermo-electric properties of the metal.            The heating was, how
ever, in this case accomplished by means of an air-chamber, consist
 ing of two concentric brass cylinders with a layer of water between
 them.     The strips were placed, clamped together at their centres, in
 the axis of the chamber, the two extremities of each projecting about
 8 inches from either end of the chamber ; a thermometer was also
 placed with its bulb in the centre of the latter, and the temperature
 in the first instance       raised to 100° C.       When the needle of the
 galvanometer was at rest, a load of 8 kilos. was put on the lever, and
 after a space of 2 minutes had elapsed a deflection of three divisions
 of the scale resulted.       This deflection again showed the stressed metal
 to he positive      to the unstretched, and on the removal of the load the
 needle came back again to nearly its old position.            Trials were made
 with several loads from 2 to 8 kilos., and always with the same result
 as regards the nature       of the effect ; the mean value of the deflection
 per kilo. being as nearly as could be judged 0-375 division of the
 scale.     The electromotive force developed by the highest load was
 found to be 0-429 microvolt, and the electromotive force which would
 be produced by a stress of 1 gram per square centimetre would be
 659 x 10-9 microvolts, the temperature of one junction being at 100° C.
 and of the other about 16° C.           The chamber was next permitted to
 cool down, first to 60° C, and afterwards to 42° C, and at both these
 temperatures the effect of the stress was found to be in the same
direction as before, and though no attempt was made to measure the
actual deflection, this was evidently diminished with the temperature.
    Finally, it should be added that both in this experiment and in the
two previous ones, the extremities of the strips and the clamps at the
ends of the stressed strip were all well shielded from the source of
heat.     It would seem then that we have good reason for concluding
that for any temperature between 16° C. and 100° C, cobalt, whether
 in the annealed or unannealed condition, is rendered by traction
 thermo-electrically positive to unstretched cobalt.*

specific resistance of hard piano-steel wire is temporarily diminished
by very considerable longitudinal traction,                    I arranged a pair of hard

already mention has been made, and proceeded to test one of them in

increase the specific resistance, excessive stress would diminish it.

    It   will  be seen    that the increase of resistance produced by the load
ing is proportional to the load throughout. The diameter of the wire
was 0-08246 cm., and the greatest total load on the wire was equal to
102 kilos., or 2 cwts.            The greatest stress per square centimetre was
above 19,000 kilos., and only a little short of the breaking stress.
From the above results was deduced that the increase of resistance
per unit produced by a stress of 1 gram per square centimetre, was
1620 X 10-12, and this number so nearly agrees with those obtained for
the previously used specimens of piano-steel, that it was not con
sidered necessary to determine the value of " Young's modulus
                                                                                        "

of the simple rigidity, in order to prove that, as in soft iron, the
specific resistance is increased, not only when moderate stresses are
employed but also for stresses close to the breaking load.\ This last
experiment, however, confirms the fact mentioned in an earlier paper,                       J
that the electrical resistance of steel is less increased than that of
iron, not only per gram stress on the square centimetre, but also per
 unit increase of length.
    * This is the load due to the weight of the lever itself.
    t I afterwards found that Mr. Johnson must have miscalculated the nmount of
temporary lengthening produced by the load used by him, as he gives it as 3 per
 cent., though the wire was not loaded beyond the limits of elasticity. This last ia
 an   impossible   result, as the greatest tensile strength of any piano-wire does not
admit of a temporary elongation of more than l-6 per cent. without breaking.

    Cobalt and nickel have been found to decrease in resistance when
subjected to moderate longitudinal traction, nor does it appear* that
this abnormal behaviour is in any way connected with the magnetic
properties of these metals.       Nevertheless, it seemed desirable to find,
if possible, some metal which, possessiug much feebler magnetic pro
perties, would exhibit similar conduct.               Now, judging from the
apparent relationship between the alteration of specific resistance
produced by traction and the

    " Young's modulus " was, in the first instance, determined by the
 method of longitudinal vibrations, a length of 550 cm. being under
examination. The wire was stretched on a long wooden box, and
precautions taken which will be fully described in a future com
 munication to the Society, to avoid certain sources of error iucidental
 to this method.     The results obtained with the syren were quite as
accordant with each other as those got with the cobalt strip, and
 from these and the value of the density obtained in the manner pre
sently to be described, was deduced a value of " Youngs modulus
                                                                          " of
 437-3 X   106 grams per square centimetre.
    The simple rigidity of the wire was determined by the method of
 torsional vibrations in the manner described in a former portion of
 this memoir,f and proved to be 172-3 X 106 grams per square centi
 metre.
     Some little difficulty was experienced in finding the density of the
 magnesium, as when the wire was immersed in water a very large
 number of minute bubbles of gas — evidently a consequence of chemi
cal action — made the apparent mass in water from 10 to 20 per cent,
 less than it ought to have been.            Most of these bubbles could be
 shaken off by merely moving the wire twice or thrice backwards and
 forwards through the water, but in a very few seconds they collected
 again and rendered it evident that no reliable determination of the
 density could be obtained in this way.          As there was not at hand any
 liquid which might be suitably used in place of the water, the density
  was ascertained from the length, diameter, and mass of three separate
 lengths of the wire.     The diameter of each of these pieces was mea-

    The probable error in the determination of the density in this way
 would therefore appear to be 0-2 per cent. But values of " Young's
              "
modulus obtained by the method of longitudinal vibrations are apt
to be slightly too high in the case of wires in consequence of slight
yielding of the supports at either end of the wire.* It was therefore
deemed advisable to employ also the static method, and accordingly a
pair of wires were suspended and examined in the manner already
described in Part           I  of this memoir, and with the same precautions to
                         " Young's modulus "
avoid error.         f                                as thus      obtained   proved to be
424-3 X 10* grams per square centimetre.                     It was impossible, however,
in this instance to have any but a comparatively small load perma
nently on the wire, and in such a case the result is apt to be too low
to a slight extent. We may,                I  think, then, find a very near approach
to the true value by taking the mean between the valnes got by the
two methods : this mean is 430'8 + 108 grams per square centimetre,
and is,    I  should say, certainly less than 1 per cent. in error.
    From "Young's modulus" and the simple rigidity the ratio of
lateral contraction to longitudinal extension can be calculated ; this
ratio would be —

where e, is the bulk-modulus and C, the mean thermal capacity per
unit volume between 0° C. and 100° C. According to Regnault the
thermal capacity per unit mass is 0'2499, and according to Kopp it is
0-245.f The mean of these two numbers is 0-2480, and the thermal
capacity per unit volume is therefore 0-2480 x 1-743, or 0-4323. From
the above formula, therefore, we obtain —

so much as 2 per cent., and            considering the difficulties which are in
the way of getting correct values of the bulk-modulus, we may regard
the agreement of the observed and calculated values of e, as suffi

      The wire completely recovered itself when each of the temporary
 loads was removed, and yet it will be noticed that the alteration of
 resistance per kilo.f varies largely with the load, so much so, indeed,
  that with a temporary load of 2 kilos. the temporary alteration per
  kilo., which is of the nature of increase on loading, was nearly double
 that when only £ kilo. was employed for the temporary load.                          This
 marked increase of alteration of resistance per kilo. with the increase
 of the temporary load does not depend upon the amount of permanent
 stress, as we obtain the same alteration for                   J  kilo. when the per
 manent load is ^ kilo. as we do when the permanent load is 2 kilos.,
 but at the same time it should be observed that with the permanent
 load of 2 kilos. the first effect both of loading and unloading with
                                          J
    kilo. was considerably greater than that which took place after three
 loadings and unloadings with the ^ kilo.§                    The results given above
 undoubtedly point to imperfect elasticity due to the rotation of the
molecules about their axes, for though the wire recovered its original
resistance on the removal of the load, this is evidently due to the
slight shock caused by unloading. ||

     The numbers given in the third column are the means of several
 trials and, with the exception of the last two, require a slight correc
 tion, inasmuch as it was evidently impossible with such a small per
 manent load as £ kilo. to obtain a sufficiently straight wire.*                           The
 correction, however, can be easily applied, for we see that when the
 permanent load is equal to 1^ kilos. a temporary load of § kilo.
 produces precisely the same temporary elongation as when the per
 manent load is 2£ kilos., or, in other words, l£ kilos. must have
 sufficed to make the wire straight. Thus with a permanent load
 of £ kilo. the apparent increase of length caused by the mere
 straightening of the wire is 2'70— 2-37, or 0-43 when £ kilo. is the
 temporary load, and will be 0'43 + 2'53 — 2-37, or 0'59 when the tem
 porary load is either 1 kilo. or greater than 1 kilo. Making the above
 corrections,      and placing side by side the alteration of length and the
 alteration of resistance produced by each additional 5 kilo., we obtain

 the temporary alteration of length increases in greater proportion than

   It has been proved that longitudinal traction on the whole causes
increase of resistance, but this increase is less than can be accounted
for by mere change of dimensions, provided that the temporary stress
used be sufficiently small.       In the present instance      it may be assumed
that for any temporary stress not exceeding              i  kilo. we shall barely
enter into the region where " Hooke's law

and that up this limit of loading the increase of resistance and of
length will, within the limits of errors of observation, be proportional
to the load, since, were it otherwise, there could not be the accordance
which there is between the value of " Young's modulus
                                                                      " as deter
mined by the statical and dynamical methods-!                   H' then, we take
4*4 divisions of the platinum-iridium wire to represent the temporary
increase of resistance produced by a load of £ kilo., we gather that
the increase of resistance due to a stress of 1 gram per square centi
metre is 1841 x 10-12 per unit.               In calculating the alteration of
resistance per unit, resulting from increase of length, we must take
the value of " Young's modulus
                                          "
                                               obtained by using the statical
method, for the alteration of resistance is necessarily determined by
this method. If we do so we find that the ratio of the increase of
resistance per unit to the increase of length per unit is 0-7813. The
mere change of dimensions, however, would cause an increase of
resistance of 1 + 25, where 0 is the ratio of lateral contraction to
longitudinal extension, and may be taken as equal to 0-2501 ; so that
on the whole we have a decrease of the specific resistance per unit,
equal to 1-5002— 0-7813, or 0 7189. With aluminium also it has been
shownf that there is a decrease of specific resistance per unit; but
this is of small amount, namely, 0-420 for the unannealed, and 0-262
for the annealed metal. We may say, then, that though magnesium
does not agree with nickel and cobalt in having its resistance
decreased — in spite of change of dimensions — it does agree with
these metals and with aluminium in having its specific resistance
decreased by longitudinal traction of small amount.
    The question next arises, shall we, passing the limit of temporary
stress up to which " Hooke's law holds good, eventually find the

with the load much more largely than the alteration of length : this

    It would appear, then, at first sight, that magnesium and nickel
behave in a somewhat similar manner as regards the effect of stress
on their specific electrical resistance, for with nickel the decrease of
resistance is changed to increase when the stress has passed a certain
limit.     Closer examination, however, does not justify this view, for
with nickel the change from decrease to increase is conditioned by the
amount of the permanent load, so that if say 6 kilos. be the limiting
 stress, and we maintain this stress permanently, an additional kilo.
 will always produce increase of resistance, though this load of 1 kilo.
 be taken off and put on any number of times, whilst with magnesium,
 if we regard 2 kilos. as the limiting stress, and allow this load to
 remain on, an additional               kilo. will only produce a temporary
 increase or a temporary decrease of specific resistance when put on and
 taken off respectively for the first time.

 into a coil suitable for finding the density in the ordinary way, the
 latter was calculated from the mass, length, and diameter. The length

    From these data was deduced a density at 16° C. of 21'523, which
value, considering the drawing to which the metal had been subjected,
 agrees very well with that calculated from the above analysis.
    The value of " Young's modulus

static method in my usual way, and proved to be 2089 x 108 grams
 per square centimetre, and though the length of the wire operated
 upon was inconveniently small, the different trials agree very well
 with each other. The modulus was next determined by the method of
 longitudinal vibrations, the wire, which was sufficiently stout and rigid

rubbed with a resined glove.         When rubbed, the wire yielded some
times one note, and sometimes another about a semitone lower in
pitch. Both these notes were fairly clear, and from the higher of the
two a value for the modulus was deduced of 2276 X 106 grams per
square centimetre, whilst from the lower was obtained a value which
within the limits of error of observation was exactly equal to that
got by the static method ; so that we may regard 2089 X 106 grams
per square centimetre as representing with fair accuracy* the value of
" Young's modulus."
    There was no difficulty in finding the value of the simple rigidity in
the usual way, and this proved to be 724-8 X 10" grams per square
centimetre.     From the above data the ratio of lateral contraction
to longitudinal extension was calculated to be 0-441. The values of
" Young's modulus " and of the simple rigidity are both high, and it
is very remarkable that the 10 per cent. of iridium added to the
platinum should have raised the former value more than 40 per
cent.

                                Experiment    X.
    We will now turn to the experiments on the alteration of resistance
produced by longitudinal traction experiments, which it will be seen
resulted in a complete surprise in more ways than one.                 In the first
trials the wire was arranged in exactly the same manner as the steel
and magnesium wires had been, and the lever used for applying the
stress, but a German-silver wire was employed as the comparison-
wire.    With only a permanent stress, due to the weight of the lever,
2 kilos. put on or taken off the lever caused an alteration of resist
ance which required to be balanced by moving the sliding-piece
54-5 divisions, and when there was a permanent stress equivalent in
all to 3 kilos. on the end of the lever, an additional kilo. on or off
caused an alteration represented by 27-0 divisions, or almost exactly
 half the number of divisions which were required with twice the
temporary load. Hence it was calculated that a stress of 1 gram per
 square centimetre produced an increase of resistance per unit of
 3049 X 10-12. The increase of resistance per unit divided by increase
 of length per unit was 6-368, and the increase of specific resistance
 per unit was 4-486. These results were very unexpected, inasmuch as
 all the other alloys which have been examined, namely, brass, German-
 silver, and platinum-silver are altered by stress in their electrical
 resistance far less than the pure metals of which they are composed,

 whereas here the increase of specific resistance produced by traction
 is nearly three times as great as with iron, which heads the list of
those metals which show increase of resistance on loading.
                                  Experiment  XI.
    Under the above-mentioned circumstances, it was deemed to be
advisable to test the platinum-iridium in another manner.              In this
case, instead of using German-silver as the comparison-wire, the
following arrangement was made : —
    To the centre of the wire was firmly fixed a brass clamp, which
rested on a stout table, and was connected with one terminal of the
galvanometer, the other terminal being as usual connected with the
sliding-piece. The lower half of the wire, which passed through a
small hole in the table, was stretched by means of the lever, whilst
the upper half remained unstretched.           Near the extremities of both
halves were fixed other clamps, provided with terminal screws, which
in each case were united as usual with one pole of a battery, and with
a set of resistance coils joined to each other by the platinum-iridium
wire traversed by the sliding-piece. With this arrangement it will be
seen that the upper half of the wire served as a comparison-wire to
the lower half. The results of this experiment were in fair accord
ance with those of the previous one, and still showed platinum-
iridium to be considerably more increased in resistance by traction
than any of the other metals.
                                Experiment    XII.
   In order     to remove any further doubt about clamping not being
sufficient to make proper connexion between the various parts of the
"bridge," a third experiment was tried, in which the platinum-
iridium wire, with a German-silver wire as a comparison-wire, were
arranged     as   in Experiment X, but now all connexions with the wire
to be stretched were well soldered, and a long series of trials, extend
ing over three days, was made with a view to not only confirm the
results of Experiments X and XI, but also to bring out any fresh
peculiarities which might exist.        Tho main points to which it is well
to call  attention    are shown  in the last two series of trials given below,
in which the permanent stress was that due to the weight of the
lever itself.
   It is noteworthy here that the resistance at first increases in greater
proportion than the load, but when a certain limit of stress has been
reached the ratio of the increase of resistance to the load producing it
begins to diminish, until finally the last kilogram only produces the
same alteration of resistance as the first.         A similar state of things
was perceived with wires made of other metals in the experiments

described in the previous portions of this memoir,* and, moreover,
there is a like change in the elasticity,! but with platinum-iridium
the effect, as far as alteration of the resistance is concerned, is more
marked than is the case with other metals.                  Equally noteworthy is it
that at the third kilogram there is a sudden increase in the tem
porary alteration of resistance produced by the load, and a like
phenomenon is plainly discernible in the above-mentioned previou-
experiments.           Moreover, the stress which produces this sudden
increase is certainly not far from the stress which produces the first
sudden leap in the value of the ratio of the permanent alteration of
resistance to the load, when the annealed wire is stretched for th-
first time ;% nay, more, a careful examination of Experiment VII§
shows undoubted evidence of the existence of the same number of
critical points where temporarij alteration is concerned, as there are
 in the case of permanent extension.
     Finally, it must be added, that if we take the mean effect produced
 by all the loads on the resistance of the wire, we obtain an increase of
 resistance which is exactly equal to that already recorded in Experi
 ment X, and therefore we must regard the comparatively large
 increase of resistance of platinum-iridium caused by traction as a
  well-established fact.||

  secutive loads of 2 kilos, each, this can be plainly discerned,

  Experiment XXIII, it should be remarked that more recent observations have shown
  that there is a critical point at the third kilogram (fifth kilogram if we include the
  weight of the scale-pan itself), and that here therefore we must look for the first
  critical point and not at the eighth kilogram (tenth kilogram including the weight
  of the scale-pan), where is the second critical point.

              Stress and    Strain on  the  Properties   of Matter.           527
  The Effect of Longitudinal Traction on the Thermo-electric Properties
                              of Platinum-iridium.
                                Experiment   XIII.
    The above-mentioned large increase of resistance resulting from
the temporary traction of platinum-iridium, together with the ap
parent relationship between the effect of mechanical stress on the
thermo-electric     properties of metals, and that on the specific resist
ance, rendered it probable that stress would act on the thermo-electric
properties of iron and platinum-iridium similarly as regards nature,
but with greater intensity with the latter metal than with the former,
but here, again, a surprise was met with, for when the wire was
tested in the same manner as the cobalt had been, the unstretched
platinum-iridium was found to he positive to the temporarily stretched
metal, and therefore the alloy is affected by stress, thermo- electrically,
in a manner similar to nickel. Thus we see that, though these new
experiments would in the case of cobalt and magnesium' largely con
firm us in our opinion respecting the above-mentioned relationship, it
is quite the contrary in the case of platinum-iridium.              In the next
table will be found drawn up the results obtained by Hall, Bidwell,
and myself.
    Hall says of the numbers in the second column : "I cannot vouch
for the quantities within 50 per cent., but I think I can vouch for the
direction of the effect." Bearing this statement in mind, and the diffi
culties which lie in the way of obtaining accurate values for the ratio
of lateral contraction to longitudinal extension, which difficulties will
affect the numbers in the fourth and fifth columns, one cannot help
being struck with the fact that with most of the metals the order of
the " rotational coefficients " is the same as that of the alteration of
specific resistance caused by traction.            Cobalt and platinum are,
however, conspicuous exceptions, but with regard to the former
metal it has been already observed, and of course the same observa
tion would apply equally to nickel and iron, that longitudinal traction
might produce different effects in the magnetised and unmagnetised
metals.    The exception furnished by platinum cannot be thus ac
counted for, nor does it seem fair to attribute the discrepancy either
to errors of observation or to difference in the purity of the specimens
examined by Hall and myself respectively.*              In the fifth column is
given the difference between the alteration of the specific resistance
of lead by traction, and that of the other metals, and, with the excep
tions just mentioned,! it may be fairly said that, within the errors of

 the centres of adjacent molecules                  be  proportional to                    Bj   say,
my possession, the effect of traction on the thermo-elp.ctric properties of the metal
seemed to be the same in direction             as that given, and for which Bidwell is my
authority,   but the  effect   was                      I
                                     very slight, and am not now quite certain whether a
less stress than was then applied would not give an opposite result.

 ex«'    is, with  most   metals,   a constant, where   e denotes " Young's
 modulus." Taking the mean of the values of e and of A for cobalt in
 the annealed and unannealed conditions, we have «=l-927, and
 e x «7= 1886 x 108.    For magnesium «= 2-399, and e X a7= 1969 x 108.
    In the next table will be found collected together most of those
 results of the present inquiry which can be expressed by numbers.
    It has been suggested with regard to the method of finding the
 effect of strain on the resistance, that unless the strain was fairly
 uniform, thermo-electric effect might have to some extent vitiated the
 results. It will be seen, however, that the strain must have been
 fairly uniform, and even if there had been considerably more lack
 of uniformity than actually existed, the small change which can be
 wrought by stress and strain in the thermo-electric power of any of
 the metals hitherto used, would preclude the possibility of any appre
 ciable vitiation. Fnrther, in many cases, very different lengths of the
 same wire were tested and found to yield the same results, which
 would not have been the case had the strain on the connexions, a
 point also suggested for consideration, introduced error.
                                   Summary.
    1.  The electrical  resistance   of cobalt, like that of nickel, is tem
 porarily    decreased  by temporary longitudinal traction.        Whether
 the decrease of resistance would be changed to increase, as it is with
 nickel, by a greater amount of stress, has not yet been ascertained,
 but should this be the case, the magnitude of the stress per unit area
 which would suffice for the purpose, must be much greater with cobalt
 than with nickel.
    2. Permanent extension and rolling diminishes with cobalt as with
 nickel, the effect of longitudinal traction alluded to in 1.
    3. Cobalt is remarkable for the extreme persistence with which the
 same load, when applied again and again, continnes to produce per
 manent increase of resistance.
    4. Moderate permanent extension decreases permanently with cobalt
 as with nickel and iron, the specific resistance.
    5. Temporary longitudinal traction renders           cobalt temporarily
 positive as regards its thermo-electrical qualities to cobalt not under
^traction, provided there is no magnetic stress acting at the same
 time.
    6.  Temporary longitudinal magnetic stress renders cobalt tem
 porarily negative as regards its thermo-electrical qualities to cobalt
 not under magnetic stress, provided there is no mechanical stress
 acting at the same time.
    7. The effect of temporary longitudinal traction, even when carried
 to very great excess, is to increase the resistance of unannealed piano-
 steel ; and this increase, though less than with iron, both for uni t

            Stress and      Strain on   the   Properties   of Matter.        5ol
stress per square unit of area and per nnit temporary increase of
length, is much greater than can be accounted for by changes in the
dimensions of the steel.
  8.    The electrical resistance of magnesium is temporarily increased
by temporary longitudinal traction of moderate amount, but the
amount of increase is less than can be accounted for by mere change
of dimensions, so that the specific resistance of magnesium, like that
of aluminium, is diminished by the temporary stress.
     9. When the permanent load on the wire is very 'mall, the temporary
 increase of length, like that of the increase of resistance, increases in
larger proportion than the temporary load, but the former increases
less rapidly than the latter, so that when the temporary stress exceeds
a certain limit the above-mentioned decrease of specific resistance is
changed to an increase of specific resistance.
    10. The values of " Young's modulus," and the simple rigidity of
 the alloy, platinum-iridium, are much greater than those calculated
from the same values for the components of the alloy.
    11. The electrical resistance of platinum-iridium, quite unlike that
 of platinum-silver, German-silver, and brass, is much more increased
by temporary longitudinal traction than that of either of the com
ponents of the alloy.
     12. The increase of resistance mentioned above is much greater
 than can be accounted for by change of dimensions, so that the
 increase of specific resistance produced by longitudinal traction             i'
 considerably greater than is the case with any of those other metals
 examined whose resistance is increased by longitudinal traction.
     13. The alteration of the resistance alluded to in 11 at first increases
  in greater proportion than the load, but when a certain limit of stres'
  has been reached, the ratio of the temporary increase of resistance to
 the load producing   it,  begins to diminish, and finally reaches the same
 value as at first.    A tendency to similar state of things seen with
                                        a                               is
 other metals, but in none       is the phenomenon so pronounced as in
  platinum-iridium.
     14. Unstretched platinum-iridium        thermo-electrically positive to
                                               is
the temporarily stretched metal.
   15. The present investigations, as far as magnesium        concerned,
                                                                    is
confirm the previous ones in showing an apparent relationship between
the " Hall effect
                  " and the alteration of the
                                               specific resistance pro
duced by mechanical stress.  With regard to cobalt this    not so, at   is
any   rate for the metal when not under  the influence  of magnetic
stress.
