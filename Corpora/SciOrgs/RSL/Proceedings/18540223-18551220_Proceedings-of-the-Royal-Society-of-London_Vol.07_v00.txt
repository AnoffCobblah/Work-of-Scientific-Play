    The following communications            were read    : —
I. A paper entitled, "Continuation of the subject of                    a paper
       read   Dec. 22, 1853,        the supplement         to which was read
      Jan. 12, 1854, by Sir Frederick Pollock, &c. ; with                     a
      proof of Fermat's first and second Theorems of the Polygonal
      Numbers, viz. that every odd number is composed of four
      square numbers        or less, and of three triangular numbers or
      less."    By Sir Frederick            Pollock, M.A., F.R.S.           &c.
       Received February 23, 1854.
    The   object of this paper is in the first instance to prove the
 truth of a theorem stated in the supplement to a former paper, viz.
 " that every odd number can be divided into four squares
                                                                    (zero being
considered an even square)         the  algebraic    sum    of whose roots (in
some form or other)       will equal     1, 3, 5, 7,  &c. up to the greatest
possible  sum of the roots."       The paper also contains      a proof, that if
every odd number 2n +        1 can be divided into four square numbers,
the algebraic sum of whose roots is equal to 1, then any number n
is composed    of not exceeding three triangular numbers.
   The general statement of the method of proof may be              made thus   :
two theorems are introduced which connect every odd number with
the gradation     series, 1, 3, 7, 13,   &c, of which the general term is
» + n9+   1 or 4p*+'2p +    1  (that is, the double of a triangular number
 + 1), each term of which series can be resolved into four squares, the
algebraic sum of the roots of which, p,p, p, p+ 1, or p— l,p,p, p
may manifestly be      = 1.    By  these theorems      it is shown that   every
odd number      is divisible into four squares,       having roots capable of
    VOl.  Vii.                                                        B

                                             2
 forming as the sum of the roots               1, 3, 5, 7,     &c. up to the greatest
 possible sum of the roots.
     As  the four square numbers which compose                  an odd number must
 obviously be three of them even and one odd, or three odd and one
 even, the differences      of the roots among themselves must be the first
 odd and the third even, or vice versd            ;  and therefore these roots must
 have the sum       of the first and third differences an odd number               ;  the
 middle difference may be either odd or even.
    The first of    the theorems referred to, called by the author              " Theo
 rem   P," is in substance this : —
    Let r,   s, t, v be the roots the squares           of which     compose    any odd
 number N, such that         r+s + t+v=l,           and let each of these roots be
 increased by m; then r+m, s+m, t+m, v+m will be the roots of
 the odd number        N+2m(2m+         1)  ; and tn—r, m — s, m — t, m—v the
 roots of the odd number         N-f 2m(2m       —  1) ;  the sum of the roots in
 the first case being 4m 4-1, and in the second                     4m — 1.     So that
 giving to m successively the values           0,1,2,     3, &c.   in the general form
 N+2m(2m^l),           a series   will  be   formed in which the sums of the
 roots will be     1,3,  5, 7, 9,  &c, and the sums of their squares N,
N + 2.1.1, N + 2. 1 .3, N + 2 .2.3, N + 2 . 2 . 5, N+2 . 3 . 5,
N + 2. 3. 7, N+2.4.7.&C ; orN,N + 1.2, N + 2 . 3, N + 3.4,
N + 4 . 5, N + 5 . 6, N + 6 .7, N + 7 . 8, &c. So that if p be the
distance of any odd number in this series from N, the number will be
N+p(p+         1), and the sum     of its roots will      be 2p + 1.
    The conclusions to       be drawn from this theorem are then stated              : —
    1.  The greatest     sum of the roots of the             squares into which any
odd number can be divided may be obtained                     : for let In +  1  be any
odd number, and 2p+           1 the odd number to which the algebraic sum
of its roots is required to be equal           ;  then   if p is such that p(p +       1)
is less than    2n+l,     the number 2n        +l    can   be resolved into squares
the sum of whose roots is 2p +          1 ;   otherwise it cannot.
    2.  The form of the roots of 2»+l may                    be found of which the
algebraic sum is any possible odd number                 2p+l except       1, provided
all the odd numbers less than          2n+l      possess the property of having
the algebraic sum of their roots          =1.        For if from      2n +  l,p(p+     1)
be taken, there      will remain     an odd number          (N in Theorem P) such
that, according to the condition stated, the algebraic sum of its
roots =    1 ;  and in the series of roots and odd numbers formed from

                                       3
these   roots according to theorem P, p terms from N will be found
the number 2n +      1 composed of squares the algebraic sum of whose
roots is 2p+    1.
    It thus appears    that any odd number           2»+l     can be divided into
squares the sum     of whose roots will equal 3, 5,         7, &c. (any possible
odd number except 1)       if  the odd numbers below            it   can be divided
into squares the sum of whose roots =              1 ; and    if it can    be shown
that its roots in some form will equal        1,  then the theorem         M will  be
true for that number and for every number below it.
    This is illustrated   by an example,         and    then another        theorem,
called   " Theorem Q,"     is stated.     In this     a series    of roots and odd
numbers is formed by making the 1st and 3rd differences of the
roots constant, but reversed every alternate term, and increasing or
diminishing     the middle difference by        1  each term       ; — or the middle
difference is made constant and the 1st and 3rd vary.                   The  sums  of
the roots thus oecome constant in every term of the series, but the
sums   of  the squares   of   the roots increase, as in theorem P, by the
 even numbers 2, 4, 6, 8,       &c, so that the increase at any number of
 terms  p is p(j>+ 1), or the double of     a  triangular number.
    By the application of     these theorems to a variety of examples,              it
is shown how any odd number may be composed                         of four squares,
such that the algebraic sum of their roots may equal 1.
    The theorems P and Q, it is considered, connect every odd num
ber with every other odd number, so as to make it impossible if one
odd number be composed of four squares, but that every other odd
number should likewise         be so.   It is pointed out in what manner
every possible combination of numbers which can furnish the differ
ences    of the roots of any squares, not exceeding four, which can
make an odd number, and the sum of which roots = 1, can be derived
from the gradation series, that is from 4p*+2p+                1.     The combined
effect of the theorems P and Q is therefore to prove that every
 odd number must be composed of not exceeding four square num
bers.
    The author     goes on to show that every number is composed of
not exceeding three triangular         numbers, by proving that if every
odd number 2n+ 1 can be divided into four square numbers the sum
 of whose roots = 1 , then n will be composed of not exceeding three
 triangular numbers.      This is done by taking the differences of               the
                                                                         b 2

                                                     4
roots of 2n + l           ,   the algebraic sum of which roots is one, and dimi
nishing the middle difference by theorem Q until it reaches a number
nearest to half the sum of the first and third differences.      The
difference between 2n +                   1   and the number thus obtained          will   be the
double of a triangular number = 2T.                        By the next       step, the extreme

      The author employs                       the     symbol [p, q] in                   a sense    similar to that
in which Poisson and others have employed (p, g), namely, as an

     Hence it easily follows,                    that         if any            n integrals           o,   ...a, of the
 system   (I.) be given, which satisfy the conditions [ai, a/]=0, a
 " Principal Function " X can always be found, from which the re
 maining         integrals of the system may be deduced by means of the
 second set of equations                (II.).
     The relation in which                these       investigations stand to the discovery
of Sir     W. R. Hamilton               (as improved    completed by Jacobi) is
                                                                      and

Sir W. Hamilton had transformed into the system (I.) by                                                      a process
depending upon the circumstance that, in dynamical problems,                                                         W

     In the second section,              the author gives a simplified demonstration
of Poisson's theorem                (extended to the general system (I.)), that if
f,   g be any two integrals,             [/,        g~\

ciples are then exemplified by application                                          to the problems of the
motion of a material point under the action of                                             a    central force, and
the rotation of a solid body about                        a     fixed point.

   In  each   case  three integrals,    c„ et,  c3, are taken, satisfying the
three conditions [c2, c3]=0, [c„ c,] = 0, [c„ e,]=0; the first being
the integral of vis viva, and the other two being derived from the
integrals expressing the conservation of areas.            In the former pro
blem the   " principal  function

                                    is then found with great ease, and the
remaining integrals deduced.        The    set of "normal elements" thus
obtained coincide with those given by Jacobi (in a memoir in Crelle's
Journal, vol. xvii.). In the problem of rotation, the algebraical solution
of the three assumed integrals for y,,       y2, ys depends    upon that of an
equation    of the fourth degree.         It is therefore impracticable to
exhibit the principal function in an explicit form.             In this respect
the result arrived at resembles that obtained by Mr. Cayley in a
totally different way   ; Mr. Cayley having shown that the solution of
the problem is reducible to quadratures, assuming the algebraical
solution of a certain system of equations of the same form as those
to which the author of the present investigation is conducted. (Camb.
and Dub. Math. Journ. vol. i. p. 172.)

    Perhaps the following observations on the growth of land shells
 may contain sufficient information to prove interesting to the Royal
 Society.   Before describing    them, however, a few introductory re
marks    will be necessary.   Every individual  experimented upon has
been kept in confinement       since the day it was hatched.      Each

                                         9
species    has  been   placed in    a separate    box (filled with soil to the
depth of three inches), and care has been taken to feed the Mollusca
every other day, the food chiefly consisting of the leaves of the
lettuce and cabbage.         In very dry weather the soil has been moistened
with rain-water       about once     a week   ;  in that box containing Helix
pomatia small lumps of chalk have been mixed with the soil.
    The   species  experimented upon were         : —
               Helix  aspersa                       Zonites cellarius

    The facts arrived at are, —
     1st. The shells of Helicidae increase but little for         a considerable
 period, never arriving at maturity before the animal has once become
 dormant.
     2nd. Shells do not grow whilst the animal itself remains dor
 mant.
     3rd. The growth of shells is very rapid when it does take place.
     4th. Most species      bury themselves in the ground to increase         the
 dimensions of their shells.

 young ones were deposited in a box (having                 a lace cover) placed
 in the shade.      The young Helices were regularly             fed  every other
 day until the beginning of December, when they buried themselves
 in the soil for winter    ;  up to this period they had gradually increased
  in dimensions to the size of Helix hispida.             From December until
  April the soil was kept dry, the box being placed in the cellar. On
 the 1st of April they were replaced in the garden, the soil having
 previously been copiously watered.             On the 3rd of April the young
  ones appeared on the surface, being no larger in size than they were
  in December, and although regularly fed up to the 20th of June

                                               10
 they scarcely increased, not being perceptibly larger in size than
 they were      in December.           However,      on the 20th of June five of
them disappeared, having buried themselves                   (with the mouth of the
 shell downwards)         in the soil    ;  on the 30th of June they reappeared,
having in ten days grown so rapidly as at this time to become equal
in  size to   Helix pisana.          They again buried themselves on the 15th
of July      and   reappeared on the 1st of August, having again in
creased    in size.       From this date they did not apparently become any
larger, and       on the 2nd of November               food   was withheld     for the
winter,     and at the present time (February               14th) they are in    a dor
mant state. Probably they will arrive at maturity by July or August
next.     The sixth specimen did not bury itself until the 15 th of
August.
                      Second Experiment with          Helix   aspersa.
   A pair of Helix         aspersa    having been procured in the act of copu
lation on the 19th of May 1852, they were placed in confinement.
Each individual deposited about 70 eggs,                  which began to hatch on
the 20th of June           :   these   young ones      grew but little during       the
summer.        They buried themselves in the soil on the 10th of October,
coming      again to the surface           on the 5th of April, not having grown
during the winter.           In May they buried       themselves     (with their  heads
downwards      as with      Helix pomatia, in winter they and other species
buried themselves            with the head upwards), appearing again in a
week double the size ; this process was carried on at about fortnightly
intervals     until July the 18th, when they were almost fully grown.
It is worthy of remark that this species, as well as Helix pomatia
and Helix nemoralis, and probably other of the Helicae, form an oper
culum at the aperture, after which                they retire considerably within
the shell, and form           a  second (much       thinner),    behind which they
rest during the winter.
   It  would be swelling this paper too much to describe all the obser
vations in full     ;   it will perhaps therefore be considered sufficient to
remark that the process of growth within the ground takes place
with Helix     nemoralis,      Helix virgata, Helix     caperata, and   Helix hispida.
Helix    rotundata       burrows      into decayed      wood to increase the size
of its shell.     Zonites radiatulus appears to remain on decaying blades
of grass   ;  whilst Pupa umbilicata, Clausilia               nigricans and Bulimus
obscurus bury their heads only to increase their shells.                 With respect

not satisfactorily ascertained whether their heads            were buried du

 II. " Note      on the Decomposition         of Sulphuric Acid by Penta-
        chloride of Phosphorus."            By Alexander Williamson,
        Ph.D., F.C.S., Professor of Practical Chemistry in Univer
        sity College.     Communicated by Dr. Sharpey, Sec. R.S.
        Received February 23, 1854.
    Chemists have long been aware of the fact that some acids unite
 with   bases  in one proportion only, others in two or more proportions.
 Thus    a  given quantity of nitric acid forms with what is termed its
 equivalent of potash, a definite nitrate of potash         ;  if less than this
 equivalent quantity     of potash were         added  to the nitric acid, the
 product would be a mechanical mixture of the same nitrate of potash
 with uncombined nitric acid       ;  if  more than the equivalent      of potash
 were added, the excess      of alkali would remain uncombined.               Sul
 phuric acid, on the other hand, is capable of forming two compounds
 with potash, and it depends upon the proportions in which the two
 substances are brought together whether the neutral or acid sulphate
 is formed.
    The number of compounds which an acid forms with                  one base is
 now considered as indicating          its atomic weight.       The weights of
 sulphuric and nitric acids which are         respectively susceptible of neu
 tralizing the     same quantity     of   potash   are termed equivalent,      but
 these are by no means       the same       as their atomic weights.        Sixty-
  three parts of nitric acid (nitrate of water) contains the same quantity
  of hydrogen as forty-five parts of sulphuric acid, and when they are
  neutralized by potash the whole of this hydrogen is removed                  and
  replaced by potassium    ; and   if neither of the acids could combine in
  any other proportion with potash, their atomic weights would be the
  same as their equivalent weights.          But sulphuric acid also forms        a
  potash   compound in which half of its hydrogen is replaced by potas

                                        12
sium, the other half remaining in the compound, whereas the smallest
particles of nitric acid either exchange the whole or none of their
hydrogen for potassium.
    This fact is   expressed    in the simplest possible manner by the
statement that the smallest indivisible          particles of sulphuric      acid
contain two atoms        of hydrogen, whilst those of nitric acid only
contain one. Thus it is, that whereas the equivalent weights of the
two acids are the quantities which contain the same amount of basic
hydrogen, their atomic weights must be in the proportion                  of two
equivalents of sulphuric to one of nitric acid.          The simplest expres
sion for an atom of nitric acid being empirically N03 H, we shall
accordingly represent an atom of sulphuric acid by the formula
S04H3.      In like manner, an atom of common phosphoric acid,
being tribasic, is expressed empirically by the formula PO4 Hs. The
labours of Messrs. Laurent and Gerhardt greatly contributed to the
establishment of these results, which are uncontroverted.
    We   have  hitherto been accustomed to resort very freely to ima
ginary distinctions of form and arrangement of matter to explain the
differences of properties    ; but of late years an opposite tendency has
arisen, and chemists have felt the necessity of reducing their language
and ideas to simpler and more consistent forms.             This necessity was
first felt in the most complex, i.     e. the  so-called organic part of che
mistry.     But the simplifications thus introduced         have proved to be
equally applicable to the inorganic          part of the science   ;  and their
introduction    is calculated to disengage, for the consideration of sub
stantial differences of composition, the attention which has hitherto
been absorbed by imaginary distinctions of form.              Being unable     to
express the constitution of compounds without some formal artifice,
we shall be able to see and compare             their substantial    differences
most easily when all unnecessary variations of those formal artifices
are eliminated.      The  success of this operation      of course depends    on
our finding one form sufficiently general to replace the special and
limited forms now employed.
   In  some papers published      in the   Journal of the Chemical Society
two or three years ago,     I  endeavoured to show that the constitution
of salts may be reduced to the type of water           ; that acids and bases
being, truly, acid salts and basic salts, are perfectly conformable to
the same principle     ; and that, amongst other things, the difference

                                          13
between monobasic and bibasic acids, &c. admits of               a  simple and easy
explanation by it. The leading propositions in those papers have been
adopted by several eminent chemists in this country and in France                   ;
and   M. Gerhardt speedily enriched science with              a  series of brilliant
and striking illustrations      of their truth.    As regards the constitution
of bibasic acids, M. Gerhardt's results were, however, at variance
with that theory       ; and he was led to represent them by formulae
equally inconsistent with his own previous views on the subject.                    I
believe that this discrepancy is satisfactorily removed by the facts                I
have the honour      of submitting to the consideration of            the Society.
    An  atom of nitric acid, being eminently monobasic, is, as we have
already shown,       represented in the monobasic             type          by   the
formula   ^^||0, in        which peroxide of nitrogen (NO„) replaces one
atom of hydrogen.          In like manner, hydrate of potash I                is ob
                                                                        ^Oj

 explains itself.
    Chemists have long known            how to remove       the basylous consti
 tuents H,    K, &c. of   these salts, and to replace them by others.            But
 it is only recently that they have learnt to remove the chlorous
 radicals SO,, NO,, &c. in a similar manner. To obtain the chloride
 of potassium from its sulphate, it is sufficient to bring the latter into
 liquid contact with chloride of barium          ; but the same reagent would
 be powerless for the preparation         of the chlorides of the radicals SO.,
 or  NO,.

                                      14
    M. Cahours    has shown us a reagent (the pentachloride of phos
phorus) which is capable of forming from        a  great number of mono
basic acids the chlorides of the acid radicals.       Whilst extending our
knowledge of the action of the body on monobasic and organic acids,
and preparing numerous compounds of their radicals with one atom
of chlorine, M. Gerhardt examined also the nature of its action upon
bibasic acids and their compounds; and states that it consists of two
successive phases, first, the liberation of the anhydrous acid, secondly,
the substitution of two atoms of chlorine for one of oxygen in that
anhydrous acid.      These facts,  if correct, would    be unfavourable    to
the above view of the constitution of sulphuric and the other bibasic
acids; and    M. Gerhardt adopted accordingly       the old formulae, repre
senting in their composition an atom of water ready-formed, S03 Hs O .
     Confining my remarks for the present to the case of sulphuric
 acid, whose decomposition is doubtless typical of that of other bibasic
 acids,  I may state as the result of numerous experiments with the
 most varied    proportions of pentachloride and acid, performed on a
 scale  of considerable magnitude, that the first action of the penta
 chloride consists in removing       one atom of hydrogen and one of
 oxygen (empirically peroxide of hydrogen) from the acid, putting in
 an atom of chlorine in their place and forming the compound SO,
                                                                       H0     ,
                                                                           CI
  which is strictly intermediate between the hydrated acid and the
  final product SO, Cl2 formed by a repetition of the same process of
  substitution of chlorine for peroxide of hydrogen.          The existence
  and formation of this body, which we may call chloro-hydrated sul
 phuric acid, furnishes the most direct evidence        of the truth of the
  notion, that the bibasic character of sulphuric acid is owing to the
 fact of one atom of its radical S02 replacing or (to use the customary
  expression) being equivalent to two atoms of hydrogen.            Had this
  radical been   divisible like an equivalent quantity      of  a monobasic
  acid, we should have obtained a mixture, not           a compound    of the
  chloride with the   hydrate, — or,  at least, the products of decomposi
  tion of that mixture.
      Chloro-hydrated    sulphuric  acid boils at 145°      Cent.,  distilling
  without    decomposition.     The intensity    of its action upon water
  varies according to the manner in which the two bodies are brought

                                         IS
together.     When poured rapidly into a large quantity of cold water,
a  portion of it sinks to the bottom, and only gradually dissolves as
a  mixture of hydrochloric and sulphuric acids. When a small
quantity of water is added to the compound, the same decomposition
takes place with explosive violence.           The   acid dissolves chloride      of
sodium on the application of        a gentle heat with evolution of hydro-
                                                                  NaQ
chloric acid, giving rise to    a  compound of the formula S09            .   When
                                                                      CI,
poured upon pieces of melted nitre at the atmospheric temperature,
an effervescence takes place with evolution of a colourless vapour
which possesses in    a  striking degree the odour of aqua regia. This
vapour may be dissolved in various liquids, and when decomposed
by water, yields nitric and hydrochloric               acids.   It is doubtless
chloro-nitric acid, NOa     01.     In like manner the chlorides of other
inorganic acid radicals may be obtained, as from chlorates, perchlo-
rates, sulphites,  &c, but of     these and other reactions       I  beg leave to
defer any further account until the experiments now in hand are
more advanced.
   From   the general resemblance       of properties and identity of boiling-
point of the chloro-hydrate         with   a compound discovered by Rose,
and described by that eminent chemist as possessing empirically the
composition Sa Os Cl^, I was led to suspect that the two might in
reality be identical, which of course would require the addition of
the elements of water to Rose's formula, and several experiments                   I
have   performed afford strong confirmation            of that identity.       The
same   compound is obtained by the action of dry hydrochloric                  acid
on anhydrous       sulphuric    acid  ;  and  finally,   I  may mention        that
Mr. Railton obtained      a small quantity      of the   same substance some
weeks ago in my laboratory by the action of platinum-black                     at a
high temperature on an imperfectly dried mixture of chlorine and
sulphurous acid.
   As regards    the successive transformations         effected   in the penta-
chloride,   I have observed    the formation     of Wurtz's oxychloride (the
tribasic chloro-phosphoric acid (PO CI3)), and also of a compound
boiling above 145°, probably P03 CI.            Hydrated phosphoric acid is
always found      unless  the   amount of pentachloride           added     is very
great.

 " On   a new and more     correct method of determining the Angle
       of Aperture of Microscopic Object-Glasses."        By William
       S.  Gillett,     Esq.,   M.A.    Communicated by        Charles
       Brooke, Esq., M.A., F.R.S.          Received March 9, 1854.
    The very large apertures assigned to the    more recent microscopic
 object-glasses drew the author's attention some time since to the im
 portance of testing the accuracy of the method employed to deter
 mine their amount.
    With this object in view     he began   with the consideration that
 the central pencil was alone to be regarded, and that the marginal
 rays of this were the true limits of the angle of aperture, and that
 consequently the rays of all oblique pencils were to be excluded, as
 these might cross at a point not coincident with the principal focus,
 and being measured      separately might form an angle (apparently of
 aperture) not coinciding of course with the true one, although per
 haps  not differing from it in amount.       A short description of the
usual method of measuring these angles will suffice to show what
 claim it has to confidence in these respects.
    The microscope, with    the object-glass to be examined and an or
dinary eye-piece, is used as a telescope,    and a light placed at some
distance is commonly made an object to define the limit of the field
of view, the   image  of which is formed near    the back surface of the
posterior combination, and the diffused light of this image, as seen
through the eye-piece, is the indication that a pencil of light is ad
mitted, whether central or oblique.        Sometimes by an additional
glass the eye-piece  is made an erecting one capable of bringing the
image into focus.    This  adds   much to the convenience, but not to

                                        17
 the correctness   of the method.        Thus the conditions of the micro
 scopic object-glass are reversed, the principal focus being transferred
 from the front to the back, and the rays estimated are those of the ex
 treme oblique pencils, which may or may not pass through the point
 of the principal focus of the glass when used for the microscope.
    The importance of this in the illumination of objects immediately
 suggested itself ; and the author obtained a further proof by another
 experiment bearing directly upon this point.          A blackened wire was
 placed under a microscope at the focal point, with an object-glass
 of considerable power and aperture, the wire covering the field with
 the eye-piece used.    The field was then illuminated with          an achro
 matic condenser, the field of illumination         exceeding, as   it usually
 does, that   of the microscope. As was expected, the oblique rays
 which passed on both sides of the wire prevented its blackness from
 being seen (this becoming of a milky-grey), until the field of illumi
nation was reduced to the extent of that of the microscope, when it
immediately     assumed    to the eye its natural blackness.          This  re
 minded the author of    a  beautiful illustration  given by Professor Fara
 day some years since at the       Royal Institution, of   the effect of glare
produced by placing white muslin blackened in parts before a white
paper   printed in large letters     ; with the white muslin in front,     the
letters were scarcely visible, while through the blackened parts they
resumed their natural appearance.            These experiments suggested
the new method adopted, which may be briefly stated as follows             : —
    The microscope of which         the object-glass   is to be examined is
placed   horizontally  and centred by an object placed in the focus.
Next, there is substituted in place of the eye-piece, a hollow cone
with an aperture at its summit.          Light passing through this aper
ture is made to form an image of it in the principal focus of the ob
ject-glass, in the place of the original object.           On this image a
horizontally   placed examining        microscope is then directed, which
traverses  as the radius   of a graduated circle, having its centre corre
sponding with the place of the originnl          object, and therefore with
the image to be viewed      ;  and the angle of aperture is measured         by
the arc passed through between two extreme positions,            in the usual
manner.     The method      is further explained    in the paper by a figure
and description    of the apparatus, which was itself exhibited in the
Library after the meeting.

tained in an investigation      of Carbolic Acid or Hydrated Oxide of
Phenyl,     conducted,   under the author's       superintendence,    by    Mr.
Scrugham in the Analytical Laboratory          of University   College.
    Referring to the substitution    products obtained by Laurent from
hydrate of phenyl by      the action of chlorine and bromine, as well as
to its combination with acids prepared by that chemist in conjunc
tion with Gerhardt, the author states that the substance which they
conceived to be chloride of phenyl has been found by           Mr. Scrugham
to be a mixture of two compounds.
   As regards the preparation of hydrate of phenyl from the creosote
of coal-tar, it is observed that the numerous fractional distillations
by which it is usually isolated may be abridged by crystallization ;
for  if creosote, having  the boiling-point between     186° and 188° Cent.,
be left for some time in contact with      a  few crystals of the pure hy
drate, it deposits a considerable quantity           of beautiful   colourless
needles,     which, when separated     from the mother-liquid,        distil at
184° Cent., and condense in the neck of the retort into a solid mass
of pure hydrate of phenyl.
   When pentachloride of phosphorus is         added to hydrate of phenyl,
the action is at first very energetic, hydrochloric      acid being evolved,
and the mixture becoming hot; but after         a  time the addition of fresh
portions of pentachloride produces no perceptible action, unless the
mixture be heated.       Oxychloride of phosphorus is formed, as well as

                                        19
a  neutral oily body, which        is insoluble     in aqueous potash at the
common temperature, but soluble with decomposition in boiling pot
ash.    This oily compound would, from its mode of formation, be
naturally supposed to be the chloride of phenyl, and it has been so
considered by some distinguished chemists.            It may, however,     be sepa
rated by distillation   into two perfectly definite and distinct bodies, one
of which boils at 136° Cent., the other at            a  temperature above the
range of mercurial thermometers.           The former of        these is a colour
less mobile liquid,    possessing a fragrant smell, not unlike              that of
bitter almonds.       The latter is a more        consistent inodorous liquid,
which solidifies at a low temperature into a mass of colourless cry
stals.   The liquid having the boiling-point of 136° is nothing else
than the chloride of phenyl. The crystalline body is the phosphate of
phenyl, one of the most beautiful products in organic chemistry.                  In
the liquid state it is slightly yellow by transmitted light, and it re
flects the more refrangible       rays with a fine opalescent appearance,
due no doubt to the so-called epipolic refraction.              The epipolic rays
visible by ordinary daylight        on and at some depth below its sur
face, are   of a fine violet tint, differing decidedly from the blue colour
exhibited by disulphate of quinine in like circumstances.                The  flame
of sulphur     does not bring     out this effect      more    strongly than the
diffused light of the sun.
    Phosphate    of phenyl dissolves in strong nitric acid with evolution
of considerable heat, and       the solution      gives out nitrous fumes on
ebullition.     A heavy yellow oil is precipitated by water from this
solution, and collects in drops which ultimately               solidify, and their
solidification   is, singularly    enough, accelerated by hot water, by
reason of its more quickly dissolving out the nitric acid which at first
holds the solid body in solution.        Nitrophosphate      of phenyl is  an acid,
and forms with potash a beautiful crystalline salt.
    An alcoholic solution of phosphate of phenyl             decomposes     acetate
 of potash on ebullition.     After the alcohol      is distilled off, the tempe
 rature of  the mixture rises rapidly on the application of further heat,
 and a limpid      oleaginous substance, having a very peculiar odour,
 distils over, which possesses       the  composition      of acetate    of phenyl.
 This compound boils at       190° Cent.    ;  it is heavier than water,         and
 very slightly soluble in that liquid.        It  dissolves  with decomposition
 in boiling potash.

                                      20
   Cyanide   of phenyl is obtained by the action of the phosphate on
cyanide of potassium.        It is decomposed by boiling potash with
evolution of ammonia.
   Terchloride of phosphorus, when distilled with hydrate of phenyl,
seems to act at first  similarly to the pentachloride, but the phosphite
of phenyl formed is decomposed by heat ; and among the products of
distillation is found a body boiling at 80° Cent., and possessing all
the properties   of benzin, i. e. hydruret  of phenyl.
   The formation of    the iodide   of phenyl is necessarily attended with
some difficulty,   owing to the circumstance of phosphorus not com
bining    with more than three equivalents of iodine.            Its boiling-
point is 190° Cent.
   Mr. Scrugham      has had reason to confirm the statements        of Lau
rent and Gerhardt respecting the benzoate of phenyl, and has pre
pared that compound in considerable quantities by the action of
chloride of benzoyle on phenylate of potash.            Chloride   and phos
phate of phenyl could not be made to react on benzoate of potash.
   Chloride of cuminyl     reacts  with violence on phenylate of potash,
with formation of    cuminate   of phenyl, a  compound analogous to the
benzoate.
   Chloride of phenyl was heated with phenylate of sodium, with a
view to the formation of oxide      of phenyl,  and there is no doubt that
this compound was formed by the reaction, as the correlative pro
duct, chloride of sodium, was detected.          But  a  further account of
this and other reactions is deferred until the experimental investiga
tion is more advanced.
   Specimens of most of the compounds mentioned were exhibited.

"  Note on an indication of depth of Primaeval Seas, afforded by
       the remains of colour in Fossil Testacea." By Edward
       Forbes, F.R.S., Pres. G.S. &c. Received March 22, 1854.
   When engaged in the investigation of the bathy metrical distribu
tion of existing mollusks, the author found that not only did the
colour of their shells cease to be strongly marked at considerable
depths, but also that well-defined    patterns were, with very few and
slight exceptions, presented    only by testacea    inhabiting the littoral,
circumlittoral  and median zones.       In the Mediterranean only     one  in
eighteen of the shells taken from below 100 fathoms exhibited any
markings of colour, and even the few that did so, were questionable
inhabitants of those depths.      Between 35 and 55 fathoms, the pro
portion of marked to plain shells was rather less than one in three,
and between the sea-margin and 2 fathoms the striped or mottled
species exceeded    one-half of the total number.
   In our own   seas the author observes that testacea taken from below
100   fathoms, even when they were individuals           of species  vividly
striped or banded in shallower zones, are quite white or colourless.
Between     60   and 80 fathoms,     striping    and   banding   are  rarely
presented    by  our   shells, especially   in  the   northern   provinces   ;
and from 50 fathoms shallow-wards,         colours and patterns are well
marked.
   The relation of    these arrangements of colour       to the degrees    of
light penetrating the different zones of depth, is a subject well worthy
of minute inquiry, and has not yet been investigated by natural phi
losophers.

   The purpose in this brief notice is not, however, to pursue this
kind of research, but to put on record an application of our know
ledge of the fact that vivid patterns are not presented by testacea
living below certain depths, to the indication of the depth, within
certain limits, of palaeozoic seas, through an examination of the
traces of colour afforded by fossil remains of testacea.
  Although their original colour is very rarely exhibited by fossil
shells, occasionally we meet with specimens in which, owing proba
bly to organic differences in the minute structure of the coloured
and colourless portions of the shell, the pattern of the original paint
ing is clearly distinguished from the ground tint. Not a few exam
ples are found in Mesozoic as well as in Tertiary strata, but in all
the instances on record, the association of species, mostly closely allied
to existing types, and the habits of the animals of the genera to
which they belong, are such as to prevent our having much difficulty
about ascertaining the probable bathymetrical                  zone of the sea in
which they lived.
  But in    palaeozoic   strata the general assemblage          of articulate, mol-
luscan and radiate forms is so different from any now existing with
which     we can compare it, and so few species  of generic types
still remaining are presented for our guidance, that in many in
stances we can scarcely venture to infer with safety the original
bathymetrical     zone of a deposit from its fossil contents.                    Con
sequently any fact that will help us in elucidating this point be
comes of considerable importance.
  Traces of colouring are rarely presented by palaeozoic fossils, and
the author knows of few examples in which they have been noticed.
Professor Phillips, in his ' Geology of Yorkshire,' represents the car
boniferous species, Pleurotomaria flammigera             (i.   e. carinata) and co
rnea, as marked    with colour, and Sowerby             has figured such mark
ings in   P. carinata and P. rotundata.         In the excellent monograph
of the carboniferous fossils of Belgium, by Professor De Koninck of
Liege, indications       of pattern-colouring     are    faintly    shown      in the
figures of Solarium pentangulatum, and distinctly in those of Pleu
rotomaria carinata and Patella Solaris.
  In the cabinets of        the   Geological    Survey of Great Britain are
some    finely-preserved    fossils from the      carboniferous         limestone of
Parkhill, near Longnor in Derbyshire.             Among         these    are   several

                                      23
 that present unmistakeable pattern-markings,           evidently derived from
 the  original colouring.     They are —
    Pleurotomaria     carinata and conica, showing wavy blotches, resem
 bling the colouring of many recent Trochidee.
    An undescribed Trochus, showing         a  spiral band of colour.
    Metoptoma pileus, and
    Patella  ?  retrorsa, both with radiating      stripes, such as are pre
 sented by numerous existing Patellidee.
    Natica plicistria, with broad mottled       bands.
    Aviculo-pecten, a large unnamed species, with spotty markings on
the ribs   in the manner of many existing Pectines.
    Aviculo-pecten sublobatus, Ph. ? Beautifully marked with radiating,
 well-defined stripes, varying    in each individual, and resembling the
patterns presented by those        recent Aviculce      that inhabit shallows
 and moderate depths.
    Aviculo-pecten intercostatus   and elongatus also exhibit markings.
    Spirifer   decorus and Orthis resupinata,     show fine radiating white
 lines.
    Terebratula hastata, with radiating stripes.
    The analogy of any existing forms that            can  be compared    with
those enumerated, would lead        to the conclusion       that the markings
in these instances       are characteristic    of mollusks    living in  a less
depth of water than 50 fathoms.           In the     case of the Terebratula,
which belongs to       a genus the majority of whose living representa
tives inhabit deep water, it may be noticed that all the living spe
cies  exhibiting striped shells    are exceptions to the rule, and come
from shallow water.
    There   are many circumstances which warrant us to suspect             that
the carboniferous mountain limestone          of most regions was    a deposit
in shallow      water.   The facts now adduced materially strengthen
this inference.
    In the British Museum there is      a beautifully spotted example of a
Devonian Terebratula, brought by Sir John Richardson from Boreal
America.
    Specimens of the Turbo rupestris, from the Lower Silurian Lime
stone   of the Chair of Kildare near Dublin, exhibit         appearances  that
seem to indicate spiral bands of colour.

    The following papers were read         : —
I. "Note       on the    Melting-point     and Transformations       of Sul
      phur."        By B. C. Brodie, Esq., F.R.S.          Received March
       30, 1854.
   In the treatises of chemistry where the results of different           ob
servers   are   collected, various statements will      be found as to the
melting-point of sulphur.          The numbers given in Gmelin's Che
mistry vary from 104°-5 C. to 112°-2 C., but of five chemists cited, no
two agree as to this apparently simple fact. There is evidently
some peculiarity about this melting-point       which is the cause of these
anomalous results.        In  some experiments on allotropic      substances,
in which    I have been engaged,      I  had occasion to submit this ques
tion to a more searching inquiry than it had hitherto received, in
which   I  have discovered the cause       of these discrepancies.     In the
present note     I will briefly give the results at which I     have arrived,
reserving the details for a further and more full communication.
   The melting-point of sulphur varies according to its allotropic
condition.      This condition is readily altered by heat, and invariably,
without peculiar precautions, by melting.           Hence the temperature
at which sulphur melts is different from that at which it will solidify,
or at which, having been melted, it will melt again.
   The melting-point of the octohedral sulphur, as crystallized from
the bisulphide of carbon, is 1 14°-5 C.         But from the facility with
which   this sulphur,      when    heated even    below its   melting-point,
passes into the sulphur      of the oblique system, this fact may readily
be overlooked.       When this sulphur, in the      state of fine powder, is
heated  even     for the shortest time between 100° and 114°-5, this
change cannot be avoided.          For the transformation of large crystals

                                             25
 a  longer time is required.           At   a certain point       the crystal becomes
 opake, and is often broken in pieces at the moment of the change.
 When in such          a crystal     this change has either entirely                or par
 tially  taken place, the melting-point              will   be above        114°-5.      The
minute crystals of sulphur from alcohol, which are so extremely thin
that their angles cannot be measured, have this melting-point                              of
 114°-5, which fixes the system to which the crystals belong.                           The
crystals of sulphur from benzole (rectified coal naphtha) melt also at
 114°-5. The crystals from alcohol are very minute, consequently
so readily transformed, that they presented anomalies which led me
to doubt whether sulphur of both forms did not exist among them.
I answered this question by dividing               a certain number of carefully
selected crystals, and taking the melting-point                  of  the two halves        of
the same crystal.          I found that     these melting-points          in many      cases
did not correspond, which would have been the case                     if  the anomalies
had arisen from the different nature of the crystals.                    Sulphur which
has been melted at 114°-5, and               of which the temperature             has not
been raised above       1  15°, remains, on solidification,         perfectly transpa
rent for any length of time.             Heated beyond this point, it becomes,
on cooling,     more or less opake.
    When sulphur has been converted by heating for a sufficient
length of time, in the manner above mentioned, between 100° and
1  14°-5, it acquires    a  fixed melting-point of 120° C.             This is  the melt
ing-point of the oblique prismatic sulphur.               If sulphur thus converted
be carefully     melted so as to raise the temperature as little as possible
above the melting-point,          no sensible difference will be observed                be
tween the point of melting and of solidification.                 To obtain this fixed
melting-point     of   120°, care must be taken that the transformation of
the   sulphur   has been thoroughly effected.           If this    be not done,      it may
melt at any point between          1 14°-5 and   1 20°.  If, however, the tempera
ture of the melted sulphur be raised above its melting-point                      of 120°,
the   point of solidification will       be altered, and may lie even below the
first melting-point of 114°-5*.             The point of solidification is in this
case not fixed, but depends           upon the temperature to which the sul-
   * This  has been observed by Person,      who states that  if sulphur   be heated above
150° its melting-point is lowered to about 112° or 110°.      He says, that when heated
with care, the thermometer       will remain constant    during crystallization, at     115°.

                                       26
phur is raised and upon the mode in which it is cooled.         It has varied
in my experiments from 118° to as low as 111°. When the melting-
point of the sulphur, thus solidified, is taken, it will begin to melt
at about the temperature of solidification.         The   cause  of this ano
maly is evident.      When    the temperature of sulphur is raised above
 120°, a transformation into the viscid form instantly        commences, so
that the sulphur is a mixture of the two varieties, and the melting-
 point varies according to the proportion in which these two varieties
 are mixed.      It varies inversely with the temperature to which the
 sulphur is raised, so that the presence of the viscid sulphur lowers
 the point of solidification.     There is, however, a limit beyond which
 the   melting-point    is not affected   by this admixture.     I  made    the
 experiment of pouring        sulphur,   heated to its boiling-point, into
 water of different temperatures, and of taking the melting-point             of
 the sulphur when it had become hard.           Five different preparations,
 which, when extracted with bisulphide of carbon, gave each           a differ
 ent quantity of insoluble sulphur, coincided in the melting-point            of
 about    11 2°.  This sulphur, before melting,   becomes transparent, and
 passes again into the viscid or elastic condition.
    The sulphur which is insoluble in bisulphide of carbon, and which
 is prepared by extracting the hardened viscid sulphur with that re
 agent, has a melting-point        considerably  above    120°, but which      I
 have not been able to determine        with precision.
    I had placed in    a water-bath, at 100°, tubes containing fragments
 of the three definite varieties of sulphur.        After   a short time, on
 examining the tubes,       I found the insoluble sulphur, which I have
 stated to have such a high melting-point,          distinctly melted.     The
 octohedral sulphur had become opake and rounded at the edges, the
 other was unaltered in appearance.          Further inquiry convinced       me
 that the cause of the melting of the insoluble          sulphur was, that it
 had passed into another modification,        and that this conversion was
 attended with evolution of heat sufficient to melt the sulphur.           The
 insoluble sulphur thus converted remains transparent, and is per
 fectly soluble in bisulphide of carbon.
     It is stated in chemical treatises that   the opacity which on solidi
 fication comes over the melted sulphur, is due to the transformation
 of the oblique prismatic into      the octohedral    sulphur, and the con
 sequent disruption of the crystal.      To this cause also is attributed the

                                       27
evolution of heat which         has been observed     in solid sulphur imme
diately after cooling.       There are, however, no sufficient grounds for
this view, and some of the observations which             I have given are de
cidedly adverse to it.     1.  The change readily   takes place, even at tem
peratures at which sulphur becomes opake, in the opposite direction,
namely, from the octohedron to the oblique prism.                2. The melting-
point of the opake sulphur coincides too nearly with its point of soli
dification for  it to  be supposed that this change       in it  has taken place.
On extracting melted sulphur which had become opake, with bisul
phide of carbon,     I have constantly found present traces of insoluble
matter, even where the greatest precaution had been taken to avoid
elevation of temperature       ; and this opacity appears       to me to be due
to the hardening of the viscid sulphur, and the consequent deposition
of opake matter in the pores of the crystals, which is quite sufficient
to account for it.      It  remains to ascertain the cause of the evolution
of the heat.     On this point also I will offer a suggestion. It is well
known that the appearance of opacity is delayed by pouring the sul
phur into cold water, and that the sulphur             thus formed is at first
viscid and transparent, and only after a time becomes solid and opake.
The received view,       I believe, is that the hard sulphur thus formed
 is the solid form of the viscid sulphur, in the same sense as ice is the
 solid form of water.       It appears  to me more probable that these two
sulphurs    stand   in  a different relation,   and that the change which
 takes place on solidification      is an allotropic    transformation      of the
 viscid sulphur into the insoluble sulphur and one of the other modi
 fications.   In the   case of sulphur gradually cooled this change takes
 place with rapidity, and, like other similar transformations, is attended
 with a sensible evolution of       heat.    Where the sulphur is         tempered
 the change takes place very slowly, and the heat evolved              is not per
 ceived.    This view    is confirmed by a fact which        I  have discovered,
 namely,    that the viscid sulphur       possesses   another solid form.         I
 have found that when sulphur, melted at a high temperature, is sud
 denly exposed     to intense cold — the cold of solid carbonic acid and
 ether —the sulphur formed is not viscid, but solid, hard, and perfectly
 transparent.     When the temperature is allowed to rise to that of the
 air, the sulphur becomes soft and elastic.         It is probable that this     is
 the true solid form     of the viscid sulphur.

II. " On    the Structure and Affinities of Trigonocarpon               (a fossil
       fruit of the Coal-measures)." By Joseph D. Hooker,
       M.D., F.R.S. Received March 23, 1854.
   Having    been for some time engaged          in examining the structure
and affinities of some fossil fruits of the coal formation,            included
under the name Trigonocarpon, and the progress which              I am enabled
to make being extremely slow            (owing to the difficulty of procuring
good specimens),       I  am induced to lay before the Royal Society such
results as  I   have arrived     at, for publication in their Proceedings (if
thought worthy of that honour).              The details and illustrations of
the subject will, when complete, be offered to the Geological Society
of London.
   My attention      has for many years been directed to the genus          Tri
gonocarpon    ;  as, from the period of my earliest acquaintance            with
the flora of the carboniferous epoch,         I have felt assured, that bota-
nically, this was the most interesting and important            fossil which   it
contained in any great abundance, and that until the affinities of this
were determined, the real nature of the flora in question could never
be regarded as even approximately ascertained.
   In the first place, Trigonocarpon is         so abundant throughout       the
coal-measures, that in certain localities some species             may be pro
cured by the bushel        ; nor is there any part of the formation in which
they do not occur, except the underclays and limestone.               The sand
stone, ironstones, shales and coal itself, all contain them.
   Secondly.     The symmetry in form and size which many of them
display, the regularity of the sculpturing on their surfaces, and
various other points, suggested their belonging to a class of highly
organized vegetables.
   Thirdly. The fact of our being wholly unacquainted with the
organs of fructification belonging to the exogenous vegetation, which
also abounds      in the coal formation, coupled with the assumed         highly
organized nature of Trigonocarpon,            favoured the assumption that
these might throw        light  upon one another, and seemed to afford a
legitimate basis upon which to proceed, should           I ever procure speci
mens of Trigonocarpon displaying structure,          which   I had long hoped
to do.

                                      29
    It is, however, only since my return from India that I have been so
fortunate as to obtain good specimens, and for these I am indebted
to my friend Mr. Binney of Manchester, who has himself thrown
much light upon the vegetation of the coal epoch, and whose exer
tions indeed have alone enabled me to prosecute the subject;               since
he has not only placed his whole collection       of Trigonocarpons       at my
disposal, but has shared with me the trouble and expense of their
preparation for study.       All the specimens were found imbedded in
a  very tough and hard black-band         or clay ironstone, full of frag
ments of vegetable       matter, and which appears         originally to   have
been a fine tenacious clay.
    The individual Trigonocarpons      are exposed by breaking this rock,
and    are  invariably so intimately   adherent to the matrix as to be
fractured with it.      A great many of    these lumps      of ironstone,   con
taining partially exposed Trigonocarpons,       have been sliced by a lapi
dary in the usual manner, and excessively thin sections taken on
slips of glass.      The sections were    made   necessarily very much at
random, but as nearly as possible parallel, or at right angles to the
long diameter of the fruit.        Five of the   specimens       thus operated
upon have proved instructive, presenting the same appearances,               and
all being intelligible,   and referable to one highly developed type of
plants.     As, however, the term highly developed may appear ambi
guous, especially with reference to a higher or lower degree in the
scale of vegetable life, I may mention that by this term I mean to
imply that there are in the fruit of Trigonocarpon extensive modifi
cations of elementary organs, for the purpose of their adaptation to
special functions, and that these modifications are as great, and the
adaptation as special, as any to be found amongst analogous fruits
in the existing vegetable world.
    Thus,   I find that the integuments of the fruit of Trigonocarpon are
each   of them   a special highly organized structure    ;  they are modifica
tions of the several coats of one ovule, and indeed of the same num
ber   of integuments as now prevail in the ovules of living plants.
    The number, structure and superposition of these, are strongly
indicative of the Trigonocarpons      having belonged to that large sec
tion of existing coniferous plants, which bear fleshy, solitary fruits,
and not cones     ; and they so strongly resemble the various parts of the
fruit of the Chinese genus Salisburia, that, in     the present state    of our

                                           80
knowledge,       it appears legitimate to assume          their relationship to it.
In all   the five specimens alluded to, there are more or less perfect evi
dences     of four distinct integuments, and of a large cavity, which is
in all filled with carbonate of lime and magnesia ; these minerals, I
presume, having replaced the albumen and embryo of the seed.
   The general form of the perfect fruit is an elongated ovoid (rather
larger than a hazel nut), of which the broader or lower end presents
the point of attachment, while the upper or smaller end is produced
into   a   straight,   conical, truncated rostrum or beak, which is per
forated by a straight longitudinal            canal.    The exterior integument
is very thick and cellular, and was no doubt once fleshy                ; it alone is
produced beyond the seed and forms the beak                 ; its apex  I assume to
have been that       of the primine of the ovule, and its cavity the exo-
stome.       The second       coat appears     to have been much thinner, but
hard and woody or bony; it is impervious at the apex; is also ovoid,
and sessile      by its broad base within the outer integument,                   with
which it is perhaps adherent everywhere except at the apex.                       This
is marked by three angles or ridges, and being that alone which
(owing to its hard nature) commonly remains in the fossil state, has
suggested the name of Trigonocarpon.                  Within this are the third
and fourth coats, both          of which    are very delicate membranes         ;  one
appears     to have been in close apposition with the inner wall of the
second integument, and the other to have                surrounded the albumen.
These are now separated both from one another, and from the inner
wall of the cavity, by the shrinking of the contents of the latter, and
the subsequent       infiltration   of water charged with mineral matter.             I
may remark, however, that these two membranes may be due to the
separation of one into two plates, in which case the original one was
formed of several layers of cells.           Hitherto    I  have not been able to
trace any organized structure within the cavity of the fruit, and its
real nature therefore remains doubtful.               It is only from the strong
resemblance, in structure, appearance and superposition, which these
integuments present to those of Taxoid coniferoe, that               I assume their
probable relationship.           Salisburia,    especially, has the same ovoid
fruit, sessile by its broader end, and its outer coat is perfectly ana
logous, being thick,         fleshy, and perforated at its apex by a longitu
dinal canal (the exostome of the ovule) ; within this is a perfectly
similar, woody, two or three angled, impervious integument, form

                                            31
ing the nut.        This again is lined with         one very delicate membrane,
and contains a mass of albumen covered with a second similar mem
 brane.     A    marked analogy is presented to the European botanist by
 the fruit of the Yew, which has the same integuments though some
 what modified       ;  the outer, fleshy coat in the Yew is however a cup-
 shaped receptacle,         and not drawn up over the nut so as to leave
  only a small canal at the top, as in Salisburia                 and Trigonocarpon.
  The nut also does not adhere             to the fleshy cup except below its
  middle.     The internal structure is the          same in all three.
      Such are the main facts which            I have been able         satisfactorily to
   establish.     There are many others yet to be worked out, especially
   those connected      with the individual      tissues   of which     those bodies are
   composed    ;  and it is particularly to be borne in mind that the disco
   very of some      structure indicative of albumen or embryo, is abso
   lutely essential to the complete establishment of the affinity I have
   suggested.
      It must not    be overlooked, that the characters through which              I have
   attempted to establish an affinity between Trigonocarpon and Coniferae
   are equally common to the fruits          of Cycadeae; and in connexion with
   this subject    I   may remark, that        M. Brongniart*         has referred the
   genus   Noggerathia,      which is also found in the coal-measures, to
   that natural order, together with some associated organs which are
   probably Trigonocarpons in a mutilated state.                   The leaves of Nog
  gerathia are, however, alone known, and Dr. Lindley, when figuring
  those of one species (Lindley and Hutton, Fossil Flora, 28, 29),
  pointed    out their great resemblance to those of Salisburia, thus
  affording collateral evidence of the view I have been led to adopt
  from an examination         of the fruit alone.

    The following communications were read             : —
 I. " On    a peculiar Arrangement of the Sanguiferous System              in
       Terebratula and certain other          Brachiopoda."       By W. B.
       Carpenter, M.D., F.R.S.              Received March 30, 1854.
    In a memoir    " On the Minute Structure of Shell," read before the
 Royal Society January 17, 1843, (and subsequently embodied in a
 " Report " on the same subject, prepared at the request of the
British Association    for the Advancement         of Science, and published
in its Transactions    for 1844,)    I first announced the fact, that the
'               '
  punctations     which had    been    previously noticed on the exterior
of many Brachiopodous shells, both recent and fossil,          are really the
orifices of tubular perforations,      which pass directly     through each
valve, from one of its surfaces to the other (fig. 1).
    Having subsequently obtained specimens of Terebratula in which
the soft parts of the animals had been preserved, in connection with
their shells,  I  ascertained that these passages        are occupied  in the
living  state by membranous caeca,        closed externally, but opening on
the internal surface of the shell, and filled with minute cells of a
brownish hue.       Recollecting  that Professor Owen, in his account of
dissections of some species       of Terebratula and Orbicula (Transac
tions of the Zoological Society, vol.        i.), had spoken of an unusual
adhesion of the mantle to the shell in these Bivalves, it occurred to
me that this adhesion might         be due to a continuity      between the

                                           33
mantle and these caecal tubuli          ;  and  I carefully sought for evidence
of such a structure.         In this, however,         I  was entirely unsuccess
ful ;  for the mantle, when stripped from the shell, presented no ap
pearance     whatever    of having transmitted           any such prolongations
into its substance    ;  on the contrary,       it was evidently continued over
the mouths of the      caeca  with which it was in apposition ; and I fre
quently found its external surface (that in contact with the shell)
covered in patches with cells exactly resembling in size and aspect
those contained     within   the caeca.       I was equally unsuccessful in the
attempt to trace any other connection between these                  caeca   and the
soft parts of the animal       ;  so that, although       their importance in its
(Economy scarcely admitted of doubt, the nature of their function re
mained entirely unknown.             The idea that they        had any connection
with the formation of the shell itself, seemed to be completely nega
tived by the fact, that in      a  large proportion of the group of       Brachio
poda, no such perforations exist           ; notwithstanding      that their shells,
in every other feature of minute structure,                 are exactly   accordant
with that of Terebratula. — The foregoing results were communicated
to the British Scientific Association in 1847, and were embodied in
the Second Part of my         " Report " published in its Transactions for
that year.
                                                                     '               '

     '                   '
or     non-perforation      has become       continually more obvious, as the
principles   on which the subdivision            of the group of Brachiopoda
should be founded, have been gradually settled by those who have
concerned themselves with its systematic arrangement                  ;  and in par
ticular, the universal presence of the perforations in the shells of the
family Terebratulidee,     contrasted with their equally universal absence
in those of the family Rhynchonellidee,          unequivocally marked its rela
tion to the general conformation of the animals of these subdivisions.
    Having been requested by Mr. Davidson to undertake                   a more de
tailed investigation than        I had yet    made, into     the minute structure
of the shells of Brachiopoda,          for the    sake   of throwing still further
light upon the classification of the group,               I  applied myself afresh
to the solution of the problem, and believing that               I have succeeded
in ascertaining the import of this curious feature in the organization
of Terebratula     and its allies,       I beg to offer an account        of my re
sults to the Royal Society.

    The    membrane       which is commonly spoken of as            the mantle,'   and
which may be stripped from the shell by the use of sufficient force
to overcome its adhesions, must, I maintain, be considered as really
its inner layer only; for        I find that   an outer layer exists, so intimately
incorporated with the shell as not to be separable from it without the
removal of its calcareous component by maceration in dilute acid.
When thus detached, this outer layer                is found to be continuous     with
the membrane lining the perforations in the shell (fig.                 15);   so that
their tubular        caeca  are,    in fact, prolongations     of the real external
surface of the mantle.                The adhesion of the inner to the outer

 layer (which Professor Owen, not being aware of the existence of an
 outer layer, interpreted as an adhesion of the mantle to the shell)
 does    not extend to the whole of the contiguous                   surfaces, but is
 limited to certain bands or spots, — the two layers of membrane, in
 the intervals between these,             being separated     by a set of irregular
 spaces, freely communicating            with   one another, and    with the cavities
  of the   caeca,   so as to form a rude network.             This arrangement is
  peculiarly well marked in Terebratula caput -serpent is, as shown in the
  figure (fig. 2) ; and to those who are familiar with the condition of the
  circulating apparatus in the inferior Mollusca, it is scarcely possible
                                  '
  not to recognize in it a           sinus-system,' corresponding to that which
  is formed in the Tunicata by the partial adhesion of the second and
  third tunics to each other.

                                           36
    Considered under this point of view, the caecal structure (as was
first suggested to me by my friend Mr. T. H. Huxley) bears a close
resemblance to the vascular prolongations, which, in many Asci-
dians, pass from the sinus-system into the substance of the ' test ;'
the chief difference lying in this, — that whilst each of the vascular
                              '      '
prolongations       into the    test   of the Ascidians contains both           an affe
rent and an efferent       canal, — no such distinction ordinarily manifests
itself in these prolongations of the intra- palleal sinus-system of Tere-
bratula, although        I have met    with indications of it in Crania.          Their
caecal character,       however, is by no means            opposed      to the views I
am    now giving of their physiological nature              ; for it has been shown
by   M.   de Quatrefages, that the prolongations              of  the ' general cavity
of the body,' which pass into the branchiae and other appendages of
 Annelida,     transmitting      to them its nutritive fluid for aeration,           are
always caecal, notwithstanding             that they are sometimes distributed
as minutely      as blood-vessels*.

 Sinus-system    of Terebratula caputserpenlu (as shown by the grinding away of
    the shell, without detaching   the mantle), being a network of canals formed by
    the adhesion of the two layers of the mantle at certain spots, leaving passages
    around  them.
     On this interpretation,       the cells which are found          within the  caeca,
 and in the spaces between the contiguous surfaces of the two layers
 of the mantle,      are to be regarded as blood- corpuscles,             and they cor
 respond in size and appearance           (so far as can be determined by spe
 cimens preserved in spirits) with the blood-corpuscles of Ascidian
 and Lam elli branchiate        Mollusks.

      The sinus-system from which this collection of                        caeca  proceeds,
 appears to be altogether distinct from the vascular apparatus of the
                 '
 (so-called)        mantle,' (that is, according to my interpretation, of the
 inner layer of the mantle) which has been described by Professor
                                                                                         '
 Owen ; but it probably communicates with the ' common sinus                               at
 the back part of the visceral chamber, which                      is stated by Professor
 Owen to receive the blood, not only from the palleal sinuses of the
 dorsal and ventral valves, but also from                    " other sinuses that there
 fill, line, and seem to form, the visceral or peritoneal cavity*."
      It cannot    be deemed improbable, then, that the apparatus                   in ques
 tion is branchial in its nature           ; and that it is designed to provide for
certain tribes a more special means of aerating the blood, than is
afforded by that distribution             of blood to the general surface of the
 mantle, which is common to the entire group.                        This view of its re
spiratory office is confirmed by an observation communicated                           to me
by Professor Quekett            ;  viz. that the discoidal opercula which cover
the external orifices          of the  caeca,   and which, though adherent to the
periostracum,           are not structurally        continuous with it, present ap
pearances      in young shells, which seem indicative of the existence of
a   fringe of cilia round each, designed to produce currents of water
over the extremities           of the   caeca.
     The resemblance which             these    caecal prolongations          of the sinus-
system into the shell of the Terebratula bear to the vascular pro
longations of the sinus-system                into the test of certain Ascidians,          is
not without its parallel in another group, which (as pointed out by
Mr. Hancock, Ann. of Nat. Hist. vol. v. p. 198) is intimately re
lated to that of Brachiopoda,                — namely,       the Bryozoa.        The stony
                    '        '
walls of the           cells   which invest the soft bodies of many species of
Eschara, Lepralia,            &c,  are marked, like          the shells of Terebratulae,
with punctations, which             are really the orifices of short passages            ex
tending into them from their internal                     cavity, as sections of these
structures demonstrate.               These passages       I  have found to be occupied
by prolongations of the visceral sac, which is the only representative
of    a circulating      system among these animals              ; and they thus convey
the nutrient          fluid which this contains, into the substance of the
framework formed by the calcified tunics of these animals.
    *   See Mr.    Davidson's     Monograph      on  the   " British   Fossil  Brachiopoda,"

   I need not here enlarge upon the additional value which these
structural and physiological considerations afford, to the character of
" perforation " or " non-perforation " in           the shells  of Brachiopoda.
The importance of this character in systematic arrangement will
plainly appear, I think, from the details which I                 have published
in the Introduction to Mr. Davidson's Monograph                    already refer
red to.
II. "   On  a new      Series of Sulphuretted          Acids."      By Dr. Ac-
      oust Kek.ule.         Communicated by Dr. Sharpey, Sec. R.S.
      Received     April 5, 1854.
   Adopting the idea that the       series   of organic compounds of which
sulphuretted hydrogen is      the type, corresponds in every respect with
the series  of which water is the type,           I  concluded that not only
mercaptans and neutral sulphides which            correspond to the alcohols
and ethers, but also compounds corresponding                 to the acids, anhy
drous acids and ethers of acids might be produced                   ; I  therefore
endeavoured to obtain reactions which would enable me to replace
oxygen in the compounds of the latter series by sulphur.
   Such reactions     are produced by the compounds             of sulphur with
phosphorus — the tersulphide       (Pa S3) and the pentasulphide (P* S5)
                                                                                —
which are easily obtained by fusing together amorphous phosphorus
and sulphur    in an atmosphere      of carbonic acid      ;  no explosion takes
place, although     the combination        is attended with a very violent
action.
   Experiment     has proved that these         combinations of sulphur and
phosphorus act on the members           of the series of water in the same
manner (although       less violently) as the corresponding           compounds
of chlorine and phosphorus      ; —however, with        this difference, that by
using the chlorine compounds the product is resolved into two groups
of atoms, while by using the sulphur            compounds there is obtained
only one group    ; a peculiarity,   which, according to the bibasic nature
of sulphur,   must have been expected.             By acting on       these  com
pounds of sulphur and phosphorus with water one atom of sulphu-
    VOl.  Vii.                                                          E

hydrochloric acid,

   Similar reactions      are observed    with organic compounds belonging
to the series of water       with the formation of phosphorous and phos
phoric acids respectively, or a copulated acid. By acting in this
way, the following series of sulphuretted organic compounds is ob
tained, by the side of which are placed for comparison the products
formed by the action of the chlorides of phosphorus on the same
substances.

   Mercaptan is obtained by the action of tersulphide or pentasulphide
of phosphorus on alcohol with extreme facility.                Sulphide of ethyl
may also be prepared by acting on ether in a similar manner.
   Thiacetic Acid, — Sulphuretted Acetic Acid,         — has   been obtained by
me by    acting    on monohydrated         acetic acid with       tersulphide    of
phosphorus.     It is   a colourless   liquid,  boiling   at about    93° C,   and
has a  peculiar odour resembling sulphuretted hydrogen and acetic

                                        39
acid.     It  dissolves potassium in the cold and zinc on heating with
the evolution      of hydrogen, and gives with lead           a salt less soluble
than the ordinary acetate, so that it gives          a  precipitate with acetate
of lead.      By recrystallization from water or alcohol, the lead salt is
obtained in fine silky needles, which, though quite colourless at first,
are   rapidly    decomposed     (whether    in solution or in the solid form)
with the formation of sulphide of         lead.
   By analysis      I found the lead salt contained —
           Lead 58-8 per cent.        Theory requires 58-0 per cent.
   The acid contained —
        Sulphur 41-3 per cent.         Theory requires 42-1 per cent.
   Thiacetic acid is also formed in small quantity and by secondary
action, by distilling pentasulphide of phosphorus with fused acetate
of soda.       Pentachloride    of phosphorus gives a violent reaction with
thiacetic     acid, yielding    sulphochloride of phosphorus, chloride of
othyl, and hydrochloric         acid,

    Thiacetate    of Othyl. — Sulphide of Othyl. — Anhydrous Sulphuretted
Acetic Acid. — Pentasulphide of phosphorus acts but very feebly upon
anhydrous acetic acid in the cold, but on heating a violent reaction
takes place.      By distilling  the product, the anhydrous acid is obtained
in the form of a colourless liquid, boiling at about 121° C., and having
an odour       greatly resembling sulphuretted         acetic acid.   On mixing
with water it falls to the bottom, without, at first, suffering any
change ; on standing, however, it is slowly dissolved and decom
posed    into sulphuretted acetic acid and ordinary acetic acid.             This
 change takes place much more rapidly on heating,

    It  appears that anhydrous sulphuretted             acetic acid is also pro
duced by acting on the othyl-sulphide           of lead with chloride of othyl,
at all events chloride of lead is formed.           Chloride of benzoyle gives
with the lead salt       a similar reaction, and   it is probable that   an inter
mediate sulphuretted acid is formed, having the formula
                                    C7H,0/H-

   Thiacetate of Ethyl.—    Sulphuretted Acetic Ether. — This compound
may be prepared by the action of pentasulphide of phosphorus             on
acetic ether.    It  is a liquid lighter    than water, and possesses    an
odour resembling acetic ether and sulphuretted hydrogen.            It boils
at about 80° C.
   It will be seen that the action    of tersulphide and pentasulphide of
phosphorus    above    described produces      sulphuretted  organic com
pounds by substituting       sulphur for oxygen.      The compounds ob
tained in this way may also be formed by replacing one or two
atoms of hydrogen in sulphuretted hydrogen (Ha S), or one or two
atoms of metal in sulphide of potassium           (K, S), or in sulphide  of
hydrogen and potassium        (KHS),    by organic radicals.    Mercaptan
and the sulphides of alcohol radicals have, in fact, been long ob
tained in this manner.
   The formation      of  a sulphuretted compound containing        an acid
radical   has been    observed by Gerhardt by acting        on sulphide   of
lead with chloride of othyl.       I have  not made many experiments of
this kind, but  I  have   observed   that chloride of benzoyle is not de
composed by sulphuretted hydrogen, while it (as well as chloride of
othyl) gives a reaction with sulphide of hydrogen and potassium
yielding chloride of potassium.
   I am continuing     these researches,   and believe the above reactions
will furnish many new compounds, and will tend to complete our
knowledge of some of those organic and inorganic compounds now
known.
   The Society then adjourned to the 27th of April.

   The following papers were read        : —
I. "On the Changes produced in the Blood by the administra
      tion of Cod-liver Oil and Cocoa-nut Oil." By Theophilus
      Thompson, M.D., F.R.S.           Received March 30, 1854.
   The author    has found that during     the administration  of cod-liver
oil to phthisical  patients their blood grew richer in red corpuscles,
and he refers to a previous observation of        Dr. Franz Simon to the
same effect.    The   use  of almond-oil    and of olive-oil was not fol
lowed by any remedial effect,     but from cocoa-nut oil results were
obtained almost as decided as from the oil of the liver of the Cod,
and the author believes   it may turn out to   be a useful substitute. The
oil employed was a pure cocoa        oleine, obtained by pressure from
crude cocoa-nut oil, as expressed in Ceylon and the Malabar coast
from the Copper ah or dried cocoa-nut kernel, and refined by being
treated with an alkali     and then repeatedly washed with distilled
water.    It burns with a faint blue flame, showing a comparatively
small proportion of carbon, and is undrying.
   The analysis of the blood was conducted by Mr. Dugald Camp
bell. The whole quantity abstracted having been weighed, the
coagulum was drained on bibulous            paper for four or five hours,
weighed and divided into two portions.          One portion was weighed

finally dried completely and weighed as fibrin.          From the respective
weights of the fibrin and the dry clot that of the corpuscles was cal
culated.     The following were the results observed in seven different
individuals affected with phthisis in different stages of advance

 II. " On     a property of Numbers."          By the Rev. James Booth,
       LL.D., F.R.S.      &c.     Received April 6, 1854.
    I know not whether the following property of numbers has been
 made public.
    A number of six places, consisting of         a repetition of   a  period   of
 any three figures, is divisible by the prime numbers            7, 11   and 13.
 Thus 376376, 459459, 301301 are so divisible.
    A number N of six places may         be thus written    : —
           N= 100.000 a+      10.000 b+ 1000 c+ 100 d+         lOe+f,
 which, when divided by        7, will give  a quotient     q and a remainder
 50 + 46+ 6c+ 2rf+      3e+/.
    Now if d=a, e=b,f=c, this remainder may be written 7(a +               6 + c),
 which is divisible by 7, whatever be the values of a, b, c.
    In like manner if     a number of six places       be divided by 13, the
 remainder will be
    4o +  3i + 12c+9rf+10e+/;         and, as before,     if d=a, e=b,f=c.

 the remainder       may be written        13(a +  b + c), which is divisible by 13,
   whatever be the       value of  a, b and c.
      In the same way       it may    be shown that a number of this kind is
   divisible by 11.
      When the first figure of the period is 0, and the second any what
  ever    i and j, the number is     0ij0ij=ij0ij; or any number of five        places,
  the   first two and the last two being the same, while the middle place
  is 0,     is divisible   by 7,   11    and   13.   Thus 34034,        14014   are so
  divisible.
      When the first two places are 0, the number may be written
 00i00i=i'00i, or any number of four places, the first and last figures
  being the same,         while the two middle places are 0, is divisible by
  7, 11     and 13.    Thus 5005, 8008         are so divisible.
      Like properties may be found for 17,             19, 23,    but the periods are
  longer. The prime divisor being 2» +                1, it is manifest the number
  of places in the period cannot exceed, however               it may fall short of n.
     Thus when the divisor is           17, the number of places in the period is
  eight.
   III. " On       Fessel's   Gyroscope."          By C. Wheatstone,             Esq.,
           F.R.S.      Received    April 6, 1854.
      Since the announcement of             M. Foucault's beautiful experiment
   which has afforded us a new mechanical proof of the rotation of the
  earth on its axis, the phenomena of rotary motion have received re
  newed attention, and many ingenious                instruments      have been   con
  trived to exhibit and to explain them.              One of the most instructive
  of these      is the Gyroscope       invented by     M. Fessel of Cologne,         de
  scribed in its earlier form       in Poggendorff's       Annalen for September
  1853, and       which, with     some     improvements by Prof. Pliicker and
  some     further   modifications suggested by myself,            I take the present
  opportunity of bringing before the Royal Society.
     It is thus constructed      :  a beam is capable of moving freely round
 a  horizontal axis which is itself moveable round a vertical axis, so
 that the beam        may move in any direction round a fixed point                ;  at
one    end of the beam is fixed         a horizontal ring which carries       a heavy
                                                                          F 2

                                          44
disc, the axis of rotation of which is in       a  line with the beam    ; at the
opposite extremity is       a  shifting weight by means of which the equi
librium of the beam may be established or disturbed at pleasure.
                                  The Gyroscope.
    If the beam be brought into equilibrium,           and the disc be rapidly
rotated, by means of a thread unrolled from its axis, it will be seen
that the beam has no tendency to displace itself in any direction.
Not    so, however,      if the equilibrium    be   in any way disturbed ; on
moving the weight towards the centre of the beam, thus causing
the disc to preponderate, it will be observed that if the disc ro
tates    from right to left the beam          will   move  round    the vertical
axis also from right to left           ; and if the motion of the disc be
reversed the rotation of the beam will be reversed also.                      On
causing     the equipoise      to preponderate     contrary   effects  will take
place. The velocity of the rotation of the beam round the ver
tical axis increases in proportion to the disturbance of the equili
brium.      It will  also be observed that, notwithstanding       the increased
or diminished       action    of gravity on the disc, its axis of rotation
always preserves       the  same inclination to the vertical axis at which
it  has been    originally placed. The effect produced is a seeming
paradox.      When the equilibrium is disturbed while the disc is at
rest, the beam being placed in any other position            than the vertical,
gravity acts so as to turn it round a horizontal axis          ; but when the

                                              45
disc is     in motion the usual effect of gravity disappears, and there is
substituted for it a continued rotation round a vertical axis, that is,
round an axis perpendicular            to the plane which contains the axes of
the two       original rotations.
   A similar composition of forces takes place when the disc is caused
to rotate while the equilibrium of the beam is maintained, by im
pressing on the beam a rotation round the vertical axis. When the
disc rotates from right to left, the slightest pressure tending to pro
duce rotation round the vertical axis in the same direction, causes
the end of the beam          carrying      the disc to ascend, and a pressure in
the opposite direction causes           it to descend, that is, the      beam is con
strained to move round a horizontal axis perpendicular to the vertical
plane which contains the two axes of impressed rotation,               a case  exactly
analogous to the preceding.             The    beam ascends and descends        in like
manner, after rotation has spontaneously taken place round the ver
tical axis in consequence of the equilibrium being disturbed, when
ever     this rotation is any how accelerated or retarded              ;  the disc ro
tating from right to left and its weight predominating,                   the rotation
round the vertical axis is from left to right             ;  accelerating the latter
motion will cause         the disc to      descend, and retarding it will occa
sion it to ascend.
   As the centre of gravity of the beam is below its point of suspen
sion, even when equipoised it is in perfect equilibrium only when it
is horizontal,       consequently,     if it  be elevated   above or depressed      be
low this position it will endeavour to resume it, tending to produce
in the two        cases rotations    in opposite directions round         a horizontal
axis   ;   the rotation of the disc combined with this tendency gives
rise, as in the other cases        I  have mentioned, to a continued rotation
round the vertical axis.          If   the    disc rotate from right to left, and
the end of the beam carrying               it  be elevated above     the horizontal
position, the rotation round the vertical axis will be from right to
left ;    if, on the contrary, the        same    end  of the beam be depressed
below the horizontal position, that rotation will be from left to right.
   In all the experiments              above     mentioned the axis        of the ro
tating disc has remained in the prolongation                  of the  beam, but, by
means        of  an internal   ring     moveable     round    a  line perpendicular
thereto, this axis may be placed at any inclination                 and at any azi
muth with respect to it.          Very obvious considerations show that the

                                        46
inclination of this axis should produce no difference in the character
of the effects but merely in their intensity, since in any inclined po
sition of the disc its rotation is resolvable into two others, one per
pendicular     to the beam, and the other, which is incapable of pro
ducing any effect, in a plane containing it.          When the axis of the
rotating disc is vertical and at right angles to the beam, no rotation
on the vertical axis ought to take place in any case           ; but, contrary to
 this expectation, although        the beam be horizontal         and in perfect
 equilibrium,    a motion   round the vertical axis results, which is             in
 opposite directions according as one or the other end of the axis of
 the disc is uppermost.       It is, however,  easy to see that this      rotation
 is not owing to the same cause which gives rise to the phenomena
 hitherto considered, for whether it be accelerated or retarded no
 change is produced in the horizontal        position of the beam       ;  it is, in
 fact, occasioned by the friction of the pivots of rotation dragging
 the beam into a corresponding motion.          Attention to this extraneous
 cause    of rotation will explain numerous anomalies which present
 themselves in many of the instruments contrived to exemplify the
 phenomena of combined rotary motions.            It is  one of the advantages
 of Fessel's apparatus that the phenomena          may be exhibited        in their
 more important phases without being affected by this source of error.
     We may form      a clearer conception     of these phenomena by first
 considering some      simpler facts which do not appear to me to have
 been    hitherto  sufficiently   attended to.    For this purpose let the
 system    of rings carrying    the disc be removed        from the rest of the
 apparatus, and by unfastening the tightening               screw let the inner
 ring  be allowed to move freely      within the outer.      Having set the disc
 in rapid rotation, hold     the   outer ring at the extremities of the dia
 meter which is in the plane       in which the axis of motion of the disc
 is free to move, then giving to the outer ring         a  tendency to rotation
 round that diameter, it       will be observed that,     in whatever position
 the axis is, it will fly to place itself in the fixed axis thus determined,
  and rotation will take place round it in the same direction.               Consi
  derable resistance is felt so long as the moveable axis is changing
  its position,   but when once it coincides with the fixed axis the
  rotation of the external       ring round its diameter is effected           with
 facility.    A slight alternate motion of the outer ring, tending to
  give to it rotations in opposite directions, will occasion          a continued

                                           47
rotation of the moveable axis.             The   same result takes place when
an endeavour        is made to rotate the outer ring round an axis per
pendicular to its plane.         In all   cases when the axis of the rotating
disc is free to move       in  a plane, and the outer ring is constrained to
rotate round a line in this plane, the moveable axis will place itself
so as to coincide        with that line, and       so that the disc shall rotate
in the same direction as the ring          ; if the fixed axis     be in a different
plane the moveable axis         will assume permanently that position           in its
plane   which approaches nearest to the former.                  The   moveable   axis
is thus apparently attracted towards the fixed axis                 if  the rotations
are  in the    same direction,     and repelled from it       if  the rotations are
in opposite directions.
   In the experiments just described the free and constrained axes of
rotation intersect, but in Fessel's apparatus they are distant from each
other.      In  the latter case the rule must be thus modified, that the
free  axis of rotation tends to place itself parallel to the constrained
axis of rotation, or to as near a position thereto as possible. By this
principle all the results manifested are easily explained.                 The beam
being in equilibrium, a motion impressed on it round the vertical axis
causes   it to   ascend or descend, because       the axis of the rotating disc
tends to place itself parallel to the vertical axis of rotation and so that
the disc rotates in the impressed direction.            When      the equilibrium of
the beam is destroyed, gravity tends to make           it rotate round     a horizon
tal axis  ;   the axis of the disc endeavours to place itself parallel with
that axis, but both being unchangeably at right angles to each other,
the tendency to place itself there gives rise to             a  continued rotation.
Other results with this apparatus, to which              I have not yet adverted,
are  similarly explained. Fix the outer ring horizontally and loosen
the inner ring, keeping them both however in the same plane ; then,
on moving the beam round the vertical axis, the axis of the rotating
disc  will immediately fly to place itself parallel thereto, with rotation
of the disc in the impressed direction.           The rings being placed in the
vertical plane, the same result will take place            if the   beam be moved
in a vertical plane, i.     e. round a horizontal axis.
   The following additional experiments may be made with the rings
detached from the apparatus.               The results are necessary conse
quences of what has been previously explained               : —
   1.  Suspend, by means of          a string, the outer ring at the extremity

                                         48
of a diameter perpendicular          to the axis of the         inner  ring; and,
having loosened       the latter, place it at right angles to the former.
On causing       the disc to rotate, its axis      will retain its original posi
tion  ; but  if the slightest effort be made to turn the outer ring round
the vertical line, the axis of the rotating           disc will instantly fly into
this position, and the disc will move in the same direction as that of
the impressed rotation.
   2.   The horizontality     of the   loose inner      ring being restored, if a
weight be suspended from either end            of the axis of the disc, that axis
will, while it     preserves  its horizontal      or any inclined position,    re
volve round the vertical line; the direction of the motion            will change
if either the weight      be applied to the opposite end of the axis or the
disc rotate in the opposite direction.             If  this rotation be arrested,
gravity will immediately         cause    the   weighted     end of the axis to
descend.
   3. Clamp the rings together either in the same plane or at right
angles to each other, and fasten a string, in the first case, at the ex
tremity of a diameter coinciding with the axis of the inner ring, and
in the latter   case at the extremity    of a diameter perpendicular thereto.
Having    set the disc spinning,     if a  rotation round the vertical line be
given to the system the axis of the disc will ascend, carrying with it
the disc and rings notwithstanding           their weight, and, even when the
impressed rotation has ceased to act, will continue to rotate in the
same direction      until the motion of the disc        ceases.
   In this note     I have purposely avoided       entering into the mathema
tical theory of the phenomena, my intention                having been solely to
describe the apparatus exhibited and to give an intelligible account of
its effects.     Those who wish to investigate            the subject more pro
foundly,     will find  the best guide      in the Astronomer Royal's essay
on Precession and       Nutation published in his Mathematical Tracts.

I. " Account of     Researches in Thermo-electricity."          By Professor
       W. Thomson of Glasgow, F.R.S. Received April 20, 1854.
     5 I. On the Thermal Effects     of Electric Currents in    Unequally
                             Heated Conductors.
    Theoretical   considerations (communicated in December 1851 to
the Royal Society of Edinburgh), founded on observations which
had been made regarding the law of thermo-electric force in an un
equally heated circuit of two metals, led me to the conclusion that
an electric current must exercise           a convective effect on heat   in a
homogeneous metallic conductor of which different parts are kept at
different temperatures.       A special application of      the reasoning to
 the case  of a compound     circuit of copper and iron was made, and it
is repeated    here because   of the illustration it affords of the mecha
 nical principles on which the general reasoning is founded.

                                       50
   Becquerel discovered that      if one junction of copper and iron, in       a
circuit of the two metals, be kept at an ordinary atmospheric tem
perature, while the other is raised gradually to a red or white heat,
a current first sets from copper to iron through the hot          junction, in
creasing in strength only as long as the temperature is below about
300° Cent.; and becoming feebler with farther elevations of tempera
ture until it ceases, and a current actually sets in the contrary direc
tion when    a  high red heat is attained.         Many experimenters      have
professed themselves unable to verify this extraordinary discovery,
but the description which        M. Becquerel gives of his experiments
leaves no room for the doubts which some have thrown upon his
conclusion,    and establishes    the thermo-electric      inversion   between
iron and copper, not as        a  singular   case (extraordinary     and unex
pected as it appeared), but as a phenomenon to be looked for be
tween any two metals, when tried through           a  sufficient range of tem
perature, especially any two which            lie near one another in the
thermo-electric    series for ordinary temperatures.          M. Regnault    has
verified  M.   Becquerel's conclusion so far, in finding that the strength
of the current in a circuit of copper and iron wire did not increase
sensibly for elevations of temperature above 240° Cent., and began to
diminish    when the temperature considerably           exceeded    this limit  ;
but the actual inversion observed          by  M. Becquerel is required to
show that the diminution of strength in the current is due to a real
falling off in the electromotive force,     and not to the increased resist
ance known to be produced by an elevation of temperature.
   From Becquerel's discovery it follows that, for temperatures be
low a certain limit, which, for particular specimens of copper and
iron wire,   I have ascertained, by a mode of experimenting described
below, to be 280° Cent., copper is on the negative side of iron in the
thermo-electric     series, and on the positive side for higher tempera
tures  ; and at the   limiting temperature copper and iron         are thermo-
electrically   neutral to one another.         It follows, according to the
general mechanical theory of thermo-electric currents referred to
 above, that electricity passing from copper to iron causes the absorp
tion or the evolution of heat according           as the temperature of the
metals is below or above the neutral point            ; but neither evolution
nor absorption of heat,      if the temperature     be precisely that of neu
trality (a conclusion       which    I  have   already partially    verified  by

                                            ,-)L
experiment).      Hence,    if in  a   circuit of copper and iron,     one  junction
be kept about 280°, that is, at the neutral temperature, and the other
at any lower      temperature, a thermo-electric             current will set from
copper to iron through          the hot, and        from iron to copper through
the cold   junction   ;   causing the evolution of heat at the latter, and
the raising of weights too        if it   be employed to work an electro-mag
netic engine, but not causing the absorption of any heat at the hot
junction.      Hence there must be an absorption of heat at some part
or parts   of  the  circuit consisting solely of         one metal or   of the other,
to an amount equivalent to the heat evolved                at the cold junction,  to
gether with the thermal value of any mechanical effects produced in
other parts of the circuit.          The locality of this absorption can only
be where      the temperatures of the single metals                are non- uniform,
since the thermal effect of        a   current in any homogeneous uniformly
 heated conductor is always an evolution               of heat.   Hence there must
 be on    the whole an absorption of heat,                 caused    by the current
 in passing from cold to hot in copper, and from hot to cold in iron.
 When    a current is forced through              the circuit against the thermo
 electric force, the same reasoning establishes an evolution of heat to
 an amount equivalent to the sum of the heat that would be then
 taken in at the cold junction,            and the value      in heat of  the energy
 spent by the agency (chemical or of any other kind) by which the
 electromotive force is applied.               The aggregate reversible thermal
 effect, thus demonstrated        to exist in the unequally heated portions
 of the two metals, might be produced in one of the metals alone, or
 (as appears more natural to suppose) it may be the sum or difference
 of effects experienced by the two.               Adopting as a matter of form the
 latter supposition, without excluding the former possibility, we may
 assert that either there is absorption of heat by the current passing
 from hot to cold in the copper, and evolution, to a less extent, in the
 iron of the same circuit; or there is absorption of heat produced by the
 current    from hot to cold in the iron, and evolution of heat to                   a
 less amount in the copper           ;   or there must be absorption of heat in
  each metal,   with    the reverse effect       in  each case when the current is
  reversed.    The reversible effect in            a single metal of non-uniform
  temperature may be called            a  convection of heat     ;  and to avoid cir
  cumlocution, I shall express it, that the vitreous electricity carries heat
  with it, or that    the   specific heat of vitreous electricity is positive,

                                        52
when this convection is in the nominal              " direction of the current,"
and    I shall apply the      same   expressions to
                                                         " resinous electricity "
when the convection is against the nominal direction of the current.
It is established then that       one or other     of the following three hypo
theses must be true : —
    Vitreous   electricity   carries heat with it in an unequally heated
conductor whether of copper or iron             ;  but more in copper than in
iron.
    Or Resinous electricity carries heat with it in an unequally heated
conductor whether of copper or iron ; but more in iron than in
copper.
    Or Vitreous electricity carries heat with it in an unequally heated
conductor of copper, and Resinous electricity carries heat with it in
 an unequally heated conductor         of iron.
    Immediately after communicating this theory to the Royal Society
of Edinburgh,     I commenced trying to ascertain by experiment which
of the three hypotheses is the truth, as Theory with only thermo
electric data could not decide between them.               I had  a slight bias in
favour of the first rather than the second,              in consequence of the
positiveness which,       after Franklin, we habitually         attribute to the
vitreous electricity, and      a very strong feeling of the improbability       of
the third.    With the     able and persevering exertions        of my assistant,
Mr. McFarlane, applied to          the construction of various forms of ap
paratus and to assist me in conducting                experiments, the research
has been carried on,        with little intermission, for more than two
years.     Mr. Robert Davidson, Mr. Charles A. Smith, and other
friends have also given much valuable assistance              during the greater
part of this time, in the different           experimental     investigations   of
which results are now laid before            the Royal Society.         Only nu
gatory results were obtained until recently from multiplied                   and
varied experiments both on copper and iron conductors                   ; but the
theoretical anticipation was of such          a   nature that no want of expe
rimental evidence     could influence my conviction of its truth.          About
four months ago, by means of         a new form of apparatus,       I ascertained
that resinous electricity carries heat with it in an unequally heated iron
conductor.    A similar equally sensitive arrangement showed no                re
sult for copper.     The second hypothesis might then have been ex
pected    to hold; but to ascertain the truth with certainty I have

                                            53
continued ever since, getting an experiment on copper nearly every
week      with more and        more   sensitive arrangements, and at last, in
two experiments,          I have made out with certainty,        that vitreous elec
tricity carries heat with it in an unequally heated copper conductor.
    The third hypothesis is thus established            : a most unexpected con
clusion     I am  willing to     confess.
     I intend to continue the research, and I             hope   not only to ascer
tain the nature of the thermal effects in other metals, but to deter
mine its amount in absolute measure                in the most important cases,
and to find how        it varies, if at all, with    the temperature    ;  that is, to
determine the character (positive or negative) and the value of the
specific heat, varying or not with the temperature, of the unit of
current electricity in various metals.
    §  II.  On the  Law of Thermo-electric Force in          an unequally    heated
                                 circuit  of two Metals.
    A general relation between the specific            heats  of electricity in two
different metals, and the law of thermo-electric force, in a circuit
composed of them according to the temperatures of their junctions,
was established       in the communication        to the   Royal Society of Edin
burgh referred to above, and was expressed by an equation* which
may now be simplified by the thermometric assumption
((i. denoting Carnot's
                              function,   J Joule's equivalent, and    t  the tempe
rature measured from an absolute zero, about 273£° Cent. below the

in absolute measure, which the experimental researches recently made
by    Mr. Joule and myself establish          as not differing sensibly from the
scale     of the air-thermometer between ordinary limits.                  The  equa

perature t    ;  F the thermo-electric force in the circuit when the two
junctions are kept at the temperatures S and          T  respectively, of which
the former is the higher         ; and Gs the amount of heat absorbed per
unit of electricity crossing the hot junction. The following relation
 (similarly simplified in form) was also established : —

    These relations show how important it is towards the special ob
ject of determining the specific heats of electricity in metals, to in
vestigate the law of electromotive force in various cases, and to de
 termine the thermal effect of electricity in passing from one metal to
 another at various temperatures.            Both of these objects of research
 are therefore included       in the general investigation   of  the subject.
    The only progress I have as yet made in the last-mentioned
 branch of the inquiry, has been to demonstrate experimentally that
 there is a cooling or heating effect produced by a current between
 copper and iron at an ordinary atmospheric temperature according
 as it passes from copper to iron or from iron to copper,            in verifica
 tion of    a   theoretical conclusion      mentioned   above  :  but  I intend
 shortly to extend the verification of theory to a demonstration that
 reverse   effects   take place between those        metals at a temperature
 above their neutral point of about 280° Cent.            ; and  I hope also to
 be able to make determinations          in absolute   measure   of the amount
 of the Peltier effect for a given strength of current between various
 pairs of metals.
    With    reference   to laws of electromotive force in various cases,         I
 have commenced by determining              the order of several   specimens   of
 metals   in the thermo-electric      series, and have ascertained some very
 curious facts regarding varieties in this series which exist at different
 temperatures.        In this I  have only followed Becquerel's remarkable
 discovery, from which      I had been led to the reasoning and experimental
 investigation regarding copper and iron described above.               My way
 of experimenting        has been    to raise the temperature first of one
junction     as far as the circumstances admit, keeping the other cold,
 and then to raise the temperature of the other gradually, and watch
 the indications of a galvanometer during the whole process.              When
 an inversion     of the current is noticed, the changing temperature is

brought      back    till  the galvanometer shows no current             ; and then (by
a  process      quite     analogous     to that followed        by Mr. Joule and Dr.
Lyon Playfair           in ascertaining the temperature at which water is of
maximum density) the temperatures of the two junctions                              are ap
proximated, the galvanometer always being kept as near zero as
possible.        When the difference between any two temperatures on
each side      of the neutral point which give no current             is not very great,
their arithmetical mean will be the neutral temperature.                        A regular
deviation      of the      mean     temperature from the true neutral tempera
ture is to be looked            for with wide ranges, and a determination of it
would show the law according to which the difference of the spe
cific heat      of electricity in the two metals varies with               the tempera
tures  ; but     I  have not even as yet ascertained with certainty the ex
istence    of such       a deviation    in any particular      case.   The following       is
a  summary of the principal               results    I  have already obtained in this
department of the subject.
    The metals tried being, — three platinum wires (P, the thickest,
P. the thinnest, and             P3 one   of intermediate thickness), brass wires
 (B), a lead wire          (L'), slips of    sheet lead     (L), copper wires (C), and
 iron wire        (I), I    find that the specimens            experimented      on stand
 thermo-electrically           at different temperatures in the order shown
 in the following Table, and explained in the heading by reference                        to

     It must      be added,    by way of explanation,        that the bracket en
closing the symbols of any two of the metallic specimens indicates
that they are neutral to one another at the corresponding temperature,
and the arrow-head below one of them shows the direction in which
it  is changing its place with reference to the other,              in  the series,   as
the temperature is raised.            When there is any doubt          as to a posi
tion as      shown in the Table, the symbol of the metal is            a small letter
instead of a capital.
    The rapidity with which copper changes its place among                     some   of
the other metals (the platinums and iron) is very remarkable.                     Brass
also changes its place in the same direction possibly no less rapidly
than copper        ; and lead changes its place also in the same direction
but certainly less rapidly than brass, which after passing the thick
platinum wire (P,) at 130° Cent, passes the lead at 140°, the lead
itself having probably passed the thick platinum                 at some tempera
ture a little below 130°*.
    The conclusion        as regards specific heats     of electricity in the dif
ferent metals, from the equation expressing                  thermo-electric      force
given above, is that the specific heat of vitreous electricity is greater
in   each metal passing another from left to           right in the     series   as the
temperature rises than in the metal it passes            :  thus in particular,     —
    The specific heat      of vitreous electricity is greater     in copper than in
platinum or in iron        ; greater in brass than in platinum or in lead ; and
greater in lead than in platinum.
    It   is probable enough from the results regarding              iron and copper
mentioned above,           that the    specific heat of vitreous electricity          is
positive in brass       ; very small positive, or else negative, in platinum,
perhaps of about the same value as in iron.              It will not   be difficult to
test these speculations either by direct experiment on the convective
effects of electric currents        in the different metals, or by comparative
measurements         of thermo-electric     forces for various temperatures in
circuits of the metals, and         I trust to  be able to do so before long.
§  III.     On Thermo-electricity in crystalline metals, and in metals in a

cal theory         to the phenomena of thermo-electricity             in crystalline
metals,     I have been led to experimental investigation on this branch
of the subject.          The difficulty of obtaining actual metallic crystals
of considerable dimensions made it desirable to imitate crystalline
structure in various ways.              The analogies of the crystalline optical
properties which have been             observed in transparent solids, in a state
of strain, and of the crystalline structure as regards magnetic induc
tion which Dr. Tyndall's remarkable experiments show to be pro
duced not only in bismuth but in wax, thick paste of flour, and                 " the
pith of fresh rolls," by pressure, made it almost certain that pres
sure or tension on a mass of metal would give it the thermo-electric
properties of a crystal.            The only   case which    I have as yet had time
to   try, verifies this anticipation.            I  have   found that copper wire
stretched by a weight bears to similar copper wire unstretched,                   ex
actly the thermo-electric            relation which     Svanberg discovered in a
bar   cut equatorially from          a crystal of bismuth or antimony compared
with a bar cut axially from              a crystal of the same metal.         Thus I
found that       : —
    If  part of a circuit of copper wire be stretched by a considerable
 force and the remainder left in its natural condition, or stretched by
 a less   force, and      if either extremity of the stretched part       be heated,
 a  current sets from the stretched           to the unstretched   part through    the
 hot junction       : and    if the wire   be stretched and unstretched on the
 two sides of the heated            part alternately,   the current is reversed (as
 far as   I  have been able yet to test, instantaneously) with each change
     the tension.
     I intend to      make similar experiments on other metallic wires          ; also
 to try the effect of transverse as well as of longitudinal tension on
 slips of sheet metal with their ends at different temperatures, when
 placed longitudinally           in an electric circuit  ; and the effects of oblique
  tension on slips of metal similarly placed in a circuit, but kept with
  their ends at the same temperature and their lateral edges unequally
  heated.      I   have no doubt       of being    able so to verify every thermo
  electric characteristic of crystalline structure, in metals in            a state  of
  strain.

    on the two sides of        a heated        part the current is reversed along with
    the change of tension, always passing from the unstretched to the

    II. " An     Introductory Memoir upon Quantics."                                            By     Arthur
           Cayley, Esq., F.R.S.                  Received           April 20, 1854.
        The subject of Quantics is defined as the entire subject of rational
    and integral functions, and of the equations and loci to which these
    give rise, but the memoir relates principally to the functions called
    quantics;   a quantic being in fact a rational and integral                                        function,
    homogeneous in regard to a set of facients (x, y.                                   .),   or more gene
    rally homogeneous in regard to each of several such sets separately.

    represented by a notation such as
                                 (#)(*, y..                    yi.. )»'..),
    where the mark      #   is   considered as indicative of the absolute gene
    rality of the quantic.            The coefficients of            the different terms                    of the
    quantic may be either mere numerical multiples of single letters or
    elements, such as a,         b,   c, or     else functions          (in general rational and
    integral functions) of such elements this explains the meaning of
                                                               ;
    the expression the elements of quantic.   The theory leads to the
                                                 a
    discussion of the derivatives called covariants.                            Of      these covariants
    a   very general definition          is    given as follows,               viz. considering               the
    quantic (#)(*, y,   .)"»   (x', y'..)m'-    1).   and selecting any two facients of the
    same set, e. g. the facients x, y,                it   is   remarked that there                   is   always
    an operation upon the elements                    tantamount         as regards the quantic
    to the operation xdy, viz.           if    we differentiate               with respect to each
    element, multiply by proper functions                          of the elements and add, the

                                          59
result  will be that obtained by differentiating with dy and multi
plying by x.       And if the operation upon the elements tantamount
to       is represented     by {xdp}, then writing down the series of ope
    xdf
rations
                       {xdr}-xdr,   . . {*'d',\-x<dr,.  . .&c,
where     x , y are considered as being successively replaced by every
permutation       of two different facients of the        set  (x,y..), x*,y' by
every permutation of two different facients of the set             (x1, y'..) &c,
then  it is clear that the quantic is reduced to zero        by each  of the ope
rations    of the entire system, but this property is not by any            means
confined to the quantic        ; and    any function   having the property in
question, i.    e. every function which is reduced to zero by each ope
ration of the entire system, is said to be a covariant of the quantic.
The definition      is afterwards still further generalized, and its connec
tion explained      with the methods given, in the memoir ' On Linear
Transformations,' Camb. and Dub. Math. Journal, Old Series, t. iv.,
and New Series, t. i., and the ' Memoire sur les Hyperd^terminants,'
Crelle, t. xxx., and some other theorems given in relation to the
subject.      The latter part of the memoir relates to the theory of
the  quantic            y)m, and to the number of and relations between
the  covariants,     and as part of such theory to the beautiful law of
reciprocity of     MM.    Sylvester and Hermite.

"  On the relation of the Angular Aperture of the Object-Glasses
        of Compound Microscopes to their penetrating power and
        to Oblique     Light."    By   J.  W.   Griffith,    M.D., F.L.S.
        Communicated by        Arthur Henfrey,         Esq., F.R.S.     Re
        ceived  April 29, 1854.
    The explanation given      by Dr. Goring and others of the advantage
 of increased angular aperture in microscopic objective-glasses ap
pears to the author to be correct, as applied to the case of opake ob
jects, and accordingly       his remarks in the present communication
have reference to transparent objects only.
    It is known that delicate markings on        a transparent object, such
as the valve of a Gyrosigma, may be rendered more distinctly         visible
by using an object-glass of large aperture, by bringing the mirror to
one side, and by placing a central stop in the object-glass or the con
denser or in both    ;  the increased distinctness produced in these seve
ral ways being due to the illumination       of the object by oblique light.
 Experiment also shows that the degree of obliquity of the light re
quisite varies with the delicacy or fineness        of the markings, being
greater as these are more delicate ; so that the finest markings re
quire the most oblique light which can possibly be obtained to ren
der them evident, and the angular aperture of the object-glass must
necessarily be proportionately large, otherwise none of these oblique
rays could enter it.
    If the  parts of an object which refract the light are large in pro
portion to the power of the object-glass and of irregular form, they

                                          (11
will refract a certain number of rays, so that these cannot enter the
object-glass; hence certain parts will become dark, and will map out, as
it were, in the image formed of the object, the structural peculiarities
of the same.       But    if the parts are minute, of a curved form and ap-
proximatively      symmetrical, they       will act upon the light transmitted
through them in the manner of lenses, and their luminous or dark
appearance will vary according to the relation of the foci of these to
that of the object-glass.           Thus    the parts of an object may appear
dark and defined, from the refraction of the light out of the field of
the microscope      ;   also, from the concentration         or dispersion of por
tions of the light by these parts, all the rays being admitted by the
object-glass, or entering the field.
   Another condition affecting distinctness consists in the relation
which the luminousness or darkness of an object bears to that of the
field  or back ground upon which it is apparently situated.
   The refraction of the light out of the field of the microscope or
beyond the angle of aperture of the object-glass is the ordinary
cause    of the outlines of objects becoming visible ; and in these cases,
an increase of the angular aperture of the object-glass will impair
their distinctness, because it will allow of the admission of those
rays   which would otherwise           have    been refracted from the field, and
the margins      will    become     more  luminous      and less contrasted with
the   luminous field.
   The cause of         the   distinctness of an object by refraction         when
all or nearly      all the rays enter the field of the microscope, may
be   investigated      in a drop of oil immersed in water, or in            a  drop
of milk, as illuminated by light reflected from an ordinary mirror.
The     refractive    power of the globules is so great and their form
such, that each         acts   as a minute        spherical lens ;  and the    parts
within the margin will appear light or dark according to               the relation
of the focus of the little lens to that of the object-glass.             Under an
object-glass of small aperture and moderate power the outline will
appear black, because the marginal rays do not enter the object-glass.
If  the object-glass be of sufficient aperture to admit these marginal
rays, the black margin will disappear, and the little lens will only be
distinguishable       by the above focal relation.          Its appearance    under
oblique light (thrown          from all sides, as when the condenser and a
 central stop are used) will vary            ;  but taking the case of extreme

                                           62
 obliquity of the rays, the lens will only be visible by a luminous mar
 gin from reflexion,        giving it a very beautiful       annular appearance.
 Hence it is more distinct by direct, or slightly oblique, than by very
 oblique light.
    But in certain objects,        the irregularities    of structure  are of such
 extreme minuteness, or the difference of the refractive power of the
various portions of the structure is so slight, that the course of the
 rays is but little altered by refraction on passing through them, and,
 under ordinary illumination,         all the rays will enter the object-glass     ;
 neither are the rays accumulated into little cones or parcels, of suffi
 cient intensity to map out the little light or dark spots in the field
 of the microscope, according to the relation of their foci with that
 of the object-glass.
    Let us take the instance of an object with minute depressions on
the surface, as the valve of a Gyrosigma.             These are so minute, that
 when the light reflected from the ordinary mirror is used, the rays
passing through the depressed and the undepressed portions, are not
sufficiently refracted to cause          either set to be excluded from the
object-glass,     consequently       both sets will enter it.        The slightly
oblique     and converging        rays passing through         a  portion of the
valve become       separated     into   two sets,    one   passing through     the
thinner depressed portions, the other through the thicker and unde
pressed portions:      still both  sets enter the object-glass.      But on trans
mitting oblique light through the object, one set of the rays              will be
refracted so as not to enter the object-glass, whilst the           other set will
gain admission     ; thus the two parts, which have differently refracted
the rays,    will become distinct.        If the markings were more delicate,
or  if the difference between        the refractive power of the two portions
of the valve were      less, both sets would enter the object-glass.           But
on rendering the      light still more oblique, one         set would    be again
excluded by being refracted out of the field.                Hence it is evident
why the      angular aperture of the          object-glass    must be larger    as
the   markings     are   finer, or the difference between the refractive
power of the two portions of tissue is less            ;  because   the obliquity
of the light requisite will be very great to cause the exclusion
of one set of the rays, and the other set will be too oblique to
enter the object-glass unless it be of correspondingly large aperture.
This   is the explanation of the         advantage of oblique light.        It has

 no peculiar      power of rendering           objects distinct,   as has sometimes
 been believed, and the          following experiment,        supposed   to show such
 peculiar power, is really to be explained               on different grounds.      A
 piece    of net, or  some similar texture, is placed behind a hole made in
 a   window- shutter, and when thus viewed, the fibres                    are not well
 seen   ;  but when the texture is moved on one side, they become very
 distinctly visible, and this has been erroneously                 attributed to the
 illumination     by oblique light      ;   whereas the increased distinctness in
 the lateral     position     is owing      principally   to the circumstance that
 the object is then viewed on a dark instead of a white ground as                   in
 the first instance     ;   although it is also true that in this position the
 oblique rays, being reflected in large numbers from the fibres into
 the eye, contribute to the distinct vision             of  the object when viewed
 as  it then is upon a dark ground.
     The most difficult point has              been   to explain,    how an object-
 glass     of large angular         aperture     will render markings         evident,
 which were not visible under an object-glass of smaller aperture                ; be
 cause    it would naturally       be imagined that the larger aperture would
 admit both sets of rays, one of which                  was excluded by the ob
ject-glass of smaller aperture.              The difficulty vanishes when it is    re
 collected that the additional rays admitted by the object-glass of larger
aperture are more oblique            ; hence one set of these rays will be         re
fracted from the field of the microscope, whilst the other set will
enter the object-glass and will illuminate the more highly refractive
parts of the object       ;  thus the two kinds of differently refractive struc
ture become distinctly separated, one appearing dark, the other lumi
nous ; in fact, by means of the additional rays admitted by the larger
aperture we illuminate more highly one part of the object whilst the
illumination of the other is not increased.                   In short, the object is
illuminated,      first, by rays corresponding            to those   admitted by an
object-glass of small aperture            ; and, secondly, by the additional rays
admitted by the object-glass            of larger aperture. The first set not
being sufficiently oblique, no part of them is refracted beyond the
angular aperture of the object-glass ; the second, being more oblique,
are refracted out of the field by certain parts of the object and not
by others, and thus contribute to render its different parts distin
guishable by contrast of darkness and illumination.                   The first set of
rays, by illuminating all parts of the object, tend to diminish this

                                      64
contrast, and consequently do not add to but impair the discrimina
tive power of the object-glass for the fine markings of transparent
objects, and accordingly these are rendered more distinctly                visible
by intercepting the less oblique rays by means of a central stop.
    It has been here assumed that the oblique         light requisite for the
display   of the  markings upon objects      is   separated into two sets of
rays by refraction ; but the author observes that it might be ques
tioned whether they are not separated         by reflexion.     There can be
no doubt that the latter is not generally the case        ; perhaps the most
important reason which may be assigned for this is, the considerable
comparative breadth of the luminous           portions of the valve of the
Gyrosigma for instance.        On transmitting unilateral light obliquely
through     the valve  of an   Isthmia, in which the depressions are so
large, in such manner that part of it is reflected by portions of them,
it is easily  seen how small the amount       of reflected light   is ; and this
because    the surface  of the depressions     is curved, and thus the       por
tions inclined at the requisite angle for reflexion are also very small.
As the amount of light reflected is        so small in this case,       it would
be inappreciable in that of the Gyrosigma, in which the depressions
are so exceedingly minute.         In fact, attention   to this point affords
a ready means of distinguishing       whether an object is illuminated by
reflexion or refraction.
    The author next considers the relation of the penetrating power of
an object-glass     to its defining power.      Penetrating   power depends
upon angular      aperture, and     consequently on oblique light.            The
 question whether there be any essential difference between pene
 trating and defining power is best answered by experiment.                 If we
 take  a fragment of the valve of an Isthmia and examine it under a
 high power of small aperture, all the parts are very distinctly seen
 by the ordinary light of the mirror    ; and the various depths of shadow
 of the different parts of the depressions and the undepressed por
 tions render these also clearly distinguishable      ; and when an object-
 glass  of very large aperture is used, the distinctness is rather im
 paired than improved.      But if we examine a fragment of the valve
 of a Gyrosigma, and this requires an object-glass          of large aperture
 to render the markings visible, no distinction       of the various parts       of
 the depressions and the undepressed portions is visible        ; all we see is,
 that the depressions as    a   whole are dark and the undepressed por

                                         65
 tions are luminous.        Hence the Isthmia        requires defining power,
 whilst the Gyrosigma requires penetrating power or large angle of
 aperture to exhibit the markings ; yet the structures differ only in
 size. And there can be no doubt that if we could examine the valve
 of the Gyrosigma under a power as high relatively to the size of the
 depressions, as that under which           we can examine the Isthmia, the
 same relations being preserved        between the angle of aperture of the
 object-glass    and the angular inclination of the refracted rays, the
 various parts of the depressed         and undepressed portions would be
 equally recognizable in both cases.
    This is also true of fine lines scratched or etched on glass            ;  for
 although the coarser lines upon glass micrometers are well seen             with
 an object-glass      of small aperture with       good defining     power and
 direct light, yet the finest lines upon Nobert's            test-slide require
 penetrating power in the object-glass, and oblique light.            Large an
 gular aperture or penetrating power is but a very imperfect substitute
 for defining power — an important point which the author believes has
 not hitherto been noticed, and to which he would invite the earnest
 attention of object-glass makers.
    The author concludes by observing that his remarks                have been
principally   confined to one class         of objects requiring    penetrating
power, viz. the valves of the Diatomaceae.            This  has been done     ad
visedly, because the scales of insects, which may be regarded as form
ing the type of the other class, involve considerations              of a mixed
kind, which would        have tended    to confuse the subject.      The longi
tudinal ridges upon the scales of insects, in their relation to pene
tration, may be viewed as representing the undepressed portions of
the valves of the Diatomaceae        ; and the same explanation      will apply
to the visibility of both under various conditions.            The    transverse
lines seen upon the scales are not indications          of true structure   ; but
their origin, as also that of the lines seen upon the valves of the
Diatomaceae,      from circular    or angular depressions, does not come
within the conditions involved in         the principle which   it has been the
object here to elucidate.        It will suffice to   say that the true struc
tures producing       the appearance       of transverse markings      upon the
scales  of insects   are best resolved by small angular aperture and good
definition.
    It has  been   assumed    also, that the markings upon the valves of
VOl.    Vii.                                                          B

                                    fifi
the Diatomaceae   arise from depressions.    This  can be proved to be
the case   in the larger ones (Isthmia, &c); and there is sufficient
evidence  to render it at least highly probable in the remainder.  But
this is an unessential point as regards the principle, and therefore it
has not been dwelt upon.

      May 18, 1854.
   The author commences with the following preliminary remarks            : —
   " The
          part taken by the Royal Society in promoting, by its influence
with Government, the establishment of the Colonial Magnetic Ob
servatories,  and in drawing up instructions for the guidance        of those
who were employed in them, makes         it the duty  of the person charged
with their superintendence, to spare         no pains to place before the
Fellows, on suitable occasions, the results of researches       designed to
obtain a foundation    of facts, on which     a correct theory  of the mag
netic variations might be framed, and an insight be gained into the
nature  of the physical agency by which they are produced.
   " In this first stage of scientific inquiry, when we have only the
phenomena themselves to guide us in their classification, or to indi
cate by apparent correspondences the existence          of some causal con
nexion   of which we   have   no other knowledge       than that which the
observations   themselves may afford, the first difficulty       to be met
consists,  in disentangling    from the complication in which the mag-
   VOl.   Vii.                                                     i

 netic variations proceeding from different causes first present them
 selves,   the effects which   may appear to be due to certain amongst
 them   ; and in presenting these in some methodical order or arrange
 ment, which may best assist the physicist or the mathematician in
 his conception of the problem or problems, to the solution of which
 he may desire to apply himself.
    " The first and most obvious separation of        the magnetic variations
 is into those which are presented        at one time at different parts of
 the earth's surface, and have special reference therefore to space           ; and
 those    which present themselves      at different times at one and the
 same place, and have special reference therefore to time.               It is the
 object of magnetic surveys to collect the facts of the first, and of
 magnetic observatories the facts of the second, of these primary divi
 sions.    The present communication        belongs to the second, and re
 gards the variations depending upon time at             a  single station (St.
 Helena).
    " Still, however, the phenomena         even at a single station are too
 complicated for ready comprehension,         and stand     in  need  of further
 subdivision.     This is  most  satisfactorily effected     by the customary
 separation into three classes,       or elements   as they are       frequently
 termed, the Declination,      the Inclination,   and the Intensity of the
 Directive Force.      The discussion is limited on      the present occasion
to a single element, the Declination,         and to a portion only of the
 results obtained by the observations of that element at St. Helena."
    After premising     a description   of the instrument       with which the
 observations were made, and of the mode of observing and of record
ing the observations, which is omitted        here because     it may   be found

in the Introduction to the first volume of the         St. Helena Magnetical
 Observations,' the author proceeds to the conclusions which he de
sires to notice, and to the manner in which these have been obtained,
which we follow, by adopting, as nearly as may be convenient, his
own words.
    "Before we attempt to examine those periodical variations, or
fluctuations about a mean value, which, from their having for periods,
for example, the solar year or the solar day, we naturally refer to
causes depending      in some way upon the earth's place         in its orbit re
latively to the sun, or to the earth's revolution round its axis, it is
desirable to examine, and if practicable, to eliminate the effects of a

                                        69
variation which we have reason to believe belongs intrinsically              to the
magnetism of the earth itself.         The geographical    aspect,    if we may
so  express it, of the terrestrial     magnetism, or the different measure
in which the magnetic force exists at different parts of the earth's
surface,  and the different directions which a magnet assumes in dif
ferent places by virtue    of this force,     so far from being permanent,
are found to be subject to a continual change, which differs from                  all
other magnetic variations       with which     we are acquainted, inasmuch
as  it does not present to      us the character     of an oscillation of the
phenomena around       a mean    value in periods of greater or less dura
tion, but appears,    especially when viewed generally in its operation
over the whole globe, as a continuously          progressive change      ;   it   has
                                                            '
for this reason received the appropriate name of              secular    change.-
It is possible indeed that the magnetism of the earth may                       have
its periods, — that  the phenomena existing at one and the same epoch
over the whole surface of the globe may be identically          reproduced at
a  subsequent epoch, — and that what           has been   called the secular
change of each of the magnetic elements, which we perceive to be in
progress at any particular       point of the surface, St. Helena for ex
ample, may be part of       a  succession of changes which operate               in  a
cycle, of which the duration, vast as it          may be, may hereafter be
found to be calculable.       But    as far as our knowledge has yet gone,
it is insufficient  to justify the assumption of even approximate pe
riodical  laws   of this variation of the terrestrial magnetism ; and
we must continue to regard         it therefore for the present    as a secular
change, of which the period,        if there be one, or the periods,       if there
be more than one,      are as yet unknown.         But although      the secular
change has no intrinsic relation, as far as we have been able to dis
cover,  to any of the periods of time determined by other phenomena,
either of our own planet or of any other of the heavenly bodies, it is
obvious that we may assign the average rate at which the change is
taking place, in any of the magnetic elements and at any particular
station (the declination for example at St. Helena), corresponding to
any definite measure of time in usage amongst us (say for example
a month, or the twelfth part of a solar year), by taking the successive
differences between the monthly means of all the hourly observations
in the first and second months of their continuance,           then between
the second and third months, then between the third and fourth, and
                                                                   i  2

                                          70
  so on.     By thus proceeding in the case of the Declination at St. He
  lena, we have sixty differences thus accruing             in the five years   of
  hourly observation, by which we          find that the monthly increase of
  West Declination during       these    five years amounted on the average
  to 0'-657, or to an annual increase of 7'-88.
      " It is not however               for this investigation that the system
                            necessary
  of observation should     be hourly  :   a much less onerous system      is suf
  ficient, provided that the observations be distributed equably through
  the year, and     that the intervals between the observations of each
  day be, approximately at least, equidistant.            Before the commence
  ment of the hourly series       there had been fifteen months of two-
 hourly observations, and after its close           the observations were con
 tinued for twenty-one        months more at five hours of each day, the
 hours being such as to give by their combination a true mean value
 for each day. We are thus enabled to take in           a more  extended period,
 amounting to ninety-six        consecutive months, or eight years, from
 which to derive the average        rate    of secular change at St. Helena.
 Proceeding as     before, we find for this period an average rate of 0'-661
 for the increase of West Declination          in  a month,    or an annual in
 crease of 7'-93   in  a solar year.      During    these  eight years the hori
 zontal magnetic direction at St. Helena had consequently changed
 altogether rather more than one degree.
     " When the number of      years are few from which an annual average
rate of secular change is derived, it is necessary           to be particular  in
regard to the regular distribution          of the observations     as to months
and hours, because observations made at one time of the year or at
one hour of the day, are not strictly comparable            with  those made at
other times of the year or at other hours of the day, unless indeed
corrections based on a long series of observations at the same spot
or in its vicinity are applied for the annual and diurnal variations.
But when the periods of comparison include intervals of consider
able length, the comparative influence of the annual and diurnal
variations is greatly diminished,        and,  if the comparison extend over
a  great number of years, it may practically be disregarded. Now, St.
Helena being a naval station, and frequently visited by navigators
of our own and other countries, who have had the requisite knowledge
and have been at the pains to take the necessary precautions to
make trustworthy       observations, we are able to collect from the nar-

                                           71
 natives  of their voyages     a succession       of determinations of the Decli
 nation,  all made at the      same   spot, namely, at the one anchorage at
 St. Helena,    which extend over        a period     of 236 years, or from     1610
 to 1846.      The following Table contains eleven such determinations,
all  from authorities of high repute, which are fortunately so far
equably    distributed in respect to the years when they were made, as
to  throw light not only upon the average amount of the secular
change    of declination during that long period, but also in            a consider
able   degree upon the regularity, or uniformity with which the change
has  taken place.       By treating these        eleven determinations according
to  well-known methods, we obtain                1 1° 48' as the west declination
corresponding       to the middle epoch, the year 1763, and 8'-05 as the
most probable      rate of the annual increase during the 236 years.

    " We have       here then a    striking example of         the magnitude     and
 character    of the changes wrought          at a particular station by this very
 remarkable     feature of the earth's magnetic force.            In less than two
 centuries and a half, the horizontal direction which a magnet takes at
 St. Helena by virtue of the terrestrial magnetic force has been found
to have changed more than 30°, or more than a twelfth part of the
whole circle     : and when we further examine the facts more                closely,
 we find reason to conclude that this great change has taken place
by a steady, equable       and uniform progression throughout the whole
period.      The   rate  of annual     change      derived from the eight years
during which the observations were maintained by the detachment

                                                      72
of the Royal Artillery stationed at the Observatory (7'-93) differs so
slightly from that derived from the observations made at the anchor
age        from the earliest period at which                       observations are recorded
(i.   e.   8'-05), that we may practically regard them as the same.                                    To
examine whether this has been                        a   uniform rate throughout               the 236
years, or otherwise, the same calculation which gives 8'-05 as the
most probable average rate of change between 1610 and 1846,                                           will
give also for each of the years in which the Declination                                was observed
the most probable values                      of the Declination           corresponding to the
same rate of change supposed                        uniform.      These calculated values are
placed in the Table opposite to the years to which each belongs, and
adjoining the observed                    values.        The differences        are shown        in the
next column.               On inspecting            these, we perceive         that not one of the
differences exceeds the limits, which, with                        a   due consideration         of the
irregularities to which magnetic observations made on board ship are
liable, may be ascribed to accidents of observation                            ;   and, what     is   still
more important, that they   fall indiscriminately to the                            east and to the
west of the values calculated on the supposition of                                 a   uniform rate,
and without              the slightest appearance                of any systematic character
which might indicate that the rate had been otherwise than regular.
We     have reason to conclude, therefore, that, from the earliest date to
which we can refer, the progression of secular change at St. Helena
has gone on from year to year, as nearly as may be,                                 in   one uniform
annual rate.
  " The instruction to                 be derived from the             St. Helena observations
does       not however stop here.                    By     a   suitable   arrangement of the
observations of the eight years, they may be made to show that,
when allowance                is   made      for comparatively very small irregularities
superimposed upon the regular                         march of the phenomenon by dis
turbing causes which                  will    be treated of in the sequel, the average
annual change takes place by equal aliquot portions in each month
of   the year.           The eight years of observation commenced with June
1841       :   if   we take    a    mean of the eight monthly means                      in   the eight
Junes from           1   841 to 1848, we shall have a better assured                     mean value
of the Declination                 corresponding         to the month of June, than              if   we
had confined ourselves to                    a   single year.        If we     then do the same
with the eight Julys, and with                       each   of the other months in             succes
sion, we shall have twelve monthly values                            for   a   year commencing

                                           73
  with  June and ending with May, which will represent in                         a simple
  and condensed form the means of the whole eight years.                        These are
  exhibited   in the next table, and we perceive at the first view that
  the increase    of west declination is progressive in each month of the
  year without     a  single exception.       If  we desire to examine further
  the degree of approximation which these values present to a progres
  sion absolutely uniform, we may apply an aliquot portion of the an
  nual value (7'-93) to each of the monthly means corresponding to
  the difference   in time from  the mean epoch (December 1)                .   These ali-

 by the third column, containing the mean declinations of the year
 deduced severally from the observation-values in the different months,
 with the correction for secular change assumed uniform applied, how
 very nearly the results derived from the several months approximate
 to one and the same value.         The small differences which are shown
in the last column are for the most part such as would probably dis
appear     by a longer continuance of the observations                  ;  but we may
notice, by the character of the signs, that there is also visible amongst
them the indication of a comparatively very small semi-annual affec
tion, depending on the sun's position on either side of the equator,
which    will be reverted to when treating of superimposed effects.
    " The same features of regularity and uniformity are manifested if
the examination be further pursued into shorter periods, by comparing
with each other the twenty-six fortnightly means in the year ; but

                                      74
enough has been already stated to show the magnitude, the regula
rity, and the systematic character of the changes called secular,
which are thus produced by forces in constant operation at the sur
face of our planet.      In our entire inability to connect    these changes
with any other of the phenomena of nature, either cosmical or ter
restrial, we appear to have no other alternative than to view them as
a  constituent feature of the terrestrial magnetic force itself, and as
one  of its most    remarkable characteristics, not to be overlooked by
those   who would      seek to explain   the phenomena of that force        by
means    of a physical    theory.  The attempts which       have sometimes
been   made    to explain them by a supposed connection           of the ter
restrial magnetic phenomena with the distribution         of land and sea at
the surface of the globe, or with the distribution          of heat on that
surface, or by electrical currents excited by the rotation of the earth
on its axis, contain no provision to meet a systematic variation of
this nature  ;  and break down altogether when the facts of the secu
lar change are duly apprehended.         From the phenomena of        a single
element at a single station,       as here    presented, we may         assure
ourselves that effects proceeding with so much order and regularity,
which we cannot ascribe to any other cause than that of the ter
restrial magnetism itself, and cannot therefore separate from its other
manifestations, must find a place in any physical theory which pro
fesses to explain the phenomena       of the earth's magnetism. To learn
the changes in this and in the other magnetic elements which are
simultaneously in progress in other parts of the globe, and to appre
hend their mutual        connexion   and   the general system      of secular
change which they indicate, it is necessary       that the facts should be
collected in the same manner as at St. Helena, at a great number of
stations distributed over the earth's surface, and that, they should be
studied both separately and together.          This may indeed appear a
work of labour    ;  but it is the most certain,   if not  the   only certain
 mode of arriving at a correct knowledge        of phenomenal laws, when
the laws of their causation are wholly unknown.         In this,   as in simi
lar studies, however complex the phenomena may appear at the first
aspect, — and it is fully admitted that those of the secular magnetic
change do appear extremely complex at the first view, — the mind
soon   begins to recognize order amidst apparent irregularity,             and
system amidst incessant variation.        The order    and   regularity with

                                            75
which we      are impressed at a single station are soon perceived to cha
racterize,    in    an equally    remarkable manner,          a  general systematic
change taking place connectedly over the whole surface of the globe,
and which can everywhere be traced to have been continuously in
operation since the earliest epoch of magnetic observation. To those
who find pleasure in tracing               phenomena of great apparent com
plexity to laws of comparative simplicity which appear to embrace
them all, this study affords its own repayment ; and it is indis
pensable towards the acquisition                of  a   knowledge     of the  laws of
terrestrial    magnetism.        By  a comparison of the isogonic lines cor
responding       to different epochs        (lines of equal Magnetic Declina
tion employed          by Halley and since found so useful in generali
 sation in this branch of the magnetic phenomena), we perceive
 that a secular change of the Declination, almost identical with
 that at St. Helena, has prevailed at the same time over the greater
 part of the southern Atlantic        ;  and that from the form of the isogonic
 lines in that quarter of the globe (which has undergone very little
 variation in the last 200 years), the regularity of the progression,
 and its persistence in the same direction, is in accordance                 with that
 general progressive motion from east to west, which magneticians
 have   long since recognized as distinguishing the general systematic
 change in the southern hemisphere from that in the northern, which
 takes    place    in the opposite direction        ;  whilst from   the form of the
 isogonic lines in that quarter, we may further anticipate that, at St.
  Helena, the secular change of the Declination                will continue to   take
 place in the same direction as at present, until the line drawn through
 the conical      summits of the isogonic curves shall in its western pro
 gress pass the geographical meridian of that station."
     The author then        proceeds     to the Variations      which are found to
 take place     in periods corresponding to           a solar year and a solar day     ;
 a  correspondence which, he remarks,
                                                  "  enables us to recognize a phy
 sical connexion,       although we are still uncertain as to the mode of
 operation between cause and effect.                  A correct knowledge of       the
 phenomena themselves           is the    surest guide to a correct judgement
 amongst the many theories which have been propounded in anticipa
 tion of that knowledge        ;  and  I  have therefore taken this opportunity
  of bringing before the Society a careful analysis of the primary an
  nual and diurnal variations at St. Helena attributable to solar                influ

                                             76
  ence, in the belief that they        will  be found to place in a very distinct
  light  some points which are important to be kept              in view in framing
  or in judging of such theories."              For this purpose diagrams were
  exhibited, representing         on a large scale    the mean diurnal variation
  of the Declination at St. Helena in the different months of the year,
  and the annual variation at each of the twenty-four hours, both de
  rived from the mean of five years of hourly observation               ; the secular
 change having been previously eliminated, these diagrams were re
 garded by the author as exhibiting               what might be considered as
 typical views of the annual and diurnal variations, correct in their
 relations to the mean Declination in the year, or to the arithmetical
 mean     of all the hourly observations in the year, taken as zero. As
 on the first aspect the diurnal phenomena in the several months are
 seen to separate       themselves      into two groups, having the equinoxes
 as at least approximate epochs             of separation, the months in which
 the sun is north of the equator were coloured red, and those in which
 he is south     of the equator were coloured blue.
     Having     in these     diagrams      the conjoint   representation       of two
 distinct    classes   of phenomena, a diurnal          variation in each of the
 months, and an annual variation at each of the hours, the author
 proceeded     to treat of each of these variations separately, commencing
 with the annual, which           he illustrated   by taking the hour of        7 a.m.
 as an example, and (referring             to the diagram) showing          the order
 and succession of the several            months in the annual cycle at that
 hour, which are as       follows : — in April the     mean declination is about
 half  a minute east      of the mean declination in the year ; in May about
 2' east; in June about            2'j east; in July and August, when the
sequence is slightly irregular, respectively          2'-l and 2'-6    east  ; in Sep
tember the declination           is again approaching the mean line, being
less than     l'\ east  of it ; in October it    has passed the mean line, being
about    l'J west    of it; November, December, January and February
are    congregated near the western extremity of the annual range,
whilst in March we perceive that             the declination   is again approach
ing the mean line, and in April it           has passed to the east of the mean
line.    " We    have here, then," the author proceeds,           " in  the success
ive changes of the declination in the course of the year, the general
fact of the existence of an annual variation, of which, at the solar hour
of   7 a.m., selected as an example, or when the sun is five hours east

                                       77
of the meridian, the phenomena are such as have been thus cursorily
described. Were there no annual variation at that hour the different
months would all have the same mean declination, and the extended
figure, which in the diagram represents the annual cycle, would
be concentrated into one point.          The annual variation differs con
siderably at the different hours     ;  but it is a general feature amongst
them that     the months on either side        of the   one   solstice are either
congregated together towards one extremity                of  the annual range
at the hour,    whilst the months on either         side  of the opposite sol
stice  are  similarly  congregated at the opposite extremity,               or the
months of both solstices are contemporaneously                    in pretty   rapid
transition   from the one extremity to the other.                It is this annual
variation which has been overlooked in the supposition entertained
by a very eminent authority,      that in the vicinity of the equator the
magnetic direction would be found to be constant at all hours of
the day and night.       If we group together the monthly                 means   of
each   period of six months separated           by the equinoxes,         we have
two semiannual        mean  lines,     each    differing    comparatively      very
slightly from any one of the months of which it is composed, but
the two differing very greatly from each other, and both differing
very considerably from the mean diurnal march in the year.                         If
the latter line, viz. the mean diurnal march          in the year, be projected
as a straight line, as is done in the zero-line        of fig.   1  in the annexed
woodcut, the semiannual groups take respectively the forms exhibited
in that figure, the continuous line being the semiannual march in the
half year when the sun is north of the equator, and the dotted line
the semiannual march when the sun is south               of the equator.       It is
in this form that the phenomena of the annual variation in different
parts of the globe may be most advantageously compared with each
other.     Fig. 2 represents the analogous phenomena at                 Toronto in
43° north, and fig. 3 those     at Hobarton in 43° south latitude.             The
semiannual groups at Toronto and Hobarton                have been obtained       in
precisely the same manner as those at St. Helena               ;   the scale is the
same    in the three figures, i.   e. -5  of an inch to l'-0 of Declination,
the dotted and continuous lines refer respectively to the same periods
of the year, and the zero line is in          each   figure the mean diurnal
variation in the year at the station.
    " In viewing  these three figures,   it is scarcely possible to doubt that

 they represent substantially        the same phenomenon.             The magni
 tude and inflexions of the curves are not indeed identical, but they
 approach so near to it that we may well suppose the small differ
 ences   to be very minor modifications          which will some day receive
 their explanation,     It will  be remarked that during the hours when
 the sun is above the horizon and the effects are greatest, the corre
 spondence of the phenomena at the three stations is most striking,
 and that there is no inversion       of the phenomena in       the opposite hemi
 spheres  ; in both (as well as at St. Helena, in the tropics), the De
 clination is easterly of the mean in the forenoon and westerly in the
 afternoon when the sun is north of the equator, and the reverse
 when the sun is south of the equator.            The   effects   are the same at
 the three stations, though        in the one      hemisphere the sun being
 north of the equator corresponds to         summer,    and in the other hemi
 sphere   to winter  ;  whilst in the tropics this distinction of          seasons
 almost ceases to be sensible, and the epochs of maximum and mini
 mum of temperature do not correspond with either of those of the
 extra-tropical  stations.    The phenomena thus represented              embrace
 above 86° of latitude, presenting not only almost extreme contem
poraneous diversities of climate, but also not less remarkable diver
sities of absolute dip, declination and magnetic force.
    " No doubt     can,  I apprehend,       be entertained       that the annual
variation which is here represented, is attributable, primarily, to the
earth's revolution round the sun in           a period of the same duration
and   in an orbit inclined to   the equator.      But in what way, it may        be
asked,   does  the sun superimpose upon the earth's magnetism this
comparatively small but systematic magnetic variation ? The simi
larity of effect, amounting almost indeed to identity at the hours
when the sun is above the horizon of the station, taking place at
stations where both the climatic and the terrestrial               magnetic con
ditions are so dissimilar,     seems to remove        it altogether from those
physical connexions, which         have   so   often and in so many various
ways been referred to as affording possible explanations of the mag
netic variations.    In this difficulty    some assistance may perhaps be
afforded by examining       more    closely, by means        of the St. Helena
observations, the epochs      when the phenomena of one of the semi
annual groups passes into the very dissimilar               phenomena of the
other semiannual       group.     This    has    been   stated to     take   place

                                          80
approximately      at the    equinoxes.      The   approximation,    particularly
at the September equinox, is very distinctly and definitely marked.
The day of the equinox is the 21st of September; if a mean be
taken of the diurnal         march in the three weeks from the 1st to the
21st of September,          the line     which   represents it scarcely differs
sensibly at any hour of the twenty-four from the mean line of the pre
ceding half-year, taken from the 22nd of March to the 20th of Sep
tember    ; thus showing that the phenomena of that semiannual group
are unchanged up to the time of the equinox.               If in the same way a
mean be taken of the diurnal march in the three weeks following the
 21st of September, the line which represents them shows that the
 passage from the phenomena of one semiannual group to those of the
 other has not only commenced, but that in half the period of three
 weeks, i.   e. within   eleven days of the equinox, the change has already
 advanced    very far towards its completion        ; and by the middle of Oc
 tober it is found to be quite complete, the mean in October retaining
 no trace of those        semiannual characters which had undergone no
 modification ten days before the equinox."              The facts thus stated
 were illustrated by diagrams.
    " At the March equinox             the   commencement of the change is
 equally definite    :  no trace of change can be discovered in the mean
 from the 1st to the 20th of March,             when compared with the mean
 of the six months from the 22nd of September to the 20th of March                ;
 the change then commences,            but from some cause not yet apparent,
 the conversion from the phenomena             of the  one half-year to those    of
 the other is effected         less  rapidly at this than at the September
 equinox. The mean of the month of April retains the distinct traces
 of the group which it has quitted, and is in fact a month of transition
 between the two groups, but in May the conversion is quite com
 plete  ;  the phenomena of that month have no characteristic distin
 guishable from those of June,          July and August.
     " From what       has been stated     in the preceding paragraphs, it will
 be evident that the epochs         of the sun's passage of the equator have a
  very marked influence on the phenomena under consideration,                  and
  that the influence is the same and produces similar effects whether
  the station itself be north or south of the equator, and however di
  verse may be its climatic or magnetic conditions.              The semiannual
  characteristics continue unchanged up to the days of the respective

                                       81
 equinoxes   ; these form the epochs when the transition from the cha
 racters of the one semiannual group to those of the other commences,
 the transition being completed a very few days after the September
 equinox, but somewhat less rapidly after the March equinox.            Like the
 changes in the induced magnetism of ships, which follow immediately
the changes     in the terrestrial magnetism corresponding         to the ship's
 altered geographical position, but complete the change only after in
 tervals of time of greater or less duration, so the changes which we
 are here considering appear      to commence      at the equinoxial epochs,
 but to require a greater or less interval of time for their completion."
    The divergence of      the semiannual groups at the different hours
 from a mean march in the year has been shown in figs.             1, 2 and 3  by
 their comparison with the latter projected as straight lines, because
 the accordance of the divergence at the three stations is seen thereby
 in its simplest form.     In another diagram the lines thus projected as
 straight lines were exhibited in their true Declination values, and com
 pared with a Zero-line representing at each station the mean Decli
 nation in the year.    " In  the previous comparison of the annual varia
 tions at the three stations with each other, it was shown that there
 is no inversion, or contrariety, between the phenomena at Toronto and
 Hobarton as representatives of opposite hemispheres, the same semi
 annual group diverging (during the hours of the day when the cha
 racters are most marked) in the same direction at the same hours at
 both stations. But markedly opposite characteristics are shown when
 we compare the divergences of the mean diurnal variation                 in  the
 year from the zero-line at different stations        ;  these divergences, so
 far from according with each other at the two stations, present a
strong contrast throughout;        the divergence at Toronto being to the
east at the hours when at Hobarton         it is to the west, and vice versd.
St. Helena, moreover, which         agrees  with both      the other stations in
the divergences of the semiannual groups, differs from both in those
of the   mean of the whole year.       The phenomena of the solar annual
variation   superimposed upon those of the solar diurnal variation, —
and those of the solar diurnal variation itself, —are in this respect
contradistinguished     by important differences.
    " To  have completed the view      of the solar variations of     the Decli
nation at St. Helena would have required            a   notice of the so-called
irregular disturbances of that element, which are now known to have

                                  82
a  periodical character dependent on solar hours    ;   and also of the  re
markable cycle which is found to pervade all the magnetic variations
depending upon the sun, corresponding       in its period and epochs
with those of the phenomena of the solar      spots   ;  but as both these
subjects have been recently brought before the Society in separate
memoirs, the author does not think it necessary to do more than
merely advert to them on the present occasion."

     The following papers were read      : —
 I. The      Bakerian Lecture. — " On Osmotic Force."                    By
        Professor Graham, V.P.R.S.
    This  name   was applied to the power by which liquids are im
pelled through moist membrane and other porous septa in experi
ments of endosmose      and exosmose.      It was shown that with    a solu
tion of salt on one side of the porous septum and pure water on the
other side (the condition of the osmometer of Dutrochet when filled
with a saline solution and immersed in water), the passage of the
salt outward is entirely by diffusion, and that a thin membrane does
not sensibly impede that molecular process.         The movement is     con
fined to the liquid salt particles, and does      not influence the   water
holding them in solution, which       is entirely passive  : it requires no
further explanation.     The flow of water inwards, on the other hand,
     VOl.  Vii.                                                   K

affects sensible masses          of fluid, and is the only    one of the movements
which can be correctly described as a current.                 It is   osmose,      and the
work of the osmotic force to be discussed.
    As diffusion          is always a double movement — while             salt diffuses
out, a certain quantity of water necessarily diffusing in at the same
time in exchange — diffusibility might be imagined to be the osmotic
force.     But the water introduced into the osmometer in this way
has   always a definite relation to the quantity of salt which escapes,
and can scarcely rise in any case above four or six times the weight
of salt, while the water entering the osmometer often exceeds the
salt leaving        it,   at least one hundred times.         Diffusion       is   therefore
quite insufficient to account for the water current.
  The theory which refers osmose to capillarity appears to have no
better foundation. The great inequality of ascension assumed among
aqueous fluids        is    found not to exist, when their capillarity              is   cor
rectly observed       :    and many of the saline solutions            which give rise
to the greatest osmose are undistinguishable                 in ascension from pure
water itself.
    Two    series     of experiments on       osmose were described, the                 first
series made with the use of porous mineral                   septa,    and the second
series    with animal membrane.              The earthenware osmometer con
sisted of the porous cylinder             employed in voltaic batteries, about
5   inches in depth, surmounted by an open glass tube 0-6 inch in dia
meter, attached to the mouth              of the cylinder by      means of         a   cap   of
gutta percha.             In conducting   an experiment      the cylinder was filled
with any saline solution to the base of the glass tube,                and immediately
placed in   a   large jar of distilled water      ;   and as the fluid within the
instrument rose in the tube, during the experiment, water was added
to the jar so as to prevent inequality of hydrostatic pressure.                          The
rise (or fall) of liquid in the tube was highly uniform, as observed
from hour to hour, and the experiment was generally terminated in
five hours.  From experiments made on solutions of every variety of
soluble substance,  appeared that the rise or osmose
                            it                         quite insig       is
nificant with neutral organic substances in general, such as sugar,
alcohol, urea, tannin, &c. so also with neutral salts of the earths
                                    ;
and ordinary metals, and with chlorides of sodium and potassium,
nitrates of potash and soda and chloride of mercury.                      A    more sen
sible but still very moderate osmose              is   exhibited by hydrochloric,

                                         85
 nitric, acetic, sulphurous,     citric and tartaric acids.       These are sur
 passed by the stronger        mineral acids, such as sulphuric        and phos
 phoric acid and sulphate of potash, which are again exceeded by
 salts  of potash and soda possessing either          a decided acid or alkaline
 reaction, such as binoxalate of potash, phosphate of soda and car
 bonates     of potash and soda.        The highly osmotic substances were
 also found to act       with most advantage in small proportions, pro
ducing in general the largest osmose in the proportion of one-quarter
per cent, of salt dissolved.         Osmose is eminently the phenomenon
of weak solutions.        The   same substances are likewise         always che
mically active bodies, and possess           affinities which enable     them to
act upon the material of the earthenware septum.                  Lime and alu
mina were accordingly always found in solution                after osmose, and
the corrosion      of the septum appeared      to be a necessary condition of
the flow.       Septa of other materials, such as pure carbonate of lime,
gypsum, compressed charcoal and tanned sole-leather, although not
deficient in porosity,      gave no osmose,       apparently because     they are
not acted upon chemically by the saline solutions.              Capillarity alone
 was manifestly insufficient       to produce the liquid movement, while
the vis matrix appeared       to be chemical action.
    The electrical    endosmose     of Porrett, which    has lately been defined
with great clearness by Wiedemann,              was believed to indicate the
possession     of a peculiar chemical constitution       by water, while liquid,
or at least the capacity to assume          that constitution when polarized
and    acting chemically upon other substances. A large but variable
number of atoms of water are associated together to form a liquid
molecule      of water, of which an individual         atom   of oxygen stands
apart forming a negative or chlorous radical, while the whole remain
ing atoms together are constituted into          a positive or basylous radical,
which last will contain an unbalanced equivalent of hydrogen giving
the molecule basicity, as      in the great proportion of organic radicals.
Now     it is this voluminous basylous radical that travels in the           elec
trical decomposition of pure water, and resolves itself into hydrogen
gas and water at the negative pole, causing the accumulation             of water
observed there, while the oxygen alone proceeds in the opposite direc
tion to the positive pole.        Attention was also called to the fact that
acids, and alkalies, when in solution, are chemically combined               with
much water       of hydration, sulphuric acid for instance evolving heat
                                                                    K 2

 when the fiftieth equivalent of water is added to it.         In the combi
 nation of such bodies, the disposal of the water is generally over
 looked.     Osmose was considered as depending upon such secondary
 results of combination,    that is, upon the large number or volumi
 nous proportions of the water molecules involved in such combina
 tions.    The porous septum is the means of bringing out and render
 ing visible, both in electrical and ordinary osmose, this liquid move
 ment attending chemical combinations and decompositions.
    Although    the nature and   modus operandi of chemical action pro
 ducing osmose remains still very obscure, considerable light is thrown
 upon it in the application of septa of animal membrane.         Ox-bladder
 was found to acquire greatly increased activity, and also to act with
 much greater regularity when first divested of its outer muscular
 coat.    Cotton   calico also impregnated      with liquid albumen and
 afterwards exposed to heat so as to coagulate that substance,           was
 sufficiently impervious, and formed an excellent septum, resembling
 membrane in every respect.       The osmometer was of       the usual  bulb-
 form, but the membrane was supported by a         plate of perforated zinc,
 and the instrument provided with        a tube  of considerable diameter.
 The diameter of the tube being one-tenth of that of the mouth of the
 bulb or the disc of membrane exposed to the fluids, a rise of liquid in
 the tube, amounting      to 100 millimeters,    indicated    that as much
 water had permeated the membrane and entered the osmometer,               as
 would cover the whole surface of the membrane to a depth of one
 millimeter, or one twenty-fifth     part of an inch.      Such millimeter
 divisions of the tube become      degrees   of osmose,   which are of the
 same value in all instruments.
    Osmose in membrane presented many points of similarity to that
in earthenware.      The membrane     is constantly undergoing decompo
sition and its osmotic action is exhaustible.        Salts and other sub
stances,   also capable of determining     a large osmose,    are all chemi
cally active substances, while the great mass of neutral organic sub
stances and perfectly neutral monobasic salts       of the metals, such as
chloride of sodium, possess only    a  low degree of action or are wholly
inert.    The active substances are also relatively most efficient in
small proportions.      When a solution of the proper kind is used, the
osmose or passage of fluid proceeds with a velocity wholly unprece
dented   in such experiments.     The rise of liquid in    the tube   with a

                                        87
solution containing one-tenth of a per cent. carbonate of potash in
the osmometer, was 167 degrees, and with 1 per cent. of the same
salt 206 degrees,       in  five   hours.    With another membrane and
stronger solution, the rise was 863 millimeters,              or upwards of 38
inches, in the same time, and as much water was therefore impelled
through the membrane as would cover its whole surface to a depth of
8-6 millimeters   or one-third of an inch. The chemical action must be
different on the substance       of the membrane,        at its inner and outer
surfaces, to induce osmose        ;  and according     to the hypothetic view
which accords    best with the phenomena, the action on the two sides
is not unequal in degree only, but also different in kind.             It appears
as an alkaline action on the albuminous substance             of the membrane,
at the inner surface, and as an acid action on the albumen at the
outer surface.    The most general empirical conclusion that               can be
drawn is, that the water always accumulates on the alkaline or basic
side  of the membrane.        Hence, with an alkaline salt, such as car
bonate or phosphate of soda in the osmometer, and water outside,
the  flow is inwards.      With an acid in the osmometer,           on the con
trary, the flow is outwards, or there         is negative osmose, the liquid
then falling in the tube.        In  the last case the water outside is basic
when compared with the acid within,             and the flow is therefore still
towards the base.      The chloride of sodium, chloride of barium, chlo
ride of magnesium, and similar neutral salts, are wholly indifferent, or
appear only to act in a subordinate manner to some other active acid
or basic substance, which last may be present in the solution                  or
membrane only in the most minute quantity.                Salts which admit of
dividing into a basic subsalt and free acid exhibit an osmotic activity
of the highest order. Such are the acetate and various other salts
of alumina, iron and chromium, the protochloride of copper and tin,
chloride of copper, nitrate of lead, &c. The acid travels outwards
by diffusion, superinducing        a basic condition of the inner surface of
the membrane and an acid condition of the outer surface, the favour
able condition  for  a  high positive osmose.        The bibasic salts of pot
ash and soda, again, although strictly          neutral in properties, such    as
the sulphate and tartrate of potash, begin to exhibit         a positive osmose,
in consequence, it    may be presumed, of their possible resolution into
an acid supersalt and free alkaline base.

   The osmotic action of carbonate of               potash and other alkaline salts
is interfered with in an extraordinary manner by the presence                            of
chloride of sodium, being reduced almost to nothing by an equal
proportion of that salt.          The moderate positive             osmose  of sulphate
of potash is converted into a            very sensible negative osmose by the
presence of the merest trace of a strong acid, while the positive
osmose of the first-mentioned             salt is singularly promoted by a small
proportion of an alkaline carbonate. The last statement is illustrated
by the following observations            : —
                            Osmose in same membrane.
                                                                                   Degrees.

     It may appear      to some   that the chemical character which          has
been assigned to osmose takes away from the physiological               interest
 of the subject, in    so far as the decomposition     of the membrane may
 appear to them to be incompatible with vital conditions, and that
 osmotic movement must therefore be confined to dead matter.                But
 such apprehensions are, it is believed, groundless, or at all events pre
 mature.     All parts of living structures are allowed to be in a state
of incessant change, of decomposition and renewal. The decompo.
 si tion occurring in a living membrane, while effecting osmotic pro
pulsion, may possibly therefore be of a reparable kind.            In other  re
spects chemical osmose appears to be an agency particularly adapted
to take part in the animal oeconomy.         It is seen that osmose is pecu
liarly excited by dilute saline solutions, such         as the  animal juices
really are, and that the alkaline or acid property which these juices
always possess is another most favourable condition for their action
on membrane.         The natural excitation of      osmose   in the substance
of the membranes or cell-walls dividing          such solutions seems there
fore almost inevitable                                           .
     In osmose    there is further a remarkably direct substitution of one
of the great forces of nature by its equivalent in another force — the
conversion, as it may be said, of chemical affinity into mechanical
power. Now what is more wanted in the theory of animal functions
than a mechanism for obtaining motive power from chemical decom
position as it occurs in the tissues     ?  In minute microscopic cells, the
osmotic movements should attain the highest velocity, being entirely
dependent upon extent of surface.          May it not   be hoped, therefore,
to find in the osmotic injection        of fluids the deficient link, which
certainly intervenes between muscular movement and chemical de
composition     ?
II. " Examination         of the Cerebro-spinal Fluid."        By William
        Turner, Esq., Scholar of St. Bartholomew's Hospital. Com
        municated by James Paget, F.R.S.                Received     May 18,
        1854.
     In the Bulletin   de l'Academie   de Mddecine for December 1852, a
paper is published by       M. Bussy, containing an analysis by M. Des

                                        90
champs      of  a fluid, which    flowed from the ear of a man who had
sustained     a fracture of the base of the cranium.          From   a comparison
between the composition of this fluid and that given by              M. Lassaigne
as the composition       of the cerebro-spinal fluid, M. Bussy arrived at the
conclusion that they were identical in their origin.             In addition, how
ever, to the     albumen and ordinary saline constituents, M. Deschamps
found that the fluid obtained from the fractured cranium contained
a certain constituent which         possessed    the peculiar property of re
ducing the blue protoxide of copper to the state of the yellow sub
oxide.
   As this power of reducing the oxide of copper             is possessed also by
grape-sugar,      M. Bussy arrived at the conclusion that this fluid con
tained a small portion of grape-sugar, and as additional evidence                 in
support of this conclusion he quotes the experiments of                M. Bernard,
who, by irritating the base of the encephalon and the origin of the
vagus nerve, produced an excess             of sugar in the secretions.          He
supposes     that in the present instance the fracture through the base
of the cranium may have produced some irritation at the origin                    of
the pneumogastric,        and thus have excited the formation of sugar.
Such a supposition would have received             additional confirmation     if at
the same time an analysis could have been made of the blood, urine,
or other secretions, so as to determine          if sugar was present in those
fluids —  no such analysis however is given.               The property of re
ducing    the   oxide  of copper   was  also  found   by  M.   Bussy to reside in
the cerebro-spinal fluid       of the Horse     and   Dog.      In none of these
experiments was he able to induce fermentation.                   As this reducing
power is not peculiar to grape-sugar, but is possessed by other orga
nic substances,      such as lactine and lactucine,       this test alone should
not be relied on as affording any positive indications of its presence              ;
recourse should        therefore be    had to other        confirmatory     experi
 ments.
    With    a view to determine this point, Mr. Paget, in the early
 part  of  March    last, gave me for examination three separate portions
of the cerebro-spinal fluid, obtained by puncturing a spina bifida
in a child, several days intervening between the removal of each
portion   .
   Those removed on the first two occasions were perfectly clear and
pellucid,    giving an alkaline reaction to test-paper, their spec. grav.

                                           91
being 1-006, no spontaneous coagulation taking place after standing
for some time        ;  that removed on the third occasion had a slightly
yellow tinge, and a distinct coagulum formed in it on standing.              The
presence of fibrine in this instance was owing doubtless to some
slight inflammation having been set up, caused by the successive
puncturings.           The three specimens corresponded in the following
characters      : —
    1st. No precipitate on applying heat, merely an opalescence             being
produced      ;  on the addition of a few drops of nitric acid a white flaky
precipitate subsided.           Nitric acid alone, without    heat,  also caused
a precipitate.
    The non-precipitation          of the albumen, until   the  addition   of the
acid, was owing to the alkalinity of the fluid.
    2nd. Boiled with liquor potassae a very faint pinkish tint was pro
 duced    ;  a few white flakes also fell down.
    3rd. Heated in a water-bath with the blue oxide of copper, in                a
 few minutes the yellowish red powdery suboxide precipitated.
    This reaction took place both in the original albuminous liquid and
 after the coagulation of the albumen by heat and nitric acid.
    4th.    A piece of flannel, saturated with the chloride of tin, was
 well moistened with the fluid, and then heated over            a red-hot coal    ;
 no brown         colour of the flannel was produced, such as occurs when
 grape-sugar is present.           (Maumene's test.)
     5th.   A   portion mixed in a test-tube with some German yeast was
 placed for several hours in a warm cupboard, but there was no deve
 lopment of gas.
     From     these     experiments it appears that of the various tests em
  ployed, only one gave any indication of the presence of grape-sugar,
 that test also being the one which is most liable to deception.              The
  lowness of the specific gravity,         in which respect this fluid and that
  analysed by        M. Deschamps closely corresponded, would,           d priori,
  almost lead to the assumption that no grape- sugar was present.
     The    presence     of the reducing agent could not in this case depend
  upon any irritation        of the origin of the vagus, for the irritation,     if
  any, produced by         a spina bifida is at the end of the cerebro-spinal
  axis furthest removed from the origin of that nerve.              That the ma
  terial however which         effects  this reduction is of a very changeable
  nature, was shown by allowing             a portion of the fluid to stand for

                                       92
several days until putrefaction had commenced.             The fluid was then
filtered so as to separate      the insoluble albuminous flakes, and the
clear liquid heated in a water-bath          with the blue oxide of copper        ;
when, instead of the suboxide being produced, the black anhydrous
oxide was formed, just as is the case when the blue oxide is heated
merely with water, thus satisfactorily           showing    that the reducing
substance     had been destroyed.
    The recent investigations of Virchow* and Buskf               have  shown
that substances     of a  non-nitrogenous     nature exist both in the brain
and spinal cord, but they hold somewhat different opinions respect
ing their exact characters      ; for whilst the former considers them to
be cellulose, the latter regards them both         in their " structural, che
mical and optical properties
                                    " to resemble starch. In
                                                                    conformity
with   these   views, it was interesting to determine if any indications
of the presence of either of       these  substances could be found in the
cerebro-spinal fluid    ;  accordingly a portion of the fluid was evapo
rated nearly to dryness and then divided into two portions            ; to one
was added an alcoholic solution of iodine and concentrated sulphuric
acid, when a violet tint was produced, which after a few minutes dis
appeared    ; but it was also found that this same appearance         was pro
duced when the acid and iodine solution were mixed together alone,
the violet colour being evidently owing to the volatilization         of a part
of the iodine and the evolution of its characteristic violet tint           ;  to
the other a solution of iodide of potassium and then nitric acid was
added, when a brown colour          was produced, owing to the liberation
of the iodine.     In neither portion could it     be said that any evidence
of the  presence   of starch or cellulose was detected.
    A comparative trial was also      made between the effects       produced
upon the blue oxide of copper by the cerebro-spinal fluid, solutions
of grape-sugar, cane-sugar, starch, cellulose, and mannite,          an unfer-
mentizable sugar.       These various substances were heated in a water-
bath for the same length of time, when it was found that whilst the
grape-sugar effected a reduction immediately, and the cerebro-spinal
fluid only after the lapse of several minutes, neither the starch, cellu
lose, cane-sugar nor mannite effected        any reduction at all.
    The power of reducing the blue oxide of copper is not confined to

non-nitrogenous       substances, for      I found that if    a solution of leucine*
be heated nlong      with it in    the usual manner, the reduction is effected
in about the      same length       of time, and in the        same way as by the
cerebro-spinal fluid. This single experiment is not of itself sufficient
evidence that the reducing power in both cases depends upon the
presence    of   the same      substance.       Such an assertion could only of
course be proved by obtaining             from the cerebro-spinal fluid leucine
in the crystallized        form.     A proper quantity of           the fluid was not,
however, left to investigate this point.
    From the above experiments            I think it   may be safely asserted that
the power possessed by the cerebro-spinal fluid of reducing the oxide
of copper, is not owing to the presence either of grape-sugar or any
of the allied substances : whether it may depend upon the presence
of leucine or other modifications of albumen of                   a   somewhat similar
nature, or whether it may be due to the presence of a substance be
longing to another        series, is a point that has yet to be determined.
    Note   by Mr. Paget. — The patient from whom the fluid analysed
by Mr. Turner was obtained, was a girl born of healthy parents. An
infant cousin had lately died from the same congenital defect as she
presented.        The upper part of the body was well formed, but the
pelvis and lower limbs were small and nearly powerless.                          The   sac
containing      the fluid was seated over the last lumbar vertebra, pro
jecting (as the examination after death showed) through an opening
 between its unclosed arches.            It enlarged quickly after birth, but did
 not evidently affect the child's health, unless it were connected with
 a very frequent spasmodic action             of the muscles closing the glottis,
 which, almost from the time of birth,                 had produced the peculiar
 " crowing inspiration," or laryngismus stridulus.                   The fluid was first
 withdrawn when the child was three months old.                         Neither on this,
 nor on any subsequent occasion, did its removal produce any mani
 fest effect, although the flaccidity          of the emptied        sac indicated that
 the pressure upon the spinal cord was greatly diminished.                    After every
    * Leucine
               Ca NH1S 04,     a weak base, belonging    to the same series as glycocine
 and alanine, is generally   obtained  by the decomposition   of albuminous     substances.
 It has been obtained   by Scherer from the spleen,      and, according    to Gregory,  has
 been detected as a natural product     in the liver of the Calf.

                                      94
 evacuation the sac very quickly filled again, notwithstanding      pressure
 exercised upon it.
    The examination after     death  showed that the fluid was collected
in the expanded tissue of the pia mater, or subarachnoid spaces,
about the cauda equina. The pia mater presented appearances of
inflammation long past, as well as of that which had probably been
the cause of death.       The canal in    the axis  of the spinal cord was
distinct   in its whole length.      Commencing,     below a large fourth
ventricle, with a diameter of about one-fourth of       a line, it gradually
widened, till, at the lumbar part of the cord, it had       a diameter of a
line and a half.     Its termination at  the end  of the cord could not be
traced in the confusion of parts caused by the distension and inflam
mation of the membranes.
III. " On      the Oxidation of Ammonia in the Human Body."
        By H. Bence Jones,           M.D., F.R.S., Physician         to  St.
        George's  Hospital.     Received    June 14, 1854.
    In the last edition of Professor Lehmann's Animal Chemistry,
vol. ii. p. 363, a very decided opinion is expressed      against the con
clusion to which    I arrived in consequence of    some experiments pub
lished in the Philosophical    Transactions   for 1851.
    I considered it proved that ammonia was partly at least converted
into nitrous acid in its passage through the body.         In opposition to
this Professor Lehmann states,     —
    1st. That the method which      I employed must of necessity give a
reaction resembling that given by nitrous acid       ; his words are,   " Es
ware nun leicht einzusehen dass schweflige Saure, durch welche be-
kanntlich Iodwasserstoff zersetzt wird, in die Vorlage iibergeht und
so jene vermeintliche salpetersaure Reaction bedingt."
    2ndly. That when nitric acid was added to urine and it was di
stilled with phosphoric     acid instead of sulphuric     acid, no trace of
blue colour with starch and iodide of potassium could be obtained.
" Das nach Anwendung        von Phosphorsaure erhaltene Destillat giebt
aber auch jene vermeintliche      salpetersaure Reaction nicht, ja selbst
dann nicht,     wenn    dem   Harn vorher absichtlich       einige Tropfen
Salpetersaure zugesetzt worden waren."

                                       95
   It   appeared    to me undesirable merely to reply to Professor Leh-
mann, that      I had expressly stated that the indigo and protosulphate
of iron tests were used, and       gave as decided proof   of the presence   of
nitrous     acid in the urine as Price's test gave    ; and that sulphurous
acid could not have produced the same effect as nitrous acid in these
tests.     It seemed    more desirable to repeat the experiments which
had been made in Professor Lehmann's            laboratory on the action of
sulphurous      acid, and on the effect of using phosphoric        instead of
sulphuric acid in the distillation     of the urine.
   I  was fortunate enough to obtain the assistance of        Mr. Malone to
carry on the experiments continuously from day to day, and through
the kindness of Dr. Hofmann this was done in the College of Che
mistry.
   1st.   On the action of sulphurous acid on starch           and  iodide of
potassium and very dilute hydrochloric         acid.
    In England it is by no       means well known that sulphurous          acid
decomposes hydriodic acid.          On  the contrary, theoretically it should
not liberate iodine, and experimentally not only does it not liberate
iodine, but it hinders the liberation of iodine and stops the formation
of  the blue colour when Price's test is used and nitrous acid is pre
sent  ;  and  if sulphurous acid   be added after the blue colour is formed
it makes it disappear.
   Pure sulphurous acid was prepared, some nitre was fused, and a
dilute solution was made, and it was tested by Price's test (starch,
iodide of potassium and very dilute hydrochloric          acid), then the di
lute nitre solution immediately gave the deep blue iodide of starch            ;
but when much or little sulphurous acid was added previously to the
nitre    solution,   no blue colour    at all was produced      ; and  when,
instead of the nitre solution, much or little sulphurous acid alone
was added, contrary to the statement of Lehmann, no decomposition
of the hydriodic acid could       be obtained.
   If instead of pure iodide of potassium it was mixed with iodate of
potassa, an immediate blue colour was of course observed.                I can
only suppose       that in this way Professor Lehmann obtained the re
action which he has attributed wrongly to the action of sulphurous
acid on hydriodic       acid, unless indeed no sulphurous acid at all was
present and the acidity of the distillate was unneutralized.         Dr. Leh
mann is however right as well as wrong, in saying that Price's test

                                       9(5
for nitric acid fails when sulphurous acid is present.          The test fails,
not, as he says, because sulphurous acid has the same action as ni
trous acid in liberating iodine, but because it has exactly the oppo
site property of hindering the iodide from being set free even when
nitrous acid in small quantity is present.
    It is possible that in distilling the urine with sulphuric acid, the
distillation, if carried too far, may give rise to sulphurous acid, and
that thus Price's test may fail to detect nitrous acid in the urine.
Moreover,      portions of the distillate    may be projected     against the
sides   of the hot retort, by which the sulphuric         acid acting on the
organic matter may be decomposed, and minute quantities of sul
phurous acid may be liberated.         This sulphurous acid, instead of    de
composing hydriodic acid, causes the reformation of hydriodic             acid
when nitrous acid liberates iodine in Price's test.
    2ndly.    Lehmann states that experiments were made by distilling
urine to which     a few drops of nitric acid were added with phosphoric
 acid, and that then the distillate gave no reaction with Price's test.
    The following experiments were         made  with every precaution.
    Anhydrous phosphoric acid was prepared, and it was found to              be
free from nitrous acid.        Some healthy urine was taken and some
 pure nitrate of potassa, in the proportion          of two grains of salt to
 an ounce of fluid, and distilled with phosphoric acid (ten ounces of
 urine, twenty grains of nitre, and one ounce of anhydrous phosphoric
 acid).    On concentrating,      the neutralized dilute    nitrous acid was
 detected by all the tests, namely, the indigo test, the protosulphate
 of iron and Price's test.
    In  a second    experiment, five ounces of urine with five grains of
 nitre and half an ounce of anhydrous phosphoric acid, gave nitrous
 acid by all the tests.      The distillation was continued until the con
 tents of the retort were viscid.
    In  a third experiment, three ounces     of urine with  a grain and a half
 of nitre were distilled with three drachms of glacial phosphoric acid         ;
 the distillate   neutralized   and evaporated     gave  no trace of nitrous
 acid; the     same  urine with the same quantity         of nitre and three
 drachms of sulphuric       acid, when distilled,   gave a distillate,  which
 when neutralized and evaporated gave decided evidence of nitrous
 acid.
    In my former paper I showed that by distilling with sulphuric

                                        97
acid when only one-tenth of a grain of nitre was added                     to each
ounce of urine, nitrous acid could be detected.
   From these experiments        it appears   that distillation with sulphuric
acid is to be preferred to distillation      with phosphoric acid       ; but even
with this last acid, when       a grain of nitre     is added    to an ounce of
urine, the nitrous acid can be detected.
   I  then endeavoured, by using phosphoric instead of sulphuric acid
in distilling urine   passed    after a salt of ammonia had been taken
into the stomach, to detect nitrous acid in the urine.
   Two drachms of muriate of ammonia were taken in                  seven ounces
of distilled water.    The urine was collected for six hours afterwards.
Twelve ounces of this urine were distilled with             one ounce     of phos
phoric acid (anhydrous).         The distillate, when concentrated, did not
give any evidence     of nitrous acid by Price's test.
   The   same experiment was repeated          with no better result.
   In another experiment, sulphuric            acid, six drachms to twelve
ounces of urine, was used instead of phosphoric acid.               The distillate
as soon as   it was obtained   gave the slightest precipitate with chloride
of barium insoluble in nitric acid, showing that a trace of sulphuric
acid was carried over into the receiver.            The distillate was made
alkaline with pure carbonate of soda, evaporated, and nitrous acid
was immediately detected by the indigo and iron test, as well as by
Price's test.    A portion of the distillate left exposed to the air, on
the following day had lost the power of liberating                 iodine.    This
arose from the nitrous acid passing into nitric acid.
   Pure nitre gives no colour with starch, iodide of potassium and
dilute hydrochloric     acid, but when fused       it produces the liberation
of iodine immediately.        If  the solution   of fused nitre is exposed to
the air it loses   this property, but regains it when the solution is
evaporated to dryness and refused and again dissolved.
   In another experiment six ounces of urine            passed before the mu
riate of ammonia was taken were distilled with half an ounce of sul
phuric acid, the distillate was highly acid, and gave             a  slight preci
pitate with chloride of barium        ; it was  made     slightly alkaline,   eva
porated to a small residue, and          then gave no evidence of nitrous
acid.    Then two drachms of muriate of ammonia were taken in                seven
ounces of distilled    water, eight ounces of urine passed             four hours
afterwards were distilled with half an ounce of sulphuric acid.               The

                                        98
distillate was fractional  ;   the first portion gave no colour with starch
test  ; it contained  a  minute trace of sulphurous acid.             The second
portion was highly acid      ;  it was  made      slightly alkaline,   evaporated
nearly to dryness, and then gave most positive evidence of nitrous
acid by Price's     test, and also by decolorizing            a deep solution   of
indigo.
   Thus before    the salt of ammonia was taken no nitrous acid could
be detected    in the urine, whilst after the ammonia nitrous acid was
proved to be present, not only by Price's test, but by the indigo test
also.
   In conclusion, it results from        these    experiments,    — 1st, That in
Price's test sulphurous acid produces exactly the opposite effect to
nitrous acid, and even hinders nitrous             acid from liberating    iodine
from hydriodic acid.
   2ndly. That phosphoric         acid, when mixed with urine containing
nitre and distilled very low, does liberate nitrous acid          ; though when
used instead of sulphuric       acid, it does not enable the nitrous acid to
be detected so readily as when the latter acid is employed.
   Hence the experiments performed in Professor Lehmann's                   labo
ratory by Herr Jaffe*. do not invalidate Price's test for nitrous acid
in the way Professor Lehmann            supposes      ; and  by again repeating
some of my former experiments,           I still  arrive at the conclusion that
when ammonia is taken into the body nitric acid may be detected
in the urine, but that the quantity which can              be made to appear    is
so small that the most delicate method is required for its detection.
This however is no proof that          a much larger quantity may not be
lost in the process for obtaining it from          the urine.

 IV. "On      the Disintegration    of Urinary Calculi by the Lateral
       Disruptive Force of the Electrical Discharge."         By George
        Robinson, M.D., Licentiate of the Royal College of Phy
       sicians of London, and Lecturer on Medicine in the New
       castle-upon-Tyne College of Practical Science.             Commu
       nicated by    Dr. Sharpey, Sec. R.S.         Received   June 13th,
        1854.
    The great and diversified powers of electricity   have long suggested
 the possibility of its being employed as a means of effecting the de
 struction of calculi   in the human bladder, and thus obviating the
 necessity for    the painful   and dangerous operation of lithotomy.
 But the attempts hitherto made in this direction have contemplated
the solution of the stone through electrolytic action rather than its
disintegration    by the mechanical force of the electrical discharge.
A moment's reflection will however suffice to convince         us that the
force which     shatters a steeple or cleaves  an oak, is also capable    of
reducing    to fragments the largest urinary concretion.        Nor can I
imagine any other than the following sources of objection to the prac
ticability of employing this force for the purpose of breaking down
vesical calculi in situ, namely,   1.  the danger to the living structures
from the necessity of using a powerful discharge      ; 2. the difficulty of
conveying the force to the required spot, or in other words, causing
the discharge to pass through the calculus.       The first objection is in
a great measure met by the fact of our being enabled to regulate with
the utmost precision the degree of intensity of the discharge, and it
would be almost entirely removed were it possible to apply the dis
ruptive force of electricity without      any portion of the body being
included within the circuit traversed by the electrical current.        The
second objection rests upon the mechanical difficulty of bringing the
calculus within the direct route of the electrical discharge, but would
scarcely apply were it demonstrated that the disruptive          effects  of
electricity can be obtained without       any such direct transmission of
the current.
    My own attention was       some years since directed to the subject
by reading an account of the following        experiment first performed
by  Mr. Crosse.      " Two platinum wires one-thirtieth of an inch in
    VOl.  Vii.                                                   i.

                                     100
diameter were secured to a slip of window glass half an inch wide
and four inches long, so that they rested upon the flat surface of the
glass, leaving an interval between their points of one-twentieth of
an inch.     The wires were connected,       one   with the negative con
ductor of a powerful machine, the other with a ball to receive sparks
from the prime conductor.        On placing the glass in    a flat dish filled
with water and turning the machine, the glass between the points
soon became       fractured,  and after 100      revolutions   the fracture
enlarged and two small cracks appeared.          After 200 revolutions an
excavation was formed, but on the side opposite to that on which
the wires were tied.      After 250 revolutions   the glass was completely
perforated.     Many variations of this experiment were         made,    in all
of which the    same kind of mechanical effect       was obtained.       Even
quartz was excavated*."
    It being thus shown that a lateral disruptive action takes place
within   a certain distance of the seat    of discharge, the idea at      once
suggested itself to me, that by using two parallel wires separated           at
their extremities like those in  Mr. Crosse's experiment, and similarly
connected with an electrical machine or Leyden jar, bringing their
ends in contact     with the surface of  a calculus, and then     allowing    a
series of moderate discharges to take place between the extremities
of the wires, a disintegrating effect would be produced upon urinary
calculi of the same nature as that witnessed in glass and quartz.
And short of the actual disintegration of a calculus in the bladder
of a living person, the following experiments will, I trust, be deemed
conclusive on this point.
    Two copper wires, one- twentieth of an inch in diameter, were
connected, one with the external, the other with the internal surface
of a Leyden jar, having about 400 square inches of internal metallic
coating.     These copper wires were soldered to platinum wires half
an inch long and one-thirtieth      of an inch in diameter.        Each wire
 was drawn through a fine gutta percha tube, and the tubes, having
 first been placed perfectly parallel, were warmed and gently pressed
 together so as to assume     somewhat of the appearance        of  a flexible
 bougie  ; the platinum wires projecting      beyond the gutta percha to
    * Described by  Mr. Walker in Lardner's Cabinet Cyclopedia, vol. ii. pages
 218-220.

                                      101
the extent of one-eighth of an inch, and their free extremities being
slightly everted and separated from each other by an interval of o ne
tenth of an inch.       In experimenting, the united gutta percha tubes
were grasped and the projecting platinum points pressed against the
surface of the calculus      : the jar was then discharged by another
person, and a series of such discharges thus passed between the free
extremities     of the parallel platinum wires while resting upon the
surface of the stone.
    With this simple arrangement, fragments           a quarter   of an inch
 long were broken off flints immersed in water, and the same force
was applied to urinary calculi with the following results : —
    Exp.   1.  June 7th.— A piece of a large lithic acid calculus was
 placed in a bladder, nearly filled with water, into which the gutta
 percha bougie containing       the wires was then introduced         and the
 neck of the bladder tied round the instrument.           The bladder with
 its contents being placed on       a  wet board, the projecting platinum
 wires were then kept in contact with the surface of the calculus
 and the jar discharged.       On opening   the bladder and examining the
 stone, it was found to be broken into numerous fragments by the
 single discharge.
     Exp.  2. — A small phosphatic calculus, very smooth and hard, was
  experimented upon in a similar manner.           The first  five discharges
  produced no perceptible effect,      but the sixth split it into at least
  twenty   fragments, and many of these,        on being slightly pressed
  between the finger and thumb, readily broke down.
     Exp.  3. —A very large oxalate     of lime or mulberry calculus with
  projecting tubercles was similarly tested, and the first discharge pro
  duced a small cavity in the surface to which the wires were applied,
  separating   a considerable quantity of fine sand    ; but subsequent dis
  charges did not act so efficiently on this very large stone.
     Exp. 4. — On the following day, June 8th, the experiment was
  repeated in the presence of Messrs. Potter, Rayne and Furness, sur
  geons in Newcastle,      and a small calculus, removed a few months
  since by the gentleman last mentioned from        a young boy, was, after
  a few trials,  split through the centre, one-half being reduced to frag
  ments, and the other exhibiting in its interior a dark-coloured
  nucleus of lithic acid.
     These    experiments    appear to demonstrate the practicability       of

                                       102
applying the lateral disruptive force of the electrical discharge to the
disintegration of calculi in the bladder.          There can be no difficulty
in bringing the end of a gutta percha catheter, conveying two cop
per wires, in contact with the surface of a stone in the bladder, and
a  very simple mechanical contrivance will enable           the extremities of
the platinum    wires to be protruded when the end of the catheter
touches the calculus.       By employing two wires,       one connected    with
the positive, the other with the negative, portion of the jar or ma
chine, not only is the intensity of the discharge increased, but the
body is also prevented from forming any part of the circuit, and the
risk of injury thereby materially diminished.            The bladder    used in
the above-mentioned experiments was not at all injured, and on re
taining a portion of it between the platinum wires so that the dis
charge passed through it, no perforation or other destructive effect
took place.    The gutta percha tubes, having the projecting platinum
wires, were placed in the mouth without being in contact with the
lips, and a discharge sent through         the wires, but there was no per
ceptible shock.     When, however, the bladder containing the stone
rested upon the hand, during the act of disintegration a smart im
pulse was felt.
   On  the whole,    I am of opinion that the electrical force applied in
the manner indicated,      will  be found quite as efficient for the disin
tegration of calculi in the bladder as the more formidable analogous
operation of lithotrity, occasionally practised.         And,  as regards sim
plicity and security, the electrical apparatus certainly           appears pre
ferable to the instruments      used   for crushing     the stone by ordinary
mechanical force.

V. " The             Attraction       of   Ellipsoids               considered            generally."
         By Mathew             Collins,          Esq., B.A.                    Communicated         by
         S.   Hunter Christie, Esq., M.A.,                          Sec.       R.S. &c.     Received
         April 27, 1854.
   The author commences by stating, that                            the attraction        of an ellip
soid on a point on its surface or within                           it,   in   a direction perpendi
cular to one of its principal planes,                 is   proportional to the distance of
the attracted point from that plane.
   This general proposition,               which      is    an extension to ellipsoids of
those already given for spheroids              " On the Figure of
                                                 in Airy's Tract
the Earth," Prop.   and 10, and in MacLaurin's 4th Lemma, "De
                           8
causa physica Fluxus et Refluxus Maris," he demonstrates —
   1.    In   the case when the attracted point                      is       on the surface of the
ellipsoid.
   The demonstration of this               is   much like those given by the above-
named authors for the less general case of spheroids, and its final
step    is   effected   by Cor.   1   to Prop. 87 of the first book of the                        Prin-
cipia.
   2. When the attracted point                  is   within the ellipsoid.
   The demonstration in this                case      is    effected           by showing       that an
ellipsoidal        shell, bounded by two similar and similarly placed ellip
soidal surfaces, exerts no attraction on                       a         point situated anywhere
within       it   or upon its interior surface.
   The foregoing proposition shows that the attraction of an ellip
soid on any point on its surface, or within it, can begot at once from
the attraction of the same ellipsoid on                        a    point placed at the extre-
   VOl.       Vii.                                                                          M

                                       104
 mity of an axis, and the author proceeds to show how the latter
 attraction can be found and reduced to elliptic functions.            He then
 gives this proposition     :
     Let  a, b, c be the semiaxes of a homogeneous fluid ellipsoid, and
 A, B, C     the forces acting on points at the extremities         of a, b, c,
 caused    partly by the ellipsoid's    own attractions      on its parts, and
 partly by centrifugal forces of revolution about an axis (2c), or by
 the action of an extraneous force directed towards its centre, and
 varying as the distance from the centre, then the ellipsoid will pre
 serve its form    if Aa=B6=Ce.
     The last proposition stated in the paper is thus given : let R and r
 be the radii of two homogeneous concentric spheres; A and a the
 attractions of each on       a point on the surface       of the other, then
  A     a
            whatever be the law of attraction as        a  function of the di-
 R"    r*
 stance.
    The demonstration given of       the first of these two theorems is very
 concise, and of the second is direct and elementary.

       Embryo." (Third Series.)             From the MS. papers of the
       late   George     Newport, F.R.S., F.L.S. &c. Selected and
       arranged      by George      Viner Ellis, Esq., Professor of
       Anatomy in University College, London.                 Communicated
       by Sir    John Forbes, M.D., F.R.S.              Received   June 6th,
       1854,
    In this paper    the  author has given the result of further inquiries
into the manner by which the frog's egg is impregnated,               and has
supplied in addition some very interesting          facts respecting the de
velopment of the embryo during the earlier stages of its growth.
    In consequence of the difficulties that       arose  in the course of the
inquiry, and of the doubts that might be suggested by others from
the difficulty   of manipulating with      the egg   of the Amphibia unless
certain precautions are taken, the author first describes the apparatus

                                        105
 used and the mode of proceeding he has employed               ; and his results
show that he has successfully surmounted             the obstacles to micro
 scopic investigation      caused by the opacity, the great size, and the
tendency to movement inherent in the egg.
    The fact of the impregnation of         the ovum through       the entrance
 of the spermatozoon into the yelk by its own movement was com
 municated to the Royal Society in a preceding paper*, and the ori
 ginal experiments there referred to as serving to establish the fact,
 are now detailed.       In addition,  the circumstances affecting the pas
 sage  of the sperm-body through the thick investing envelopes               are
considered, and thence it is concluded, that " when there is any             de
ficiency in the usual power, arising from an unhealthy condition of
 the fertilising body, or an increase     in the resistance of the yelk mem
branes, the spermatozoon is unable to pass through the membranes
into the yelk and the egg remains unfertilized."
    The two small rounded bodies that appear on              the surface  of the
yelk in the interval or       chamber between     it and the investing    mem
brane, have been traced from their origin,            through    their changes,
till their disappearance after the equatorial division of the yelk. The
investigations as to the true import of these bodies have not been
further    carried out, in consequence of the untimely             death of the
author   ;  but his observations have induced him to put forth the fol
lowing statement regarding them, viz. " that they              are usually, and
perhaps invariably, at that part of the yelk at which the head of the
embryo is afterwards found."
    By following the changes in the segmenting yelk, evidence has
been obtained of the derivation of different parts of the future being
from definite segments of the yelk.            Thus it has been found, that
the half of the yelk on one side of the second or crucial cleft begins
its subdivisions    sooner than the opposite, and that the trunk and
tail of the embryo    are derived from this first subdividing       part, whilst
the head is produced from the other half.
    Having ascertained      so much respecting the foundation of different
parts of the embryo, the author next determined that the axis or
spine will primarily      lie in a line with the first cleft of the yelk,
though     it may afterwards deviate somewhat from that line during
the growth of the embryo.

                                                                    M 2

                                       100
    Lastly, it  has been sought to discover what influence the       artificial
application of the spermatozoon to only one side of the egg would
have upon the direction of the primary cleft of the yelk.          The result
of this inquiry seems, very curiously, to be, that the first cleft of the
yelk will lie, under the circumstances stated, in a line with the
point of the egg that has been touched with the impregnating fluid.
VII. "     Contributions to the Anatomy of the Brachiopoda."               By
        Thomas H.      Huxley, F.R.S.         Received    May 18, 1854.
    In the course of the dissection of certain Brachiopoda with which
I have recently been engaged, I have met with so many peculiarities
which are unnoticed in the extant and received accounts of their
anatomy, that although the pressure of other duties prevents me from
attempting to work out the subject with any degree of completeness
for the present,    I yet gladly avail myself of the opportunity of com
municating     a few   of the  more    important   results at which   I  have
arrived, in the hope that they may find a place in the Proceedings of
the   Royal Society.
    My investigations were principally       made   upon Rhynchonella psit-
tacea, for specimens    of which   I  am indebted to   Prof. Edward Forbes,
while Dr. Gray obligingly      enabled me to compare them with Wald-
heimia flavescens   and with Lingula.
    1.  The Alimentary Canal q/Terebratulida.    —Professor    Owen, in both
his earlier and his later memoirs on the anatomy of the Terebratulidae,
describes at length the manner in which the intestine, as he states,
terminates on the right side between the lobes of the mantle.
    On the other hand, Mr. Hancock          has declared himself unable to
observe    at this point any such anal aperture, and concludes from his
own observations that the latter is situated on the ventral surface of
the animal in the middle line,       just behind  the insertion of the great
adductor     muscle.    M. Gratiolet,     in a late communication     to the
 Academic des Sciences, takes the same view.           To get rid of the ob
vious difficulty, that this spot is covered by the shell, and therefore
that   if the anus existed   here,  there would be no road of escape for
 the faces,    Mr. Hancock and Mr. Woodward           appear   to be inclined

                                        107
to suppose that some cloacal aperture must exist in the neighbour
 hood of the pedicle.
    The existence of any such aperture, however,             has recently been
denied with great justice by Professor Owen.
    The result of my own      repeated    examinations of Rhynchonella psit-
tacea and of Waldheimia flavescens         is — 1. that the intestine does not
terminate on the right side of the mantle as Professor Owen describes
it, but in the middle line,    as  Mr. Hancock describes it in Waldheimia,
while in Rhynchonella it inclines, after curving upwards, to the left
side; and 2. that there is no anus at all, the intestine terminating
in a rounded caecal extremity, which is straight and conical in Wald
heimia, curved to the left side and enlarged in Rhynchonella.
    I confess  that this result, so exceptional in its character, caused
me no small surprise,      and    I have   taken very great pains to satisfy
myself of the accuracy of my conclusion            ; but notwithstanding     the
strong prejudice to the contrary, to which the known relations of the
anal aperture in Lingula gave rise, repeated observation has inva
riably confirmed it.
    Professor Owen's statement is, that in Rhynchonella (Terehratula)
psittacea
            " the intestine inclines to the right side and makes a slight
bend forwards before perforating           the circumscribing     membrane in
order to terminate between the mantle lobes on that side."             — On  the
Anatomy     of the Brachiopoda,     p. 152.
    I find, on the contrary (figs.      1 and 2), that the intestine passes
at first straight downwards in the middle line, as in Waldheimia, but
instead of terminating      in a rounded tapering extremity as in that
genus, it bends upwards and then curves round to the left side,
forming a sort of free caecum in the visceral cavity.           My reasons for
believing that it is a free caecum are these         : — in the first place, no
anal aperture can be detected in the mantle cavity, either on the
right or left    sides, although     the small size    of the animal allows of
its being readily examined uninjured, with considerable magnifying
powers.
   Secondly.     If the shell be removed without injuring the animal
and the visceral cavity be opened from behind by cutting through its
walls close to the bulb of the pedicle, it is easy not only to see that
the disposition of the extremity of the intestine is such as         I have de
scribed it to be, but by gentle manipulation with a needle to convince

                                                 108
 oneself that it is perfectly unattached.                   And in connexion with this
 evidence      I may remark, that the tissues of the Brachiopods in general
 are anything but delicate             ;   it would    be quite impossible for instance
 to break away the end of the intestine of Lingula from its attach
  ments without considerable violence.
    Thirdly.       If the extremity of the intestine, either in Rhynchonella

or in Waldheimia, be cut off and transferred to       a glass plate, it may
readily be examined microscopically with high powers, and it is then
easily observable that its fibrous investment is a completely shut
sac.    In Rhynchonella the enlarged    caecum is often      full of diatoma-
ceous shells, but it is impossible to force them out at its end, while
if any  aperture existed they would of course be readily so extruded.
   However anomalous, physiologically,       then, this caecal termination
of the intestine in a molluscous genus may be,            I   see no way    of
escaping from the conclusion     that in the Terebratulidce       (at any rate
in these two species) it really obtains.      There are other peculiarities
                                  Fig. 2.
about the arrangement of the alimentary canal, however, of which I
can find either no account at all or a very imperfect notice.
   The intestinal canal (figs  1  and 2   b, d, e) has an   inner, epithelial,
and an outer fibrous coat  ; the latter expands in the middle line into
a  sort of mesentery, which     extends from the anterior face of the
intestine between the adductors, to the anterior wall of the visceral

                                         110
 chamber, and from the upper face of the intestine to the roof of the
 visceral chamber     ; while posteriorly it extends beyond the intestine as
 a more    or less extensive free edge.        I will call this the mesentery      (/).
    From     each side  of  the intestinal canal, again, the fibrous coat gives
           '
 off two     bands,' an upper (g), which stretches from the parietes of the
 stomach      to the upper part of the walls of the visceral chamber,
 forming     a sort of little sheath for the base of the posterior division
 of the adductor muscle, which            I will call    the gastro-parietal band       ;
 and   a  lower,   which passes from the middle of the intestine to the
 parietes, supporting the so-called
                                            '
                                              auricle.'     I will  call this the ilio-
 parietal band (A)    .
    The ilio-parietal     and    gastro-parietal    bands are united by certain
 other ridges upon the fibrous coat of the intestine, from whose point
 of union in the middle line of the stomach posteriorly,                   a pyriform
 vesicle (n) depends.
    The mesentery divides the liver into two lateral lobes, while the
 gastro-parietal bands give rise to the appearance              that these are again
 divided into two lobules, one above the other.              I  am inclined to think
                                                                  '
that these bands are what have been described as hepatic arteries,'
at least there is nothing else that could possibly be confounded with
an arterial ramification upon the liver.
    This description       applies more especially            to Rhynchonella      and
 Waldheimia, but the arrangement              in Lingula is not essentially dif
ferent.
    2.   The Circulatory     System  of Terebratulidee.      — Considerable     differ
ences of opinion have prevailed among comparative anatomists as to
the nature and arrangement           of  the vascular system in the          Brachio-
poda.     A pair of organs,    one on each side       of  the body, have been re
cognized as Hearts since the time of Cuvier,                    who declared these
hearts in    Lingula to    be aortic, receiving the blood from the mantle
and pouring it into the body, the principal arterial trunks being dis
tributed into that glandular          mass    which Cuvier called ovary, but
which is now known to be the genital gland of either sex.
   Professor Owen in his first memoir follows Cuvier's interpretation,
stating that in Orbicula the pallial            veins terminate in the hearts,
from which arterial branches proceed              to the liver and ovary.         Pro
fessor Owen further adds for the Brachiopoda                 in general, —
   " Each heart, for example, in the Brachiopoda                  is as simple as    in

                                         Ill
Ascidia, consisting of a single elongated cavity, and not composed of
a distinct auricle and ventricle        as in the ordinary      Bivalves," and          he
compares the hearts of Brachiopoda              to the auricles of Area, &c.
 (Trans. Zoological Society, vol. i. p. 159).
    In 1843, however, M. Vogt's elaborate memoir on Lingula                           ap
                                                                    '          '
peared,   in which the true complex structure of the                    heart     in this
                                                        '          '
genus was first explained          and the plaited        auricle        discriminated
           '              '
from the     ventricle;     and in 1845, Professor Owen, having apparently
been thus led to re-examine the circulatory             organs of Brachiopoda,
published his
                  '
                    Lettre sur l'appareil de la Circulation chez les                Mol-
lusques de la Classe des Brachiopodes,'               in which          he felicitates
M. Milne-Edwards on          the important confirmation        of the views which
the latter entertains with respect to the lacunar nature of the circu
lation in the Mollusca,        afforded by the Brachiopoda,             and describes
each heart of the Terebratulidae as consisting of a ventricle and a
plaited auricle, the pallial veins not terminating in the latter but in
the general visceral cavity.        As the Professor      does not recal the view
which he had already taken of the circulation in Orbicula,                   I presume
that he considers two opposite types of the circulatory organs to ob
tain in the Brachiopoda, the direction of the current being from the
mantle through       the heart towards the body in Orbicula, and from
the mantle through the body towards the heart in Terebratula.
   The possibilities of nature are so various that I would not venture,
without having carefully dissected Orbicula, — no opportunity of doing
which has yet presented itself, — to call this view in question, but                     I
think it   seems somewhat improbable.             Indeed the structural             rela
tions which    I have observed       and which are described below, do not
appear to me to square with any of the received doctrines of Bra-
chiopod    circulation,     but  I  offer them simply as facts, not being
prepared at present to present any safe theory on the subject.
                                                    '
   In Waldheimia      flavescens   there are two      hearts,' situated as Pro
fessor Owen describes them, but so far as             I    have been able to ob
                                                             '        '
serve, the ventricle      cannot be described as an            oval       cavity, inas
much as it is an elongated cavity bent sharply upon itself.                      Hastily
examined of course this may appear oval.                  I  have     been    similarly
unable to discover ' the delicate membrane             of the venous sinuses,'
which is said by Professor Owen to " communicate with and                           close
the basal apertures of the auricles," or to perceive that the auricular

                                                112
 cavity can be
                    " correctly described as a closed one, consisting at the
 half next the ventricle, of a beautifully plicated muscular coat in
 addition      to the membranous one, but at the other half next the
 venous sinus of venous membrane only                    ; the latter might be termed
 the auricular sinus, the former the auricle proper."
                         '                                                                  '
     I presume that        this delicate membrane of the venous sinuses
 is what    I  have called the ilio-parietal          band, in which the base of the
 auricle is as it were set, like a landing-net                   in its hoop, but this
 does not close the base        of the auricle, the latter opening widely into
 the visceral chamber.
     I have equally failed       in detecting any arteries continued from the
apices of the ventricles          ;   and   I  have the less hesitation in supposing
 I  have not overlooked them, as Mr. Albany Hancock, whose works
are sufficient      evidence      of the value of his testimony, permits                 me
to say that he long since arrived at the conclusion that no such arte
ries exist.
     What     has given rise to the notion          of the existence of     these arteries
appears     to me to be this.           A narrow band resembling             those  I  have
already described, is attached in Waldheimia along the base of the
'
   ventricle' and the contiguous outer parietes of the auricle: inferiorly
it   passes    outwards to the sinuses, and running along their inner
wall, forms a sort of ridge or axis* from which the genitalia, whether
ovaria or testes, are developed,              stretching through their whole length
and following the ramifications of the sinuses.                   It is the  base  of these
ridges seen through the walls of the sinuses, where they extend
beyond the genitalia, which have been described as arteries.
    The upper     end  of the band        passes into the sinuses      of the upper lobe
of the mantle, and comes into the same relation with the genitalia
which they enclose.
    The walls of      the auricle in Waldheimia are curiously plaited, but
I  have been unable, in either auricle or ventricle, to detect any such
arrangement of muscular fibres as that which has been described
The epithelial investment of the auricle, on the other hand, is well
developed, and in the ventricle the corresponding inner coat is raised
up into rounded villous eminences.
    The ventricle lies in the thickness of             the parietes, while the auricle
floats in the visceral cavity, supported only by the ilio-parietal band.
        * This arrangement   is,    I find, particularly described by M. Gratiolet.

                                              113
The former is            at first directed downwards,         but then bends sharply
round and passes upwards to terminate by a truncated extremity
close to the subcesophageal            ganglion and bases of the arms.
  Mr. Hancock informs                me,    that in his dissections he repeatedly
                                                                '
found an aperture by which the apex of the                          ventricle'     communi
cated with the pallial cavity           ;   and that, taking this fact in combina
tion with the absence of any arteries leading from this part, he had
been tempted to doubt the cardiac nature of these organs altogether,
and to regard them rather as connected with the efferent genital
system, had not the difficulty               of determining whether these aper
tures were artificial or natural prevented his coming to any definite
conclusion at all.
  Before becoming acquainted with Mr. Hancock's investigations,                                I
had repeatedly observed             these apertures in Rhynchonella, but preoc
cupied with the received views on the subject, I at once interpreted
them as artificial.            A knowledge of Mr. Hancock's views, however,
led me to reconsider the question,                  and   I   have now        so repeatedly
observed          these apertures both in Waldheimia                and   in Rhynchonella,
that    I   am strongly inclined       to think they may after all be natural.
   If   these organs be hearts, in fact, Rhynchonella is the most remark
able of living Mollusks, for it possesses            four of them.            Two of these
occupy the same position as in Waldheimia, close to the origins of the
calcareous crus (A), while the other two are placed above these, and
above the mouth, one on each side                of the liver (i).         It is   these latter
which Professor Owen describes, while he has apparently overlooked
the other two, at least he says (speaking as               I presume of Rhyncho
nella)    c. p. 148) that the
            (/.                             venous sinuses " enter the two hearts
or dilated sinuses which are situated exterior                       to the liver, and in
T. Chilensis           and   T. Sowerbii just within      the   origins of the internal
calcareous loop."
   The fact is, that while          the ilio-parietal     bands support two
                                                                                     '
                                                                                         hearts'
as usual, the gastro-parietal               bands are in relation with two others.
The     base of the          'auricle' of    the latter opens        into the re-entering
angle formed by the gastro-parietal                 band      with the parietes, while
its apex          is   directed backwards to join the ventricle, which                   passes
downwards              and backwards along the posterior edge               of the posterior
division of the adductor muscle.
   The auricles in Rhynchonella                are far smaller,           both actually and

                                       114
proportionally,    than in Waldheimia.         They exhibit only       a few     longi
tudinal folds, and not only present the same deficiency of muscular
fibres as those of Waldheimia, but are so tied by the bands                      which
support them that it is difficult to conceive how muscular fibres, even
if they existed, could act.        The 'ventricles' in like manner lie ob
liquely in the parietes of the body, and simply present villous emi
nences on their inner surface, which has a yellowish                colour.
    All these  '
                 hearts' exhibit the same curious relation with the geni
                                                                              '
talia in Rhynchonella as in Waldheimia            ;  that is to say, a          genital
band' (/) proceeds from the        base  of   the ' ventricle'    and becomes the
axis of the curiously reticulated genital organ.              But in Rhynchonella
the genital      bands of the upper genitalia           come     from    their     own
 '
   hearts.'
    The arrangement of the genitalia in Rhynchonella               is very remark
able. The sinuses have the same arrangement in                    each lobe of the
mantle.      The single trunk formed by the union of the principal
branches in each lobe opens into the inner and anterior angle of a
large semilunar sinus which surrounds the bases of the adductors,
and opens into      the visceral cavity.       The floor of this great sinus is
marked out into meshes         by the reticulated       genital band, and from
 the centre of each mesh a flat partition passes, uniting the two walls
of the sinus, and breaking it up into irregular partial channels.
    There are the same anastomosing bands uniting the gastro-pa-
rietal and ilio-parietal     bands on the stomach in Rhynchonella as in
 Waldheimia, and      a pyriform vesicle of the same nature, but            I   did not
observe    in Rhynchonella those accessory vesicles upon the origins of
genital bands, which I observed once or twice in Waldheimia.
    I could find no trace of arteries terminating the elongated, ovoid
                        '
and nearly straight       ventricles' of Rhynchonella       ;  their ends appeared
truncated, and as     I have already said, repeatedly presented a distinct
external aperture.
    Such appear to me to be the facts respecting the structure of the
so-called hearts in the Terebratulidce      ;  what   I believe to be an import
ant part of their peripheral circulatory system,              has not hitherto, so
far as I am aware, received any notice.
    In Waldheimia the membranous walls of the body,                 the parieto-in-
 testinal bands and the        mantle, present a very peculiar            structure     ;
 they consist of an outer and an inner epithelial layer, of two corre

                                            115
spending       fibrous layers, and between them of           a  reticulated tissue,
which makes         up the principal      thickness of the layer, and in which
the nerves and great sinuses are imbedded.
   The    trabeculae     of this reticulated tissue contain granules and cell
like bodies, and       I  imagined them at first to represent       a   fibro-cellular
network,      the interspaces of which          I conceived were very probably
sinuses.      Sheaths of this tissue were particularly conspicuous along
the nerves.      On examining      the arms, however,     I found that the oblique
markings, which have given rise to the supposition that they are
surrounded by muscular bands, proceeded                from trabeculae of a simi
lar structure, which took a curved course from a canal which lies at
the base     of   the  cirri (not   the    great canal of the arms, of course)
round the outer convexity of the arm, and terminated by breaking
up into a network.            These trabeculae, however, were not solid but
hollow, and the interspaces between them were solid.                    The network
into which they broke up was formed by distinct canals, and then,
after uniting with two or three straight narrow canals which ran
along the outer convexity of the arm close to its junction with the
interbrachial       fold,   appeared    to become      connected with a similar
system of reticulated          canals which     occupied the thickness of that
fold.
    It was the examination of           the interbrachial     fold, in fact, which
first convinced me that these reticulated trabeculae were canals                  ; for
it is perfectly clear that       vessels or channels of some       kind must sup
ply the proportionally         enormous mass       of the united arms with their
nutritive material, and it is so easy to make thin sections of this part,
that   I can say quite definitely that no other system of canals than
these exists      in this locality.
   The facts, then, with regard to the real or supposed circulatory
organs of the Terebratulidte, are simply these : —
    1.  There     are two or four organs (hearts), composed            each of a free
funnel-shaped        portion with plaited walls, opening widely into the
visceral cavity at one end, and at the other connected by a constricted
neck, with narrower, oval or bent, flattened cavities, engaged in the
substance of the parietes.          The existence of muscular        fibres in either
of these is very doubtful.           It is certain that no arteries       are derived
from the apex of the so-called ventricle, but whether this naturally
opens externally or not is a point yet to be decided.

                                          116
    2. There is a system       of ramified peripheral      vessels.
    3. There are one or more pyriform vesicles.
                                 '           '                              '
   4. There are the large          sinuses     of the mantle, and the         visceral
cavity' into which they open.
   To determine in what way             these parts are connected and            what
functions     should be ascribed to each, it appears             to me that much
further research is required.
    Nervous System      of Terebratulidtc. — Professor Owen describes and
figures the central part of this system as a ring surrounding the oral
aperture, its inferior      portion being constituted by          a mere     commis
sural band.
    M. Gratiolet, however,       states with justice that the inferior side         of
this collar is the thicker,        and   I  find both in Rhynchonella and           in
 Waldheimia that it constitutes, in fact, a distinct oblong ganglion,
of a brownish colour by reflected light.              From its extremities com
missural branches pass          round     the   mouth,    while    other cords are
distributed     to the arms, to the superior and inferior pallial lobes,
and to the so-called hearts.           The     nerves   are marked by fine and
distinct longitudinal      striations, and can be traced to the margins of
the pallial lobes, where they become lost among the muscular fibres
of the free edges of the mantle.
    Structure    of the Arms.   —I    have    not been able to convince myself
of the existence of that spiral arrangement of the muscular fibres of
the arms which has been described in Rhynchonella and Waldheimia.
I  have found the     wall of the hollow cylinder of the arm to be con
stituted (1) externally, by an epithelium, within which lie (2) the
reticulated canals, which have been already described                ; (3) by a de
licate layer of longitudinal         or more oblique and transverse fibres,
which are probably         muscular,       and (4)    internally    by   a  granular
epithelial layer.
    In Rhynchonella the bases of the arms are terminated by two con
siderable sacs, which project upwards into the visceral cavity.                  Have
these    the function    of distending and        so straightening      the spirally
coiled, very flexible arms of this species          ?
    Affinities of the   Brachiopoda. — All that I        have seen of the struc
ture of these animals leads me to appreciate more and more highly
the value of      Mr. Hancock's suggestion, that             the   affinities of the
Brachiopoda are with the Polyzoa.              As in the Polyzoa, the flexure of

                                      117
  the intestine is neural, and they take a very natural position among
  the neural mollusks    between the Polyzoa on the one hand, and the
  Lamellibranchs    and Pteropoda on the other.
     The arms of the Brachiopoda may be compared with those of the
  Lophophore     Polyzoa, and   if it turns out that    the so-called hearts
  are not such organs, one difference     will  be removed.
     In conclusion,   I may repeat what I      have  elsewhere adverted to,
  that though the difference between the cell of        a Polyzoon    and the
  shell of a Terebratula appears wide enough, yet the resemblance be
 tween the latter with its muscles and the Avicularium        of a Polyzoon,
 is exceedingly close and striking.
 VIII. "An       Inquiry into some of the circumstances           and prin
        ciples  which regulate     the production      of Pictures on the
        Retina of the Human Eye, with their measure of endurance,
        their Colours andChanges."      — Part II. By theRev. William
        Scoresby, D.D., F.R.S., Corresp. Inst. of France, &c.
        Received   May 31, 1854.
     This second part of the author's inquiries concerning phenomena
 in optical spectra, embraced the results in respect of colour in the
 images impressed on the retina, as derived simply from the influence
of light.
    The optical spectra from white, grey, or black opake objects under
faint illumination, or of ordinary windows or apertures transmitting
low degrees of light, were usually found to be without colour. But
ordinary daylight,     and, much more, the light from bright sunshine
(as is well known),     yield chromatic spectra of vivid or brilliant hues.
By viewing with slightly closed       eyes, the pictures impressed on the
retina by a few seconds' steady gazing at some fixed point of an
illuminated object, and noting the various effects, disappearances and
changes, a considerable number of characteristic           phenomena were
elicited, and the effects of a variety of modifying circumstances satis
factorily determined.      The most prevailing influences in modifying
the phenomena     —  whatever other causes might tend to the produc
tion of variation in the colours — were found to be referable      to  differ

                                        118
  ences in the degree of intensity of the external         light, in  the extent
  of time occupied in gazing at the illuminated object, in the quantity
  of light penetrating the chamber of the eye whilst examining the
 spectra, and in the normal condition of the eye itself.            These, with
 other modifying      circumstances, had been somewhat elaborately in
 vestigated.
     Different degrees of light, whether reflected        from white objects,
 or transmitted     by colourless glass, had obviously the tendency to
 yield differences in the colours of the primarily developed pictures
 on the retina, with corresponding varieties in the nature and number
 of  the subsequent changes.        Thus    the viewing for a few seconds        of
 an aperture    in  a window the size     of  a pane   of glass, whilst all    the
 rest was covered with      a thick brown-paper      screen,   gave, with a low
 degree   of daylight, transparent pictures of a     dingy orange, olive, yel
 low-grey or bluish black tint, changing, most usually, into            a  rusty-
 tinted blackish spectrum, and disappearing, for the most part, in                a
 minute of time or less.       From    medium degrees     of daylight, the pri
 mary pictures embraced        a considerable variety      of colours, such     as
 crimson-pink, purple-pink, violet, purple, indigo, blue, — the blue
 being the highest in the scale of intensity.               The most marked
 changes, commencing with blue, were usually from blue to red, or
 to crimson, olive, black fading into blackish grey.            In certain  cases
 rapid and evanescent glances were had of several intermediate colours.
 The general photochromatic         effects   of the higher degrees     of light,
 such as from a clear sky in full sunshine, were far more uniform
than those from inferior light           The spectrum first elicited, even
after viewing a window or window-aperture           for three or four seconds
 only, was almost always green,          with the character of illuminated
 transparency    ; the shades of colour however varied with the inten
sity of the impression.       The picture always        appeared    within   four
or five seconds after closing the eyes, and when the light had been
strong and the gazing continued for a quarter of a minute or more,
the picture would burst out almost instantly.              The restoration of
the picture in new colours, after the vanishing, had very much the
character and appearance      of the dissolving views    effected by the magic
lanthorn.      The  frame of the window or aperture, and the cross
bars,   were always pictured in colours different from those of the
panes,    besides  a  fine marginal line of another colour dividing the

                                        119
glass and the frames.          These consequential   colours,  constitute, as is
 well known,     a remarkable      feature in the phenomena.         They    have
generally a certain complementary relation, or tendency to such, to
the colours of the primary picture.         Thus in the clear green or blue
spectrum of a window,           derived from strong illumination,        the re
 mainder of the field of the eye will generally, in the first instance,
be covered with a ground of glowing crimson, with cross-bars simi
lar, and purple edgings       ; and when the picture changes to crimson
 or red, the antagonistic tint will also change, perhaps to purple, or
orange or brown.         The original spectra were found to       fade away at
intervals, often of tolerable equality, such as of eight or nine seconds,
disappearing perhaps for two or three seconds,          and then reappearing
under, generally, some change of shade or tint, through an extent of
very numerous repetitions.           The changes of colour from      the bright
or emerald green, as very frequently traced, went rapidly through
yellow-green, yellow, orange, red, scarlet, crimson and brown, or olive.
And this    series,  it is observable, is particularly accordant, in respect
to  the principal or fundamental colours, with that of the prismatic
spectrum from green to yellow, orange and red.            These visual photo
graphs, besides      having the sharpest definition, and often the most
brilliant illuminated colours, were found to          possess,   under strong
intensities of impression,       a remarkable degree of permanency —ex
tending sometimes to endurance for an hour or longer after the act
of gazing.
   Investigations     on the relation of the photochromatic developments
to the time of gazing, gave results in many respects            corresponding
with those derived from differences in the degree of external light.
Thus   the higher colours     of the spectral series elicited by strong    light,
could, within certain limits, be also developed by more             continuous
gazing with inferior light       : so that the pink-coloured     spectrum de
rived from ten to twenty seconds' gazing in low degrees                of light,
could be elicited by a single glance under bright             sunshine.      The
results, therefore, were clearly in relation to the intensity of the im
pression  ;  and, taken in the form of      a general proposition, we shall
not be far wrong, perhaps, in considering the intensity of impression
as the product      of  the time   of gazing into the relative quantity of
light admitted by the aperture.

the impression, yielded       (comparatively and roughly       taken) the fol
lowing series, — crimson-pink,        purple-pink,   purple, blue, green, the
latter being the produce of the highest intensity tried.
    As in the foregoing researches, the relative degrees of light were
but broadly assumed, whilst the comparative experiments comprised
a    variety   of   differences    affecting   the photochromatic       results,
another series     of experiments on the simple effects          of degrees   of
light was instituted, in which all these other differences were elimi
nated.     In this series the quantity of light was varied by partial or
sectional screens      of glass, or other transparent or semitransparent
substances.       The results    were   particularly  satisfactory, — different
tints or shades of colour being obtained by the same view and in the
 same spectrum of a window-aperture,           when different thicknesses     of
window glass were placed in the several sections (six in number) into
 which the aperture was divided.
    A beautiful example of      the chromatic effects of partial and varied
 screening of light on the optical spectrum elicited, was incidentally
 obtained by viewing an aperture in the clouds, when the sky was
 otherwise densely covered.          After gazing for   a few seconds    on the
 middle of this aperture, the spectrum, as viewed with gently closed
 eyes, exhibited a singular variety of the richest tints according to the
 differences in the light screened        off by the edges of the cloud and
 by certain little patches within the aperture.         The spectrum resem
 bled the variegation and richness of colouring as elicited in certain
 transparent or semitransparent substances when examined by polar
 ized light.
    The experiments on binocular and multiple spectra, as described
 in Part I. of the author's paper, being repeated under degrees of
 light   adequate   for yielding colour, gave pictures, in many cases, of
 much interest and beauty.          The multiple spectra, however, which
 proved the most strikingly beautiful,          were derived from the sun,
 which was viewed indirectly, and on occasions, near setting, in winter,
 when the intensity of its light was duly subdued by passing through
 a dense condition of atmosphere.         Under such circumstances, images,
 sometimes in 100 to 150         repetitions, were impressed on the retina
 by rapid glances at the sky immediately around the sun.            These were
 taken by quick movements of the head, winking intermediately,                 at
 the rate    of 60 to    1 20 impressions in the minute      ; and   the result.

                                      121
when viewed with closed eyes, presented a splendid spectacle like           a
cluster of coloured stars, or rather of round planetary discs, brilliant
in green, yellow, orange, red, crimson and purple !
    Besides the experiments thus far described, in which        the spectral
images were viewed/for the most part, with gently closed eyes kept
steadily in the direction in which the objects were gazed on, —the
differences, which were often very remarkable, produced by alter
ations in the quantity of light admitted into the chamber of the eye
whilst the image was viewed, were also investigated.             Sometimes
the smallest change in the light thus transmitted was found to alter
greatly the character of the spectrum.         In certain  cases, the com
pressing of the eyelids, or the mere passing of the hands betwixt the
eyes and the    light, would   serve to change a negative picture into a
positive, or the colours, as viewed in the usual way, into their com
plementary tints.
    The paper concludes with      a considerable series of deductions, ap
plications and general results.    — 1. As to the elucidation yielded by
these ocular spectra, of the theory of vision. — 2. Of the principles of
binocular and simple vision. — 3. Of the action of the retina for the
obliterating  of impressed images, and the recovery of       a normal con
dition. — 4. Of the nature of certain disturbing and dazzling effects
of vision by strong light. — 5. Of the phenomena of certain spectral
illusions. — 6. As to   the practical use of the process of examining the
ocular spectra, for the determination of quantities of light relatively
intercepted by different portions or thicknesses of glass or other trans
parent media. — 7. For assisting in the determination of the relative
degrees of illumination     of lamps, candles,   &c, and of quantities of
                                        —
light reflected from opake objects. 8. For aiding in the selection
and harmonizing of colours in ornamental and decorative depart
ments of art. — 9. For the examination of the condition of the inte
rior of the  eyes  in certain states of disease.   The author having had
the opportunity     of trying this process   in case of amaurosis, found
that it afforded a perfect picture of defects in the surface of the re
tina of the eyes separately, when there was no visible defect, and
when the patient had no other perception of a diseased eye, or patch
on the retinal surface, except the partial distortion       or interruption
of vision.   Founded on this, the author suggests       a plan of scotome-
trical examination of retinal    defects, by which not only the accurate
                                                               n 2

duced.
IX. " On      the frequent occurrence     of Indigo in Human Urine,
      and    on    its   Chemical,    Physiological      and    Pathological
      Relations."       By Arthur      Hill   Hassall, M.D., Member
      of the Royal College of Physicians, Physician to the Royal
      Free Hospital, &c.        Communicated by Professor Sharpey,
       Sec.  R.S.     Received   June 10, 1854.
   The present communication         embraces   some further observations
and   experiments      on  the occurrence of indigo       in human      urine.
From these it appears       that the presence of that substance is even
more common than the author was led           to anticipate from his first
inquiries, the results of which were communicated to the Society in
June last.
   The author furnishes additional proofs of      the blue colouring matter
in question being really indigo,       by converting it into isatine and
aniline ;  for this purpose it was necessary to obtain the pigment in
considerable quantity.
   Contrasting    its chemical and physiological      relations with haema-
tine and urine pigment, he shows that indigo is closely allied in its
nature and origin to those substances, and he considers that when
indigo is met with in urine in considerable amount, it forms a vehicle
for the elimination of any excess of carbon contained in the system.
This view is borne out by the important fact, that the greater
number of cases in which indigo has been observed to be developed
in the urine in large amount have been cases of extensive tubercular
disease   of the lungs,   and in which the decarbonizing         functions  of
those organs are greatly impaired.

 X. " On         the Effect of the Pressure of the Atmosphere on the
         Mean Level of the Ocean."               By Captain Sir James       Clark
          Ross, R.N., F.R.S.           Received    June 15, 1854.
    The author        states  that, in September 1848, Her Majesty's ships
 Enterprize       and Investigator having anchored in the harbour of Port
 Leopold       in lat. 74°   N. and long.     91°  W.,  a heavy pack of ice was
 driven down upon and completely closed the harbour's mouth, thus
 effectually      preventing    their egress, and compelling       them   there to
 pass the winter of 1848-49.              It was during that period that        the
 series of observations here presented            to the Royal Society was ob
 tained    ;  and, as the observations were made under peculiarly favor
 able circumstances, the author considers they will throw some light
 on the movements of the tides, and on some of the causes of their
apparent irregularities.
    Soon after the harbour had been completely frozen over, a very
heavy pressure from the main pack forced the newly- formed sheet
of   ice,    which covered      the bay, far up towards       its head,   carrying
the ships with it into such shallow water that at low spring-tides
their keels       sometimes    rested on the ground.        Under these circum
stances the movements of the tides became to the author an object
of great anxiety,         and consequently      of careful observation, in order
to ascertain the amount of irregularities             to which they were liable
in that particular locality.
    The first few days' observations          evidenced  much larger differences
in  the elevation or depression         of successive high or low-waters than
could be       accounted for by any of the generally received causes of
disturbance       ; and the author was at once led to connect them with
changes of the pressure of the atmosphere, from perceiving that on
the days      of great atmospheric pressure high- water was not            so high
as  it ought      to have been,    and low-water was lower than its proper
height     ;  and that the reverse        took place    on the days of smaller
pressure.
   As it was found that the usual method of determining                 the mean
level of the sea, by taking          the mean of successive      high- and low-
waters, was inadequate to the detection of small quantities arising
from a change in the pressure,           a  system of observation was adopted

                                        124
  different from that heretofore practised, in order to determine the
  mean level of the sea on each day.
     In the first instance, simultaneous observations of           the   height of
  the tide and of the mercury         in the barometer were made every
  quarter of an hour throughout the twenty-four hours.                 From these
  it was found that the mean       level of the sea for each day could be
  determined with great accuracy, and that the variation in the daily
  mean level and      in the  mean   pressure of the atmosphere followed
  each other in a remarkable manner, so that a rise in the former cor
  responded to      a  diminution  in the latter.      Subsequently       however
  hourly observations were adopted.
     The peculiar advantages of the position of the ships at Port Leo
 pold for making tidal observations are stated to have consisted in : —
     1. The great width       of the entrance of       the   harbour admitting
 the free ingress and egress of the          water, combined with the large
 field of ice which covered the whole of the bay, completely subduing
 every undulation of the water.
     2. The     steady movement of the immense          platform of ice, rising
 and falling     with such singular regularity and precision          as to admit
 the reading off the marks of the tide-pole with the greatest exactnesss,
 even to the tenth of an inch.
     3. The shallowness of the water and the             evenness    and solidity
 of the clay bottom admitting the fixture of the tide-pole               with im
 moveable     firmness.
     4. The whole surface of the       sea in the neighbourhood         being, for
 the greater part of the time, covered         by a sheet of ice,      preventing
 those irregularities    which occur in other localities      from the violence
 of the wind raising or depressing the sea in as many different de
 grees as   it varied in strength or duration.
     For fixing the tide-pole for the "Enterprize"         a hole 2 feet square
 was cut through the icy platform, and a strong pole, nearly 40 feet
 long, was passed through it and driven firmly down several feet into
 the clay, being fixed by heavy iron          weights, which      also rested  on
 the clay and prevented any movement           of the pole.     It was placed in
about 21 feet depth of water at the time of mean level of the sea.
Another such tide-pole was, in         a  like manner, fixed through a hole
in the ice close to the
                            " Investigator," for    the sake of reference and
comparison.

                                       125
   Hourly observations of      the height of the tide and of the barometer
were commenced on the 1st of November, and were continued by
the officers of each ship throughout the whole of the nine following
months to the end of       July.    After forty-seven days of observation
an interruption in one of the series occurred in consequence              of the
tide- pole of the   " Enterprize" having      been drawn up by the ice, to
the under part of which it had become frozen.            The amount of       dis
placement of the pole was easily determined by a comparison with
that of the    " Investigator," but    several days elapsed    before   it could
be satisfactorily    fixed at the same point    in which it   had been origi
nally.     The observations of     these forty-seven   days are those which
are given in the paper, and their discussion is the immediate object
of  the communication.
    It is stated that subsequent observations       seem to show that, from
the time of the interruption      to the middle of    July, there   was a pro
gressive elevation of the mean level of the sea, which, although                of
small amount,       was sufficiently    evident from month to month to
render the subdivision of the series desirable, in order that the indi
vidual observations of each separate division should be strictly com
parable.
   The height of      the sea and the corresponding height        of  the mer
cury in the barometer, at every hour in each day, from the 1st No
vember to the 18th December 1848 are given in tables.                  In  these
the arithmetic mean of the hourly heights of the sea for each day is
taken as the mean level of the sea for that day, and the mean of
the hourly heights of the barometer is taken as the corresponding
height    of the barometer.       These    mean   levels and corresponding
mean barometric heights are given in another two-column                    table,
arranged in the order of the days of observation            ;  and in a third
table these are arranged in the order of the heights of the barometer
with the corresponding mean levels, without regard to the              dates   of
observation, for the purpose of showing the dependence               which the
latter have on the former.
   On    these  tables the author makes the following remarks.               The
forty-seven days of hourly observations give for the mean height of
the barometer      29874 inches, and of the mark of        the mean level of
the sea 21 feet    021 in.

Thus    a difference    of pressure equal to 0-668 inch produced a differ
ence    of  9  inches in the mean level of the sea.           As the ratio of 9 to
.668 is 13-467 to        1,   the author considers that the effect of the pres
sure   of   the atmosphere on the level of the sea is 13-467                times as
great as the effect       it produces on the mercury in the barometer, or
very nearly in the inverse ratio of the specific gravities of sea- water
and mercury.          He however       states  that this remarkable coincidence
must be considered in            a  great measure     accidental, for if a greater
number of days' observation be taken in order to deduce the mean
greatest and mean least pressure, and the corresponding mean levels,
a  different result will be obtained.          From   these observations however
he considers that he has been enabled to deduce results which                  plainly
point to the law which governs the effect of the pressure of the atmo
sphere     on the mean level of the sea, and may be encouraged to
pursue the investigation through a more extended series of observa
tions, in order to arrive at the most accurate conclusion that the ob
served facts may       justify.
    In conclusion     a formula is given for determining the correct height
of the tide, or of the mean level of the sea            : —
    Let  L    denote the correct height of the tide, or of the mean level
             of the sea   ;
         B the    mean pressure of the atmosphere           ;

             water  :

    Examples are given of the application of this formula.

XI. "On the Thermal Effects of Fluids in Motion."— No. II.
       By J. P. Joule, Esq., F.R.S. and Professor W. Thomson,
        F.R.S.     Received   June 15, 1854.
    The first experiments described in this paper show that the ano
malies exhibited in the last table of experiments, in the paper pre
ceding   it*, are due to fluctuations of temperature      in the issuing steam
consequent on a change of the pressure with which the entering air is
forced into the plug.      It appears    from these experiments, that when
a considerable alteration is suddenly made         in the pressure of the     en
tering stream, the issuing stream experiences remarkable successions
of augmentations and diminutions of temperature, which are some
times perceptible for half an hour after the pressure of the entering
stream has ceased to vary.
    Several series of experiments are next described in which air is
forced (by means of the large pump and other apparatus described
in the first paper) through      a  plug of cotton wool, or unspun silk
pressed    together, at pressures varying in their          excess   above the
atmospheric pressure, from five or six up to fifty or sixty pounds on
the square inch.      By these it appears that the cooling effect which
the air, as found in the authors' previous experiments, always ex
periences in passing through the porous plug, varies proportionally
to the excess of the pressure of the air on entering the plug above
that with which it is allowed to escape.             Seven series    of experi
ments, in each of which the air entered the plug at a temperature of
about 16° Cent., gave a mean         cooling effect of about -0175°Cent.,
per pound on the square inch, or -27° Cent. per atmosphere, of dif
ference of pressure.      Experiments made at lower and at higher tem
peratures showed that the cooling effect is very sensibly less for
high than for low temperatures, but have not yet led to sufficiently
exact results at other temperatures than that stated (16° Cent.) to
indicate the law according to which it varies with the temperature.
    Experiments    on carbonic acid at different temperatures are also
described, which show that at about 16° Cent., this gas experiences
4} times as great a cooling effect as air.         They  agree well at all the
   * Communicated   to the Royal Society,  June 1853, and published in the Trans,
notions.

                                       128
different temperatures with       a  theoretical result derived according to
the general dynamical        theory from an empirical        formula   for the
pressure of carbonic acid in terms of its temperature and density,
which was kindly communicated by               Mr. Rankine to the authors,
having been investigated by him upon no other experimental data
than those of Regnault on the expansion of the gas by heat and its
compressibility.
    Experiments were also made on hydrogen gas, which, although
not such as to lead to accurate determinations, appeared           to indicate
very decidedly a cooling       effect amounting     to a small fraction, per
haps about y'j, of that which air would          experience in the same cir
cumstances.
    The following theoretical deductions from          these  experiments are
made    : —
    I. The relations between the heat generated and            the work spent
in compressing carbonic acid, air and hydrogen, are investigated
from the experimental results.          In each case the relation is nearly
that of equivalence, but the heat developed exceeds the equivalent
of the work      spent, by a very small amount for hydrogen, consider
ably more for air, and still -more           for carbonic acid.    For slight
 compressions with the       gases kept about the temperature 16°, this
 excess amounts to about 7'7        of the whole heat emitted in the       case
of carbonic acid, and           m tne case of air.
    II. It  is shown by the general dynamical theory, that the air ex
 periments, taken in connexion with Regnault's           experimental results
 on the latent heat and pressure of saturated steam, make it certain
 that the density of saturated steam increases          very much more with
 the pressure than according to Boyle's           and Gay-Lussac's     gaseous
 laws, and numbers are given expressing the theoretical densities of
 saturated steam at different temperatures, which it is desired should
 be verified by direct experiments.
    III.  Carnot's   function   in the " Theory of the Motive Power of
 Heat"    is shown to be very nearly equal to the mechanical equivalent
 of the thermal unit divided by the temperature from the zero of the
 air-thermometer (that is, temperature Centigrade with a number equal
 to the reciprocal of the coefficient of expansion added), and correc
 tions, depending on the amount of the observed cooling effects in the
 new air experiments, and the deviations from the gaseous laws of

                                              12!)
expansion       and compression determined by Regnault,                are applied to
give a more precise evaluation.
    IV. An absolute         scale of temperature, that is, a scale not founded
on reference to any particular                thermometric substance or to any
special    qualities of any      class   of bodies, is founded on the following
definition    : —
    If   a  physical system       be subjected     to cycles of perfectly reversible
operations      and be not allowed       to take in or to emit heat except in loca
lities, at two fixed temperatures,           these temperatures   are proportional to
the whole       quantities   of  heat taken in or emitted       at them respectively
during a complete cycle         of the    operations.
    The principles upon which the unit or              degree  of temperature is to
be chosen, so as to make the difference of temperatures on the abso
lute scale, agree with that on any other scale for a particular range
of temperatures.           If  the   difference of temperatures between the
freezing and the boiling-points              of water be made 100° on the new
-l  ile, the absolute temperature            of the freezing-point    is shown to be
              .
about 273       7 ; and it is demonstrated that the temperatures from the
freezing-point       on the new scale will agree very closely with Centi
grade temperature by the standard air- thermometer                     ; quite within
the   limits of the most accurate practical thermometry when                  the tem
perature is between 0° and 100° Cent., and very nearly                    if not quite
within     these limits for temperatures up to 300° Cent.
    V. An empirical formula for the pressure of air in terms of its
density, and its temperature on the absolute scale, is investigated, by
using forms such as those first proposed and used by Mr. Rankine,
and determining          the  constants so as to fulfil the conditions (1) of
giving the observed          cooling effects, (2) of agreeing with Regnault's
observations on expansion by heat, and (3) of agreeing with Reg
nault's experimental results on compressibility at a particular tem
perature.
    A table of comparison of temperature by the air-thermometer
under varied conditions of temperature and pressure with the abso
lute scale, is deduced from this formula.
    Expressions for the specific heats of any fluid in terms of the ab
solute temperature, the           density, and the pressure, derived from the
general dynamical theory, are worked out for the case of air accord
ing to the empirical formula           ;   and tables of numerical results derived

                                    130
exclusively from these expressions and the ratio of the specific heats
as determined by the theory       of sound, are     given.     These tables
show the mechanical values of the specific heats of air at different
constant   pressures,   and at different     constant densities.      Taking
1390 as the mechanical equivalent of the thermal unit as determined
by Mr. Joule's experiment       on the friction    of fluids, the authors
find, as the mean specific heat of air under constant pressure,
                      .2390, from 0° to 100° Cent.
                      .2384, from 0° to 300° Cent.

   This compound is formed by acting upon glycerine with a mix
ture, in equal volumes, of concentrated nitric and sulphuric acids,
the glycerine being added by a few drops at a time.
   It is heavier than water, in which it is slightly soluble, and is
soluble in alcohol and in ether.
   From its proneness to decomposition in drying,          even by the    air-
pump, a complete analysis could not be made, but a qualitative ex
amination of the relative amounts of carbon and nitrogen gave the
following results : —

   From these results the following formula was deduced           :.

   It would therefore appear that 3H     are replaced by    3N01.
   On boiling this compound with concentrated solution of potash, it
   decomposed into glycerine and nitrate of potash.

              New Phosphite of Ethyl, 3C4 H50, P0S."
                         a                           By
       A. W. Williamson, Ph.D., &c. Communicated by Dr.
        Sharpey, Sec. R.S.                   Received       June 15, 1854.
  The following results were obtained by Mr. Railton in an in
vestigation undertaken in connexion with the idea that the water
of constitution               discovered by Wurtz           may be conceived as basic.
The    processes             for preparing the compound are thus described by
Mr. Railton.
   1st.    When three             atoms of absolute alcohol are acted upon by one
atom of       PCI,, this compound is formed.                  The alcohol is introduced
into a retort which is connected with an apparatus for upward distil
lation, and the retort is surrounded with a freezing mixture.   The
terchloride            is then added       drop by drop, the whole is then gently
heated for some time, the vapour being allowed to run back into the
retort.       It       is now distilled and the portion which comes               off between
140° C. and 196° C. collected and redistilled, that portion being pre
served which boils between 188° and 191° C.    The quantity of pure
ether obtained by this process was not large, and there was left in
the retort  considerable amount of P03 and other products, which
                   a
on further heating evolved inflammable phosphuretted hydrogen.
   2nd. This ether is obtained with the greatest facility from ethy-
late of soda and terchloride of phosphorus.
   I   introduce into a thirty ounce stoppered retort about a pint of
ether, which must be perfectly free from alcohol and from water.
The ethylate of               soda is then added, and as much PCI3 is taken as
is necessary to form chloride of sodium and phosphite of ethyl.                             The
ether is absolutely necessary, for without                    it,   the action of the PCI,     is
so violent, as to set fire to the ethylate.
   The PCI,             is   introduced    into the mixture of ether and ethylate of
soda      through        a    long funnel,    which    is   drawn to an extremely fine
point, by which means               it    enters drop by drop into the mixture, thus
avoiding the violent action which otherwise occurs.
   The retort should               be kept quite cool and frequently shaken.                  If
these precautions are neglected considerable loss                       is   experienced.
   When        the whole of the PCI3 has been added, the ether                     is   distilled
off by    a   water-bath.           The retort    is   then transferred to an oil-bath

                                          132
which is gradually heated up to about 240° C.                  The whole of the
distillate obtained by the oil-bath is collected in a dry receiver, and
as it is prone to decomposition if distilled in air, it is distilled in an
atmosphere of hydrogen, the portion which comes off at 188° C. is
the phosphite of ethyl.          I  may here notice the remarkable fact, that
this substance has two boiling points, as doubtless have many other
bodies,   if distilled under similar circumstances.             In air it boils at
191°   C. while,    as I  said before, it boils in hydrogen at 188° C.          Its
specific gravity is 1-075.
   3rd. The reaction which             occurs on the formation of this ether
may be represented by the following formula               : —
             3NaO, C4H50 + PCl3=3NaCl+3C4HsO,                    P03.
   The carbon and hydrogen were estimated in the usual manner by
oxide of copper, the phosphorus as follows.                 A weighed portion of
the ether was introduced             into a twelve ounce stoppered bottle          ;
concentrated nitric        acid was poured upon it, and the bottle allowed
to stand in a warm place, loosely stopped, for several days.               When
nitrous fumes no longer appeared,            the oxidation of the phosphorous
acid was deemed to be complete.              The acid liquid was then saturated
with ammonia, some chloride of ammonium and sulphate of magnesia
then added, and the mixture well shaken.                It was allowed to stand
for some time, when a precipitate of phosphate of magnesia and
ammonia was formed           ; this was washed, dried, and ignited, and the
amount of phosphorus calculated from the result.                   These are the
results.

   These results being satisfactory as regards the formula, the den
sity of the vapour was then ascertained and found to be in strict
accordance with theory.         The method of taking the vapour densities
of bodies liable to oxidation was described by me about twelve months
ago, in the Chemical Society's Quarterly Journal.               It  was used in
the following experiments.
    1st. Weight of globe filled with air at 53° F. and 30            2 in.  baro
meter, 188     21 3 grs.

   Weight of globe and vapour at 521° F. and 30-3 in. barometer,
192 387 grs.
   Capacity of globe at 60°      F.,  6 00 cub. in.
   Residual hydrogen -05 cub. in.
   Capacity of globe at 521° F., 6 40 cub. in.
   Six cubic inches of air      at 53°  F. and 30-2 in. barometer,       become
at 60°F. and 30 in. barometer 6-12 cub. in., and weigh 1-90 grs.
   .05 cub.   in. hydrogen at     60°  F. become    -094 cub. in. at 521°     F.,
and weigh -002 grs.
   6-40— 094=6-306 cub. in. vapour             at521°F., which at 60°F.
and 30 in. barometer =3-376 cub. in.
   Hence     192-387— -002=192-385-186-313=6072                     grains,  the
weight of 3-376 cub. in. vapour.
                     100 cubic inches.    . =179 8Ggrs.
                      100  cubic inches air= 3T01 grs.
The density is therefore 5-800, from which it           appears   that its com
bining measure is four volumes.
   Density by calculation =5-763.
   A second experiment       gave 5-877.
   This substance      has a highly offensive  odour, it burns with a bluish
white flame,     is soluble in water, alcohol, and ether, and is slowly
decomposed      in contact with air.
   On boiling phosphite of ethyl with concentrated solution of baryta,
in water, it is decomposed into alcohol and              a  salt which varies
according to the amount of baryta used.             If one atom    of the ether
be treated   with   one of baryta, a crystallized salt is produced on eva
poration,   the carbon and hydrogen in which are, according to an
analysis I have just completed.

lowing formula and to     be completely anhydrous, 2C4H,,0,             BaO, P03,
but  if we  suppose   that four atoms of water are present in the salt
analyzed, the relation will stand thus

                            5-356                 5-540
   The formula would then          be 2C4H50,     BaO, P03 + 4HO.
   When two atoms of baryta             are made to act upon one atom            of
the ether, a salt is obtained which         does not crystallize,      and it may
be evaporated   in air without sensible decomposition. This salt is per
fectly neutral to test paper ; when dry it is a white friable delique
scent mass, the formula of which will be C4HsO, 2BaO, P03.                        If
an excess of baryta is used, a white salt is thrown down on boiling,
which   I suppose   to be  HO, 2BaO, P03.
   I have  prepared another compound with three equivalents of amyle.
This was obtained from amylate of            soda by an analogous process        to
that described for the phosphite of ethyl.
   Analysis   has  pointed     out    the  formula      3C10H,,O,     P03.    Like
phosphite of ethyl it is easily decomposed             on being heated      in air ;
heated in hydrogen     it is more stable and then boils at 236° C. It is
soluble in ether and in alcohol, but only slightly soluble in water.

 XIV. "On        some new derivatives        of Chloroform."         By A. W.
        Williamson, Ph.D., &c.           Communicated by Dr. Sharpey,
        Sec.  R.S.    Received    June 15, 1854.
    According to    the   results of recent researches in the constitution
of salts and the methods thence introduced of explaining chemical
reactions, it is equally correct to represent such a reaction as that of
hydrochloric    acid on hydrate of potash, as consisting in an exchange
of hydrogen of the one for potassium of the other, or of chlorine in
one for peroxide of hydrogen in the other.           In Mr. Kay's researches
as described in the following brief        outline,  this notion has obtained
very striking illustration     ; for he has obtained a peculiar body in
which the chlorine of chloroform is replaced by peroxide of ethyle
by the action of chloroform on three atoms of ethylate of sodium,
which product may be equally well conceived to be              a body  in which
the hydrogen of three atoms          of alcohol is replaced by the tribasic
radical of chloroform.
   According to the older theories of the capacity of saturation of
salts, this compound would contain a tribasic modification of formic
acid, for it has the same relation to formic          ether as a so-called tri
basic phosphate has to      a monobasic one.
   To    one equivalent of chloroform       were added,     by degrees,   three
equivalents of dry and powdered ethylate of soda, a violent action
taking place with the evolution of much         heat ;  the liquid was entirely
distilled from the residue (chloride of sodium) by means of an oil-
bath, and then subjected to a series of fractional distillations, which
yielded   a  small distillate between 50° and 60° C., smelling strongly
of vinous ether,    a large distillate (about three-fourths      of the whole)
between 77° and 78°       C,  which was chiefly    alcohol,  and another small
distillate (about one-sixth) between 145° and 145-3° C.
   The distillates obtained by the above process, except that of alcohol,
being small, the following modification was adopted.
   Sodium was dissolved in absolute alcohol until the action became
feeble,   chloroform was then added,        care being taken       to keep the
liquid alkaline; more sodium was then added, and the process re
peated several    times, until the chloride of sodium precipitated be
came very bulky.        The liquid was then distilled off and chloroform
   VOl. Vi1.                                                          o

                                        136
added   to the residue, and also distilled off.            To this first distillate
sodium was again added, and treated             with the last distillate instead
of pure chloroform, the same precautions being used as before.                    This
method gave similar distillates, and in about the same proportion as
that first used  ; the highest distillate        however boiled constantly at
 146° instead   of at 145-3° C.
    This compound which boils at              145°  to   146° C. is a colourless
limpid liquid,   only slightly soluble in water, having a strongly aro
matic odour, readily inflammable and burning without much smoke                       ;
its specific gravity is '8964      ; it remained liquid at 0° F.
    Several analyses made of this body agree in giving to it the for
mula C7Hl603,         which   would also be the empirical formula of                 a
tribasic formic-ether     ; the density of its vapour also corresponds very
closely with the same formula.
    Pentachloride of phosphorus added to a portion of the compound
produced a heavy liquid having the odour of chloroform.
    A small quantity of the body was dissolved in alcohol, distilled
upwards for two or three hours with solid hydrate of potash and
then distilled off   ;  the residue was next dissolved in water and made
exactly neutral by hydrochloric         acid, filtered to remove the turbidity,
and then a few drops of chloride of mercury added              ;  after a little time
and by the application       of heat,    a  very slight precipitate of subchlo-
ride of mercury was formed            ; also the colour of sesquichloride of
iron  was a  little darkened by another portion of               the solution, thus
showing    that the action of potash on the compound had produced
formic acid, but in very small quantity.
    An equivalent of dry hydrochloric acid was              passed    into  a portion
of the compound     ;  the gas was    wholly absorbed,      a considerable amount
of heat being evolved and the liquid assuming a brownish colour                  ; the
liquid after the absorption of the gas still remained perfectly neutral.
 It was next distilled with    the thermometer        : it began to boil at 20° C.
and rose gradually to 100°; it was collected in three portions, the first
 (about one-sixth of the whole) passing over between 20° and 50°, the
second (about one-third) between 50° and 68°, the third (one-half)
between 68° and 100°.            I   was unable to carry these distillations
further in consequence of the small quantity of the liquid available.
    Two equivalents of dry hydrochloric                acid were passed        into a
larger quantity of the compound           ;  towards the close the gas was ab

                                         ia7
sorbed less freely, a portion passing through               ; after this treatment,
the liquid fumed and was highly acid                ; it was distilled upwards for
some time by which a portion          of   free hydrochloric     acid was expelled,
and then distilled fractionally        ; about one-third       came over    between
56° and 60°C., one-fourth between 60° and 70°, one-sixth between
70° and 80°, and the remainder (about one-fourth) between 80° and
88°. To the lowest distillate about an equal bulk of water was
added    ;  the substance    floated on the surface        and seemed to be little,
if at all dissolved by the water         ;   a   sufficient quantity of carbonate
of soda was next added           to neutralize the free acid, and the liquid
pipetted from the water, it was then distilled upwards for some time
with dry chloride of calcium, and afterwards distilled off; this distil
late was found to boil constantly at 55-5° C.                 An analysis made of
this body agrees closely with the formula C6 H14 Ov
   The distillate which came over between 60° and 70° after being
treated in the same way as the lower distillate, also yielded                a  liquid
which boiled at 56°C.
   As both methods hitherto          used for the        purpose of obtaining the
body C7 Hl8 Os afforded only small quantities, the treatment of
chloroform with an alcoholic solution of potash was tried ; for this
purpose 12 oz. of solid hydrate of potash and 20 oz. of quicklime
were added to about three pints of absolute alcohol, and the alcohol
distilled     upwards for six or seven hours           ; 6 oz. of chloroform were
then added gradually, the upward distillation being continued about
two hours longer        ; the liquid was next distilled          off to dryness by
means      of an oil-bath, and submitted to fractional distillation        ;   by this
 method     a much larger quantity of the compound was obtained than
by the former processes; it was found to boil constantly at 146° C.,
and    its analysis agreed almost exactly with the formula.                   In this
process      the lowest distillate    had      the same smell of vinous ether
which was before observed          in the other methods.
   An attempt was made to produce the intermediate compounds
CHC1S, AeO, and CHC1, 2AeO, by adding dry and powdered
ethylate of soda very gradually to            a  large excess of chloroform      ; but
the  liquid after being     separated     from the precipitate, was found, on
distilling fractionally,     to resolve itself into chloroform, alcohol, and
the body (C7 H16 03) already obtained, the presence of no other sub
stance being observable.

   With    a view of obtaining      a  compound analogous to the body
C7  Hlfi Os, in which amyle should be introduced instead of ethyle,
dry amylate of soda was prepared, to three equivalents of which one
equivalent of chloroform was added, the liquid separated          from the
precipitate and then distilled fractionally   ; a large proportion of  fusil-
oil was obtained, together with a small proportion of a body which
boiled at  a high temperature, — from 260° to 290°     C,  but chiefly from
260° to 270°     ; the purification   of this substance was not carried
further, as at each distillation  a considerable portion was decomposed
even in an atmosphere of hydrogen, the small quantity of the          liquid
available precluding any more attempts at distillation.

XV. " On the Structure of          certain    Microscopic    Test-objects,
       and their Action on the Transmitted Rays of Light."                By
       Charles Brooke, M.A., F.R.S., Surgeon of                 the West
       minster Hospital.      Received  June 1, 1854.
    In order to arrive at any satisfactory conclusions regarding the
action of any transparent medium on light, it is necessary           to form
some    definite  conceptions   regarding    the external   form and in
ternal structure of the medium.       This observation   appears   to apply
in full force to microscopic test-objects   ;  and for the purposes of the
present inquiry it will suffice to limit our observations to the struc
ture of two well-known test-objects,       the scales of Podura plumbea,
and the siliceous loricae   or valves of the genus Pleurosigma, freed
from organic matter    : the former of these is commonly adopted as
the test of the defining power of an achromatic object-glass, and the
several species   of the latter  as the tests of the penetrating or sepa
rating power as it has been termed.         The defining power      depends
only on the due correction of chromatic and spherical aberrations, so
that the image of any point of an object formed on the retina may
not overlap and confuse the images of adjacent points        ; this correc
tion is never theoretically perfect, since there will always     be residual
terms in the general expression for the aberration, whatever prac
ticable number of surfaces we may introduce as arbitrary constants          ;
but it is practically perfect, when the residual error is a quantity
less than that which the eye can appreciate.        The separation of the
markings of the Pleurosigmata and other analogous objects, is found
    VOl. Vii.                                                     P

  to depend on good defining power associated                    with large angle of
  aperture.
     The Podura     scale appears     to be a compound structure, consisting
  of a very delicate transparent lamina or membrane, covered                  with an
  imbricated arrangement of epithelial              plates, the length of which is
  six or eight times their breadth, somewhat resembling the tiles on a
  roof, or the long pile of some kinds of plush.                 This structure may
  be readily shown by putting          a live Podura into a small test-tube,
  and inverting   it on   a  glass slide   ;  the insect should then be allowed
  for some time to leap and run about in the confined space.                   By this
  means    the scales will be freely deposited on the glass, and being
  subsequently trodden on by the insect, several will be found, from
  which the epithelial plates have been partially rubbed off, and at the
  margin of the undisturbed          portion,     the    form and    position of the
  plates may be readily recognized.             This structure     appears to be ren
  dered most evident by mounting the scales thus obtained                  in Canada
 balsam, and illuminating        them by means of Wenham's parabolic re
 flector.    The structure may also            be very clearly recognized when
 the scale is seen as an opake object under a Ross's y7th (specially
 adjusted for uncovered objects), illuminated by               a  combination of the
 parabola and     a   flat Lieberkuhn,         as the     writer has elsewhere de
 scribed*.     The underside of the            scale   thus appears     as a smooth
 glistening surface     with very slight markings, corresponding probably
 to the points of insertion of the plates on the contrary side.                   The
 minuteness and close proximity of the epithelial plates will readily
 account for their being       a  good test of definition, while their promi
 nence renders them independent of the separating power due to large
 angle of aperture.
    The structure of     the second     class of test-objects above mentioned
 differs entirely from that above described           ;  it will suffice for the pre
sent purpose to notice the valves of three species only of the genus
Pleurosigma, which, as arranged in the order of easy visibility, are,
P.formosum,      P.  hippocampus,     P.    angulation.
    These appear to consist of         a  lamina of homogeneous transparent
silex,   studded with       rounded     knobs or protuberances,            which,  in
P.formosum and P. angulation, are arranged like a tier of round shot
in a triangular pile, andi n hippocampus, like a similar tier in a qua-
                   *  See British Association    Reports   for 1850.

                                       141
drangular pile, as has frequently been described            ; and the visibility of
these projections is probably proportional            to their convexity.         The
"  dots
        "  have   by some been supposed           to be depressions     ;  this how
ever is clearly not the case, as fracture is invariably observed to take
place between the rows of dots, and not through them, as would na
turally occur   if the  dots were depressions, and consequently the sub
stance thinner there than elsewhere.
   This in fact is always    observed to take place        in the siliceous    loricae
of some of the border tribes that occupy             a sort of neutral, and not
yet undisputed, ground between the confines of the animal and vege
table kingdoms ; as for example the Isthmia, which possesses a reti
culated structure, with depressions between the meshes, somewhat
analogous to that which would result from pasting together bobbin-
net and tissue paper.
    The  valves of   P.  angulatum    and    other similar objects have been
by some writers* supposed to be made up of two substances                         pos
sessing different degrees of refractive power            ; but this hypothesis is
purely gratuitous,     since the observed         phenomena will naturally re
sult from a series      of rounded or lenticular           protuberances of one
homogeneous substance.          Moreover,      if  the centres of the markings
were centres of greatest density,        if in fact    the structure were at all
analogous to that of the crystalline           lens, it is difficult to conceive
why the oblique rays only should        be visibly affected.         When     P.  hip
pocampus or P.formosum        is illuminated by a       Gillett's condenser, with
a central stop placed under the lenses, and viewed by a quarter-inch
object-glass of 70° aperture, both being accurately adjusted, we may
observe   in succession,   as the object-glass approaches the object, first
a series   of well-defined bright dots     ;  secondly, a series of dark dots
replacing these    ; and thirdly, the latter are again replaced by bright
dots, not however as well defined as the first series.              A similar suc
 cession of bright, dark, and bright          points may be observed           in the
 centre of the markings of some species              of Coscinodiscus      from Ber
 muda.
    These appearances would result      if a thin plate of glass were studded
 with minute, equal and equidistant plano-convex                lenses,   the foci of
 which would necessarily lie in the same plane.                If the focal surface
 or plane of vision of the object-glass be made to coincide with this
       * Vide Quarterly Journal of Microscopical Science, No. V. pp. 9, lft.
                                                                        p 2

                                     142
plane, a series of bright points would result from the accumulation
of the light falling on each lens.    If the plane of vision be next made
to coincide with the surfaces of the lenses, these points would ap
pear dark, in consequence of the rays being refracted towards points
now out of focus.    Lastly, if  the plane   of vision  be made to coincide
with the plane   beneath the lenses that contains their several foci, so
that each lens may be, as it were, combined with the object-glass,
then a second series of bright points will result from the accumula
tion of the rays transmitted     at those points.     Moreover,    as all rays
capable of entering the    object-glass are concerned       in the formation
of the second series   of bright    focal points, whereas the first series
are formed by the rays of a conical shell of        light only, it is evident
that the circle of least confusion must be much less, and therefore
the bright points better defined, in the first than in the last series.
   If the supposed lenses were of small convexity, it is evident that
the course of the more      oblique rays      only would be sensibly in
fluenced  ; hence probably the structure of     P.  angulalum   is recognized
only by object-glasses of large angular apertures, which are capable
of admitting very oblique rays.
   The writer has recently, in       an address    to the members       of the
Royal Institution, proposed     to explain   the extreme darkness of the
dots, under certain conditions of focus and illumination,          by the hy
pothesis that some of the oblique rays are thrown out of the field by
internal reflexion, being incident      at the upper surface at an angle
too large for emergence   ;  but this does not appear to invalidate the
present hypothesis respecting the course of the transmitted rays.
   It does not appear   to be desirable that objects should be         illumi
nated by an entire, or, as it may be termed,         a solid cone of  light of
much larger angle than that of the object-glass.        The extinction of an
object by excess of illumination      may be well illustrated by viewing
with   a  one-inch  object-glass    the Isthmia illuminated       by Gillett's
condenser.     When this is in focus, and its full aperture         open,   the
 markings above described are wholly invisible        ; but as the aperture
is successively diminished by the revolving diaphragm, the object be
comes    more and more    distinct,   and is perfectly defined      when the
 aperture of the illuminating pencil is reduced to about 20°.              The
same point may be attained, although         with much sacrifice of defini
tion, by gradually depressing the condenser, so that the rays may

                                      143
diverge before they reach the object        ; and it may be remarked gene
rally that the definition of objects is always most perfect, when an
illuminating pencil of suitable form is accurately adjusted to focus,
that is, so that the source of light and the plane of vision may be
conjugate foci of the illuminator.          If an object-glass of 120° aper
ture or upwards be used         as an illuminator,    the markings    of Diato-
maceae     will  be scarcely distinguishable,    with any object-glass    ;  the
glare of the central rays overpowering            the effects  of structure on
those that are more oblique.
XVI. "On           the Constitution    of Coal-tar Creosote."         By Pro
       fessor Williamson.            Communicated by Dr. Sharpey,
       Sec. R.S.        Received June 15, 1854.
    For  some     years past it has been a debated question among che
mists, whether the peculiar body originally            described by Reichen-
bach as creosote,       and subsequently analysed by Ettling and others,
has any real existence, or whether the properties which were attri
buted to it are not to be more         correctly ascribed to the hydrate of
phenyl,     which can be obtained in a state of great purity from at
least one sort of commercial creosote by mere distillation,          and which
possesses      in an eminent degree the antiseptic properties for which
 creosote is remarkable.
    With    a view   of obtaining  some  light  on this question,   Mr. Fairlie
undertook, in the laboratory of University College, an investigation
 of the portions of coal-tar creosote which boil higher than the hydrate
 of phenyl.       The result of his experiments has been to show that a
 body homologous to hydrate of phenyl may be obtained from the
 crude creosote,      in fact the next term of    the series above hydrate     of
 phenyl     itself.   Some qualities    of commercial creosote        contain a
 greater quantity of this hydrate      of cresyl  (as it may be termed) than
 others  ;  and it is most advantageously prepared from those portions
which in the first distillation come over between 200° Cent. and 220°.
After   a great number of fractional distillations,       a  colourless, highly
dispersive liquid is obtained, boiling at 203° Cent., and possessing
the composition represented by the formula C,.,HsOj.

                                       144
   This hydrate of cresyl resembles the corresponding phenyl com
pound in most of its properties ; but it may be easily distinguished
from that compound by its almost complete insolubility in aqueous
ammonia.
   When gradually mixed with sulphuric acid, it becomes of              a beau
tiful rose-colour, and gives rise to sulpho-cresylic acid.
   The action of nitric acid upon hydrate of cresyl           is very violent,
and almost explosive      if the acid is   used in a concentrated state and
at so high    a  temperature as the common atmospheric            ;  even   very
dilute nitric acid transforms the compound into           a brown tarry mass
from which no definite substance can be extracted.                  By cooling
some nitric     acid in a frigorific mixture and allowing some similarly
cooled hydrate to fall into it drop by drop and with constant agita
tion,  a  red-coloured    solution was obtained, which by dilution with
water and subsequent neutralization            by potash yielded     a  crop of
short needle-shaped crystals of an orange-red colour, and possessing
a greater   solubility in water than the salt of carbazotic acid.          This
salt was found by analysis to possess the composition of a homologue
of carbazotate of potash      ; so that   it is the potash salt  of  a hydrate
of cresyl in which three atoms of hydrogen            are replaced by hypo-
nitric acid,                        "j

                                 (NO,),
   The   same acid was obtained by the action         of nitric acid upon an
alcoholic solution of the hydrate containing urea         ; but in attempting
to repeat this experiment on a larger scale the mixture became              hot,
and the whole of the substance was destroyed with almost explosive
violence.
   When treated with pentachloride of phosphorus this hydrate of
cresyl is decomposed in like manner with the hydrate of phenyl, as
described by Mr. Scrugham,            yielding   a chloride  of cresyl and      a
phosphate of the same radical.
   By the action of this phosphate in        an alcoholic solution   of  acetate
of potash,   a  peculiar oleaginous body is obtained possessing an odour
entirely different from that of the hydrate, and decomposable by
potash with production of acetate and cresylate.
   A similar reaction      ensues   when the phosphate is distilled         with
ethylate of potash, and a cresylate of ethyl is thus obtained.

                                      145
    In the numerous distillations which were performed for the puri
fication of the hydrate of cresyl, some circumstances were observed
which led to      a suspicion    that the    body undergoes a change of
composition,    either through     the distillation  itself, or by some in
fluences accompanying it.       These circumstances were,      — 1st. A tarry
 residue, from a liquid which when introduced into the retort was
 perfectly  colourless.    2nd. The formation       of a small quantity     of
 water in the commencement of such a distillation, though none was
 contained in the substance used.        3rd. The gradual lowering of the
 boiling-point of   the whole  liquid by   a great number of distillations.
These facts, taken in conjunction, naturally suggested that the oxy
 gen of the air contained in the retort might act upon the substance,
 and thus gradually reduce it to hydrate of phenyl.
    In order to test  the correctness of this hypothesis, the atmospheric
 air was expelled from the distilling apparatus by dry hydrogen gas,
 and the distillation   performed in a pure atmosphere of this gas.         A
 great number of distillations     performed in this manner were at ex
 actly the same temperature, and all the other anomalies were simul
 taneously removed.       It was however found that the liquid always
 boiled at a lower temperature in hydrogen than in atmospheric air,
 the difference being about 2° Cent., and this without any alteration
 of the pressure on the surface      of the boiling liquid.     A similar fact
 was noticed in the distillation   of hydrate of phenyl, and also of     some
other liquids.

    The  same sum n" may be formed by the addition         of an arithmetical
progression of n terms in various ways.           Hence we are enabled to
construct a great variety of triangular arrangements of arithmetical
progressions,    the sums of which       are the natural    series of square,

 which render evident     some remarkable relations.

    Each of the following triangles is formed of         a series  of arithmeti
cal progressions, the number of terms increasing                successively by
unity.
    The first term of    an arithmetical    progression of n terms having a

    Thus, every square number is formed by the addition of a series
of odd numbers commencing with unity ; a result universally
known.
    The difference of any two squares         is either an odd number, or the
 sum of consecutive odd numbers.
    Each series may be resolved into two others consisting of alter
nate odd numbers, the respective sums of which are two adjacent
 triangular numbers, the addition of which           it is well known forms     a
 square.    Ex.   :
                             1+5 + 9+13=28

   Every square    ns  is the sum of an arithmetical           progression of    n

terms, the first term of which is             ,  and the common difference      1.

   This arrangement renders evident that              every   square   of an odd
number is the sum of as many consecutive natural numbers as the
root has units.
   Every square of an odd number is the difference between two tri
angular numbers the bases of which are respectively (3n+ 1) and n.
For, the sum of any series of natural numbers is the difference of
two series of natural numbers commencing with unity                  ; and since,
as it is shown   above, every square      of    an odd number is the sum of a
series of natural numbers, it is also the difference between two tri
angular numbers.
   It is also evident that series, the sums of which are squares           of odd
numbers, may be so taken that, when placed in succession, they will
form an uninterrupted progression of natural numbers commencing
with unity, the sum of which        is a triangular     number   ;

    This, it will be     observed,  is  a triangular arrangement of the uneven
numbers in their regular order.
    Every cube is the sum of             as many consecutive odd numbers as
there are units in the root*.
    The known theorem, that the sum of                  the cubes of any succession
of the natural numbers commencing with unity is equal to the square
of the sum of the roots, or, in other words, to the square of the cor
responding triangular number, is an immediate consequence of the
 above.

    The sum of any          series of odd numbers commencing                 with unity
 being equal to the square of the number of terms (A.), the sum of
 the numbers in any triangle formed as above is necessarily equal to
 the square of a triangular number.               It is  also easy to see that each
 cube is the difference between the squares               of two consecutive trian
 gular numbers       ; and, that the difference between the squares of any
 two triangular numbers whatever is the sum of consecutive cubes.
 The following equations have been found by ascertaining what dif
 ferences of the squares of two triangular numbers are equal to single
 cubes    : —

    *  Since the present note was communicated        to the Royal Society,   I have found
 that this relation has been already noticed by Count d'Adhemar (Comptes Hernias,

   Each number contained in this triangle is itself the sum of an
arithmetical progression of       n   terms.    Thus, taking the fifth row for
example : —

   The sum of all the numbers contained in                a square   thus formed
is equal to the cube of the number which occupies the upper                  right-
hand and lower left-hand corners. The sum of the numbers in either
of the diagonals is the corresponding            square, and in the case of the
odd numbers the sum of the middle horizontal or vertical line is also
the square.
   This last-mentioned relation was pointed out by Lichtenberg*.
who stated the theorem thus         : — If a be a whole number, and       A  be the
sum of all the natural numbers from            1  to a, then  :

   It is evident from the preceding arrangement that
Thus any triangular number multiplied by 8 with 1 added is equal
to the square of an odd number ; or, any square of an uneven
number minus       1  is divisible by 8, and the quotient is      a triangular
number.

XVIII. " On       the Structure and Functions        of the Rostellum in
       Listera ovata."      By  J.  D. Hooker,       M.D., F.R.S. Re
       ceived  June 15, 1854.
   The author first gives an account of the form and structure of the
rostellum of Listera ovata, and its relation and position to the anther
and stigma.      He finds that the rostellum is divided by parallel   septa
(at right angles to the plane of that organ) into a series of longitu
dinally elongated loculi, which gradually taper from the base up
wards, and terminate at two opake cellular spots, one on each side
of the apex of the rostellum,       towards which latter the loculi also
converge.      When the flower is fully expanded, these loculi are dis
tended with a viscid grumous fluid, full of chlorophyll granules.
Their external walls, and the      septa dividing   them, are formed of a
delicate, transparent tissue, which is cellular at the base and apex of
the rostellum only.
   Their grumous contents, when examined at the earliest period of
development, present the appearance           of opake club-shaped com
pressed bodies,    with areolated surfaces  ;  a form and appearance   that
may be restored at a later period by coagulating with alcohol.
    At  the period of impregnation     the slightest irritation of the ros
tellum causes the sudden and forcible discharge of the contents of
these   loculi (through the rupture of the cellular tissue at the apex
of the rostellum) and its protrusion in the form of two viscid glands,
which coalesce into one,     after which the rostellum rapidly collapses
and contracts.
    The pollen-masses, when freed from the anther-case, fall naturally
upon the rostellum ; they are retained there by their viscid gland-like
contents, and, breaking up, the pollen-grains become (by the con
traction of the rostellum) applied to the subjacent stigmatic surface.
    The author adds remarks on the structure of the rostellum in
allied genera of Orchidew, and indicates some of the more important
morphological changes to which that organ is subjected, in connec
tion with   the development of various appendages to the column and
pollen in the same natural family.

XIX. " On        the Immediate Principles of the Excrements of Man
       and    Animals in the Healthy Condition."                     By William
       Marcet, M.D.              Communicated by F. Marcet, F.R.S.
       Received     June 14, 1854.
    The author describes         a new method of extracting the immediate
 chemical constituents of the excrements of Man and animals, and
gives an account of the substances obtained by its employment.
    Healthy human        faeces   are boiled to exhaustion       in alcohol.    The
residue is insoluble in ether, and yields to boiling water nothing but
ammoniaco-magnesian phosphate.                The strained alcoholic solution
deposits, on standing,       a  sediment, from which it is decanted and then
mixed with milk of lime.            The subsiding lime is of a yellow-brown
colour  ; it is dried on filtering-paper and treated with ether, cold or
hot, and the solution thus obtained yields, on spontaneous evapora
tion, beautiful     silky crystals, which       are purified     by solution in a
mixture    of alcohol and ether, repeated            filtration    through   animal
charcoal and recrystallization        ; they then appear in circular groups,
have the form of acicular four-sided           prisms, and polarize light very
readily.     This crystalline body the author proposes to call Excretine.
It is very soluble in ether, cold or hot, but sparingly soluble in cold
alcohol;   its solution has a decided though weak alkaline reaction.
It is insoluble in hot or cold water, and is not decomposed                by dilute
mineral acids.       It  fuses    between 95° and 96°        C,   and   at a higher
temperature burns away without              inorganic     residue.    When boiled
with solution of potash it does not dissolve. As to its qualitative
constitution, it is found to contain nitrogen and sulphur, though in
small proportions     ;  the products of its decomposition have not yet
been investigated.
   The author     has   in several   cases observed the excretine to crystal
lize directly in the alcoholic solution of         faeces   before the addition    of
lime, and has scarcely any doubt that it exists for the most part in
a free state   in the excrements, and constitutes             one   of their imme
diate principles.       As to its source,     he observes      that it appeared   in
excess when a considerable quantity            of beef had     been taken, and in
less  than the usual quantity in a case of diarrhoea                 attended with
loss of appetite   ;  but none could be directly obtained from beef oa

                                      154
subjecting it to the same process of extraction as            faeces.   Neither
could it be found in ox-bile, the urine, or the substance of the spleen.
From the difficulty of obtaining the contents of the human small in
testine in a healthy state, its presence or absence in that part of the
alimentary canal has not yet been satisfactorily determined.
    The lime precipitate, after having     been   thus thoroughly deprived
of the excretine by ether, is next treated with hydrochloric                acid,
and water or alcohol, by which          means   margaric acid is extracted
from it.      The author is uncertain whether the margaric acid of the
faeces   is free or combined with excretine, but he is disposed to con
clude that the neutral fats are decomposed            in the intestinal canal
and their acid set free.      Not having   been able to detect stearic acid
in human evacuations,       he supposes that what is contained        in the fat
of mutton or beef taken        as food must be converted into          margaric
acid in its passage through the alimentary canal.
    The lime precipitate, freed from excretine and dissolved in alcohol
by means of hydrochloric acid, forms a dark port-wine-coloured solu
tion, from which       the margaric acid is deposited.         On then adding
water to the solution and concentrating it on the water-bath, a flaky
colouring matter separates, which, being purified by solution in ether
and washing with water, is obtained as a dark-brown or black amor
phous substance, similar to the colouring           matter of blood, and to
that which Dr. Harley has lately extracted from urine.
    The matters brought down with the lime having                been thus ex
tracted, the sediment which         spontaneously subsides from the alco
holic solution of    faeces before its treatment with the milk of lime, is
next examined.        This deposit  appears to be complex      in its nature  ; it
has a strongly acid reaction, and presents under the microscope small
oily globules, mixed sometimes with crystals of excretine and accom
panied by a yellow amorphous matter. By boiling with alcohol and
filtration,   a residue remains which the author has not yet examined,
and two substances are obtained from the filtrate.              The first is de
posited on cooling       ; when collected and dried on filtering-paper          it
has a granular character and is quite colourless        ; it is very sparingly
soluble in ether, fuses by heat, and burns with a bright fuliginous
flame, leaving a white residue consisting of phosphate of potash.
The author       has not yet been    able satisfactorily to decide whether
this is a pure immediate principle or not       ;  he is inclined to consider

                                       155
 it as a combination of phosphate of potash and a pure organic sub
 stance.      The filtered fluid, after separation of this matter, still con
 tains a   substance which he has called Excretolic acid. It is obtained
 by evaporating to dryness, extracting the residue with ether, adding
 to the ethereal solution alcohol and lime-water, and heating.                The
 acid is precipitated in combination with lime, from which it is sepa
 rated by means       of sulphuric or hydrochloric       acid and solution in
 ether.      The ethereal solution, after being well washed with water
 to remove mineral acid, yields the pure excretolic acid on evapora
 tion.     This body is of an olive colour      ; it fuses   between 25° and
 26°    C,   and at a higher temperature burns without residue.              It is
 insoluble in water and in a boiling solution of potash         ;   very soluble
 in ether, sparingly soluble in cold alcohol, readily so in hot; its
 solutions having a marked acid reaction.          The author is disposed to
 believe that in excrement it is combined in form of a salt, with ex-
cretdne or a basic substance closely allied to it, which is obtained in
 the filtrate from which the excretolic acid is precipitated in com
bination      with lime in the process of its purification.
    The author failed to obtain        evidence   of  the presence either       of
butyric or of lactic acid in the clear alcoholic solution of      faeces filtered
from the precipitate formed by the milk of lime.              From the above
investigation, therefore, it appears       that healthy human excrements
contain    : —
     1.  A new organic substance, possessing      an alkaline reaction, which
the author names Excretine.
    2.   A fatty acid, having    the properties of margaric acid, but not
constantly present.
    3.  A colouring matter, similar to that of blood and urine.
    4. A light granular substance, whose properties have not                  yet
been sufficiently examined to admit of its being considered a pure
substance.
    5.  An acid olive-coloured      substance, of    a  fatty nature, named
Excretolic acid.
    6.  No butyric acid and no lactic acid.
    The faeces of various animals were submitted         to the same process
of analysis, with the following results : —
    1 . The excrements of carnivorous mammalia, viz. the Tiger, Leo
pard    and Dog (fed on meat),      contain  a  substance allied in its na-
    vol. vir.                                                        Q

 cretine ;  they yield butyric acid, which is not present in human
 excrements.

       Alto-Douro,        in April 1854.      With   a  Supplementary Note
       on    the    Proposed     Remedies      for its Eradication."        By
       Jos. James Forrester, Esq., F.R.G.S.                   Communicated
       by J. P. Gassiot, Esq., F.R.S.             Received May 17, 1854.
    In Portugal, where the vine-disease committed great           ravages  last
year, no measures have as yet been adopted for ascertaining whe
ther the disease        is radical,   or only superficial  ; or whether   any
practical remedy may be adopted in order to arrest the progress of
the evil.
    At Oporto, and in the north of Portugal, an opinion prevails —
    " That the O-idium is the effect, and not the cause of the epidemic.
    " That the roots and the wood of the vines are diseased.
    " That sporules of the O-idium exist in the interior of the vine, and
about its roots.
    " That the obstruction          to the ascent of the sap through       the
various ducts, originates in the roots.
    " That black spots appear in       the joints of the branches, indicating
that disease exists throughout the         body of the vine.
   " That    a new fungus has appeared         on the vines,  in the shape of
small globules, containing carbonic acid.
   And " that, although vegetation may continue for a while, the
fruit will not ripen, and the vines will die in a couple of years from
this date."
   Considering       that it would be of some importance to determine
whether the disease         has its origin   in the   roots or from external

                                            157
causes,    and with a hope that some practical cure for the diseased
vines grown in the open air may be discovered, I record the results
of my own observations of the progress of the vine-malady in the
Alto-Douro.
    The Port-wine District extends eight leagues west and east from
the Serra do         Mar So (an elevation of 4400 feet* from the level of the
sea) to the Quinta do Baleira, near Sam Joao da Pesqueira, and
four leagues north and south, between Villa Real and the city of
Lamego      f.
   The winter streams, tributaries to the Douro, on the right bank,                    are
the Sermenha, Corgo, Ceira, Pinhao, and                 Tua  ; and, on the left, the
Varoza, Temilobos,           Tedo, Tavora, and Torto.
    At Baleira, the Douro runs at             an elevation of not more than 250
feet  ; whence some opinion may be formed of the nature and inequality
of the country, and of the numerous abrupt mountain ridges, on the
inclines of which the vines are grown.                 The Wine-Districts of           the
Alto-Douro          form a long      irregular basin, girt by the granite chains
of the Tras-os-Montes and Beira                ; and this being for the most part
of schist formation, and protected from the bleak winds,                       is parti
cularly adapted for the cultivation of the vine.                 The strata of the
margins of the Douro              differ from the higher and middle grounds
in   character,         " being    composed      of strong clays,       more    or    less
micaceous."
    The extreme northern and southern boundaries — from the Serra
do Marao        to Favaios, and from the Serra do Monte Muro (near
Lamego)        to Sam Joao da Pesqueira — are undulating mountain
plains of still heavier soil, and more suitable for the growth of firs
than vines.          In former years, this fact         was  clearly defined      by the
 Royal Wine Company, who divided the districts into two, one
being termed Feitoria (where the most superior wines were produced
and     classified for exportation),          the other Ramo,       where only very
inferior wines, for the consumption of the country and for distilla
tion, were produced to a small extent.                 Now, the two districts        have
become one        ;   the plantations of pines on the heights and the corn-
producing        valleys having alike been converted into vineyards                 ;  the

quantity,   and not the quality, of the produce being the results sought
by the wine-grower within this privileged demarcation.
    One thousand vines generally produce a pipe of wine, and the
total number of vines in the Port- wine             Districts    above   described
may be estimated at 90,000,000.
   In the summer time, there is great scarcity of water throughout
the district.     The vineyards are for the most part situated on abrupt
mountain slopes, the vines being planted on terraces, which are not
appropriate     for the cultivation      of anything     else.    The vines      are
grown not higher than three feet from the ground, and are planted
about six feet apart, supported with canes or stakes.                 The labour
in the vineyards is performed by the            natives of Gallicia, who visit
the district three or four times a year in search of employment.
    In July   1850,  I  first observed   a  blight  on three or four vines, at
a  considerable distance from each other, in the Wine Districts.                The
general appearance of this blight to the naked eye greatly resembled
that which     appears     on the peach-tree and the rose.            The Douro
farmers had often previously noticed a similar po' branco                   (white
powder) on the vines.
   In   1851 the season was favourable, and the vines (on which we
had observed      the blight in the previous year) were vigorous, and
produced perfect fruit.        The vintage of     1851, throughout       the Alto-
Douro, was excellent.          In 1852 there was much wet and cold            ;  the
blight again   appeared,     and the vines were attacked to the extent of
about one in fifteen hundred.          The vintage of 1852 was of inferior
quality   ; but no one ascribed the failure to any disease in the vine.
From the autumn of           1852  until midsummer       1853,    continued rain,
sleet, hail, and bleak winds prevailed, and in 1853 there was no
spring.     In March of the       same    year the navigation of the Douro
was impeded, and the bar rendered impassable on account of the
floods  ; and in April and May of the same year, prayers were offered
up in the churches throughout the Wine Districts for fine weather.
    In March      1854,    only half- cargoes   could be brought down the
river Douro,     on account of the want of water, and rain was prayed
for.
    Early in June      1853, the heat     became   suddenly intense, and the
vines had     already burst forth with great vigour            ;   whilst,  in the
middle of the same month, the nights became as cold as in winter.

                                          159
    la the most       exposed    situations   the vines received the greatest
shock     ; the circulation of the sap was evidently deranged, and their
fruit withered       as soon as   it  appeared.    In  some neighbouring        vine
yards, less exposed, the grapes             grew no larger than peas        ;    they
were then suddenly covered with the blight (now designated the
 Oidium), and in about three days became rotten.
    On the inclines of the mountains on either bank of the river
Douro, the waters had run off, and but little blight appeared.                       In
the     low and heavy grounds, the most sheltered from the winds,
the waters remained stagnant ; yet the fruit grew to its full size,
and had come           to maturity, when the new wood, leaves, and fruit
were all, to a greater or less degree, covered with the Oidium.                    The
blight sometimes         attacked entire vineyards, and at other times only
partially affected one property, and then showed itself in others at a
 distance — intermediate estates being for the time wholly untouched.
     It   was in    July   1853    that the    existence of the    disease    in the
 vineyards      of the    Douro     first attracted   particular  attention    ;    but
 many vines betrayed no unhealthy symptoms until the fruit was
 nearly ripe.       The upper part of the branches was first attacked. In
 some     instances the woody part of the young branches was speckled
 with the Oidium, while the bunches of fruit were apparently alto
 gether free from it.         In other instances, the grapes became touched
 with the       disease   immediately before the vintage, but the woody
 part of the branches betrayed no such symptoms.                  In   some vines,
 which      I  supposed     had altogether      escaped   the disease    (and long
 after the fruit was gathered and the leaves had fallen off), blotches
 or stains, evidently the mycelium            of the Oidium, appeared on the
 wood.
      The usual number of         seeds in a black grape is two or three         ;  but
 in the year 1853, in all instances the grapes, which at first pro
 mised abundance of wine, were found each to contain from three to
 five seeds.
      Twenty-one       baskets of grapes usually produce one pipe of wine               ;
 but in the year 1853, a pipe of wine was rarely obtained even from
  thirty baskets of      grapes.     From seven to nine pipes of ordinary wine
  generally give a pipe of brandy, 20 per cent. above British proof                     ;
  but in the year 1853,          from ten to twelve pipes of ordinary wine
  were required to give one pipe of brandy of that strength.

                                        160
    Wines, when properly made, should be trodden continuously for
36 hours in the lagar (an open stone vat), and remain there for 36
 to 48 hours more, until the tumultuous fermentation be completed,
 when they should be run off into larger tonels (wooden vats, not
tightly bunged), where the second fermentation will be completed
about Christmas.          In 1853, in situations where      the  disease    most
prevailed, the grapes fermented before          they had been trodden more
than twelve hours, when the wines were drawn off and passed into
tonels, where brandy, as a precautionary measure, was given to them.
The fermentation of         these wines   ceased  altogether before the 15th
 October.      In other situations, where the     disease had not made pro
gress, the grapes were sound        ; and, where they were properly crushed
and fermented, they produced excellent wine, without the addition
of brandy.
    Wines, during their second fermentation, deposit a thick coating
of argol on the sides of the tonels.          In 1853 there was very little
argol deposited      ;  but the gross lees of the wine were in great de
mand, and sold for about 15s. per basket, —a sum which in former
years might almost have purchased double the quantity of grapes.
    In the   same manner as the form and colour         of the wood,     leaves,
and fruit of vines differ, so does their pith           vary in appearance,
according to the age of the wood or the quality of the vine.                The
pith in an old vine, when the sap is rising,          graduates from a deep
vandyke-brown          colour to a pale yellow, the      shade  being always
darker near the joints.
   In April 1854, I rooted up many vines of different qualities, and
in various situations, and       I was unable then to detect any remarkable
appearance      in the interior of the vine different from what           I  had
seen  in other years after continued wet and cold weather            ; but the
exterior of all the last year's branches bore palpable evidence of
having been violently attacked with the O'idium.             Some vines had
suffered more than others, and many of their vessels were evidently
choked   ;  but, in most instances, in cutting the vine longitudinally,
this obstruction was found to have arisen either from wounds, bad
pruning, or natural decay.          I found no black spots at the joints of
the branches      ; and,   with the exception of the stains left by the
disease    of last year, the vines looked healthy and vigorous, throw
ing out strong shoots and promising an abundance of fruit.

                                         161
    Towards     the end of April 1854, much rain fell in the district              ;
the easterly winds destroyed the young branches              ;   and in the most
exposed     situations and heavy soils the O-idium again made its ap
pearance.
    In  1853, the disease attacked the vines bodily, and almost simul
taneously:      whereas, in 1854, the Oidium appears              to be creeping
out of the skin of the last year's wood, and insidiously to extend
itself over the branches.
    The globules (to which allusion          has been made above) cover the
young shoots.          I have  been   familiar   with these    for twenty -three
years past, and       the Douro farmers call them the " perspiration " of
the vine.        They do not indicate disease, whereas the smallest
possible quantity of the po' branco, or white powder, being transferred
to a perfectly healthy vine, immediately infected it.
    In  the  Alto-Douro      the oranges, lemons, citrons and limes have
all been blighted, and every kind of vegetable            appears to be suffer
ing from sickness.
    The vines which suffered most in the Alto-Douro, in 1853, were
the Muscatel, Malvazia, Alvarilhao, Ferral, Agadanho and Senzao.
    Since my arrival in this country           I have noticed that the vines
grown on walls in the open air, vines grown in greenhouses, vines
grown     in hot-houses, vines forced, all show identically             the same
effects   of the   O-idium  of last year,  as exist on the vines in the       Alto-
Douro.
    Taking into consideration all the circumstances              above  narrated,
I  have come to the       conclusion, —
    That the    Oidium is the cause, and not the effect    of   the disease  ; that
the inclemency of the season           in 1853, by checking the circulation
of  the sap in the vines, produced a predisposition for disease              ; that
if  the O-idium continues to appear         on the branches of the vines, it
is only too probable that it may in a very few years be destroyed ;
that the globules are a sign of health and not of disease, and have no
connexion whatever with the fungus called Oidium               ;  and that  if the
germ of the Oidium, probably still lurking on the old branches, can
be destroyed      in the  open air as effectually as  it appears    to have been
destroyed under glass, then        I feel persuaded that all the vines in the
Port-wine districts of the Alto-Douro may be saved.

  " Supplementary      Note on the proposed           Remedies     for the Era
       dication of the Vine-Malady."           Received     June 1, 1854.
     1st.  I will take the annual production of wines in the Port-wine
  districts of the Alto-Douro at 80,000 pipes instead of 90,000, and
  the number of vines to be treated as diseased at 80,000,000.
     2nd. The value of freehold land in that district, for the growth of
  1000 vines, or one pipe of wine, may be estimated at 50/., yielding
  an interest or rental of 3/. per annum.
     3rd. The total freehold value of the vineyards in those districts
 may be estimated at 4,000,000/. sterling,          giving an annual revenue
 of 240,000/.
    4th. In the event of the disease not being checked in its progress,
 and the grapes being destroyed this year in the Alto-Douro,              a mini
 mum loss    of 240,000/, will  be sustained, and should the vines perish,
 the loss may be 4,000,000/.
    5th. Portugal    is said  to produce annually          1,000,000    pipes of
wine of all sorts and qualities, but       I will  estimate   the total produc
tion at 800,000 pipes, and the total number of vines in the country
at 800,000,000.
    If Flour  of Sulphur  be used,    the leaves, branches and shoots are
first moistened as equally as possible with a syringe                ; then the
whole is dusted with sulphur,           which     adheres    to the moistened
surface.
    This operation would have to       be repeated     thrice, and would con
sume two ounces of sulphur for        every vine, in each of the operations,
making a total of 480,000,000 ounces, or about 13,392 tons for the
treatment of the 80,000,000 vines         in the Alto-Douro, and 133,920
tons for the vines of the whole country.
    Sulphur would not cost       less than 10/. per ton, delivered in the
centre of the Alto-Douro districts, or in any other part of the inte
rior of Portugal.     The   expense    of sulphur     required for the Douro
would be 133,920/., and for the whole country 1,339,200/.
    One man could moisten one vine in one minute, and another man
could dust it with sulphur in the same time, so that two men could
perform the complete operation on about 700 vines daily, at               a cost

                                        163
of Is. 3d. each man for labour, making a total of 14,285/. in the
Alto-Douro, and 142,850/. for all Portugal.
    I  will suppose that there are 4000 vineyards in the Alto-Douro,
planted each with 20,000 vines. The first cost of syringes and
fumigators would amount to not less than 10/. for each vineyard, or
a  total of 40,000/. for the Alto-Douro.
     One quart of water would be required for every vine in each ope
ration, making a total of about 90,000 pipes, the cartage of which,
and the labour of distributing         it over   the   mountain vineyards, in
tubs, on men's heads, would cost          a  minimum of 10s. per pipe, or a
total of 45,000/.       for the Alto-Douro, and 450,000/. for the whole
country.
                                  Recapitulation.
                                                   In the Douro.    In  the whole
                                                                       country.
For sulphur,     say                                £135,000       £1,350,000
For labour, at £15,000 for         each  of the  1
                                                        45,000          450,000
       three operations                          J}
For water, at £45,000 for          each  of the  1<
       three operations, or as much as the        >   135,000        1,350,000
       sulphur                                  J
For instruments                                         40,000          400,000
                                                    £355,000       £3,550,000
This is independent of any charge for factors or superintendents, or
for the extra expense        in treating vines and vineyards which are so
much further apart than are those in the Alto-Douro.
   This    expense   to be incurred     in the endeavour     to save one year's
crop, would be equal to a charge of           41. 10s.   per pipe, or to a year
and a   halfs rental of the vineyards, or to    more than the whole revenue
of Portugal for an entire year.
    If a solution of lime and sulphur       be employed instead      of flour of
sulphur, the operation would not be less expensive.
    If, in  conjunction    with the sulphuring of the branches, the roots
were to be exposed, and sulphur and lime thrown upon them,                I could
not estimate the total expense at less than              l\d. to l^d. per vine,
which would entail a charge equal            to another year and a half's
    VOl.   Vii.                                                      R

                                    164
rental of the vineyards, or 18 per cent, on their freehold value for
the chance of saving one year's crop.
   Again, if the trunks of the vines      be bored and the sulphur    in
serted, this most delicate operation could only be performed by the
factors themselves, and    if the vines were to     be cut down to the
ground and grafted with cuttings from sound vines, the entire ope
ration (which could only be performed by the factors) would cost
l\d. to l%d. for each vine, or as much as the sulphuring process ;
and besides this, there would be a loss of four years' produce at 3/.
per pipe per annum, making      a  total loss of 16/. 10s. in every vine
yard growing    vines capable of yielding one pipe of wine, or about
33^ per cent., or one-third   of the freehold value of the   estate.
   Lastly, the dressing of the trunk and branches of 800,000,000
vines with mineral tar could not be carried into operation within
any reasonable   period, on account of the tediousness of the process
and the scarcity of labourers.      The   expense of the tar would also
be a bar to its being used.

   " Sir, — I   have the honour to state,      for the information       of the
Royal Society, that    a new asteroid was discovered here by         Mr. James
Ferguson, Assistant Astronomer, at        11 p.m.,  2nd of Sept. 1854.
    " He was observing Egeria      at the time, and found that, the 13th,
and this, the 31st, in the field together.
   "I  have delayed this communication,       waiting to ascertain whether
the planet might not have been discovered by observers in other parts
of the world  ;  and it appearing that it had not, the priority of the
discovery, therefore, belongs to the National Observatory            ;  and this
new star is added to the family of asteroids as the first representa
tive of America     among them, and a memorial of her zeal in the
cause of astronomy.
    " As a testimony    of the high appreciation in which       the talents and
the industry    of Mr. Ferguson     are held, the honour       of naming this
planet was left to him.       Following the rule adopted by astronomers
with regard to the asteroids, he has selected the graceful name of
Euphrosyne.

 III.    "Observations on the Respiratory Movements of Insects."
         By the      late   William Frederick Barlow, F.R.C.S.
         Arranged and        communicated       by   James    Paget, F.R.S.
         Received August 20, 1854.
     This   essay contains    the greater part of a series     of observations
 made     between     1845   and 1850.     The following     are some    of the
 conclusions which they plainly indicate         : —
     (1.) The respiratory movements of Dragon-flies          (Libellulae), and,
 probably, of other insects also, are naturally subject to considerable
 and frequent variations in force and rate, the causes             of many of
 these variations being as yet unknown.
     (2.) The respirations of these insects are always quickened by
exercise, emotion, rise of temperature, galvanism, and mechanical
irritation;     and the last three agents quicken them in the decapitated,
as well as in the perfect, insect.
     (3.) The respiratory movements of each segment of the trunk are,
 in some measure,       independent of those of the rest, although in the
perfect insect they concur in all the segments.             They continue to
be performed, though feebly and slowly, in separated           segments, pro
vided their nervous cords and ganglia are entire          : and they may be
abolished in single and successive          segments   by the local action of
chloroform.
    (4.) The removal of the head, including the supra- and sub-ceso-
phageal ganglia, does not, like the removal of the medulla oblongata
of the    vertebrate   animal, put  a stop  to the respiratory movements of
the insect    ;  but it diminishes their frequency and force, and deprives
them of all influence of the will and of mental emotions.
    (5.) The shock inflicted by the sudden destruction of the head, or
of the terminal part of the abdomen, generally stops all the respira
tory movements of the insect for a time, and much enfeebles               them
during the remainder of its life.
    (6.) The general tendency of the observations is to corroborate
the opinion of the self-sufficiency of the several ganglia for the
movements of their appropriate segments, and, thus far, to maintain
the belief in their essential independence. At the same time, the ob
                                                                s 2

                                        168
  servations on the diffused influence of shocks accord with those of
  the coordinate similar    movements of all the segments, in proving
 their close mutual relations and mutual influence.

    I purpose placing   before the   Royal Society in this communication,
the principal     results of experiments made during the months of
June    and  July last, on the impregnation       of the ovum in    Gasterosteus
leiurus and     G. pungitius, and hope        to be able to furnish      a  more
detailed account of my observations on a future occasion.
    The ovarian ovum of       these   fishes,   at  a very early stage of its
development, is provided with a proper investing membrane, the
future chorion.      At  a later period, one portion         of this membrane
presents a number of cup -shaped          pediculated bodies scattered over
its surface, and in the centre of this part of the chorion there is              a

                                        169
funnel-shaped depression, pierced by         a canal which leads towards the
centre of the egg.
   In the nearly ripe ovum, the germinal vesicle occupies an excentric
position with respect to the egg as a whole, but imbedded in the
centre of  a   semi-solid accumulation of fine granular matter at that
part of the surface which corresponds to the funnel-shaped depres
sion ; so that the apex of the funnel, projecting inwards beyond the
level of the inner surface of the chorion, makes a depression in the
centre of the layer of granular matter, and comes nearly into contact
with the germinal vesicle.
   For convenience of description,        the funnel-shaped depression       will
 now be called micropyle,        and   the layer of granular matter before
impregnation, discus proligerus.
   The germinal      vesicle disappears before the ovum leaves the ovary,
and no remnant of it or its spots can be seen.
   A very delicate membrane invests the yelk within the chorion                  ;
this  membrane is more          distinct  after impregnation,      or after the
action of water upon an unimpregnated egg            ; it may be isolated, and
then exhibits a remarkable degree of elasticity.          It is not a yelk-mem
brane, and   it will  be spoken    of as the inner membrane.
   The layer of   the yelk immediately internal to the inner membrane
passing over the discus proligerus, is formed by yellowish                highly
refractive drops which disappear in water, undergoing some remark
able changes, and by        a fluid substance which water precipitates in
a finely granular form.
   The principal      mass  of the yelk consists of a clear and very con
sistent albumen.       The oil is collected into a few very large drops
which come up to the surface.
   When the ovum         escapes from the ovary,     it enters   a cavity which
may be considered as the ovarian extremity of the oviduct, in which
a considerable quantity        of clear viscid fluid is previously secreted
and collected, to be expelled with the ova.
   More exact observation of         the  micropyle in the free eggs proves
that the inner end of the canal is either open, or at most closed by
a very delicate membrane.          When looking into the funnel from the
wide mouth, the apex being in focus, a bright, clear, round or oval
spot,  such as an aperture would produce, is always visible.                If a

                                       I/O
section be made of the egg, and the apex brought into focus from
within, the    same clear spot is well seen, and the fine and regularly
dotted structure of the chorion          is seen to cease suddenly at the
margin of the clear spot.
   The general form of the egg after deposition is round, but it                  is
rendered irregular by indentations caused by the pressure of other
eggs.    It is inelastic, and retains impressions      made in   it by    a needle ;
and when placed in water, these characters remain for a long time                  if
it  be  not impregnated, — a fact which indicates that water               does not
pass through      the micropyle, or by imbibition         through the chorion.
The viscid secretion of         the  oviduct   which    invests the eggs may
defend them against the action of water, in which it does not readily
diffuse or dissolve.       This secretion   has  an alkaline    reaction.      The
substance     of the yelk     has   a decidedly   acid reaction, — more than
enough to neutralize the alkalinity of the viscid secretion.                   This
reaction is,    I believe,   due to a peculiar organic acid, but the ex
periments relating       to   this question are not yet complete.               The
seminal particles of the male continue to move for a considerable
period in the viscid secretion which envelopes           the ripe ova, but they
very quickly become still in water.
    In the act of impregnation         one   or more (as many as four have
been seen) spermatozoids pass into the micropyle, and probably by
 their proper motion overcome the obstruction which prevents the
entrance of water.         Actively moving spermatozoids may remain in
 contact with the chorion for eighteen minutes at least without pro
 ducing any sensible change in the ovum, provided none of them enter
 the   micropyle, but when one is seen to enter, in about a quarter
 of a minute    a change is observable.
    The    changes   which are observed       to follow    the  entrance of the
 spermatozoids into the micropyle          are the    following    : — In about     a
 quarter of a minute the tube is shortened, and very soon             a clear space
 becomes visible within the chorion near the micropyle           :   this space, or
 respiratory chamber, gradually extends to the opposite pole of the egg
 and increases in diameter, as does also the whole ovum. During
 the formation of this space the surrounding fluid enters through the
 micropyle, and this gradually retracts and is at length closed.               This
 entrance of fluid into the egg effaces the depressions, restores                the

                                        171
round form, and makes           it firm and elastic   ;  but does not cause
any such precipitation of granular matter as is produced by its arti
ficial introduction.
    While    the respiratory chamber is yet in progress of formation, the
yellow    drops of the superficial       layer of the yelk grow pale and
disappear ; the change beginning near the micropyle.               As a result
of this, the whole egg becomes clearer, and the discus proligerus,
which may be now more correctly denominated the germinal mass,
is more distinct.
   The yelk now very slowly alters its form,          one surface    becoming
flattened  ;  but about fifteen or twenty minutes after impregnation a
remarkable and more vivid contraction begins, causing the yelk to
pass through a series      of regularly recurring forms.     The contraction
begins on one side near the equator, and soon forms           a  circular con
striction which gives the yelk the figure of a dumb-bell, the longer
axis of which is the polar axis of the egg.         The constriction travels
towards the germinal pole, and next produces a flask-shaped figure             ;
this is at length lost by the constriction passing on, and the round
form is regained in about a minute.              This   wave   reappears    and
travels forward again      without any distinct period of rest,     and  I have
seen these movements continue for forty-five minutes, though towards
the latter part    of this period they are less distinct and more limited
in extent.       The germinal mass has itself during these contractions,
which strongly resemble the peristaltic movements            of the intestine,
undergone changes in form, and has increased in bulk and distinctness.
These movements are unaffected by weak galvanic currents.
    During     the passage forward of each wave       of contraction there is
an oscillation     of the whole     mass  of the yelk,  so that its germinal
pole passes once to the right and once to the left of the micropyle,
to which it at first corresponded.         The plane of this oscillation may
be vertical, horizontal,     or inclined, but always cuts the micropyle         ;
it begins and       ceases with   the contractions   already mentioned, and
would seem to be        a mechanical result of them.
    For  some time before cleavage begins, the only changes of form are
the appearance of wave-like          elevations and depressions along the
under surface of the germinal mass, and its alternate concentration
and diffusion.       Cleavage begins in about two hours after impreg

                                      172
nation   ; no embryonic cell was observed      before it began, nor in any
of the cleavage masses.
   The inner membrane is folded in during cleavage; it is easily
seen   thrown into folds at the cleft, and for this reason         I do not
consider    it  a yelk-membrane,   which term would be better applied to
the chorion.
II. " On       the Applicability    of Gelatine Paper    as a   Medium for
       Colouring Light."         By Horace Dobell, Esq. Communi
       cated by James Paget, F.R.S.               Received November 9,
       1854.
    The object of this communication is threefold.
    (1.) To point out the properties of         a material called Gelatine
 Paper, which render it applicable as a medium for colouring light.
    (2.) Through the means of gelatine paper, to introduce the use
 of coloured light in the arts for the preservation of the sight of
 artisans.
    (3.) To introduce the use of gelatine paper for the relief of
 persons suffering from impaired vision ; for the preservation of the
 sight of travellers, and of all those who are much engaged in reading.
    This material was invented in         1829  by the late M. Grenet, of
 Rouen, and was exhibited         by him in its present state of perfection
 at the Great Exhibition of 1851.         But up to the present time it  has
 not been successfully applied to any more useful purposes than the
 manufacture of artificial flowers, address-cards, tracing-paper, wafers,
 wrappers for confectionary, and the like.
    It  is commonly manufactured in sheets, measuring 22 inches in
 length and      16 inches in diameter, which are sold at     a small price;
 but the sheets      can  as easily be made    of any dimensions not ex
 ceeding those of which plate-glass is capable.         It  can be made    of
 any thickness, from that of the finest tissue paper upwards.         It may
 be obtained as transparent as the best glass, and more free from colour,
 or of all colours and shades of colour, without        interfering with its
 transparency.       It is exceedingly light, and may be bent or rolled
 up   without injury.      It can be cut with scissors like ordinary paper,

                                        173
and may easily be stitched with a needle and thread.                   By  means of
an aqueous solution of gelatine, it can be made to adhere accurately
to plates of glass without         any interference with its transparency.
When varnished with collodion it         becomes perfectly waterproof, more
pliable,   capable of bearing a considerable degree                of heat without
injury, and its transparency is not affected.
    Hence it appears, that, in addition to its transparency and suscep
tibility to various colours and forms, gelatine paper is                 cheap, por
table, and durable.
    Such     being    the properties    of the material, the following are
enumerated by the author as          some of the forms in which he suggests
that it may be employed, and in which it has already been found
 useful.
    1.  A small      sheet of very pale green or blue gelatine paper, to
 be used    in reading.      The sheet is simply to be laid upon the page
 of the book, and the reading to be conducted through the coloured
 medium.       If  used  in a faint light, the reading paper is to be raised
a  little from    the book to admit more        light beneath it.
    2.  A   sheet   of gelatine paper of pale green           set in a  light frame,
 and placed like a screen before       the window or lamp of the engraver,
 the watchmaker, the jeweller, and the like               ;  thus providing a light
 of genial colour in which they may pursue their occupations.
    3.  A similar       appliance   to the last-mentioned           for the use of
 needlewomen.          For this purpose    screens are to be provided, both       of
 green and of blue gelatine paper           ;  so that the white materials       em
 ployed in needlework may be changed to                 a   pleasant green, by the
 screen of that colour,       the yellow    materials to       a green by the blue
 screen,   and by one or other of these screens the reds softened down
 into violets or browns.
     4. For either of the two last purposes on a larger scale,                   the
 gelatine paper may be attached to the window glass of the apart
 ment, thus colouring,       if necessary,    all the light admitted during day
 light.
     5.  Shades for the eyes in certain affections of the sight, to take
 the place    of the green or blue silk and card shades worn by many
 persons.       The gelatine paper being transparent, will allow the
  wearer to see his way about, at the same time that the eyes are pro
 tected from a glaring light.         This may      be especially useful in cases

                                       174
where it is desired not only to shade a diseased eye, but also to pro
tect its nerves from strong light admitted by the sound eye.             When
not only coloured light but       a certain degree of darkness is required,
this can be readily and delicately graduated by employing shades of
different depths of colour.
    6. Masks    of gelatine paper for protecting the eyes of travellers
against the   glare of snow-fields and of sandy deserts.
III. " On      the Theory      of Definite Integrals."         By W. H. L.
        Russell, Esq., B.A. Communicated by A. Cayley, Esq.,
        F.R.S.     Received October 30, 1854.
    I propose   in the following paper to investigate some new methods
for summing various kinds of series, including almost all of the more
important which are met with in analysis, by means of definite
integrals, and to apply the same to the evaluation of          a large number
of definite integrals.      In  a  paper which appeared in the Cambridge
and Dublin Mathematical           Journal for May 1854,      I applied certain
of   these series to the integration     of linear differential equations by
means    of definite integrals.     Now Professor Boole     has shown, in an
admirable Memoir which appeared in the Philosophical Transactions
for the year 1844, that the methods which he has invented for the
integration of linear differential equations in finite terms, lead to the
summation of numerous series of an exactly similar nature, whence
it follows that the combination of his methods of summation with
mine, leads to the evaluation of a large number of definite integrals,
as  will  be shown in this paper.      It is hence evident that the discovery
of other modes of summing these series by means of definite integrals
must in all cases lead to the evaluation of new groups of definite
integrals, as will also be shown in the following pages.           I then point
out that these investigations        are equivalent to finding all the more
important definite integrals whose values can be obtained in finite
terms by the solution of linear differential equations with variable
coefficients.    Again,   there   are certain algebraical equations which
can be solved      at once by Lagrange's series, and by common alge
braical processes    ; the summation of the former by means of definite

                                    175
 ntegrals affords us    a new class of results, which     I next consider.
 A continental mathematician, M. Smaasen,          has given,    in a recent
 volume of Crelle's     Journal, certain methods of combining series
 together which give us the means of reducing various multiple inte
 grals to single ones.    The  series hitherto considered are what have
been denominated      "factorial series;" but, lastly, I proceed to show
that analogous processes extend to series of a very complicated
nature and of an entirely different form, and for that purpose sum
by means of definite integrals certain series, whose values are obtained
in finite terms in the " Exercices                             "
                                        des Mathematiques         by means
of the Residual Calculus.       The total result will   be the evaluation
of an enormous number of definite integrals on an entirely new type,
and the application of definite integrals to the summation of many
intricate series.

     The following communications were read               : —
 I. " On    the Attraction of the Himalaya Mountains,                  and of the
       elevated   region beyond          them,    upon the Plumb-line            in
       India."     By the Venerable John Henry Pratt, M.A.,
       Archdeacon of Calcutta.            Communicated by the Rev. Pro
       fessor Challis, M.A., F.R.S. &c.                 Received October 23,
       1854.
    The author   commences        by observing that it is now well known
 that the attraction of the Himalaya        Mountains,       and of the elevated
 region beyond them, has a sensible influence on the plumb-line in
 North India.     This circumstance was brought to light during the
 progress of the great trigonometrical survey of that country.                   It
 was found by triangulation that the difference of latitude between
 the two extreme stations of the northern division of the arc, namely
 Kalianpur and Kaliana, is 5° 23' 42"-294, whereas astronomical ob
 servations show a difference of 5° 23' 37"058, which is 5"-236 less
 than the former.
    That the geodetic operations        are not   in fault,    appears  from this ;
 that two bases, about     7    miles long, at the extremities of the arc
 having been measured      with    the utmost care, and also the length          of
 the northern base having been computed from the measured                   length
 of the southern one, through         a chain  of triangles extending about
 370 miles, the difference between the measured and the computed
lengths was only 0-6 of     a   foot, which would produce, even          if wholly
lying in  the meridian, a difference      of only 0"-006 in the latitude.
    The difference 5"-236 must therefore be attributed to some other
cause.    A very probable     cause presents    itself in   the attraction  of the
superficial matter which lies in such abundance on the north of the
Indian arc.    It is easily    seen that this disturbing        force acts in the
right direction, that  is,  it diminishes the difference of astronomical
latitude between the two stations. Whether the cause here assigned
will account for the error in      the difference of latitude in quantity       as
well as in direction,   is the question which         the author     proposes to
discuss in the present paper.

                                           177
    It might    seem at first sight       that  if mountain attraction    were so
influential as is here supposed, it would disturb the geodetic opera
tions, since in observing the altitude or depression of one station as
seen from another, the error         in   the plumb-line     must come into cal
culation.      The author shows, however, by mathematical calculation,
that the effect of mountain attraction            on the geodetic operations is
perfectly insensible,      so that  it is clearly the astronomical operation
of finding the difference of latitude that requires the correction.
This is further apparent from the results obtained by Colonel Everest
on attempting to determine the azimuths of the arc at seven stations
 astronomically.
    To show     the importance    of considering mountain attraction in the
delicate problem of the figure of the earth, the author investigates the
effect of a small error in the difference         of latitude of the extremities
of an arc on the deduced           value of the earth's ellipticity.       As two
unknown quantities occur in the determination of the spheroid of
revolution which most nearly agrees with the earth, namely                   a the
equatorial radius and       e the ellipticity, two      arcs are required in order
to determine them.         The author       selects   the Russian arc, measured
near North Cape, as the most advantageous with which to combine the
northern portion of the Indian arc, and shows that an error of 5"-236 in
defect in the amplitude of the latter would diminish the value              of the
ellipticity   resulting   from the two by about the -jLth part of the
whole.     If the effect of mountain attraction be as great as the author
calculates it to be, (15"-885        in the northern portion of the Indian
arc,) the ellipticity would be diminished by            - s, and even by as much
                                                        8
as \t    if the whole Indian arc from Kaliana to Damargida were
employed.
   The author then       proceeds,    first to develope his method of calcula
tion, and then to reduce his formula to numbers, according to the
best data which he was able to collect.
   An expression is first investigated for           the horizontal  attraction of
a prism of the earth's crust standing on            a  given small base, having  a
small height, and situated at            a  given angular distance (measured
from the centre of the earth) from the station, A, at which the at
traction is sought. In the cases to which this expression is employed

                                         178
 it  reduces   itself without sensible error to
 where    M is the attracting     mass, a the chord    joining its    base with   A,
and    8 the angle subtended by this chord at the earth's centre.
     In applying this expression        to the problem in hand, the author
 divides the earth's surface into lines, by vertical planes passing
through      at equal angular distances.         These lines are further sub
divided by small circles having         A for their common pole,         and in this
manner cutting the whole surface into curvilinear quadrilaterals.                He
then investigates what the law of dissection must be, that is, accord
ing to what law the radii of the small circles must be taken to in
crease, in order that the horizontal attraction of the portion of the
crust standing on one of the quadrilaterals may be equal to the pro
duct of its average height and density by           a constant quantity, inde
pendent of the distance of the quadrilateral from            A.    If  a and a +   ip
be the angular radii       of two consecutive small circles,      there results
                  <pcos  (y a + zp)_a     con8tan(; quantity=c.

To fix the value of this constant, the author           assumes    0=
                                                                   r —      a. when
                                                                         10

Q    and a are indefinitely        small,   which   gives               The above

equation may then be solved numerically with sufficient approxima
tion.     In this manner       a table is calculated of the radii of the suc
cessive small circles.
     These distances should be laid down, and the circles drawn, on                a
map or globe, as well         as the lines dividing      the surface into lines.
Nothing then remains to be done but to ascertain the average heights
of the masses standing on the compartments thus drawn.
    The author's      paper  was accompanied by a plate representing an
outline of the continent of Asia.          On this was laid down       a polygonal
figure   DEFGHIJKL,          (which   for convenience the author calls the
"   enclosed    space,") marking      the   boundary    of an irregular        mass,
which is the only part of the earth's surface that appears to have a
sensible effect on the plumb-line           in India.     The boundary of this
space is thus defined      :—
    DEF is    the Himalaya range, having a bend at           E from north-west

                                       179
 on the left, to east-by-south on the right.        FG   is a range running to
 the table-land    of Yu-nan in lat. 25° and long. 103°.              GH is the
 range of the Yun-Ling mountains, in which there are many peaks of
 perpetual snow.      HI   is the Inshan range.        IJ   is the Khing-khan
 range, very steep on the east side, not so on the west             ; the passes
 are said to be 5525 feet above       the sea.    JK  is the Altai range, the
 highest peak of which is 10,800 feet; the average height is 6000           : the
 range    declines towards the east.        KL   was once thought to be a
 range of mountains, but is now found to be a line of broken country.
 LD is   the  Bolor range, rising to     an elevation similar to that of the
 Hindoo Koosh.       There are besides       these  two ranges of mountains
 running into the enclosed space,        parallel to the Altai and Southern
 Himalayas, namely the Thian-Schan range, or Celestial Mountains,
 and the   Kuen-Luen range, being      a continuation of the Hindoo Koosh,
 which rises from an altitude of 2558 feet near Herat to about 20,000
 where it meets the Bolor range.          It is, however, with the elevation
 of the enclosed space itself that we are principally concerned, since
 ranges    of mountains    have    not so important       an   influence,  when
 distant, as table-lands of elevation.
    Before describing the country within these limits, the author gives
 a general sketch of the parts which lie outside, from which it ap
pears that the calculations       may be confined to the enclosed space.
 He then describes in detail the nature of the country within the
boundaries of the enclosed space, commencing with the Himalayas,
which rise abruptly from the plains of India to 4000 feet and more,
and cover an extensive broken space            some 100 or 200 miles wide,
rising to great heights      ;  perhaps 200 summits exceed 18,000 feet;
the   highest   reaches   to more    than 28,000.       The general     base on
which these peaks rest rises gradually to 9000 or 10,000 feet, where
it abuts on the great plateau north of the range. The character of
the country to the south of this plateau is much better known than
that to the north.      If a  circle with  a radius 5o-046 (the value of one
of the radii employed in the dissection) be drawn around Kaliana,
it will  pass over the highest part of this plateau.         This circle divides
the enclosed space into two portions, of which the southern is called
by the author the        "Known"        and the northern        the "Doubtful
Region."       The effects  of the two portions are separated in the cal
culation by the introduction of an arbitrary factor.
    After describing the doubtful region, as far as was possible from

                                      180
the data to which he had access,         the author assumes,           as the best
general representation of the facts, that to the north of               a line run
ning through Leh and H'Lassa the doubtful region slopes gradually
from 10,000 feet down to 2500 along              a  parallel line nearly in its
centre, and then rises again at the same angle to the north, and that
the portion to the south of the line first mentioned, and not included
in the known region,     slopes at four times that rate.
   The author then proceeds to numerical summations replacing an
integration to be extended over the whole of the enclosed space.
The breadth of the lines employed in the calculation is taken at                 30°,
which is shown not to be too large to give good results.                   The fol
lowing   are the results obtained — :

    The author then examines        these   values more minutely, and con
siders the effect of various hypotheses for reducing them.
    In the first place, the density of the attracting mass may have been
assumed too large.         The density assumed is 2-75 that of distilled
water, the value assumed           as the mean      density of the     mountain
Scheh allien in the calculations of Maskelyne.              This can hardly     be
too great, but at any rate no remarkable supposition relative to the
density can reduce the attraction by more than a small fraction of
the whole.
    Next, the mass of the doubtful region may have been assumed
too great.     This hypothesis       is then examined by the author, who
concludes that even the extravagant            supposition of the non-exist
ence of that region       will not reduce the difference of meridian           de
flexions at   A and B lower than to 9"-753.
    A third   means of reduction may be looked for in the known region.
A large part of the attraction belonging to this region arises from
the Great Plateau.        It would be necessary to cut down this plateau
as much as 6000 feet to reduce the deflexions at A and B to 5"-236,
 even were the whole mass on the doubtful             region non-existent    ;  so
 that it appears to be quite hopeless, by any admissible, hypothesis
 relative to heights, densities,    &c, to reduce     the calculated deflexion
 so as to make       it tally with      the error brought      to light by the
 survey.
    After entering into       some   elaborate calculations     confirmatory of
 the previous results, the author concludes by calculating           the form of
 the Indian arc, that is, by determining what spheroid of revolution,           —
 the  axis of revolution being the earth's axis, — would             most nearly
 coincide with that arc without reference to the rest of the earth, the
 data employed being the lengths and amplitudes of the northern and
 southern portions of the arc, and of course their sum, and likewise
 the latitudes, or at least approximate latitudes, of the middle points
 of the arcs.     By using the amplitudes uncorrected for mountain
 attraction, the author obtains for the value of the ellipticity deduced
 from the Indian      arc alone    j^, nearly agreeing with j^;, which is
 Col. Everest's result      ;  but by using the amplitudes corrected for
 mountain attraction according to the author's calculation, the ellipti
 city is reduced to    4-^j.    He concludes that the arc is more curved
 than it would be       if it had the     mean   ellipticity of  the  earth, and
     VOl.  Vii.                                                        T

regards the supposition of    a general deviation of the earth's surface
in that region from the mean spheroidal form as the most satisfactory
mode   of accounting for the discrepancy.
II. " On    the Value of Steam in the Decomposition of neutral
      Fatty Bodies."      By George Wilson, Esq. Communicated
      by Warren De la Rce, Esq.               Received November 30,
       1854.
   In the course of a long series of experiments conducted on a large
scale, the author has observed that the so-called neutral fatty bodies
may be resolved, without      danger of injurious   decomposition,   into
glycerine and fatty acids, provided the still is maintained at a uni
form high temperature, and that a continuous        current of steam is
admitted into it.
   The temperature required to effect the splitting of the fats into
their proximate elements varies with the nature of the body itself,
but all hitherto tried may be resolved into glycerine and fatty acid
at a temperature of 560° Fahr., many at much below that tempera
ture.   At  a further period  it is the author's intention to lay before
the Society a   detailed account of his experiments, with the confirma
tory analyses, but in the mean time he states that palm oil, cocoa-
nut oil, fish oil, animal tallow, Bornean vegetable      tallow, " Japan
vegetable wax"      (more properly tallow), and several others have
yielded satisfactory results, the fatty acid and glycerine distilling
over together, but no longer in combination, and separating in the
receiving vessel.

 I.   " The    Physical     Theory     of Muscular        Contraction."        By
        Charles Bland Radcliffe, M.D., Licentiate of                          the
        Royal College of Physicians, Assistant-Physician                  to the
        Westminster Hospital, and Lecturer on Materia Medica.
        Communicated by          Charles Brooke, Esq., F.R.S.                 Re
        ceived November 18, 1854.
    The theory    set forth  in this paper is, that muscle is prevented from
contracting by the several vital and physical agencies which act as
stimuli upon muscle, — volition, nervous influence, blood, electricity,
light,   heat, and the rest, — and that contraction        happens on the cessa
tion of stimulation, by virtue of the operation of that universal prin
ciple of attraction which belongs to muscle in common with all
matter, and, so happening,         that it is a physical phenomenon of the
same nature as that contraction which takes place in a bar               of metal
on the abstraction of heat.
    This theory is supported by various arguments,              some   of which
are now stated for the first time.        It is argued   : —
    (a.) That nervous influence cannot cause muscular contraction,
(1) because the degree of innervation, as measured by the supply of
nerves,   is inversely related to the tendency to contraction          ;  (2) be
cause    contraction   does not take place so long as the nerve gives
evidences of electricity (Du Bois Reymond); (3) because, in some
instances at least, contraction does not happen so long as the nerve
gives evidences of
                        " irritability " — for contraction is not     caused   by
                                                                    t  2

                                         184
  heat, by acids and alkalies, and by several other chemical and medi
  cinal substances,   until  the possibility  of provoking contraction by the
  touch of a needle has been        destroyed by the action of the agent —
  until, that is to   say, the
                                 " irritability " of the nerve     has been   de
  stroyed by this action (Eckardt) ; and (4) because the influence of
  the nervous centre in causing contraction is to suspend the natural
  electricity of the nerve and muscle.         This last conclusion is evident
  in the fact, that the signs of electricity, which are absent during
  tetanus, immediately reappear in the muscle and in the portion of
  nerve connected with it, when the influence of the nervous centre is
  cut off and the tetanus resolved by dividing the nerve.
     (6.) That blood cannot cause contraction, (1) because the tendency
  to contraction is inversely related to the supply of blood ; thus, this
  tendency is greater in the voluntary muscles           of  fishes and reptiles
  than of mammals and birds — greater in involuntary than in volun
  tary muscles — greater in the muscles of any given animal during the
  state  of hybernation     than during the period of summer life; and
  (2) because the state of rigor mortis may be relaxed more than
  once, and the lost " irritability
                                        " restored to the muscle
                                                                      by the in
 jection of living blood into the vessels (Brown- Seguard).
     (c.) That electricity cannot cause contraction, (1) because there is
 a constant     current of electricity     in a muscle during rest, but not
 during contraction     (Du Bois Reymond),
                                                  — because, that is to say,
 contraction is absent when muscle is in a state of electrical or polar
 action,  and present when this state is absent, so that contraction ap
 pears to be antagonized by this state of polar action; and (2) because
 contraction is never coincident with the passage of a current of arti
 ficial electricity ; for, not only is it true that a muscle does not con
 tract during the time that a current of artificial electricity is passing
through     it, but contraction is invariably relaxed       if  contraction pre
 existed  (Eckardt).     There is, indeed, momentary contraction at the
opening or at the closing of the circuit,         but this contraction can be
shown to be coincident           with neutralization    of electrical action,
which neutralization       is consequent upon the momentary opposition
of the natural current of      the muscle and the artificial current.
    (d.) That mechanical agents cannot stimulate contraction, (1) be
cause the electrical phenomena of muscle are opposed to such an
idea   ; thus muscle affords evidences of electricity during rest, but

                                     185
not during contraction,      and hence the probability is that electricity
has been discharged when a muscle contracts on being touched by a
needle, — a probability which is supported by the analogy which exists
between the structure of muscle and the structure of the electrical
organ of the Torpedo,        and between the circumstances producing
contraction    on the one hand and discharge         on the other (Owen,
Faraday,    and others);    and  (2) because  the movements of the sto
mach, or uterus, or any other viscus are not to be accounted for on
the supposition that the contractions are stimulated by the contents
of the viscus   ;  thus the food accumulates and the stomach expands
until the appetite is satisfied, and contraction    does not happen    until
the preliminary processes of digestion are at an end, and thus also the
child grows and the uterus expands, and labour pains do not begin
until the growth of the child is completed, and the stimulus of that
growth suspended.
    (e.) That   heat and cold do not stimulate contraction, because con
traction does not happen until the natural polar action of the muscle is
suspended, — an event which happens equally under either extreme of
 temperature, — and thus the muscle would seem to contract because
the heat or cold extinguishes that polar action of the muscle which
 antagonizes contraction.
    (/.)  That light cannot    cause contraction,  (1) because  it exercises
 a directly opposite influence upon the irritable cushions of the sensi
 tive plant  ; and (2) because it is as easy to agree with Bichat, and
 suppose that light expands the curtain of the iris, as that it causes
 contraction   in sphincter- fibres  surrounding   the pupil, which fibres
 have no existence.
    (g.) That    chemical and mechanical   agencies do  not stimulate con
 traction, because contraction does not happen until the agent has de
 stroyed that polar action of the muscle which antagonizes contrac
 tion (Eckardt).
    It is argued, also, that the action of the will upon muscle is not
 necessarily that of a stimulus, for the will may act by withdrawing
 something from the muscle as well as by communicating something
 to the muscle, and,    if so, then the previous considerations enhance
 the probability that it acts by withdrawing      something.
    In the course of the argument it is further shown that this con

                                       186
 elusion is borne out by the history of the muscular movements           which
 are manifested    in the coats of    vessels and in the heart, while at the
 same time this view is found to give the clue to the physical inter
 pretation of
                 " capillary action," and of rhythm, whether this         be in
 the heart or elsewhere.
     It is shown, also, that the     same conclusion    is borne out by the
 pathology of tremor, convulsion, and spasm,        — of those  diseases, that
 is to say, in which       muscular contraction is in excess.       Thus, (to
 mention one argument out of many,)           the state of circulation which
 is invariably associated    with tremor, convulsion, and       spasm, is one
 which necessarily implies the diminution         of all accustomed stimu
 lation in the muscle, for it is a state which borders closely upon
 syncope or asphyxia.
     And, lastly, it is shown that there is nothing in the phenomenon
 of muscular contraction which need prevent it from being referred to
 the operation    of that common principle of attraction which belongs
to muscle in common with all matter, and thus the general conclusion
 is that another barrier between the organic and inorganic world is
broken     down, and that muscular contraction          is an effect    of the
 universal law of gravitation.
    There are, however, sundry grave objections to this theory, and
one main object of the paper under consideration is to remove them.
Thus, for example, if muscle contracts when nervous influence is
withdrawn, how is it that it relaxes when the nerve is divided or
otherwise paralysed      ?  and if  a muscle contracts    for want of blood,
how is it that it relaxes in syncope, asphyxia, and death            ?  These
objections are grave, but not unsurmountable, as the following hints
at explanation     will serve to show.
    It  must be understood, then, that that state of polar action which
is present    in a muscle during rest and absent during contraction,         is
re-established   immediately   after contraction ; it must also be under
stood that this state       of polar action in the muscle is suspended
during ordinary muscular contraction by certain changes which take
place in the nervous centre, and that it has died out when contrac
tion happens after death, as in rigor mortis         ; and the rest is suffi
ciently simple.
    It  is quite in accordance with the theory, then, that a muscle
should contract when nervous influence is withdrawn,              and that it

                                          187
should relax after the nerve        is divided or otherwise paralysed.          At
the moment when the continuity              of the nerve is broken the muscle
contracts,     because    the influence of the nervous centre is cut off ;
but this contraction cannot continue,               because  that state of polar
action which antagonizes contraction is immediately re-established
in  the muscle, and in the portion          of  nerve connected   with it.    This
relaxation, moreover, must continue,             if the paralysed muscle    be left
to itself,  so long as the muscle continues to be the seat           of this polar
action.     And, on the other hand, this contraction must return when
this action is suspended, or diminished,             or extinguished,    as indeed
it does ;    thus the muscle contracts when the polar action is sud
denly suspended by galvanism or by the touch of a needle; thus it
contracts after the paralysis has continued for some time, and when
the failure in the nutrition of the muscle has entailed            a  correspond
ing failure in its polar action      ;   and thus it contracts in rigor mortis,
when all polar action is finally extinguished.
    It is also in accordance with theory that tremor, convulsion, and
spasm should be caused           by want of blood, and that they should
cease when the circulation         fails, as it fails in syncope, asphyxia, or
death.     During tremor, convulsion, or          spasm, the muscles are insuffi
ciently supplied with nervous influence, because the deficient supply
of blood    to the nervous centres involves a corresponding deficiency in
 the degree    of innervation    ; but once let the circulation fail below a
certain point, and the whole case is altered.               During tremor, con
vulsion, and spasm, the supply of blood to the nervous centres is in
sufficient to keep up the normal degree of innervation, but it is suffi
cient to prevent the nerves from being paralysed, and hence the con
tractions in the muscles,       for the nerves being conductors, the failure
in the action of the nervous centres is propagated along them to the
 muscles, and of this failure the contractions are the consequence.
 But if the circulation fails below            a certain   point, the nerves are
paralysed    for  want   of blood, and being paralysed, the failure of in
nervation in the nervous centres, even though this be now complete,
 does not entail    a   corresponding      failure in the polar action of the
muscle, because        the nerves      are   no longer    conductors   ;  and not
doing this, the polar action of the muscle,                which is much more
vigorous than that of the nervous centre and nerve,                  and far less
dependent upon the supply of blood, is immediately re-established.

                                      188
and being re-established, the muscle relaxes (just as it does                 in
the  case where paralysis is caused        by division    of the nerve), and
tremor, convulsion and spasm are at an end.           Nor   is there any doubt
that the nerves are paralysed when the circulation fails to the point
which is here supposed.         Thus, if the circulation in the hand          be
depressed   by immersion in cold water, the sense of touch and the
power    of movement are partially or wholly           destroyed    ;  or if the
principal vessel of a limb be tied, the nerves are similarly paralysed
until the collateral circulation    be established  ; and in each case, also,
                                                    "
the power of provoking " reflex        movements       is diminished or de
stroyed.    In either case the nerves are more or less paralysed for
want of blood, and,    if so, it surely follows that the       nerves must be
paralysed, and still more effectually,      when the circulation fails as it
fails in syncope, asphyxia, or death, and when the movement of the
blood is almost or altogether at an end.          Hence it is quite intelli
gible that tremor, convulsion or spasm should be caused by want of
blood, as is stated in the argument, and that they should cease in
syncope, asphyxia, and death        ; and thus this objection falls to the
ground, and with it all objections of the same kind.
    Such is an imperfect sketch of the evidence upon which the phy
sical theory of muscular contraction is founded.

       Seams   of Bituminous Coal, with           a   Description of some
       Trigonocarpons contained         in them."       By    J. D. Hooker,
       M.D., F.R.S., and E. Binney, Esq.                Received      November
       23, 1854.
    The authors first describe the occurrence of      the limestone nodules,
 which form a continuous bed in the centre of a thin seam of bitumi
 nous coal in the lower part of the Lancashire coal-field.              The no
 dules were of various sizes, some weighing many pounds, and caused
 the coal to bulge out both above and below them, and they were
 found to be entirely composed of vegetable           tissues converted into
 carbonate of lime and magnesia.          Their formation is supposed by
 the authors to be due     to infiltration of water through the superin

                                     189
 cumbent shales, which were full of fossil shells supposed         to be of
  marine origin,   and the aggregation      of the mineral matter round
 centres of vegetable remains.        The chemical constituents of the
 nodules were found to be      carbonates of lime and magnesia, sesqui-
 oxide and sulphate of iron, with a little carbonaceous matter.
    The probability of   these   nodules representing an average sample
 of the vegetable constituents of      the surrounding  coal is then dis
 cussed, and attention is drawn to the very great interest and import
 ance that would attach to them were such a view substantiated,           as
 showing the exact nature of the association of plants which              is
 capable  of conversion into bituminous coal.
    All the plants contained in the nodules were common in other
 parts of the coal formation, viz. Calamodendron,     Halonia, Sigillaria,
Lepidodendron, Stigmaria, Trigonocarpon, Anabothra, and others         ;  of
 these the first-named genus occurred in the greatest abundance and
 as large fragments    of fossil wood.     Very many of    the   specimens
were sliced, and being reduced to very thin transparent sections,
were examined with the view of determining the botanical character
of their contents, and the intimate structure of the masses of more or
less homogeneous aspect       to which   they were reduced by decompo
sition, previous to or during the operation of calcification.      The re
sults were very satisfactory, and seemed to indicate that all traces of
vegetable   structure may be completely obliterated in the substance
of highly bituminized coal, which may nevertheless also contain frag
ments   of wood with their tissues preserved.
   An account is then given of the examination of the details of
structure of Trigonocarpon, and this, as well as the comparison of
Trigonocarpon with the modern genus Salisburia,         is illustrated   by
drawings and analyses.
   The authors     are still engaged with    the study of these nodules,
with the view of showing the relationship between         Calamodendron,
Calami tes, Sigillaria and Anabothra, and the details are preparing for
publication.

     " Remarks     on  the Anatomy       of the Macgillivrayia pelagica
       and    Cheletropis   Huxleyi   (Forbes);    suggesting the esta
       blishment of    a new genus     of Gasteropoda."        By John D.
       Macdonald,         R.N.,  Assistant-Surgeon        H.M.S.    Herald.
       Communicated by Sir W.            Burnett, K.C.B.         &c.    Re
       ceived November 23, 1854.
   Having examined       the anatomy of the   Macgillivrayia pelagica and
several smaller species     of pelagic Gasteropoda, not exhibiting       the
least similarity in the character of their shells, the author found that
they all presented a very close relationship to each other in the type
of their respiratory organs, and in other points of structure of        less
importance.
   The gills in every instance    seemed   to be fixed to the body of the
animal immediately behind the head, and did not appear to be ap
pended to the mantle, as in the Pectinibranchiata        properly so called.
They were     also invariably four in number, and arranged in a cruci
form manner round a central point. They were free in the rest of their
extent, elongated and flattened in form, with a pointed extremity,
and fringed    with long flowing cilia,   set  in a frilled border.    They
were, moreover, furnished with muscular fibres, both transverse and
longitudinal,    and exhibited  great mobility when protruded, but lay
side by side in the last whorl of the shell when retracted.
   The auditory capsules, each containing       a spherical otolithe, were

   closely applied to the inner and posterior part of the larger or ante
   rior ganglion of the suboesophageal        mass.
       There were two tentacula, each bearing at the outer side of
  its base an eye consisting of a globular lens with optic nerve and
  retinal expansion.        The foot was large and very mobile, but a vesi
  cular float has been observed only in Macgillivrayia.
       The respiratory siphon was either          a simple fold    of the mantle
  forming     a temporary      tube (Cheletropis),    or  a  fold whose borders
   were united through their whole length, leaving an aperture at the
  end, as   in Macgillivrayia.
       A lingual ribbon with well-marked          rachis and pleurae occurs in
  all the species.      Very perfect labial plates with closely-        set dental
  points arm the mouth in some instances, and probably in all.
      The little animals possessing in common the characters              here de
  scribed, nevertheless fabricate shells so very different as to admit of
  their division into well-marked genera.
      The author conceives that the obvious difference between                  the
  pectinibranchiate type of respiratory organs and that observed                  in
  the group of Gasteropoda now under consideration, affords sufficient
 grounds for placing the latter in a distinct order by themselves             ; and
 as illustrations    of it he proceeds to give some details of the structure
 of the two     species mentioned      in the title of  the paper, whose shells
 have been already described by the late          Prof. E. Forbes,    and figured
                             '
 in Mr. Macgillivray's          Narrative   of the Voyage of     H.M.S. Rattle
 snake.'
      In Macgillivrayia the disc of      the foot is broad and connected by a
 narrow attachment to the body just beneath the neck              ;  it carries an
 operculum behind, and is cleft by a notch in front.                A raphe ob
 servable in    the  median   line, as  well indeed  as  the  whole character of
 this part of the organ, seems to shadow forth the transformation of
 the single foot of the Gasteropod into the wing-like expansion of
 the Pteropod.
     After describing     the labial plates and lingual strap, the eyes and
the branchiae, the author observes that the tubular siphon protrudes
from the shell on the left side and seems to indicate the coexistence
of a respiratory chamber with naked branchiae.
     The vesicular float, like that of Ianthina, noticed by Mr. Macgil-
livray, consists of an aggregation of vesicles varying both in number

                                        193
and size in different cases.       It is exceedingly delicate, and could not
be found    in the  specimens     first obtained, having probably been de
stroyed or detached from the foot by the force of the water running
through the meshes of the net with which they were captured.                   Its
coexistence with an operculum shows that it is not a modification
of the latter.
   Of the Cheletropis Huxleyi, numerous             specimens    were found in
Bass's Straits and in the South Pacific, between Sydney and Lord
Howe's Island.
   After giving    some    details respecting the shell and the foot, the
author observes     that the latter organ was destitute of float, at least
in the specimens     he obtained, but was furnished with an operculum,
which,    probably    from its     extreme     thinness and smallness,        had
escaped    the notice of Professor Forbes.           He then points out the
peculiarities of the respiratory apparatus.
   The portion of the mantle which forms the respiratory siphon, is
short, and its opposite edges           are   merely in apposition,     without
organic union.      The    branchiae are    of two kinds,   covered  and naked.
The covered gill is single but of considerable length. It is beautifully
pectinated, and fringed with long cilia, and, doubtless, represents
the respiratory organ of the pectinibranchiate              Gasteropoda.     The
basis of this part is    a long and     narrow strip of    a  tough and fibrous
material, folded upon itself into a series of loops invested with a
coating    of epithelium,     and richly ciliated       along the free border.
The naked gills      are four in number, similar both in situation and
character to those of Macgillivrayia.            Each gill is of an oval or
elongated form, presenting a thin, frilled            and corrugated border,
beset  with long whip-like cilia.        In the central parts muscular     fibres
are distinctly   discernible,     some    disposed lengthwise       and others
transversely.
   The lingual strap is next described, as well as two file-like tri
turating plates with which the mouth is furnished.
   The two tentacula of       each side appear as      it were enclosed in    one
envelope, so as to form a single tactile instrument, which bears a
large dark eye on its outer side near the base.            To this latter organ
the tegumentary covering forms a kind of cornea, beneath which is
a spherical lens resting on a mass of black pigment, both being in
closed in a little sac    ; and the optic nerve, emerging from the sub
                                                                    x 2

                                   194
 oesophageal   ganglion, joins the miniature globe and expands into     a
 retina.   The author was unable to trace       an opening through    the
 pigment for the passage of light, but thinks it probable that, as in
 the ocelli of insects, such an aperture exists in the central part. The
 auditory capsules are situated at some distance behind the eyes, and
 may be distinctly seen with the microscope when the surrounding
 parts are carefully removed with fine needles. They are of a rounded
 or oval form, and each contains a beautifully transparent and highly
 refracting otolithe, much larger than the lens of the eye.
    The paper was accompanied with drawings illustrating the prin
 cipal points mentioned in the description.

            THOMAS BELL, Esq., V.P., in             the Chair.
I. The reading of Mr. Savory's         paper
                                               " On   the Development
       of Muscular Fibre in Mammalia,"         was resumed and con
       cluded.
   The author's observations were    made chiefly upon foetal pigs,  but
they have been confirmed by repeated examinations of the embryos
of many other animals, and of the human foetus.
   If a portion of tissue immediately beneath the surface from the
dorsal region of a foetal pig, from one to two inches in length, be

                                    195
examined microscopically, there will be seen, besides blood- corpuscles
in various stages of development, nucleated cells and free nuclei or
cytoblasts scattered through a clear and structureless           blastema in
great abundance.        These cytoblasts    vary in shape and size      ; the
smaller ones, which are by far the most numerous, being generally
round, and the larger ones more       or less oval.      Their outline is di
stinct and well defined, and one or two nucleoli may be seen in their
interior as small, bright, highly refracting spots.        The rest of their
substance is either uniformly nebulous or faintly granular.
    The first  stage in the development    of striated muscular fibre con
 sists in the aggregation and adhesion     of  the cytoblasts, and their in
vestment by blastema so as to form elongated masses. In these clusters
 the nuclei have, at first, no regular arrangement.      Almost,  if not quite
as soon as the cytoblasts are thus aggregated, they become invested
 by the blastema,    and this substance at the same time appears to be
 much condensed, so that many of the nuclei become obscured.
     These nuclei, thus aggregated and invested, next assume a much
 more regular position.      They fall into  a  single row with remarkable
 uniformity, and the surrounding       substance at the same time grows
 clear and more transparent, and is arranged in the form of two bands
 bordering the fibre and bounding the extremities of the nuclei, so
 that now they become distinctly visible. They are oval, and form a
 single row in the centre of the fibre, closely packed together side by
 side, their long axes lying transversely, and their extremities bounded
 on either side by a thin clear pellucid border of apparently homoge
 neous substance.
     It is to be observed  how closely the muscular fibres of mammalia
 at this period of their development resemble their permanent form in
 many insects.
     The fibres next increase in length and the nuclei separate. Small
 intervals appear between them. The spaces rapidly widen, until at
 last the nuclei lie at a very considerable distance apart.      At the same
 time the fibre strikingly decreases in diameter      ; for as the nuclei se
 parate, the lateral bands fall in and ultimately coalesce.
     This lengthening of the fibre and consequent separation of the
 nuclei is due to an increase of material, and not to a stretching          of
 the fibre.
     Soon after the nuclei have separated some of them begin to decay.

                                         196
They increase in size      ;   their outline becomes      indistinct  ;  a bright
border appears immediately within their margin             ; their contents be
come    decidedly granular      ; their outline is broken and interrupted         ;
and presently an irregular cluster of granules is all that remains, and
these soon disappear.
   It sometimes happens that the nuclei perish while in contact,               be
fore the fibre elongates     ;  but the subsequent changes are the same.
   The    striae  generally first become       visible at this period, imme
diately within the margin of the fibre.
   The fibre is subsequently increased in size, and its development is
continued by means of the surrounding cytoblasts.                  These attach
themselves to its exterior, and then become invested by a layer of the
surrounding blastema.          Thus,   as it were,  nodes are formed at inter
vals on the surface of the fibre.           These invested nuclei are at first
readily detached, but they soon become intimately connected and in
definitely blended with the exterior of the fibre.            All its characters
are soon acquired,     the nuclei at the same time gradually sink into
its substance, and an ill-defined elevation, which soon disappears, is all
that remains.
   Lastly, the substance of         the fibre becomes     contracted and con
densed.     The diameter of        a fibre towards, or at the close of intra
uterine life, is considerably less than at       a  much earlier period.
   At  the period   of birth muscular fibres vary much in size.
   The several stages in the development of muscular fibre, above
mentioned, do not succeed each other as           a  simple consecutive series    ;
on the contrary, two, or more, are generally progressing at the same
time.    Nor    does each commence at the same period           in all  cases.

mary   of  principles already known respecting the elasticity of solids.
Those principles are treated as the consequences of the following

                                              197
Definition of Elasticity, without introducing                           any hypothesis as
to the molecular structure of bodies.
     " Elasticity is    the property which bodies possess               of preserving     deter
minate volumes and figures under given pressures and temperatures,                            and
which in a homogeneous body manifests                itself   equally in every        part of
appreciable magnitude."
     The investigations are limited by the following conditions                       :   —
     1.    The temperature of the elastic body is supposed to                        be con
stant and uniform.
     2.    The variations of the volumes            and figures of its particles are
supposed         to be so small, that the elastic pressures may be considered
as   sensibly linear functions of those variations.
     3.    It   is assumed,   that the only force, besides               elastic pressures,
acting on the particles of the body, is that of terrestrial gravitation.
     All possible small variations of volume and figure of                    an originally
rectangular molecule, when referred to three orthogonal axes, may
be resolved         into six, viz. three linear dilatations or compressions,
and three distortions.
     In like manner the elastic pressures exerted on and by such                                  a
molecule may be resolved into six, viz. three normal pressures, and
three tangential        pressures.
     Those six pressures are connected with each other and with the
attractive force acting on the molecule, by three well-known differ
ential equations of the first order.
     They       are also connected at every element                of   the surface of the
body, by three well-known            linear equations, with the components of
the external force acting on that element.
     The general problem to          be solved is, to find the integrals                  of the
first three equations, subject to conditions fixed by the last three.
     The six variations of volume and figure of                a   rectangular molecule
are       expressed by six small fractions called
                                                  " coefficients of displace
ment."
     If    the differential of each of these fractions be multiplied by the
pressure which directly tends to vary                it,   the sum of the products                is
the       complete differential      of   a   function called the Potential Energy
of    Elastic Forces for the molecule in question, which                       is   sensibly      a
homogeneous quadratic function of the six fractions.                         It   has twenty-
one        terms,   and twenty-one        constant coefficients, which constitute

                                         198
  the Coefficients  of Elasticity of the body, for   the system   of orthogonal
   axes chosen.
      Twenty-one     equations express the relations between the systems
  of coefficients of elasticity in a given body for any two different sy
  stems    of orthogonal axes.
      When a body possesses       a system   of orthogonal   axes  of elasticity,
  its coefficients of elasticity, when referred to these axes, are reduced
  to nine.
      A body isotropic with respect to elasticity    has but three coefficients
  of elasticity, which are the same for all sets of orthogonal axes, and
  are connected with each other by an equation.
     If the Potential Energy of Elastic Forces be expressed as a homo
  geneous quadratic function of the six elastic pressures, its coefficients
  constitute the coefficients of compressibility and extensibility, and of
 pliability.     They have relations to the coefficients of elasticity which
  are consequences of the properties of determinants.
     The   Second Section    of the  paper relates to the problem    of the  ge
 neral integration     of  the equations   of the internal equilibrium of an
 Elastic Solid, especially when it is not isotropic. The method of so
 lution consists of the following eight processes        : —
     I. The centre of gravity of      the body being (in general) taken      for
 the origin     of co-ordinates, the forces applied to the surface <jf the
 body are      subdivided into nine systems of " Reduced External
 Pressures," which        are of such a nature, that for any integration      of
 the external forces as originally expressed       over a portion of the sur
 face   of the body, may    be substituted the sum    of three integrations of
 certain of the reduced external pressures over the three projections
 of that portion of the surface upon the co-ordinate planes.
     By such integrations,       extended to the whole of the body, are
found the mean values of the nine reduced external pressures, which
are connected by simple equations         with the  mean values, or constant
terms,    of the six internal elastic pressures.
    The deviations of     the reduced external pressures above and below
their mean values, constitute nine systems of variable parts of those
pressures.
    II. The eighteen    coefficients of the three co-ordinates in the linear
terms    of the six internal elastic pressures     are determined by means
of eighteen equations       ; viz. three equations of internal equilibrium

                                      199
 between certain of these coefficients and the force of gravity,          and
 fifteen equations formed by means of the conditions          of equilibrium
 of portions of the body cut off by the co-ordinate planes, and planes
 parallel to them.
     III.  The six constant terms,    and the eighteen linear terms,   of the
 three dilatations or compressions and the three distortions, are com
 puted from the corresponding         terms of the internal pressures by
 elimination, or by means of the coefficients of extensibility and com
 pressibility, and of pliability. The coefficients of the co-ordinates in
 those twenty-four     terms bear linear relations to the coefficients in
 the linear and quadratic terms of the three projections of the mole
 cular displacement.
     IV. The parts of   the nine reduced external pressures correspond
ing    to the constant and linear terms    of the internal pressures  having
 been     determined for each element of the body's surface and sub
 tracted from the nine actual reduced external pressures,           there re
 main nine residual reduced external pressures for each such element,
which form three systems, each suitable for development in series
of trigonometrical functions of       a different pair of independent co
ordinates.
     V. The parts of  the three projections  of the molecular displacement,
which correspond to      each system of residues of the reduced external
pressures, are to be expressed by infinite series in terms of the sines
and cosines of linear functions of the proper pair of independent co
ordinates, each order of terms containing          (except in some special
cases) four kinds of trigonometric functions, multiplied by six expo
nential functions of the third co-ordinate, whose parameters are the
roots of an equation of the sixth order, and by twenty-four             arbi
trary constants.
     From the expressions thus formed are to be computed symbolical
expressions for the values of the system of residues or transcendental
parts of the reduced external pressures, for each pair of independent
co-ordinates, which,     by the aid of the equation of the form of the
surface of the body, are to be transformed into series containing
terms in trigonometric functions         of the independent     co-ordinates
only, multiplied by linear functions of the arbitrary constants, which
are    (in general) twenty-four     times as numerous as the orders of
terms.

                                       200
    VI. By equating the constant factor of         each term   of the symbo
lical developments thus formed, to         the constant factor of the corre
sponding term of the arithmetical developments found by the pro
cess   IV.,   there are formed as many linear equations between the
arbitrary constants and known quantities as there are constants to
be determined, from which equations those constants are found.
    VII.   Cases in which      one  ordinate intersects the surface of the
body in two or more pairs of points are to be treated by a special
 method.
    VIII.   The results of the previous processes are to be combined,
 and the solution of the problem completed by determining and adding
 to them the displacements and rotations         of the body  as a whole.
     The Third Section relates to     the internal equilibrium    of a rectan
 gular prismatic body.
     Processes   I., II. and III.   The determination of the constant and
 linear terms of the internal pressures, and the corresponding terms
 of the molecular displacements, consists in the special application of
 the methods of the preceding section.          The  axes of figure are taken
 for axes of co-ordinates.
     IV. The    means and differences      of the transcendental residues of
 the reduced external pressures on each pair of faces of the prism are
 developed in series of trigonometric functions of the pairs of inde
  pendent co-ordinates of the respective faces to which they are ap
 plied  ;  the series    employed being of such a nature, that for the
  edges of the body all their terms vanish.
     V. and VI. An order having          been fixed for the consideration    of
  the forces acting on the three pairs of faces, let yz, zx, xy be that
  order.
     Series of functions trigonometric in y and z, exponential in x, and
  satisfying the equations of internal equilibrium, with arbitrary con
  stant coefficients, are taken to represent the molecular displacements
  produced by the residual pressures on the faces normal to x.           From
  those series are computed series representing        symbolically those re
  sidual pressures, which series being equated to the series numerically
  representing those      pressures, the arbitrary constants are found by
  elimination.
     The   formulae thus obtained are employed to compute ideal systems
  of external pressures on the     faces normal to y and z, called     " provi

                                       201
sional pressures," which are developed in trigonometric functions of
the independent co-ordinates of the faces to which they are conceived
to be applied.       Should   the provisional    pressures agree    with the
actual residual pressures on those faces,         the process is complete ;
should they not so agree,         the provisional  pressures are to be sub
tracted from the actual residual pressures, leaving systems            of re
mainders called "     secondary pressures."
    The  series representing the molecular displacements corresponding
to the Secondary     Pressures on the faces normal to y are to be found
in the manner already referred to.          The formulae thus obtained are
to be employed to compute an ideal system         of"  Provisional Secondary
 Pressures" on the faces normal to z, which are to be developed            in
trigonometric functions of x and y.
     Should the provisional secondary pressures thus found agree with
the actual secondary pressures on the faces normal to e, the process
is complete. Should they not so agree, the provisional are to be sub
 tracted from the actual secondary pressures, leaving a system of re
 mainders called   " Tertiary Pressures" on the     faces normal to z, whose
 effects are to be computed      in  the usual manner.
     Process  VII. is not required.
     Process  VIII. consists in combining      the terms of the molecular
 displacements due to the constant and linear terms of the internal
 pressures, the residual pressures on the faces normal to x, the se
 condary pressures on the faces normal to y, and the tertiary press
 ures on the faces     normal to z, and finally determining       and adding
 to the other terms, those depending on the displacements and ro
 tations of the prism as a whole.
     The Fourth Section    relates to the integrals   of the equations of the
 internal equilibrium of an isotropic elastic solid.
     The constant and linear terms of the internal        pressures are to be
 determined by the methods described in the previous sections, for all
 solids, whether isotropic or not.
     The transcendental terms of the internal pressures and molecular
  displacements in an isotropic elastic solid, require a special method
  for their determination.
     The three projections of the molecular displacement, with all their
  functions,   in an isotropic     solid, are deducible from one primitive
  function or series of primitive functions of the co-ordinates, by cer

                                   202
tain processes of derivation, distributive, but not necessarily commu
tative.
   Each primitive function must satisfy the condition
and may belong to one or other of eight classes,      according as it is
even or odd   with respect to x, y and z.
   The   processes  of derivation applicable to the primitive functions
contain three arbitrary constants for each primitive function.    Hence
when there is a series of primitive functions of different orders, there
are twenty-four arbitrary constants for each order    of terms.
   In the developments of the residual external pressures, there are
also twenty-four    constant coefficients for each order of terms, of
which the arbitrary constants are linear functions.
   The notation of M. Lame's work on the Mathematical         Theory of
the Elasticity of Solid Bodies, so far as it relates to isotropic sub
stances,  is compared with that of this paper.
   Reference being made to the known        method of representing the
elastic pressures at  a given particle of a solid, in magnitude and di
rection, by the radii of an ellipsoid, and the positions of the surfaces
to which those pressures are applied by those of the tangent planes
to an ellipsoid or hyperboloid, the difference (not generally attended
to) between the cone of tangential pressures, and the cone of sliding,
is pointed out.    This difference is important in the theory of the
strength of materials.

       The following communications were read: —
 I. " Note        to a paper read before the Royal Society on the 11th
          of May, 1854."           By J. W.       Griffith,      M.D., F.L.S.        Com
          municated       by Arthur Henfrey,                Esq.      Received Decem
          ber 13, 1854.
      In  the paper referred to above,           it was stated that the markings or
 dots upon the valves          of the Diatomaceae,         are the optical expressions
 of depressions existing upon the              valves.
      All  those   authors who have paid special attention to the Diato-
 maceae,      have considered the markings to denote cells                ; among these
 we find Ehrenberg*,          Kutzingf, RalfsJ, Smith§, and Quekett||.
     The     evidence    I adduced in regard to the more coarsely marked
Diatomaceae,        as  Isthmia, &c, being furnished with depressions and
not cells, is,      I  believe, satisfactory and conclusive             ; and this view
has been admitted in a paper since read before the                     Royal Society   ^f.
     A   different view has been taken of the nature of the finer mark
ings, as those upon some species of Gyrosigma, by the author of the
paper last quoted, as by previous authors                    ;  and the object of this
note is to direct attention to the support which the extended view
argued for by me in the paper above referred to, viz. that the finer
markings also correspond to depressions,                  derives from analogy.

tion, are, as is well known,           remarkable.      So much so, that these
organisms have been claimed by botanists as members                   of the vege
table, and by zoologists as belonging to the animal kingdom.                  The
preponderance of evidence           is decidedly in favour of their vegetable
nature  ; but, be this as it may, they must all be classed together, —
they form a perfectly natural family.             Hence we have a strong argu
ment in favour of the markings upon their valves                  being identical,
and as these are evidently depressions in the genera and species with
coarsely marked valves (Isthmia,            &c),   we should expect from ana
logy that the same would apply to those with finer markings.                  And
this view receives further        support, from the fact, that under varied
methods of illumination,          corresponding      appearances    are presented
by the markings when viewed by the microscope, from those which
are very large, as      in Isthmia, through       those  of moderate     and small
size, as in the species         of Coscinodiscus,     down to those in which
they are extremely minute, as in the species of Gyrosigma, &c.                The
angular    (triangular     or quadrangular)       appearance     assumed   by the
markings, arises from the light transmitted through the valves being
unequally oblique.         This may     be readily shown in the more coarsely
marked valves       (Isthmia,      Coscinodiscus),     which    present the true
structural    appearance       when the light is reflected by the mirror in
its ordinary position, and the spurious angular appearance               when the
light is rendered oblique by moving            the mirror to one side.
II.   "Researches on the Theory of Invariants."                     By  William
       Spottiswoode, M.A., F.R.S.                    Received     December     20,
       1854.
   Invariants may be regarded from two points of view, the permu-
tational and the functional.           According to the former they are con
sidered as arising from a process of permutation,                according to the
latter as derivatives from other functions.             In this paper the latter
course is adopted     ;  and the following is an       outline of the method : —

and the problem consists in determining the coefficients of U.                                                     This

This method              has been applied                  in the      case of two variables to the
calculation of quadratic and cubic invariants.
  But in          the case of two variables the coefficient a may be expressed
by a series of symbols with a single suffix, thus                                        :
                   a0,   a,,     ..     a,,,   a,   ...     n0,                 ..    0n,                ..
Now     since      A is    of         the same degree             in   /, m, and in                     m', the coeffi
cients of all powers and products of                              a0, a,>, . .       in which the degree of
/, m is above or below that of                       /',   m',   will vanish in              the invariant.       And
from this and some other considerations
                                                                           it
                                                                           is        shown, that not only
                                                                           mn

equations arising from equating to zero each term of the last equa

tion above written, operated upon by the symbol             £>.   This always
gives a system of linear equations for finally determining the coeffi
cients.   It  does  not appear possible fully to explain this method
without entering into more details than can be given in an abstract.
   From the general equations for so determining the coefficients, the
number and degrees of the distinct invariants belonging to any given
function may theoretically be determined           ; and this has been done
for the simplest case, viz. quadratic functions.         But the expressions
for higher degrees appear so complicated that an answer to this im
portant question can hardly be expected from this method, in any
case not already known.
   The view of invariants     here taken has suggested a series of other
functions of which invariants form the last term.            These functions,
which   I   propose to call     Variants,   may be thus expressed.          If
functions of the degrees r, s, .. (r, s,    . .  being less than ») have in

 III.  A  paper was in part read, entitled
                                                     " Ocular    Spectres and
       Structures     as Mutual Exponents."            By James Jago, A.B.
       Cantab.,     M.B. Oxon., Physician          to the Royal Cornwall
       Infirmary.        Communicated by         W. J. Henwood,             Esq.
       Received December          26, 1854.
    The  paper opens     by stating that for want of a methodical elimi
 nation of ocular spectres from one another — a want which its aim is
 to meet — physiological       optics remain to this day without any real
foundation   ;   and even when we have          followed     the rays of light
through all the refracting media of the eye, we cannot safely assert
what sensations belong to them until we have detected everything
connected with the percipient membrane              which may obstruct the
action of light on it, or which may originate sensations as of light
through other sorts of impulses.           Our eyes in many important re
spects   provide us with an opportunity          for microscopical      research
that no optical instrument employed on the dead eye can rival. We
may thus gather a variety of information, physical and physiological,
solve points     of ocular structure that   escape     other means of investi
gation, and bring a profusion of ingenious speculations to           a termina
tion, by showing       that the phenomena (and this is especially true of
the retinal     phenomena) which have occasioned them are simply
exponential of anatomical facts        ; and important      physiological   laws
may be arrived at by like means.
   The first   step  in the author's task is to determine the conditions
which render objects existing upon or within the eye visible by their
shadows, and to obtain optical principles by which we may examine
the interior of our own eye with facility, so as to recognize in what
lenticular structure, and what part of it, the cause of any shadow or
" diffractive image "      resides.   He shows that       we may make      every
measurement of interest, may decide all the points just alluded to, at
the instant,    as  it were, by    mere inspection   ;  and he illustrates    his
optical principles by appropriate experiments.
   The paper then commences its actual elimination of ocular spectres
from one another, starting from the appendages            of the eye and going
on through      the ocular tissues in succession to the          retina, under
several heads, as —

                                         209
  Optical Effects     of the Eye-lashes, Eye-lids,     and Conjunctival Fluids.
     These produce phenomena of reflexion, refraction, and inflection.
 They may multiply the images of objects which are without or which
 are within the eye, and occasion us to see the latter.          The conjunc
 tival fluids render apt illustrations        of "recondite" diflractive    sha
 dows.
                    Optical Structure  of the Crystalline Lens.
     It   is shown that the stelliform       figure of our crystalline lens is
 distinctly visible in divergent light.          The Jens contains numerous
 bodies displaying a series of diffractive fringes.         The fringes of the
 border of the iris are likewise conspicuous.         Whenever light radiates
 into the eye from      a near point, all these things happen. Hence when
 a line    of radiants (an edge of any body) is before the eye, a mosaic
fringe of these coloured shadows will be formed ; and there is an
 ocular fringe, as well as the fringe on the edge of a body by light
 inflected at the body.        The ocular colours mentioned       seem to have
been the cause       of the belief that it can be proved experimentally that
the eye contains no provision for the correction of chromatic disper
 sion   ;  whereas the colours spoken of should only be compared with
those that are produced by flaws            in the glasses   of optical instru
ments.
   The Structure     of the Vitreous Body   derived from Optical   Phenomena.
    On this     head the author arrives at the     following conclusions.
    In    the vitreous body are innumerable       vesicular globules, ranging
in size from 0-0008 to 0-005 of a line, which are arranged in un.
broken series, in tubes more or less transparent.            These tubes pre
cisely resemble veins and arteries in their mode of ramification         ; they
frequently anastomose         and are united to one another by capillary
plexuses, and they are of less specific gravity than the vitreous fluid.
The trunks of this peculiar system of vessels probably arise in the
region of, or at the base of the optic nerve, and ramify in the vitreous
humour       ; the larger branches      passing circumferentially     within  a
limited distance of the hyaloid membrane, and yielding             again many
branches, which, after repeated subdivisions, end in a capillary net
work exceedingly subtle and close.            Many of the terminal loops of
the capillaries     are attached to the hyaloid      membrane, so as to    con
                                                                y 2

                                     210
fine the majority of the branches in a lax manner to its vicinity.       A true
idea of this system may be gained by conceiving that the veins and
arteries here existing in the foetal eye have in after life been deve
loped according to the growth of the body, but also metamorphosed
into these light, peculiar, globule-holding,       transparent vessels,      and
deprived of all foreign support except at their roots and a part of
their capillary  loops.    The intricate ramifications of        these   vessels
have the mechanical effect of     in  a great degree restraining the rela
tive motion of the humour which fills the hyaloid capsule, and com
pelling it to concur in the various movements of the eye-ball, so as
to obviate the risk of concussion from eddies of the fluid in rapid
movements of the eye, and consequent disturbing effects on the lens,
the retina and its vessels.
   The paper   goes on to take this subject up in detail       ;  supplies the
dynamical laws which       must be kept in view in the application of
previously obtained optical methods to the required examination                 ;
shows that it is the system      of ramifications      described which       has
given rise to the peculiar appearances     simulating concentric lamellae
in the vitreous humour previously subjected to chromic acid, so dif
ferently interpreted by microscopists.      Here too the hitherto vagrant
muscat volitantes are, for the first time, invested      with form, disposi
tion and office.    They  are now shown to be the essential element           in
the structure of the vitreous body      ; and certain radical misconcep
tions, as to the nature of these appearances        and the constitution      of
the vitreous body, are pointed out.
                   The Optical Anatomy     of the Retina.
   The existence of the    vasa centralia  retina in   the substance of the
retina, and the movements of the blood therein, occasion diversified
phenomena.      We may examine       these  vessels   in our own       eyes,  in
their minutest distributions,    by means     of  a pin-hole,    lens,  &c, in
movement across the eye's axis,    in virtue of   a physiological    law here
after determined.     Currents   of blood in    these vessels,    by pressure
upon the nervous matter at their sides,       produce remarkable pheno
mena, differing for the superficial and deep vessels (that is, according
to the place of the vessel in the five layers of the retina lately disco
vered by microscopists).     These phenomena may all be distinguished
from one another, and assigned with precision each to its cause.

                                          211
 The phenomena of this kind            are always before us by daylight and
 night.    In every     use   of the organs of sight       these  effects   may be
 observed.      In twilight, and     into   night, the pressure of the blood-
 currents on the retina first equals and then excels the impression
 made    by the failing       external    light;   and the whole       circulatory
 system may be seen, with proper attention,             definitely figuring itself
in white or golden colour. A great concentration of light appears at
 the middle of the retina, which requires a bountiful supply of blood,
and owing to the pointing of vessels towards the foramen centrale,
 there is an apparent gyration of light currents round a darker pivot.
The whole conduct of the retinal circulation              may be traced by the
 blood-light.     And the manner in which          the blood flows through the
retina may be equable, or irregular and fitful          ; it may   be very slow,
 and it may roll with great rapidity.               A rhythmical or recurrent
circulation    of  the retinal   blood is very frequent, and produces very
singular phenomena.          We may produce the uncommon             states  of the
retinal circulation at pleasure, by artifices described        ;  and it is shown
that it is the retinal circulation which is the cause of all the pheno
mena which       have been     taken to prove spontaneous, vibratory, &c.
sensations    of light.
    From these elementary facts being overlooked, fundamental errors
as to the conduct       of the retina proper       have prevailed on    all hands.
When external light is so faint that the retinal light from blood-
pressure exceeds it, the middle of the retina is so occupied with retinal
light as to be, comparatively with other parts of the retina, unavail
able for the usual purposes, and we do not see anything               with direct
nearly so   well     as with oblique vision      ; and this inefficiency of the
centre of the retina is not limited to the case of            " stars of the last
                          "
degree    of faintness       (Herschel and South), but all small objects
that are quite visible by "lateral" inspection appear to be "suddenly
blotted out" by the eyes being turned directly upon them.
   The rhythmical       waves   of light, or rhythmical progression of the
retinal blood (and the mode of movement of the retinal blood as
rendered by optical phenomena can be observed                 by other means),
may occur,     in  a  certain sense, spontaneously, or may be produced at
will.   The retinal circulation        may be excited to show astonishing
luminous effects.
   Among other ways of causing           a  rhythmical or recurrent movement

                                      212
of this blood, is that by simple fatigue of the retina by overstraining
 the sight, when the retina, more or less suddenly (or after a few
oscillations), becomes flooded with blood, and complete obliteration
 of all objects having     less than a certain luminosity       ensues.     This
 circumstance has misled Brewster and Purkinje, separately, into the
 belief that they had discovered that a sensation excited in one por
 tion of a retina may be      " extended" or " irradiated" to an adjacent
 portion.     Other cases which are imagined by        J.  Miiller and Brew
 ster to support this view are subjected to examination             ;   the real
 cause    of each   of the phenomena mentioned being pointed out.
 Some peculiar effects of retinal light are given ; and it is determined
 that the rigid correspondence     of  the limits of sensation with those       of
 the painted image, is a physiological     law literally absolute.
    Unsuspected difficulties of a solitary eye, and certain well-known
 phenomena are explained upon the foregoing principles.
    May    sensation be excited in the trunk  of  the optic nerve, or centri-
fugally ?
    The arguments which         have been presumed to prove the affirma
 tive are shown, one by one, to be fallacious,            while there is pre
 sumption of a negative sort.       Observations are offered as to the cor
 rect explanation     of various physiological     points which have been
 otherwise interpreted, and reputed physiological contrasts of colour
 are considered.
    Images    of external  objects  are painted on the limitary membrane,
 and perceived by the radial fibres.
    This   head   commences    with   the quotation of a passage from Sir
 David Brewster's 'Optics' which he offered towards an explanation
 of the difficulty of seeing a very faint star by direct vision       ;  and it is
 shown that the retina is not liable, as Brewster             imagines, to be
 thrown into a state of " undulatory" perception by our looking
 through the teeth of a
                              " fine comb" or through a single " narrow
 aperture."     The paper points out that the effect        observed    in these
 circumstances is produced by our looking near the edge of any body
 whatever, provided, and only then, that the object move, be it never
 so little, across the eye's axis.    It shows that the same effect is pro
 duced by light radiating from a point, by a flame, by lenses, curved
 reflectors, whilst they are in the act of moving across the eye's axis ;
 or by the movement      of the eye itself, merely in relation to the light

                                              213
entering         —even
               it,           the naked eye along the sky.               The effect pro
duced     is   shown to be simply owing to this            ;    that the retina, under
such action,          ceases to    perceive in the spaces        corresponding to its
blood-vessels and capillaries, so that they completely display them
selves    in the semblance of black bodies (or lines)               ;   and the law   is
arrived at, that the images of external points which are painted on
the vessels          and capillaries   are not perceived when the retina loses
light from one point          of
                         space and receives light from another point of
space within a certain interval of time, or that the percipient points
lying in front of          the vessels      require a certain time to perceive.       A
physiological         hypothesis     is   suggested to account for this pheno
menon, on the presumption that the                    " radial fibres," which project
from the layer of rods and cones and end in the limitary membrane,
are the ultimate percipients              of light.
  It   is   pointed out how wonderfully               close we may find the corre
spondence        between the microscopical             and optical anatomy of the
retina.        Each pair of identical fibres of the two optic nerves must
be regarded as one nerve.                 Another supposed anomaly to the sim
plicity of nervous action being explained on anatomical principles,                   a
statement of ordinary optical nervous action               is   made, and   a   summary
evinces how the anomalies in visual experience are due to the com
plex additions to        a   simple organ of sight.

 The Bakerian Lecture was then delivered by John Tyndall,
       Ph.D., F.R.S.; being an oral exposition, illustrated by expe
       riments, of the substance of a paper by him, entitled On
                                                                      "
       the Nature of the Force by which Bodies are repelled from
       the Poles   of a Magnet;     preceded by an Account         of some
       Experiments on Molecular Influences."
    The paper   commences   with an introduction, in which the present
 aspect of the portions of science to which it refers is briefly sketched.
 A section is devoted to the examination of the magnetic properties
of wood, which substance, the author finds, except where extraneous
impurities are present, to be always diamagnetic, and to set in the
magnetic field with its fibre equatorial.     The influence of   the shape
of pointed and flat poles is studied, and those curious phenomena of
rotation, first observed by M. Pliicker, and attributed by him to the
action of two conflicting forces, are referred to molecular structure
as a cause.    Between flat poles, it is proved that the line joining the
centres of the two poles is the line of minimum force     ; that is to say,
the force increases more quickly from the central point of the mag
netic field in an equatorial direction than in an axial one.       Reflect
ing on the great diversity of opinion at present existing with regard
to the real nature of the diamagnetic force, the author deemed it
necessary to commence at the foundation of the inquiry.           A funda
mental question in the present case is the following          : — Are dia

                                     215
 magnetic bodies repelled by a magnet in virtue of any constant pro
perty possessed     by the mass   ? Is the force in question       a mere    repul
sion of ordinary matter, or is the repulsion exercised in virtue of a
state   of magnetization    into which the body is first thrown            ?   This
question is answered in      a manner which admits of no doubt.
    It is proved that the repulsion of diamagnetic bodies             increases  in
a quicker ratio than the strength      of the magnet which produces the
repulsion.     Within    wide limits,   indeed, the repulsion, instead of
being simply proportional to the strength of the magnet, is propor
tional to the square of the strength, which leads inevitably to the
conclusion that the body thus repelled contributes to the effect pro
duced;     that its repulsion  is due to an excited condition into which
it is thrown by the influencing      magnet, the intensity of this excite
ment varying within the limits already referred to, as the strength
of the magnet which produces it.         This conclusion is further arrived
at by a close comparison of the repulsions of diamagnetic bodies
with the attraction of paramagnetic ones : both are found subservient
to  one and the same law.
    It is next proved that the diamagnetic           excitement produced by
one pole of    a  magnet is not the state which enables a pole of an op
posite quality to repel the substance      : — that   each pole induces a con
dition peculiar to itself, or, in other words, that the excitement of
diamagnetic bodies in the magnetic field is of a dual character.
   These points being established, a searching comparison is insti
tuted between the phenomena exhibited by paramagnetic and dia
magnetic bodies in three distinct         cases  : — first, when operated on
by the magnet alone       ; secondly, when operated on by the current
alone   ; and, thirdly, when operated on by the magnet and current
combined.      A bar of iron was, in   some   of   these cases, compared with
a bar   of bismuth, but it was soon found necessary, in order to avoid
the proved errors of reasoning, to take strict account of the mole
cular structure of the bismuth.         A bar of this substance, cut in            a
certain manner from the crystallized          mass,     exhibits    between the
poles of a magnet precisely the same visible deportment as a bar of
iron, while it is well known that the normal deportment of bismuth
is opposed to that of iron.        The author, in his examination of the
points before us, divided paramagnetic bars into two distinct classes,
and classified diamagnetic bars in the same manner               ;   one class he

                                     216
called normal, and the other class abnormal.       A normal paramagnetic
bar is one which sets its length from pole to pole in the magnetic
field, and a normal diamagnetic bar is one which sets its length at
right angles to the line joining the poles. An abnormal magnetic         bar,
on the contrary, is one which sets its length equatorially       ;  while an
abnormal diamagnetic bar is one which sets its length axially.
    In all cases, whether operated on by the magnet alone, the cur
rent alone, or the magnet and current combined, the deportment of
the normal paramagnetic bar is precisely antithetical        to that of the
normal diamagnetic one.        In the magnetic field the former          sets
axially, the latter equatorially.   Operated on by a voltaic current, the
former sets its length at right angles to the current, the latter sets
its length parallel to it.   When magnet       and current act together on
the bars, it is found that the disposition of forces which produces a
deflection from right to left of the paramagnetic bar produces a de
flection from left to right of the diamagnetic bar.         If the position
of equilibrium    of the former be from     N.E. to S.W., the position of
equilibrium of the latter is from N.W. to S.E. In short, the posi
tion of rest for the normal magnetic bar is always at right angles to
the position of the diamagnetic bar.       A precisely similar antithesis   is
observed   when we compare the abnormal paramagnetic bar with the
abnormal diamagnetic one.        The former, in the magnetic field, sets
equatorially, the latter axially.     The former sets parallel to an elec
tric current, the latter perpendicular     to the same.   If the   deflection
of the former be from right to left, the deflection of the latter, under
like conditions, is from left to right. Finally, the position of equi
librium of the former is always at right angles to that of the latter.
   But if the deportment of the normal paramagnetic bar be com
pared with that of the abnormal diamagnetic one, it will be found
that they are in all cases identical   ; and the same identity of deport
ment is exhibited when the abnormal paramagnetic bar is compared
with the normal diamagnetic one. The necessity of paying atten
tion to structure in experiments of this nature could not, it is ima
gined, be more strikingly exhibited.
   It is proved by   these  experiments that the simple substitution of
an attractive force for a repulsive one would completely convert the
phenomena exhibited       by paramagnetic     bodies into those exhibited
by diamagnetic ones.       That if that which Gauss    has called the ideal

                                       217
distribution  of magnetism in an iron bar be reversed, we have a
distribution which would produce the phenomena of a bismuth bar
of the same dimensions.        All the phenomena of diamagnetic bodies
become    equally intelligible     with  those   of paramagnetic   ones, when
we assume that the former class possess a polarity the same in kind,
but the opposite in direction to that of the latter.
   It is well known that a bar of iron surrounded by          a helix  in which
a voltaic current circulates is converted into a magnet, and exhibits
that twoness of action, — those phenomena of attraction and repulsion
at its two ends — to which we give the name of polarity.                      The
present paper contains an account of experiments made with the
view of ascertaining whether similar phenomena were exhibited by
a bar  of pure bismuth.      A cylinder of the latter substance,      6£ inches
long and 0-4 of an inch in diameter, was suspended by a suitable
device within a helix of covered copper wire, so that it could vibrate
freely from side to side.         The   ends   of two electro-magnetic       cores
were brought to bear upon the two ends of the bismuth bar, and it
was so arranged that the two magnetic poles acting upon the bar
might be of the same or of opposite qualities.           The helix being first
excited by a strong current, a current of considerably less power was
sent round the electro-magnetic           cores, and their action upon the
bismuth bar was observed        :  by means of a gyrotrope the current in
the helix was reversed,      and the effect of the reversion noted         ;  per
mitting the current through          the helix to flow in its last direction,
by means of a second gyrotrope, the current which excited the cores
was reversed   ; and finally, while the last magnetic polarity remained
unaltered, the direction of the current in the helix was once more
changed, and the consequent deportment of the bismuth bar was
noted.
   In making     these  experiments and exercising some judgment in
the choice of the relation between the strength of the magnets and
the strength of the current in the helix, the most complete mastery
was attained over the motions of the bar.            With   one disposition      of
the forces the ends of the bar of bismuth were promptly repelled, with
another arrangement they were just as promptly attracted.               If, when
moving towards the cores, the direction of the current in the helix
was reversed,    the motion    of the bar    was at once arrested, and attrac
tion was converted into repulsion.           If, while receding from the bar,

                                     218
 the direction of the current in the helix was changed, the recession
 was stopped and the ends of the bar were attracted.               The    same
 results were obtained when, instead of changing the direction of the
 current in the helix, the polarity of the electro-magnetic         cores was
 reversed.   When    the latter were so excited that poles       of the  same
 quality were presented to the ends of the bismuth bar, the repul
 sion of the one pole was balanced by the attraction of the other, and
 under the influence of these opposing forces the bar stood still.
    Pursuing  the  argument further,     a south pole and a north          pole
 were caused to act simultaneously       upon each end of the bismuth
 bar ; supposing one end of the latter to be repelled by a south pole,
 then, on the assumption      of diamagnetic       polarity,  the  same     end
 would be attracted by a north pole       ; and permitting      both poles to
 act upon it simultaneously     from opposite    sides,  we may anticipate
 that the force tending to turn the bar will be greater than         if only  a
 single pole were used.     To test this conclusion, four electro-mag
netic cores were made use of ; the two poles to the right of the bis
muth bar were of the same name, while the two to the left of the
bismuth bar were of an opposite quality      :  with this arrangement the
mechanical action upon the bar was greatly augmented, and the fore
going anticipation completely verified.
    The bar employed in   these   experiments is unusually large, but it
does not mark the practical    limit of success.    All the results obtained
with this bar were obtained with another solid cylinder of bismuth
14 inches long and 1 inch in diameter.         The corresponding experi
ments were made with bars of iron, and it was always found that the
arrangement of forces which caused the attraction of the ends of the
paramagnetic bar caused the repulsion of the ends of the diamagnetic
one; while the disposition which caused the repulsion of the ends
of the paramagnetic bar produced, in the most manifest manner,
the attraction of the ends of the diamagnetic one.           As regards the
abstract question of polarity,    the only difference between iron and
bismuth is the comparatively intense action of the former.             In the
case of a magnetic body, whose capacity for magnetization does not
exceed that of bismuth,     and in which coercive force is equally ab
sent, no proof can be adduced in favour of the polarity of the former
body that cannot be matched by proofs of equal value in every re
spect of the polarity of the latter.

   The objections that       have been and possibly may be used against
diamagnetic polarity, are next considered, and some observations are
made    on the constitution        of the magnetic field.       The relation of
our present knowledge of diamagnetic action to the theory of Weber,
and to Ampere's hypothesis of molecular currents is stated             ; and in
conclusion,    the author dwells briefly upon those points of diamag
netic action wherein the views of          M. Matteucci differ from his own.
   The following paper was read             : —
"On Differential Transformation and the Reversion of Serieses."
       By J. J. Sylvester, Esq., F.R.S. Received January 25,
       1855.
   With    a view to its publication      in the Proceedings of the Society,   I
take occasion to communicate the result of my investigations, as far as
they have yet extended, into the general theory of differential trans
formations, containing       a complete and general solution of the import
ant problem of expanding          a  given partial differential coefficient of a
function in respect of one system of independent variables in terms
of the partial differential coefficients thereof, in respect to a second
system of independent variables, each respectively given as explicit
functions of the first set.
   This question may         be shown to be exactly coincident        with that
of the reversion of simultaneous         serieses  proposed by Jacobi, which
may be thus stated       :   given (n + 1 ) quantities,    each   expressed by
rational infinite serieses as functions of n others      ; required to express
any one of the first set in a rational infinite         series  in terms of the
other n of the same set.          This question has only       been resolved by
Jacobi for   a particular case    ; the result hereunder given for the trans
formation of differential coefficients contains the solution of the gene
ral question.     My method of investigation is entirely different from
that adopted by the great Jacobi, and I hope in a short time to be
able to lay it in a complete form before the Society, and probably to
add  a  solution of the still more general question comprising the re
version of serieses as     a  particular case, viz. the question of express

II. " Micro-chemical      Researches on the Digestion of Starch and
      Amylaceous Foods."           By   Philip Burnard Ayres, M.D.
      Lond.     Communicated by        John Bishop, Esq., F.R.S.           Re
      ceived January 11, 1855.
   After  some general historical      remarks on the methods hitherto
employed in the investigation of the complicated phenomena of the
process of digestion,    the comparatively       small results obtained by
chemical analysis of the contents of the stomach, intestinal canal, and
of the evacuations, by Tiedemann and Gmelin, Berzelius, and others,
the author proceeded to demonstrate the necessity of a minute ex
amination of the contents of the alimentary canal by the microscope,
and such chemical tests     as we possess for the determination        of the
changes of such articles of food as exhibit definite structure.
   In order that   we may ultimately arrive at a complete exposition
of the phenomena of digestion, he is of opinion that it will be neces
sary to examine, — first, the structure       of particular   kinds of food,
then the changes produced in them by cooking, and lastly to trace
the changes they undergo at short intervals, through the alimentary
canal from the stomach to the rectum.              The results of  a series of
researches   of this character on the changes in starch, and starch-
containing foods, are presented in this memoir.
                       * An abstract is given at p. 208.
    VOl. VII.                                                    2 A

                                      226
    The method adopted for the examination of the changes in starch
and starch-foods was as follows : — An animal was kept fasting
twenty-four hours, and afterwards confined to           a   diet consisting of
the starch or amylaceous food, with water, for five or six days, until
the debris of all other kinds       of food previously taken were         cleared
from the alimentary canal.         At   a determinate    time, after a meal,
the animal was killed, the abdomen laid open as quickly as possible,
and ligatures placed at short intervals on the intestinal canal, from
the pylorus to the rectum.        The contents of the stomach and              each
portion of the intestinal canal included between the ligatures was
then carefully     examined.     This    mode   of examination       sufficed to
determine the changes which occur in the food during normal diges
tion  ; but other questions as to the particular secretion or secretions
by which the changes observed         were effected.
    The fluids poured into the alimentary canal       are five in number, —
the saliva, gastric juice, bile, pancreatic juice, and finally, the intes
tinal mucus.
    The influence of    the saliva is easily determined, by chewing the
particular food subjected to experiment, and keeping the mixture at
about 98° Fahr.       The combined action of the saliva and gastric
juice is   seen  in the contents of the stomach. To determine the
action of the bile, the common bile-duct was tied, and to ascertain
 the action of the intestinal mucus, it was necessary           to ligature the
bile and pancreatic ducts.       If  the digestion of the substance is not
effected   in the stomach, it is evident that it cannot be attributed to
 the saliva or gastric   juice ; if  the digestion is still effected       in the
intestinal canal after ligature of the bile-duct, it cannot be attributed
 to the action of the saliva, gastric juice or bile        ;  if it still go on
after ligature of the bile and pancreatic ducts, the digestive power
 must of necessity be referred to the action of the intestinal mucus,
 provided no change has previously taken place in the stomach                ;  but
 if the food  passes unchanged after      cutting off the supply of bile and
 pancreatic juice,   but proceeds     after ligature of the bile-duct alone,
 the act  of digestion must   be referred to the pancreatic juice.
    The author first briefly describes the structure of the starches and
 starch-containing    vegetables employed in his experiments          ; then the
 changes produced by cooking, and finally enters on          a minute descrip
 tion of the changes observed        in the experiments he performed on

                                        227
  normal digestion, and after cutting off the supply of bile and pan
  creatic juice.
     The correct appreciation of the structure of the starch-granule is
  of considerable importance in relation to           these  investigations, and
  the author believes that he has been         able     to afford  a satisfactory
  solution of this vexed question.        The changes observed during the
  digestion of starch favour the original opinion of Leuwenhoeck, that
 the starch-granule     consists essentially of an investing membrane          or
 cell-wall,   enclosing   an amorphous matter, the true starch, which
 strikes an intense blue colour with iodine         ;   and these changes also
 support the opinion of Professor Quekett, that the concentric circles
 seen on the starch-granules         of many plants are simple foldings of
 the investing membrane,        leaving it still doubtful, however, whether
 these concentric circles are not      in the starches     of  some plants com
 posed    of linear series of dotted elevations or depressions of the in
 vesting membrane.
     By  these experiments   it   was determined that the concentric circles
 remain after the whole of the starch matter, colourable by iodine,
 was removed, and that even then the characteristic cross and colours
 were still seen when the granules were viewed by polarized light,
 although more feebly than before         ; this result being probably due
 to the lessened power of refracting light, after the removal of the
 starch matter.
     After describing the structure of the wheat-grain and flour, the
 changes occurring in the wheat-starch during the manufacture of
 bread are given in detail    ;   but the most interesting       of the changes
 produced by cooking are those seen in the boiled or roasted potato
 and in the boiled pea.
    In  each   of these the act of cooking effects          two purposes    : — it
 causes great enlargement and physical change of the starch-granules,
 and dissolves the intimate adhesion of the starch-cells, which after
 wards appear as ovoid or globular, slightly adherent bodies distended
 by the swollen starch- granules, the outlines of which are indicated
 by more or less irregular gyrate lines, produced by the mutual com
pression of the starch-granules within an inelastic cell-membrane.
    The starch-granules     of the pea possess     a   much thicker investing
membrane than those        of the potato, which causes their outlines to
remain much more distinct after the removal of the true starch              sub
                                                                  2 a 2

                                        228
stance during the process         of digestion.    The other structures     seen
in the pea are carefully described          ; the most curious among them
being the cells composing the external layer of the testa, which
bear so strong a resemblance to columnar epithelium of the intes
tine, that they might be mistaken for the latter by an inattentive
 observer.
    The substances submitted to experiment were, — 1, boiled wheat-
starch   ; 2, wheaten bread       ;  3, uncooked tous les mois     ;  4, boiled
 tous les mois   ;  5, boiled potato    ; 6, uncooked peas   ; 7, boiled peas   ;
 8, boiled   peas   after ligature     of the bile-duct  ; 9, boiled   potatoes
 after ligature    of the bile and pancreatic ducts.        Several subsidiary
 experiments were made to determine the action of the intestinal
mucus, the saliva, and the substance of the pancreas, on starch.
    The conclusions at which the author arrives from the experiments
are, —
    1. That the starch-granule is composed of two parts, chemically
and    histologically    distinct,  —a    cell-membrane    and homogeneous
contents.     The markings       seen on many varieties      of starch   are re
ferred to folds or markings of the investing membrane.
    2.  No perceptible change occurs in the starch, whether raw or
cooked, during its sojourn in the stomach of quadrupeds or the
ventriculus    succenturiatus       and gizzard   of birds; all the granules
preserve    their perfect reaction with iodine and their pristine            ap
pearance.
    3. The conversion of boiled starch into dextrine           and glucose is
chiefly effected in the first few inches of the small intestine, but it
continues to take place in       a less degree   throughout the entire intes
tinal canal.
    4. In the digestion of boiled wheat or other starch, or of wheaten
bread, the bulk of the mass rapidly diminishes in its passage through
the small and large intestines, so that it ultimately yields only a
small quantity of faecal matter.          After being deprived of their    con
tents, the membranes of the granules shrink and shrivel up into a
minute     granular    matter, which      constitutes  the chief bulk of the
faecal evacuations after an exclusive diet        of starch food.
    5. The digestion of raw starch food (peas) in the pigeon or other
granivorous birds goes on much more slowly, and progresses pretty
equally throughout the entire intestinal canal.          The starch-granules,

                                      229
 whether free or included in cells, become intersected by radiating or
 irregular lines or fissures, more or less opaque or granular             ;   they
 also gradually    lose their characteristic    reaction with     iodine    ;  and
 this important      change,   commencing      at the   surface,     progresses
 towards the centre, until the whole of the starch matter is removed,
 leaving    the starch-membranes       often  apparently   whole, retaining
 their characteristic markings.       The fissured and granular condition
 of the starch-granules is not due to their trituration in the gizzard,
 but to the action of the intestinal fluids, since it was often seen in
 granules enclosed in and protected by perfect starch-cells.              In the
 digestion of raw starch food, a considerable quantity always escapes
 change, for many starch-cells       and granules in the      faeces   perfectly
 retain the characteristic reaction with iodine.
    6.  As the starch remains unchanged in the stomach, its conver
 sion into glucose cannot be attributed to the saliva or gastric juice,
 unless we suppose      these fluids to remain inactive     in   the   stomach,
 and suddenly to regain their activity in the first part of the small
 intestine.    The author found that the saliva was     capable    of effecting
 the  conversion of starch into glucose, but that the mixture of saliva
 and gastric juice in the stomach      did not possess that property even
after being rendered alkaline by carbonate of soda.             It is probable
that the converting power of the saliva, as it flows from the mouth,
 depends    not on the true saliva, but on the buccal mucus          ;  for Ma-
gendie found that saliva taken from the parotid duct was wholly
 inactive, while the mixed saliva from the mouth effected the conver
sion with great facility.      Unless, then, the sublingual and submax
illary glands   secrete a different fluid from the parotids,      it is evident
that the activity     of the saliva must be attributed         to the buccal
mucus.
    7. The difference between      the digestion  of boiled and raw starch
in dogs is seen in the experiments on the digestion of boiled wheat-
starch, boiled tous les mois, and bread.         In all these, some starch-
granules escape the action of heat and water, and remain in nearly
their pristine condition.     These uncooked starch-granules           undergo
slow and imperfect changes, being fissured, broken, and more or less
altered, but in general retaining       their characteristic    reaction with
iodine.
    8. The conversion of starch into glucose is not effected by the

                                           230
bile, since after ligature of the common bile-duct, the changes occur
to as great an extent as when the bile passes freely into the intes
tinal canal.
     9.   It is not   due to the pancreatic     juice, inasmuch    as after ligature
of the bile and pancreatic ducts in the same animal, the digestion of
starch is still effected.
     10.   The only remaining secretion is          the intestinal mucus, which
is especially abundant at the upper part of the intestinal canal                ; and
a further      proof is afforded of the activity of the intestinal            mucus
taken from the upper part of the duodenum above the entrance of
the pancreatic duct after ligature of this duct and the common bile-
duct, by its capability of converting a large quantity of fresh boiled
starch into glucose out of the body.
     11.    In the cooking of starch- containing         vegetables,  such as pota
 toes and peas, the adhesion         of   the starch-cells is dissolved or weak
ened so as to render them easily separable                  and amenable to the
action of the intestinal fluids.           At  the same time the starch-granules
undergo a large increase in bulk, distend the cells, and by their
mutual compression, their outlines present the appearance                  of gyrate
 lines beneath       the cell-wall.     The cells   seldom    burst so as to emit
 their contents, or present any appreciable opening through which
 the intestinal        fluids can directly      penetrate.    The author cannot
 positively affirm so much of the starch-membranes, because these
 are so extremely delicate          that fissures    might    be invisible,   but he
 believes that in a great number the membranes remain entire.
      12.   If  this be the case,       the conversion of starch matter into
 glucose must be effected           by the permeation or endosmose             of the
 intestinal      fluids   through   the invisible     pores of two      membranes,
 in the digestion of the           pea,   the potato, and other similar foods,
 and the glucose must escape                through     the same membranes         by
  exosmose.
      13.    Before the conversion of starch into glucose, the amylaceous
  matter contained in the starch is more dense than the intestinal
  mucus in immediate contact with the cells, and an inward current
  or endosmose         is established, but after that conversion the syrupy
  fluid is less dense than the mucus, and then an outward current or
  exosmose       occurs, by which the glucose escapes from the cells into
  the intestine and is absorbed.            If this be the case, as the details of

                                        231
the experiments tend strongly to prove, a new and important func
tion is assigned to the intestinal mucus.
    14.    In normal digestion, chyme        escapes  very slowly     from the
stomach into the duodenum, in small quantities, as it is detached
from the alimentary mass by the muscular movements of the stomach,
and this gradual propulsion often occupies several hours after a meal.
This slow propulsion is evidently intended to             expose   the commi
nuted food fully to the action of the intestinal juices, and produce
an intimate mixture with them.             The comparatively empty condi
tion of the        upper part of the small intestine, even during active
digestion, is thus fully explained.
     15.   If  the food be too finely divided     or incapable of     a  second
solidification in the stomach, it passes too rapidly into the first part
of the small intestine, is insufficiently         mixed with the intestinal
fluids, and a considerable part escapes           digestion.    On the other
hand,     if it  enters the small intestine in masses incapable of reduction
by the muscular action of the parts or solution in the fluid, it tra
verses the intestinal       canal  unchanged, except at the surface, which
is then alone exposed to the action of the intestinal fluids.
     16.    It is not necessary for the conversion of starch into glucose
 that the fluids in the duodenum or other parts of the intestinal
 canal should be alkaline, or even neutral, for in several of the expe
 riments the contents of every part of the alimentary canal had an
 acid reaction.
     17.    The greater part of the intestinal mucus is not excremen-
 titious, for little, if any, mucus is perceptible in the faeces in normal
 digestion, except at their surface, whereas the greater proportion of
 the contents of the small intestine consists        of mucus.      A consider
 able quantity       of mucus is   seen  in the  caecum, but  it rapidly dimi
 nishes in the colon, and is scarcely detectible in the          faeces,  except
 that on the surface, which is probably derived from the mucous
 membrane of the rectum.            The author raises the question, whether
 one   of the chief functions of the caecum is not to effect the conver
 sion of the intestinal       mucus into some other substance capable of
 re-entering the blood, and performing          some ulterior   purpose in the
 animal economy.
      18.   In normal digestion,    the separation  of the epithelium of the
  mucous membrane of the intestine is the exception instead of the rule,

                                        232
 as stated by some physiologists.          The author questions the theory of
 the detachment of the epithelium of the villi in each act of absorp
 tion, on the grounds that the presence            of detached epithelium was
 unfrequent in the whole course of his experiments              ; that epithelium
 is readily detached by manipulation          ;  that the continual      reproduc
 tion of such  a vast  amount of cell-tissue must necessarily be accom
 panied by  a  vast expenditure of vital force          ;  and finally, that it is
 not necessary, because fluids readily penetrate epithelial membranes.
    19.  The  passage   of  a  given food through the whole length of the
 intestinal canal may occupy a comparatively short time, especially
 when the animal is fasting.           In  one experiment, where a pigeon
 refused food until the     faeces  contained no visible debris of previous
 food, starch- granules were detected        in the    faeces  within two hours
 after a meal, and this although         the intestine of this animal is ex
tremely narrow and about          a yard in length.
    20.  A remarkable circumstance in the digestion of starch or
starch foods is the constant presence          of myriads of vibriones in the
lower part of the intestinal canal.         They    are generally first observed
 in the lower part of the small intestine, as minute brilliant points,
just visible with     a    power of      600    diameters,     in   active  move
ment.     They increase in numbers towards             the   caecum,   in which  a
large    number   of fully- developed       vibriones     are   constantly   seen.
These minute organisms increase in size and length in the colon
and rectum, and their fissiparous mode of propagation, first described
                         '
by the author in the Quarterly Journal of Microscopical                  Science,'
may be distinctly traced by examining              the  contents of these por
tions of the intestine.

A paper was in part read, entitled " An Account of some recent
      Researches near Cairo, undertaken with the view of throw
      ing light upon the Geological History of the Alluvial Land
      of Egypt." — Part First.         By Leonard        Horner, Esq.,

            THOMAS BELL, Esq., V.P., in              the Chair.
   Edward    John Littleton, Baron Hatherton, was balloted for and
duly elected a Fellow of the Society.
   The following communications          were read  : —
I. The reading of Mr. Horner's paper was resumed and con
      cluded.
   The author     commences   by observing, that although it be highly
improbable that we can ever form an appropriate estimate in years
of the age even of the most modern strata, we are not cut off
from all hope of being able to assign an amount in years to the
duration of some of the great geological changes which,          in past
ages,  the present surface of the earth has       undergone, by causes
that are still in operation    ; especially by a careful study of the
formation    of  the deltas of great rivers, and of the action of the
latter on the rocks and soils they traverse in their course.         If in
a country   in which   a certain alteration in the land has occurred, we
know that such alteration has taken place in part within historical
time, and  if  the entire change under consideration presents through

                                        234
out a tolerable        uniformity    of character,      we   may be justified    in
holding the portion that has taken place within the historical period
to afford a measure        of the time occupied in the production of the
antecedent part of the same change.
    Egypt supplies      us  with the earliest evidence of the existence of
the human race recorded in works of art             ; in its monuments we find
the dawn of the historical period and            of civilization  ;  and that land
alone, of all parts of the world as yet known to us, offers an instance
of  a great geological      change that has been in progress throughout
the whole of the historical period,         in its annual inundations and the
sediment these deposit to form the alluvial land in the valley of the
Nile    ; and there is good reason for believing that the change had
been going on with the same uniformity              for ages prior to that period
when our reckoning          of historical   time begins.       To investigate the
formation of the alluvial land in the valley of the Nile in Upper and
Lower Egypt is therefore an object of the highest interest to the
geologist and the historian.
    The author being impressed with the conviction                that this geolo
 gical problem could only be solved by having shafts and borings
 made     in the alluvial    soil to the greatest practicable depths, deter
 mined to have some such experiments made                  ; as the results  might
lead the way to other researches          on  a greater scale.      The ground on
 which he hoped to be able to form a              chronometric scale by which
 the total depth of sediment reached might be measured, was the
 same as that on      which the French engineers in 1800 had proceeded,
viz. the accumulation of Nile sediment around monuments of a
 known age.        If that depth of sediment be divided by the number of
 centuries that have elapsed since the date of the erection of the mo
 nument, we obtain a scale of the secular increase of which the base
 of the monument is zero, assuming that the average increase from
 century to century has been uniform within an area of some extent.
 Then if the excavation        be continued     below the base stone, and the
 sediment passed       through exhibits similar characters as to composi
 tion with that above the base line of the monument, it would be fair
 to apply the same graduation below the zero-point of the scale as
 above    it, and, if we reached     so far, we should be able to estimate the
 time that has elapsed since the first layer of sediment was deposited
 on the rock forming the channel over which the water spread when
 it first flowed northward        from its sources in the interior of Africa,

                                      235
subject however to correction for causes that might make a differ
ence in the rate    of increase between the earlier and later periods.
    The author submitted his scheme to the President and Council of
the Royal Society, who encouraged his proceeding by acceding to
his request of a grant from the Donation Fund at their disposal, to
wards the expenses of the researches.
    The author introduces his subject by         a sketch of the physical
geography and geology of Egypt, a description of the annual inun
dations, and of the sediment deposited from the water of the Nile.
    Egypt   is separated   from Nubia by a low hilly region, about fifty
miles broad from north to south, chiefly composed of granitic rocks,
but associated with two kinds of sandstone, the one belonging to
the cretaceous series, the other of the newer tertiary          age.     The
valley of Upper Egypt is bounded by two ranges of hills running
northward, the Arabian range on the right, the Libyan on the left
of the river, both alike composed of sandstones and limestone.           The
 cretaceous sandstone extends from the granitic rocks forming the
 first cataract at Assouan for about eighty-five miles, where it is
 covered   by a limestone which has the characters of the upper chalk
 of Europe.      This chalk continues on both       sides of the valley for
 about 130 miles, when it is covered in its turn by a tertiary num-
 mulite limestone, and of which the further prolongation northward
 of both ranges is composed        ; this nummulite limestone can be well
 studied in the extensive quarries of Gebel Mokattam above Cairo,
     The author briefly describes the operations of the private associa
 tion of English, French, and Austrian Engineers in 1846—47, com
 monly called the French Brigade, for the purpose of determining the
  disputed question of the relative levels of the Red Sea and Medi
  terranean.    The French engineers, at the beginning of the present
  century, had come to the conclusion that the Red Sea was about 30
  feet above   the Mediterranean,      but the observations of  Mr. Robert
  Stephenson, the English engineer, at Suez, of           M. Negretti,    the
  Austrian, at Tineh near the ancient Pelusium, and the levellings of
  Messrs. Talabot, Bourdaloue and their assistants, between the two
  seas, have proved that the low-water mark of ordinary tides at Suez
  and Tineh is very nearly on the same level, the difference being,
   that at Suez it is rather more than one inch lower.
     At the island of    Philae, about five miles above Assouan, may pro
   perly be placed the first entrance of the Nile into Egypt.      It is here

                                                236
 about two miles broad, but is soon after divided into several branches
by the rocks that rise up in its bed to form the rapids, commonly
called the First Cataract, which have a descent of about 85 feet in a
distance of five miles.               Here the river is contracted to about a third
 of a mile.         Assouan is about 300 feet above Cairo, and the distance
between the two places being 556 miles, the average                                       fall of the
river is little more             than half a foot in a mile, 0-54, and Assouan
being 365 feet above the Mediterranean,                           and 696 miles distant from
 it,   the average fall of the Nile from the foot of the First Cataract to
the sea       is   0-525 in   a   mile.     Low Nile         at Cairo      is    43 feet 65 inches
(as measured by the French Brigade                     in 1847)       above          low- water mark
in the Mediterranean,                and the distance being 149 miles, the average
fall    is   little more than 3£ inches in           a   mile.       The author cites           a re
port of Mr. Rennie to the British Association in 1834, showing that
the fall of the Thames, between Chertsey and Teddington                                     Lock,    is
nearly 17£ inches in mile.       a
  The commencement of the annual inundation                                     is   about the sum
mer solstice.             The rise   is   scarcely perceptible for six or eight days,
it     then becomes         more rapid, and about the middle of August has
usually reached one-half of the greatest amount                        ;   it    attains its maxi
mum towards the end of September, remains pretty stationary for
about fourteen days, and then begins to fall, at first at more                              a
rapid rate than that with which                 it   rose,    but after         it   has fallen one-
half the      decrease      is   very gradual, and           it   goes on sinking          until the
end of May.            The rise continues about                   90 days,       the falling lasts
250.         In   1846,    Mougel Bey, the French engineer of the Barrage
near Cairo, found the maximum rise 7'20 metres, or 30 feet 10
inches.
     When the inundations commence, the Nile                          is   of   a    reddish colour,
and     is   loaded with sand and mud.                 From the fall between the Se
cond Cataract at Wadi Ha1fa and the First, a distance of 214 miles,
being not more on an average                   than    9     inches in      a    mile, very little
coarse       gravel can be transported               by the river into Egypt.                   The
greater portion of the heavier detritus falls down in the higher parts
of Upper Egypt, and from the very gentle slope of the Delta, only                                    a
small amount of the solid matter suspended in the water can reach
the sea; still, however, the sea has been observed                              to be turbid    at   a
distance of forty miles from the mouths of the Nile.
  The author then proceeds to                  describe      the recent researches.              His

                                       237
first and indispensable step was to procure the aid of           a competent
person    to conduct his projected operations, and he was fortunate in
obtaining the active and intelligent        aid of an Armenian gentleman,
 educated and long resident in England, Hekekyan Bey, a civil engi
 neer, who had occupied         some  important positions in the service     of
the    Viceroy Mehemet AH, especially as chief of the Polytechnic
 School in Cairo.        But nothing could be done without the consent
of the then Viceroy Abbas Pacha, more             especially as the spot the
author had selected for his first operations was in a garden of the
 Pacha. By the active intervention of Her Majesty's Consul- General
 in Egypt, the Honourable Charles Augustus           Murray, not only was
 the  Viceroy's consent obtained, but his Highness was pleased to
direct his ministers to place at the disposal of Hekekyan Bey what
 ever was necessary       to conduct the operations in the most complete
manner     ;  and,  with truly royal munificence, ordered that the whole
expense      of them should be defrayed by his Treasury.          The author
never contemplated having the means           of making  these researches   on
more than a very limited scale,        but he had now the prospect, and it
has since been realized, of their being conducted on a very enlarged
plan.
    It has been often a subject      of regret that experiments of this na
ture, of which the French had set an example half a century ago,
had not been followed up.          On this subject the author remarks, that
the operations are       of a nature that scarcely any individual    traveller
could undertake       ; for they require a large body    of men, some prac
tised in the art of surveying, and as they can only be carried on con
tinuously after the inundation        waters have subsided for some time,
and therefore at a season         of the year when the heat is excessive,
those only inured to the climate could stand the work.
    The    place   selected for commencing the operations was at the
Obelisk of Heliopolis, about six miles below Cairo, the oldest known          ;
erected, according to Lepsius,         2300 years before Christ.     The au
thor having given Hekekyan           Bey full and minute directions as to
the manner in which the researches           were to be carried on, the ob
servations to be made,         the plans and reports to be drawn up, and
the specimens of soils sunk through          to be selected, the operations
commenced in June 1851.              Sixty men   were employed under the
direction of Hekekyan Bey, assisted by an officer of Artillery, and
some young engineers from the Polytechnic           School in Cairo.

                                     238
   Nine pits or excavations were sunk at different distances around
the obelisk, each down to the level of the filtration water from the
Nile at that  season, and as much under the surface        of that water as
was practicable.      The most important of these was one close to the
obelisk.   The upper surface of the pedestal on which the obelisk
rests, was reached at the depth     of 5 feet 6 inches below the surface
of the ground, Nile mud being accumulated to that height ; the
pedestal was 6 feet 1 0 inches in height, and it was found resting on
two limestone flags, the upper 16 inches, the lower            15 inches in
thickness, and this foundation was laid upon pure quartzose sand.
This last was penetrated to the depth of       3 feet '2j inches below the
lower layer of limestone.
   The author gives a section and description of each of the nine
excavations. But before doing so, he states that he obtained twenty .
eight specimens     of soils sunk through in different parts of the Nile
Valley, eleven    of which were carefully analysed at the Royal College
of Chemistry, under the superintendence of Dr. Hofmann.              A col
lection of specimens, duplicates of which are in the possession          of
Hekekyan Bey, serve as       a standard for the description in his reports
of the soils passed through, to avoid the necessity of sending speci
mens of identical alluvia.      These samples were carefully compared
with   the  specimens     analysed, and were found to resemble them
closely in external characters.
   The results of the analyses are given by the author, and the
average of eight specimens of Nile mud gives the following com
position in 100 parts   : —
              Silica                                  54-585
              Sesquioxide of iron                     20-215
              Sesquioxide of alumina                    6-418
              Alumina                                   5-237

In order to ascertain the amount of solid matter held in suspension
in the water of the Nile near Cairo, the author described to Dr. Ab
bott, a resident in that city, the method he had followed         in 1832 to
determine the amount of solid matter suspended in the water of the
Rhine at Bonn, and requested       him to undertake the experiment on
the same plan, which he did, and the result gave        1 10-6 grains    in an
imperial gallon.     The residuum sent was analysed at       the  Royal Col
lege  of Chemistry, and yielded very nearly the    same result as to com
position as the above average analysis of the Nile sediment.
   On examining the descriptions of the soils sunk through in the
nine excavations at Heliopolis, it appears that they consist of two
principal kinds, viz. earths and sands.    The earths vary in colour, but
are so nearly    allied, passing by such insensible       shades   into each
other, and having so great a resemblance to the modern Nile sedi
ment, that they may all be classed        as Nile mud.       The   sands    are
almost entirely pure quartz, similar to those of the adjoining deserts.
   In the  same horizontal   plane, even in this limited space of half a
square mile, there is a very considerable difference       in the nature of
the soil, and  in none of the excavations was there an instance of
lamination in the deposit.
   When it is considered how small is the amount of sediment left
annually by the inundations      in any  one place,  it is very difficult to
conceive, in the author's opinion,     how there should be in any one
spot so great a thickness as 12£ feet     of  one kind of sediment,       as is
the case  in one of the excavations, without any lamination or other
sign of successive deposition, and still more inconceivable that in
pits within a very short distance of each other different kinds of soil
should be found at the same levels.         Other  causes    than the tran
quil deposit from inundation water must have        been at work       in   the
formation of this portion of the alluvial land.        The layers of      sand
were most likely blown across the valley from the desert.
   The author    deems   it advisable to abstain from general remarks,
and from all inferences as to the secular increase of the alluvial de
posits, until he has had an opportunity of laying before the Society
an account of the far more extensive researches       made    in the district
of Memphis     in 1852, and during the last year in a series of pits
sunk in a line across the valley of the Nile, extending from the
Libyan to the Arabian Chain, in the parallel of Heliopolis.

      In the various excavations that          have been   made   in the prosecu
  tion of this inquiry,      many objects of art of historical interest have
 been     discovered   ;  but as these do not come within the province of
  the Royal Society, the author proposes to give an account of them
 in   a memoir to be laid before another learned body.

 II. "On        the Computation of the Effect of the Attraction                 of
         Mountain-masses,         as  disturbing the apparent astronomical
         latitude of stations        in Geodetic      Surveys."     By George
         B. Airy, Esq., F.R.S.,             Astronomer       Royal.     Received
         January 25, 1855.
     The author commences with remarking that his surprise had been
 excited by the result obtained by Archdeacon Pratt*, namely, that
 the computed attraction of the elevated country north-east of India
 considerably exceeds the disturbance which it was sought to explain.
 But    on consideration the author perceived that this result might have
 been    anticipated, on the extensively received          supposition that the
interior of the earth is a dense fluid or semi-fluid (which for conve
nience he calls lava), and that the exterior crust floats upon it.           For,
he remarks, this crust cannot be supposed            at any part to be very high
upwards (as in mountains), at least to any great horizontal extent,
unless there is a corresponding projection downwards into the lava.
Upon making a numerical calculation, even with the crust 1 00 miles
thick, it was shown that there would be such a tendency of the
table-land to crack and sink in the middle as no cohesion of rocks
can resist.       He conceives that the      state  of the ground may be pro
perly illustrated by a       raft of timber floating on water: if one piece
of timber projects higher into air than the others, we                are certain
that it also projects lower into water than the others.                Assuming
this as established, then it is evident that the horizontal attraction
of   a mountain-mass on a point at          a  considerable distance is nearly
evanescent,      because   the increase of attraction of the part which is

                                             241
 above the     general level is sensibly neutralized              by the deficiency of
 attraction below it where the lighter crust displaces the heavier lava.
 In like manner, the horizontal attraction of                  a ship or other floating
 body is nothing.         But the horizontal attraction upon a near point
 on the   earth's surface will not vanish, because the mountain which
 produces the positive attraction is nearer than the lava-displacement
 which produces the negative attraction                 :   even   here,   however, the
 efficient disturbing attraction will be much less than that computed
 by considering the dimensions             of the mountain only.

     My attention having        been called within the last two or three days,
to an error        in   my paper         on the     Anatomy      of the Brachiopoda,
 published in No. 5 of the Royal Society's Proceedings,                       I beg to   be
allowed to take the earliest opportunity of correcting it.                      At p.  Ill
of that paper the following paragraph will be found : —

    I presume that my recollection               of  M. Vogt's figures was            more
vivid than that of his text        ;   for having been unable, notwithstanding
repeated endeavours, to re-obtain the memoir when writing my paper,

 I felt justified in trusting to what   seemed my very distinct recollection
 of its sense.     I had the less hesitation in doing this, as in M. Vogt's
                              '
 subsequently published         Zoologische Briefe *,' he gives the received

 interpretation to the parts of the so-called            hearts' without any in
 dication of a change of opinion.
     I make this statement in explanation of what might otherwise
 seem to be great carelessness         on my part, and for the purpose of
 further pointing     out that M. Vogt not having made the supposed
 discovery, it is quite impossible that Professor Owen's                researches
 should have been suggested by it.

I. " On     the Temperature       and Density    of the Seas between South
        ampton and Bombay via the Mediterranean and Red Seas."
        By    MM. Adolphe, Hermann, and Robert Schlagint-
        weit.     Communicated by the Court of Directors of the
        Honourable East India Company.                 Presented    by Professor
        Stokes, Sec. R.S.          Received January         11, 1855.
    In this communication       the authors give the results      of the observa
tions they had made during their voyage, relative to the temperature
and specific gravity of the sea-water, both near the surface and at
depths ranging from about 18 to 30 metres, the latter being nearly

the greatest depth which the motion             of  the vessel  permitted them
to reach.     They   reserve for a future report their observations on the
temperature and moisture of the air, as well as the results of two
experiments on the quantity of carbonic acid contained in the air on
the Mediterranean       and Red Seas.
    The instruments      employed       in the observations      here   described
were as   follows : —
    (1.) Four thermometers which            had been carefully compared at
the  Kew Observatory previous to           the authors' departure.      At Bom
bay they repeated the        determination      of the zero-point     and of an
other standard      point,   and found that the thermometers had not
varied.
    (2.) A dipping apparatus constructed by Mr. Adie.                 This appa
ratus,   which  held 5 or     6  litres, was furnished with two valves,         so
arranged that as it descended           the water passed freely through, but
as  soon as a commencement was made of drawing it up the valves
closed and rendered       it water-tight.      The authors assured themselves
that the temperature of the enclosed water did not sensibly change
during the process of drawing it up.
    (3.)  An areometer from Mr. T. G. Greiner              at  Berlin.   This in
strument     permitted     the specific gravity      to be read off directly to
three places of decimals, and the fourth could be supplied by estima
 tion.
    To render the observations of specific gravity comparable with one
 another, it was necessary to reduce them to a common temperature,
which occasioned some difficulty,            as the exact expansion       of sea-
 water between the limits 20° and 25° C. was not accurately known.
 By means of a delicate voluminometer, constructed               for the purpose
by   M. Geissler of Berlin,     the authors determined the expansion to be
0 000271 for 1°   C. For distilled water Halstrom          had found 0 000219.
 Another set of more direct experiments,             made  at Bombay, gave for
 the expansion   of sea-water 0-0O0337.            The difference between this
 value and the preceding the authors refer to a change              of volume of
 the voluminometer itself, and they prefer the latter, which              accord
 ingly they use in their reductions.
    The authors then give tables of          the results of their observations,
 which are followed by some general remarks.
                                                                   2 b 2

         From lat. 46° to 41° N                    17°-  5 to 18°-5 C.
         From lat. 39° to 37°                      20°     to 21°    C.
         Mean specific gravity reduced to 17°-5         C.= l-0277.
   The temperature and       specific  gravity showed very little variation
in the open sea, so long as no currents were met with, but in the
vicinity  of land, disturbances of various kinds were noticed.               In
harbours and in small bays the temperature of the water was found
to diminish sensibly at    a  depth of from    15 to   20 metres, but in the
open   sea the temperature      at the very surface      was generally found
 somewhat lower than at      a depth of 30 metres, which no doubt was
 due to evaporation.
   Straits of Gibraltar. — A current with         a mean     velocity of from
three to six miles an hour usually flows through the Straits from the
Atlantic into   the Mediterranean.       A counter current is supposed to
exist underneath,    but the great depth of the Straits prevented the
authors from reaching any such current with their dipping                 appa
ratus.
   East of the Straits    the water of the Atlantic was met with in
several places, in close proximity      with water of the Mediterranean,
from which it was distinguished by its temperature and colour.             The
stream from the    Atlantic on passing    the Straits seems to divide itself
into several branches.
   In connexion with the variability of the currents in the Straits, it
is worthy of remark that the unreduced specific gravity of the water
of the Mediterranean and of the Atlantic is nearly the same.

be detected     half  a degree north     of the Straits.      After  some further
remarks about this current, the authors pass on to the

   The President then addressed     the Society as follows     : —
       Gentlemen,
When we met last November, I ventured            to remark that the objects
of science were better understood than they had been formerly, and
that accurate notions    on scientific      subjects were becoming more
prevalent  : the progress in that direction has still continued, and
during the last year it has been even more decided than before.
   With the spread of knowledge, the great body of the community
are now better enabled to appreciate the importance of science in
promoting the moral and physical improvement of mankind             ; there
is consequently a growing    desire    that science should be advanced,
and as that object has been best effected by scientific societies, they
are regarded   with more interest.       Public opinion having taken that
direction decidedly, it was not unreasonable to expect that Govern
ment would feel anxious to meet the wishes of the scientific bodies,
and provide them   with  a building where they would         be enabled to

                                     249
employ to the best advantage the machinery of association, which
had already effected so much.        It is probable, therefore, that before
very long you will have      the important question to decide, — whether
to retain your present apartments, or to accept           a  suitable place in
a   new   building.   Throughout all the communications                  with the
Government, your officers have taken especial care to be perfectly
explicit on two points   :  one,  that till the plans were prepared, any
final decision on your part was impossible        ; the other, that you had
a free option to retain your present apartments should you think
fit, having received them as a grant, to endure so long as the
Society should exist.      There can now,      I think,  be   little doubt but
that the leading Scientific      Societies will be suitably provided for,
and that you    will have the opportunity      of taking your proper place
at the head of science,    with the other Societies by your side.
    The pursuit of science will thus      be  greatly facilitated    ;  it will  be
rendered more convenient, and therefore more attractive             ;  and many
will  devote themselves    to it who perhaps otherwise would not have
entered upon it at all.
    While, however, the Government is wisely anxious              to encourage
the active pursuit    of science   by meeting the wishes of the great
body of scientific   men, we perhaps may have it in our power to
effect something in the same direction.
    From various observations of my late lamented predecessor in his
Addresses, it was evidently his opinion that we should act wisely in
shaping our rules so as to adapt them to the varying usages                       of
society, rather than to preserve       everything unchanged, relying on
the sanction of a long prescription.       In former  times, November was
the height of the London       season,   and the Anniversary,        with all its
preliminary business, was naturally held then, because                the largest
number of Fellows were in town.             Whether for    the better or not,
the season has been     changed, and it is now six months later; we,
however, remain where we were.              The Council     meets      the latter
end   of October, and continues its meetings through November                ;  the
principal   business being to award the medals,           and    to select the
Officers and    Council  to be recommended to the            Society at large
for election.    The November business is wound up by the Anniver
sary, the  most important meeting of the Society.          The Fellows who
are not permanent residents in London           are naturally absent in the
                                                                 2 c 2

                                            250
country    :  the great business of the year, with all its responsibilities,
devolves     therefore upon a section of the Society.               A country gentle
man,    if named upon the Council,                cannot conveniently           attend in
November, and but few country gentlemen attend the anniversary*.
Our proceedings        are therefore not of as much interest to the Fellows
taken as a whole as they might be made to be, and they are not
calculated to attract the men who, having attained high scientific
distinction at the Universities,           reside in the country, unharassed by
professional calls, and who have therefore both training and leisure,
important elements of success in all scientific pursuits.
    The award of the         medals      at a time when so many              Fellows   are
absent is also attended with inconvenience                ;  for although an attempt
is made to secure for each science               a kind of representation in the
Council, still so wide is the range of science now, that special de
partments are often necessarily unrepresented.                        In disposing of
papers, the imperfect representation                of individual       sciences is un
attended with inconvenience,              because    each paper is referred to two
Fellows to report upon          ;   the Council     thus calls the whole Society
to its aid, and the result,          I believe, is perfectly satisfactory.            With
the medals it is otherwise           ; no official reference is made to Fellows
not on the Council.           There is     a  further    difficulty.      The questions
which usually arise are of this nature.               Discoveries have been made
by different individuals          in various sciences.          Who     has added most
to the general stock of knowledge by               a  positive contribution        ?  Who
has the merit of having effected discoveries of most promise                        ?  Re
collect, that in answering these questions some estimate must be
made of the weight due             to each science,       for they cannot be consi
dered all alike      ;  very far from it.            Some sciences require great
mental labour, guided by faculties of a very high order, — a rare
gift; while other        sciences      can   be cultivated       successfully by com
mon-place       men,    with only        a moderate amount            of   perseverance.
That such       an estimate can be made,              and which       carries with it a
kind of general assent, is evidenced by the fact that it is annually
made, to some extent, at the examination for the                     Fellowship in      the
 University of Dublin, which bears a certain loose but not uninstruc-
    * At the last Anniversary the Fellows who voted amounted             to 63, while there
 are about 700 Fellows.     I  am informed,     however,    that  usually several who are
actually present do not vote.

                                           251
tive analogy     to the process         by which      your      Council    awards the
medals.    That examination is            the most difficult which exists            ;  the
prize is large, and the competition is free.                    There is   a course       of
mathematics, comprehending,              I may say, everything          ;  a course of
physics equally large       ; a   very large course of moral philosophy                     ;
a  course of metaphysics, of logic, classics, history, chronology, and
Hebrew.      The examination         is,   of course, public       ; and a person of
experience, acquainted with the course, can usually at the close
of the examination         point    out the successful            candidate.         Some
have   answered better in one science, some in another, but acting
under the guidance of a mature judgment,                   a kind    of equitable       ad
justment has been made by the bystander, which has led him to the
same conclusion       as the examiners.           Now, let      us see for a moment
how this has been brought about.               The examiners, who          are   Fellows,
 are conversant to a certain          extent with all the sciences             ;   and    in
 measuring the value of       each      answer, they are governed by a well-
marked public opinion         in   the University,        precisely as is the case
with the enlightened audience             ;  and they come to the same                 con
clusion.    But with your Council the               case is necessarily very            dif
ferent.   However       chosen, they cannot have within themselves                      the
same    means    of discharging their very difficult duties in                     a   way
which will carry with it the full concurrence of the Society.                        Take
as an example        the  simplest case which            can     arise:   two persons
have been    proposed for the medal, a chemist and a mathematician.
Upon the Council we will presume there is a first-rate chemist
and a first-rate mathematician.              Now, in chemistry and in mathe
matics, and indeed in all the sciences,                little discoveries        are very
abundant.      By what possible             means    can    the chemist bring            his
mind to bear upon the little discoveries of the mathematician, so as
to weigh them, even in the roughest manner, against the discoveries
in his own   science    ?  Or will the mathematician               be more fortunate
in dealing with     the discoveries       of the chemist      ?   But how is it with
respect to the other members           of the Council       ?    There will probably
be   gentlemen     representing      the     different   branches of the natural
sciences, also perhaps a geologist, an astronomer, an engineer.                      Why,
even in the very simple case           I  have supposed, the elements for the
roughest approximation          to   a   true conclusion         are not    within      the
Council,   and it cannot be otherwise.               The Council must therefore

                                         252
travel beyond its limits for the necessary            information.       Individual
members will naturally therefore, in an unofficial way, consult such
Fellows not on the Council as are known to be conversant with the
particular question at issue      ;   and, practically,   if time permitted     and
opportunity offered,       a large proportion    of  the ablest Fellows       would
exercise     a guiding influence on the Council, leading them to correct
conclusions.        Information   would even be sought without             the   So
ciety   ;  the prevalent opinions at the Universities would be looked
for, and the state        of public opinion abroad in scientific             circles
would in many cases have great weight.                  I need    hardly say, that
 as things are at present, this        inquiry is impossible except to       a very
limited extent, and public opinion, even in our own body, can afford
 but little of that aid to the Council which it would do under more
 favourable circumstances.
    If   the medals were      awarded in June, after discussion in several
 successive     Councils   at considerable intervals, while the great body
 of Fellows,      the leading members       of the Universities,        and the fo
 reigners who visit       London,      were in town,       each    member of the
 Council would have immediate access to the best sources of infor
 mation.       Recently    the   experiment has      been     tried   of proposing
 candidates for the medals before the recess,               but without,    I think,
 any practical advantage.             Where the candidates          are  numerous,
 inquiries would be endless         ;  and it is only when the number has
 been     reduced, when the doubtful questions have been put promi
 nently forward by discussion, and a decision is imminent, that in
 quiries will be prosecuted with energy, and can                    be   made   with
 effect.
    Finally, experience has shown that even in the transaction of the
 business of the nation, there is so much inconvenience in running
 counter to the habits and usages of society, that it is only in a case
 of necessity that Parliament is assembled in November.
    With     these or similar views, the subject was brought before your
 Council in      1 845 ; and, as was announced by Lord Northampton,                it
 was resolved to change the day of the anniversary to a season more
 generally convenient.         In his Address the year after         he states that
 doubts had arisen as to the legality of the change without a new
 charter, and no serious effort appears           to have      been    subsequently
 made to surmount the difficulty.

                                          253
    I believe it is well known         that Sir Humphry Davy's opinions on
this subject were very similar to Lord Northampton's,                    and    I  have
heard that he had deliberately committed them to paper, setting out
fully his views      as to the   prospects of science        in this country, and
the position       the Royal Society        should hold.        Such   a   document
would be of great value, and            I  have    anxiously inquired for it, but
in vain.
    This was      the state of things at the time of my election            as Presi
dent, and after full consideration I took the first opportunity, at the
anniversary in 1849, of expressing my entire concurrence in the views
of Lord Northampton.            It   appeared     to   me,  however,    to be quite
evident that there was not a strong and universal desire to change
the day of the anniversary         ;  and that was to be expected.               There
are certain associations, hallowed by time, to which we all recur with
pleasure    :   when we meet on the 30th of November, our thoughts
 are led back to the         auspicious day when the Royal              Society was
 founded   :    we are reminded of Boyle, Wren, Hooke and Wallis, the
 first Fellows, and feel a just pride that we enjoy the high honour of
 being their successors.         Few, perhaps, would         assent   without      some
 degree   of reluctance      to a change which would           sever  these   ancient
 associations.       Feeling assured, therefore, that           there  were    various
 shades of opinion, and having stated my views distinctly                 in my first
 address,     I  did not conceive it to be my duty to proceed                 further.
 The next      step would have been, to have directed the attention               of the
 Council to its former decision as to the expediency of changing                     the
 anniversary, and to have obtained the best advice as to the means
 to be taken to effect        that object.       I   thought it better to let the
 matter rest for      a time.  Had I    thought otherwise, there was certainly
 no one by whom such a question could have been brought forward
 with less       propriety,  or less advantage, than your President.                 He
  could not have recommended his arguments as springing                      from an
 unbiassed mind, when he was in the position, not a very agreeable
 one,   of being necessarily         absent    during    the  autumn and winter,
  when there was so much business of importance.                    Now   the case is
 different.      There is no longer any reason for reserve, and in express
 ing in my last address the same opinions as in my first address,                       I
 have ventured to express           them more        strongly, because    experience
 has more      fully confirmed them.         If we are to distribute medals, it is

                                        254
 surely important that the award of the medals, like the award of the
 Fellowships   in the University       of Dublin, should carry with it the
full approbation of the whole Society.          If we are to have meetings to
 transact business, it is of the highest importance to make them
 easily accessible to all Fellows by the choice of a suitable season,
 so that every person, whether on the Council or not, might have the
opportunity    of exercising     his privileges with the least amount of
personal inconvenience.       It  is in this way we shall render the       Royal
 Society even more popular than it is, and hasten                its growth in
strength and influence, so that it will become, not the Royal Society
of London merely, but the Royal Society of the whole kingdom.
    I  have thus ventured to suggest certain changes as to the time
and manner of transacting the business of the Royal Society                 : the
objects we have in view would,             I think, be much promoted by
another innovation, which it requires some courage to propose.                  I
mean a large increase in the number of the Council.               From what     I
have observed,    I  am convinced that to enable the Council to exercise
an effectual supervision over all the sciences,       it is necessary   to make
ample room, so that each science should be fully represented.             There
is another object perhaps of even greater importance to be attained
by the same means, an effectual representation of all classes upon the
Council, so that men of general attainments should have their place,
and the government         of the Society should not           be   exclusively
entrusted to men, who, however eminent in especial branches of
science, may not be always the most conversant with worldly affairs,
or the most competent to transact that common-place business, upon
which, in the main, the prosperity of Societies depends               : nothing
would do more than such a change, to promote harmony and good
feeling within our walls    ; nothing would contribute more to increase
the influence of the Royal Society in advancing the general interests
of science.
    I have already ventured to say, that      I  had little doubt but that the
memorial with its two hundred signatures in favour of juxtaposition,
backed up by public opinion, would produce the desired result, and
that before long we should see the leading scientific Societies under
the same roof.      I think I cannot now err in expressing          a confident
belief, that whatever changes may be required in our Society to
meet    the just wishes of scientific men,         will  be carried out with

                                        255
readiness.     The progress of      science  will thus  be promoted, and this
 country will gradually attain even a higher place in European science
 than that which it at present holds.       There is a new quarter, however,
to which science may       I think look hopefully, and that is the Univer
sity of Oxford.      Last   session  an act was passed for effecting certain
improvements in the University          of Oxford.     Under that act   a com
mission was appointed, consisting            of men of learning       and   high
station, to advise     and cooperate      with the governing body, and so
effect such changes as might be useful.            At present it   can scarcely
be said    that science at Oxford receives        any substantial encourage
ment.     The fellowships      are for the most     part close, and therefore
are not necessarily the rewards       of learning;  and where they are open,
the success of the candidate depends upon his proficiency in the an
cient languages and literature.          Honours are indeed awarded to the
mathematical and physical sciences,           but they carry with them no
emoluments      ;  and without      any knowledge       of  the   mathematical
sciences except the elements of plane geometry, and without any
knowledge whatever of the physical sciences, the highest University
honours may be obtained.           A  man therefore, after having very cre
ditably passed a public school, and having taken his degree with a
first class in Uteris humanioribus,        may find that he knows no more
than was known 1800 years ago.               He may    be ignorant   of physics
in its most elementary form, and may therefore be incapable of com
prehending the first principles of machinery and manufactures, or of
forming   a just and enlarged conception of the resources of this great
country.     That the legislation of last session should long continue
unfruitful,  I  think,  is improbable, and the time seems to be at hand
when the cultivation of the physical sciences          will receive a new im
pulse at our universities, and when the great resources              of Oxford
will, in part, be applied as the rewards of scientific eminence.
    You are all, Gentlemen, no doubt aware, that in 1823                    your
Council, at the request of the Lords of the Treasury, appointed a
Committee to report upon          Mr. Babbage's plan for the construction
of  a Calculating Machine, which        he called a Difference Engine.      The
Committee,     I  need   hardly say, was composed of men eminent for
their theoretical and practical acquaintance with such subjects           :  that
Committee      recommended        the   Lords   of the Treasury to assist
Mr. Babbage in carrying out his undertaking.                The Lords of the

                                        256
Treasury acquiesced, and the work was proceeded with; Mr.Babbage
exercising a constant and vigilant           superintendence, furnishing        the
designs, making the computations,             in fact supplying all      the theo
retical requirements,       while the Government          supplied the manual
labour and raw materials.        In   the then backward state        of mechanical
engineering, great difficulties were encountered;             at length in 1828
the    Royal Society was again consulted by Government, and the
result was a report from a Committee, to the effect that satisfactory
progress had been made, considering               the difficulties, and that the
engine was likely to answer the expectations of its inventor.                  The
 Council adopted the report, and communicated it to Government,
 with a strong recommendation in favour of the undertaking.                    The
 Government      acting    under that     recommendation         supplied   further
funds, on the condition that the engine was to be public property,
 and the work proceeded.            In  1830   the Royal Society was again
 consulted by Government,            and the Council       acting    as on former
 occasions appointed a Committee.            The report which        was drawn up
 in  a detailed form was satisfactory to the Treasury,             and the Council
 were informed that funds would be supplied from time to time till
 the engine was completed.           Very  soon a new difficulty occurred       ; it
 became    necessary   to change the engineer, and it was then found
 that by the rules of the trade, the tools, which had been constructed
 at the public expense, were the private property of the engineer                   :
 there was no choice,        therefore, but to sacrifice the tools, or to
 endeavour to effect     a  compromise for      a  large sum.      The progress of
 the work     was suspended       :   there was a      change of government.
  Science was weighed against gold by a new standard, and it was
 resolved to proceed no further.           No enterprise could        have  had its
 beginning    under more auspicious circumstances             :  the Government
  had taken the initiative, they had called for advice, and the adviser
 was the highest scientific authority in this country            ; — your Council,
 guided by such men as Davy, Wollaston and Herschel.                       By your
  Council the undertaking was inaugurated, by your Council it was
  watched over in its progress. That the first great effort to employ the
 powers of calculating mechanism, in aid of the human intellect, should
  have been suffered    in this great country to expire fruitless, because
  there was  no tangible evidence of immediate profit, as a British subject I
  deeply regret, and as a Fellow my regret is accompanied with feelings

                                       257
of bitter disappointment.          Where  a  question has once been disposed
of, succeeding Governments rarely reopen it          ;  still I thought I should
not  be  doing my duty if I did not take          some opportunity         of bring
ing the facts once more before           Government.          Circumstances         had
changed, mechanical engineering had made much progress, the tools
required and trained workmen were to be found in the workshops
of the leading mechanists, the founder's art was so advanced                       that
casting    had    been   substituted   for cutting     in making        the    change
wheels even of screw-cutting           engines, and      therefore it was very
probable that persons would be found willing to undertake to com
plete the Difference Engine for a specific sum.
   That finished, the question would then              have    arisen, how far it
was advisable to endeavour, by the same means, to turn to account
the great labour which had been expended under the guidance of
inventive powers the most original, controlled by mathematics of a
very high order       ; and which had been wholly devoted for so many
years to the great task of carrying the powers of calculating machi
nery to its utmost limits.        Before I took any step,      I wrote to several
very eminent men of science, inquiring whether in their opinion any
great scientific object would be gained,          if Mr. Babbage's views,            as
explained in Menabrea's little essay, were completely realized.                    The
answers    I received were strongly in          the affirmative.         As it was
necessary the subject should be laid before Government in                     a  form
as   practical    as possible,    I wrote to    one     of our     most eminent
mechanical engineers to inquire whether            I should     be safe in stating
to Government         that the expense      of the Calculating         Engine       had
been more than repaid in the improvements in mechanism directly
referable     to it :   he   replied, unquestionably.        Fortified     by these
opinions    I   submitted this proposition      to Government        : — that     they
should call upon the President of the Society of Civil Engineers to
report whether it would be practicable to make a contract for the
completion of Mr. Babbage's Difference Engine, and                 if so,   for what
sum.     This was in       1852, during   the short administration           of Lord
Derby, and it led to no result.          The time was unfortunate,            a  great
political   contest was impending,          and before      there was a lull in
politics, so that the voice of Science could be heard, Lord Derby's
government was at an end.

                                           258
   Although,      in communicating with Lord                 Derby,   I  was not acting
under the directions of your Council, still, as my object was to induce
the Government to complete a work in which this Society had taken
so great an interest,       I  conceived it to be my duty to lay the facts
before   you, as    a basis   to proceed upon, should it hereafter be con
sidered expedient to renew the subject.
   I  have detailed to you regularly            at each anniversary the proceed
ings of   the Committee of Recommendations                    ;   a Committee, as you
are all probably aware, appointed to distribute the grant for scientific
objects which was made to us by Government the first year of my
Presidency, and has since been continued annually.                       On the present
occasion    I have only to say, that since the last anniversary nume
rous reports have been received, and                 I   hope    the new Council     will
consider it expedient to collect the facts brought                     out, and arrange
them in the form of a paper to be laid before Parliament.
   With respect to the design for the re-examination of the heavens
in the southern hemisphere, originally suggested by the British As
sociation, and subsequently matured by your Council,                        I have only
to say, as I said the last anniversary,                   that it is in the hands of
Government.
   There is no other subject which seems to me to call for observa
tion  ; the report of your Treasurer            will give all necessary information
as to financial matters, and           it only remains for           me to express    the
deep sense     I feel of the great services which               have been rendered to
Science by your Councils during the six years                     I have been officially
connected with them.            I  am sure nothing could have exceeded              their
pains-taking industry, their complete devotion to your service.                        In
their hands your interests were watched over with anxious care,
they were in perfect safe-keeping             ;  and when       I  was unavoidably ab
sent,   as was too often          the   case,   I  had no misgivings.          To your
Council     I return    my sincere thanks            ;   to you, Gentlemen,       I  feel
equally grateful     ; and in     retiring from your Presidency permit            me to
assure   you, that although          the position      I   am destined henceforth to
occupy will be less prominent, my exertions for the welfare of your
Society shall not be less earnest.

       Da.  Sharpet,
   I  am happy to have        the honour of handing to you the Copley
Medal, in charge for Professor Miiller.
   The Copley Medal has been awarded to our distinguished Foreign
Member,       Professor Johannes    Miiller of Berlin, for his important
contributions     to different branches of Physiology and Comparative
Anatomy, and particularly for his researches on the Embryology            and
Structure     of the Echinodermata, contained in a series of memoirs
published in the Transactions       of the Royal Academy of Berlin.
   No   one has borne a more conspicuous part in the advancement of
physiological science for the last quarter of a century than Johannes
Miiller, and there is none whose services in that department of na
tural knowledge are more deserving of honourable recognition.
   So great, indeed, has been his scientific activity, that in the brief
reference    to his writings suited to this occasion,   I am constrained to
pass by much that is excellent and confine myself to those which
most strikingly evince his merit in the several departments in which
he has laboured.
   At   an   early period of his career he published his well-known
treatise   on the Secreting Glands.        In this work    he traces  the in
timate structure of these organs in the varied conditions            which it
presents,    from the lowest animals to man         ; and in particular    he
establishes    on a more broad and satisfactory basis the true doctrine
of the relation of the blood -vessels and ducts, as first correctly con
ceived by    Malpighi   ; indeed, since the time of the great anatomist
of Bologna, no general work had appeared          on the subject to be com
pared with that of Professor Miiller.
   Among his numerous contributions           to Comparative Anatomy,        I
may specially single out his series of memoirs on the Myxinoid
Fishes.     Of the  scope and importance     of this great work but a faint
idea is conveyed by the title     ;  for while the anatomy of a particular
family of fishes may be said to form its text, there is an ample com
mentary, rich in new and original         matter, in which the structure is
compared in other tribes, and the facts sagaciously applied to the
elucidation of great questions in animal morphology.
   In Physiology, Professor Miiller has proved himself equally a
master.      His "Handbook" has long held a high place in physiolo
gical literature, and under this modest designation not only presents

                                    260
 clear expositions    and enlightened   discussions    of truths    already
 known,    but is enriched throughout with the fruits of the author's
 own observation and experimental inquiry.         Evidence of this may
 be found   in almost every chapter, but it is sufficient to refer to his
 examination of the blood, to his disquisitions on the nervous system,
 and especially to his valuable experimental       investigations   on the
 voice and on hearing.
    Professor  Miiller early applied himself to the study of    the struc
 ture and economy of the        Echinoderms.     After describing,     in  a
 special memoir, the anatomy of the Pentacrinus,       so interesting   as a
 living representative of the extinct Crinoidea,      and   publishing,   in
 conjunction   with M. Troschel,    a systematic   arrangement and de
 scription of the Asterida, he was at length happily led to investigate
 the embryo life of this remarkable class of animals.         The field of
 inquiry on which    he entered had scarcely been     trenched upon be
 fore, and he has since made it almost wholly his own by persevering
 researches  carried on at the proper seasons for the last nine years,
 on the shores of the North Sea, the Mediterranean      and the Adriatic.
 In this way   he has investigated  the larval conditions of four out of
 the five orders of true Echinoderms, and has successfully sought out
 and determined the common plan followed          in their development,
amidst remarkable and unlooked-for      deviations in the larval organi
zation and habits of genera even of the same order       ;  and his inqui
ries respecting these animals have made us acquainted with larval
forms, with relations between the larva and future being, and with
modes of existence, such as nature has not yet been found to present
in any other part of the animal kingdom.     Finally, with the light thus
derived from the study of their development, Professor         Miiller  has
subjected the organization of the entire class of Echinoderms,         both
recent and fossil, to   a thorough revision, and has added much that
is new, as well as cleared up much that was obscure,         in regard    to
their economy, structure and homologies.       It is to these researches,
which occupy seven memoirs in the Transactions         of the Royal Aca
demy of Sciences of     Berlin, that more special reference is    made in
the   award of the Medal.     Besides their other claims to distinction,
they may be justly regarded as revealing a new order of facts in the
history of animal development.

                                        261
         Dr. Hooker,
      It was fortunate for natural science that you succeeded             in ob
   taining the appointment        of Naturalist to the Antarctic Expedition
  under    Sir  J.  C. Ross, and that you fully availed yourself of the
  opportunities of pursuing your favourite studies which so frequently
  presented    themselves   during the progress of that arduous voyage.
     The collections    made during this voyage were extremely import
  ant, and have served       as the foundation      of  a series of works    illus
  trative of the botany of the Southern            hemisphere.      The " Flora
  Antarctica," which was commenced immediately after your return,
  at once established for you a high place as a philosophical           botanist,
 by the accuracy and completeness with which each subject is treated,
 as   well as by the importance of the physiological questions there dis
 cussed.      The value of the details of      a systematic work can be best
 appreciated by those who use it as a guide, but the essay on the
 structure and affinities of the curious parasite Myzodendron,           may be
 noticed as perhaps the most striking of the many special topics
 which are there treated of.
     The peculiar configuration of the Southern hemisphere, in which
 the land bears so small a proportion         to the sea, seems at an early
 period to have directed your attention to Geographical Botany, and
 to have led you to investigate          critically  one of the most difficult
 questions of natural science, which is now acquiring that prominence
 to which it is so well entitled, — I mean the question of the origin
 and distribution     of species.    In your memoirs on the vegetation of
the Galapagos Islands, you have           brought together a great number
of facts relative to insular floras, which throw much light upon this
point of abstract science ; and in your Flora of New Zealand (now
in progress),      you have discussed the question in all its bearings,
in an essay which       has attracted much attention,        from the cautious
and philosophical      manner in which the subject is treated.
     As Botanist to the Geological          Survey of Great Britain, your
attention was directed to the investigation of the extinct Flora           ;  and
it is evident from the        essay on the carboniferous        vegetation pub
lished in their Records, that you devoted yourself to this task with
the same energy which          had   characterized     your previous labours.
In this   essay an intimate      knowledge     of recent structure is applied
to throw    light upon    the vegetation   of remote periods in the history

                                         2«2
 of the globe,   and there is evinced a just appreciation        of facts and a
 cautious spirit of induction, which make it one of the most important
 contributions ever made by Botany to Geology.
     In the selection of the Himalaya      as the field of further exploration,
 you seem to have been guided by a sagacious perception of the re
 quirements of natural science       ;  and in the plain and artless narrative
 of that journey, we know not whether most to admire, the industry
 by which alone so much could have been done, the judicious selec
 tion of subjects of investigation, or the completeness of the results.
 On that work, geographers, geologists, meteorologists, and bota
 nists, in fact, cultivators of all branchesof natural science, have pro
 nounced a unanimous verdict, which may be best summed up in the
 words of the illustrious Humboldt, the greatest of scientific travellers,
 as
     "a  perfect treasure of important observations, in which             a  pro
 digious extent of previous knowledge is brought to bear upon every
 topic, and which is marked with great sagacity and moderation in
 all the views brought forward."
       Dr. Hofmann,
    A Royal Medal       has been awarded to you,       " for your Memoirs on
 the molecular     constitution     of the Organic Bases, contained in the
 Philosophical Transactions, and the Transactions of the Chemical
 Society."
    The long     series   of  researches   which are acknowledged         in the
present award, were          commenced by your inquiries,          published in
 1844, on the volatile bases contained in coal-gas naphtha, in which
 you recognized aniline, a base previously obtained from indigo, and
leucoline,   likewise      derived from      the   decomposition    of quinine,
cinchonine,    and strychnine.         In consequence     of its extremely de
finite character, aniline was selected by you as the type of volatile
bases, and investigated in all directions, with singular perseverance
and success.      A variety of new compounds were thus obtained,
bearing a fixed relation to the primitive          body, such as chloraniline,
bromaniline,    nitraniline,     melaniline,   &c.    From   these   researches,
and the facts supplied by other investigators,            you were gradually
led to a conception of the common constitution of this class of com
pounds,    and obtained        the  means     of producing    substances    of a
similar constitution      to an almost unlimited extent.         Oxide of am

                                      263
monium is the general prototype, the hydrogen of that volatile base
being replaced to the extent of one, two, three, or four equivalents,
by a multitude of elementary and compound radicals.             Your method,
also,  of introducing   these radicals into the constitution     of ammonia,
by the agency of the bromides and iodides of the radicals, has been
found to admit of extensive application,            and has very materially
assisted in the general progress which         organic chemistry has made
since this method was made public.
       Db.  Neil Arnott,
   I  have much pleasure in announcing,         that a Rumford      Medal has
been awarded to you,       " for your construction of    a new Smoke-con
suming and Fuel-saving         Fire-place, with accessories,     ensuring the
healthful warming and ventilation of houses, lately described in the
Journal of the Society of Arts (May 12, 1854), and for your various
contributions to the elucidation of the principles and improvement
of the practice of heating and ventilation."
   The President then called upon Dr. Sharpey to read the following
obituary notices of some of the deceased Fellows          : —
   Edward Forbes. — In the melancholy list of those who           have passed
 away from among the Fellows of this Society, there is no name whose
mention will awaken       a  more general and profound feeling of regret
than that of     Edward Forbes.          Some leave us full of years and
honours, their work in this world finished, and its rewards enjoyed           ;
the sphere of action    of others   has been so limited, that their absence
is felt  within only  a  narrow circle   ;  but in Edward Forbes we have
to lament one whose         vigorous intellect    had but   just attained the
ripeness of the prime of life       ; who, after rising with almost unex
ampled rapidity to the height of his ambition, sank within sight of
a future more brilliant than his past ; and whose loss to the brethren
in science who looked up to him, to the University whose hopes
were centred in him, and to the friends of all classes and pursuits
who loved him, is truly irreparable       .
   A native of the Isle of Man,        and born in the year 1815, Edward
 Forbes exhibited at      a  very early age that aptness for and attach-
    VOl.   Vii.                                                   2 d

                                         264
 ment to intellectual     pursuits, so commonly remarked in those who
 attain to scientific eminence. Before his twelfth year, we find the boy
 already collecting and cataloguing the curious and beautiful things
 scattered along the shores of his native island, and even boldly ven
 turing, without other guidance or encouragement than such as were
 afforded by the vigour and hopefulness of a fresh and youthful
  mind, amidst the mazes         and difficulties     of  a  science then in its
 infancy, — that Geology to whose         advance   it was his destiny in after
 life so essentially to contribute.       And the fine healthy audacity with
 which, in these childish days, he undertook to compile                a Manual of
 British Natural History in all its branches, and carried out his pro
 ject, according to his means          and powers, is worthy of note, and
 might have led a judge of human nature to prophecy well of his
 future.
     The complexion of this future, however, was for a time doubtful.
 The tendencies of Edward Forbes's mind were always as strong
 towards art as towards science        ;  and, in very early life, the former
 appear to have been the stronger, for we find him taking up his
residence in London       as an   Art-student, under        the guidance     of the
late   Mr. Sasse.    These labours in the studio were not of very long
 duration  ;   but, short as they were, the development which they
gave to a naturally great power          of drawing, and      the critical eye for
form which they conferred, proved             of essential importance to the
future Naturalist     and Professor.        Again, the readiness with which
Forbes's    rich and   overflowing humour embodied itself in sketches,
vignettes, and caricatures,     — a facility which lent       no small charm to
many of his published works, and has left many a pleasant memorial
among his friends — must be regarded as not a little due to this
early training.
    However, the scientific tendency of Edward Forbes's mind appears
to have been too strong to allow of any lasting or exclusive attach
ment to other pursuits       ;  and in    1 830 he left London         and Art, to
commence, as     a student of medicine, the curriculum of the University
of Edinburgh.       It is hardly probable that       he ever      seriously looked
forward to the practice of physic as a profession               ;  for, although a
diligent attendant upon the prescribed courses,              he never presented
himself for his degree.        But   even   if it were   so, his inborn genius,
fostered  by the teachings of      a Jameson and      a  Graham, soon diverted

                                         265
his attention from the hospital and the operating                theatre to the
museum        and the field, and led him to the conviction that the pursuit
of knowledge         for its own sake was the only satisfactory sphere for
his activity,      and that in devotion to science      lay the vocation of his
life.
     An exploration of Norway,         and the publication of     a  fauna of his
native shores,       were among the first fruits of Edward Forbes's scien
tific training.       These were succeeded        by excursions      into Algeria
and     Illyria, and by    a stay of some    months in Paris, where Prevost
was teaching geology, and Geoffroy and De              Blainville zoology.      In
 1840, Forbes published the first work by which he will be remem
 bered, ' The History of British Starfishes,' one of a series of mono
 graphs upon the natural history of this country which do honour to
 its zoologists.      Although consisting of little more than a description
 of   a score   species of Echinoderms, this is, in many respects, an im
 portant and remarkable Essay          ; and it must be considered to be by
 no means its least merit, that, with an extent and thoroughness of
 knowledge rarely exceeded,         it unites  a spirit of playful and elegant
 humour, rare in itself, and still more rare in such combination.
 Repudiating that stilted and pretentious solemnity sometimes thought
 essential to the due preservation of the dignity of science, Edward
 Forbes here exemplifies the doctrine upon which his whole life was
  a  commentary, — that a true philosopher must first, and before all
  things, be     a genial and simple-minded man.
      Mr. Forbes spent the succeeding two years as Naturalist in
  H.M.S. Beacon, then commanded by Capt. Graves, the chief of the
  surveying corps at that time employed in the Mediterranean.                   At
  this time Capt. Graves was           more   particularly   occupied with the
  yEgean Sea,        and for a short period he was engaged            in affording
  assistance     to Sir Charles Fellowes's expedition in Lycia. Availing
  himself of the opportunity thus afforded, Mr. Forbes, in company
  with Lieutenant        (now Captain) Spratt and the Rev. Mr. Daniell,
   made many excursions inland.            The terrible fevers of the Levant
  did not spare the travellers ; and while one of his companions fell a
   victim to their virulence, Forbes's own life was at one time despaired
   of, and he always        considered his constitution to have been perma
   nently injured by the attack.
       The results of these combined explorations, by which the forgotten
                                                                    2 d 2

however interesting,             must be considered as of very secondary im
portance, so far as Edward Forbes is concerned, to the results of his
examination of the shores of the TEgean with the dredge, an instru
ment of great simplicity indeed, but with whose value he had early
acquainted himself.              It  was    upon the data obtained by dredging
                                                                        '

    That      zones of distinct       species     of living beings may be shown to
exist at different depths in the sea — just as corresponding zones are
demonstrable at different heights on the land, — is a proposition
which had been clearly enunciated by Audouin and Milne-Edwards
so long ago as 1832, and subsequently, on independent grounds, by
Loven.           But, for the addition of new zones, for their accurate enu

never     been      published.      A   sum      of money was granted by Govern
ment for the purpose, but the                pressure of new avocations and other
practical        difficulties   interfered.       Nevertheless,   Mr. Forbes always
looked forward to the working up and publication of these his early
and favourite investigations             ;  and doubtless, the hoped-for leisure to
carry out his pa1ns was one of the many attractions which the Chair
of Natural History in Edinburgh offered.                      But  these projects were
 destined to have no fulfilment              ;   and Forbes's views have but an in
                                               '                                         '

 and the       '
                 Memoirs of the Geological Survey of Great Britain.'
    Edward         Forbes's studies at the University            were on the widest
 scale  ;  and like the father of Natural History, he attacked with equal
 ardour Mineralogy, Botany,                and Zoology.        Good authorities affirm
 that his knowledge              of mineralogy was of no small extent              ; as a

                                          267
 zoologist, all know his merits         ;  and as a botanist, his acquirements
 were   so well thought      of,   that during his absence      in the East, the
 Chair of Botany at King's College,             London,    vacated  by the death
 of the lamented Professor Don, was, without solicitation on his part,
 conferred upon him.         The intelligence of this appointment put an
 end to his meditated project of further travel in Egypt and on the
 shores of the Red Sea, and Professor Forbes returned to enter upon
 the duties   of his post in 1843.
    Launched into the great world of London,              Forbes's further pro
 gress was not more        due to his intellectual      than to his moral cha
 racteristics.    His singular       sociality  and geniality,    the gentleness
 of his manner, and his ready sympathy with and comprehension of
 all phases of human character, won for him a prominent place, what
 ever the society into       which     he was thrown.        Among    his fellow-
 students, Edward      Forbes was the leader, — whether the thing to be
 done were the editing      of a mock ' Maga,' the      writing and illustrating
 a  song, or a downright         piece of hard work.        He had no quarrels
 himself, soothed them among others, and altogether kept men toge
 ther as no one else could do.
    It was these    rare peculiarities which, together with his high in
 tellectual qualifications, recommended him to the authorities of the
 Geological    Society, when a vacancy occurred in the Curatorship of
 their Museum.
    Professor Forbes accepted this post in          1 842, and availing himself
of the opportunities for the study of palaeontology           thus afforded him,
he soon distinguished       himself in the field to which henceforth his
energies   were principally       directed.    In fact, when in     1844  he re
signed his Curatorship, it was to join the Geological Survey of Great
Britain, under     the direction of       Sir Henry De la Beche, and to      take
the official position   of Palaeontologist to the Survey, a post in dis
charging whose duties he spent the next ten years of his life.
    When the Museum of Practical Geology and the Government
School of Mines were established — growing as they did out of the
Survey, — Prof. Forbes directed the arrangement                of the beautiful
collection of fossils now displayed in the former, and became Lec
turer on Natural History and Palaeontology in the latter part of the
Institution in Jermyn Street.              At the  same   time, many valuable
                         '
contributions    to the    Transactions of the Geological Society,' to the

                                           268
memoirs published by the officers of the Survey,                 to the beautifully
                '
illustrated        Decades,' in which Prof. Forbes's artistic skill and judg
ment are so manifest            ;  his Monograph      on the British Naked-eyed
Medusae,       published by the Ray Society         ;  and the large work on the
'
   Natural History of the British Mollusca,' undertaken and finished
in conjunction          with Mr. Hanley — are sufficient          evidence    that his
active mind was not one of those which are oppressed                        and over
powered by details.
    Among         these   many contributions      to science     there are two so
marked by originality            and genius, so pregnant with results for the
future, as to deserve more than passing notice.                 The first of   these is
      '
the       Essay on the Distribution       of the Fauna and      Flora of  the British
 Isles,' in the first volume of the Memoirs of the Survey, which may be
characterized as one of the happiest applications of the facts of one
 science     to the elucidation of the difficulties of another that has ever
been made.           The doctrine laid down in this memoir              is,  that the
 existing distribution          of animals and plants       can  only be regarded,
 not as a primary and independent phenomenon, but as the result of
 previously existing conditions,          — as the product, in fact, of two fac
 tors   ;  the one, the successive       changes of living beings in time         ; the
 other, the successive         changes of the position and boundaries of land
 and sea in space.
    The      second     work here adverted to is that remarkable Essay on
 the Tertiary Beds of the Isle of Wight,                the fruit of Prof. Forbes's
 last labours.
     By    an elaborate     study of the Purbeck beds in Dorsetshire in 1850,
 Prof. Forbes had come to the unexpected conclusion that they were
 divisible into three formations, each characterized by distinct sets of
 fossil remains       ;  and that the freshwater mollusca and foraminifera
  of the Purbeck          beds,   to which he had given his more            particular
  attention, did not agree specifically with the fossils of the incumbent
 Hastings Sands.            The latter   he proposed to class as       Lower Creta
  ceous     or Neocomian, while the Purbeck              he henceforth considered
  as an uppermost          member     of the Oolitic group.        His great    success
  in these     researches     awakened in him       a  lively curiosity to examine
  in like minute detail the great series             of tertiary freshwater strata
  occurring in the northern part of the Isle of Wight.                  Accordingly,
 he devoted several months in the autumn and winter of 1852 to the

                                       269
exploration of that complicated succession of freshwater and fluvio-
marine beds    ; and when we reflect how many able geologists had
gone before him in this field, we may well marvel at the richness of
the harvest which he reaped.           Among other novel conclusions, he
showed that certain strata called the Headon beds in Alum Bay had
hitherto been incorrectly identified in age with the Bembridge lime
stone  of Whitecliff Bay at the opposite or         eastern  end  of  the island.
These Bembridge beds, which belong to the same division as the
well-known     calcareous building-stone of Binstead, were recognized
as the true equivalents in age of the celebrated            gypseous series of
Montmartre near Paris, containing similar remains of Puleotheria and
other extinct quadrupeds, which Cuvier had long before described.
It followed from the correction            here alluded to,    that the mam-
miferous fauna of Binstead held         a   much higher place in the Eocene
series   than the Headon beds,          and, consequently,      than the con
temporaneous Hordwell strata of Hampshire,               in which other qua
drupeds than those of Binstead, including            amongst them the Palo-
plotherium of Owen, had been detected.               Between these two divi
sions, called by Forbes the Bembridge            and the Headon, he found
another, which he called the Osborne or St. Helen's series, also of
fresh  and brackish-water origin,         and distinguished by peculiar spe
cies  of mollusca.
   In addition to all  these    results, Prof. Forbes brought to light an
entirely new member of the British tertiary series,              hitherto over
looked.     Near Yarmouth,       in the Isle of Wight,       the most elevated
ground formed by tertiary deposits is called Hempstead                   Hill, in
which strata corresponding in their fossils with the Limburg beds of
Belgium     or the Gres      de   Fontainebleau      in France,    were recog
nized.     These would be classed          by many geologists of the conti
nent as   Lower Miocene    ;  but Prof. Forbes inferred, from the gradual
passage which he traced between them and the subjacent Bembridge
series, that the whole should rather be regarded as Upper Eocene.
In  a word, he declared    it to   be impossible, without drawing an arbi
trary line    of  demarcation,      to    denominate    the   Bembridge      beds
Eocene, according to received usage, and to distinguish              the Hemp
stead strata as Miocene.
   Always    an active and influential member of the Geological Society,
 Prof. Forbes became its President in 1853.            His anniversary    address

                                         270
 for that year contains a sketch of          a remarkable theory with regard
 to the relation of the past and present faunas of the world to one
 another, — the Theory of the Polar Development of Life in Time.
    Prof. Forbes's occupation of the Presidential Chair in the Geolo
 gical Society, however, was but short ; for in the spring of 1 854,
 the death of Prof. Jameson placed within his reach the ambition of
 his life, — the Chair of Natural History in the University            which had
 been his alma mater.       Appointed       and called upon to enter at once
 on the duties of this distinguished office, he commenced              with what
 an eminent fellow-worker          has well called "    the light-hearted   inten
 sity peculiar to himself,"       to conceive and to inaugurate plans of a
 magnitude proportioned to his great powers and noble aspirations.
 But a slow, though mortal disease — suspected least of all by him
 self — had long been undermining his constitution ; and its sudden
 outbreak, accelerated by over-fatigue and cold, carried him off, after
 a very short     illness, on the 20th of November,             1854.    He was
 buried at Edinburgh,        with such great public demonstrations of
 respect   as have    been rarely shown, but which after all but faintly
 represented the profound and universal sorrow.
    Rear-Admiral Sir John Franklin, K.C.H., D.C.L. etc. — Al
 though the unauthenticated intelligence brought recently to England
 by Dr. Rae respecting Sir          John Franklin and his companions          does
 not raise the veil of mystery          which      shrouds their fate, yet the
touching relics of that gallant commander and his brother-officers
are unhappily     of   a nature, not only to awaken the most              gloomy
thoughts,     but to forbid us entertaining          any longer the cherished
hope that they may be restored to their country.
    At  an early period of this year, long before the Expeditions which
                                '         '               '
were sent to search for the       Erebus     and ' Terror could have returned,
and   of course prior to    the receipt     of the recent Esquimaux       report,
the   Admiralty removed      the names     of Sir John Franklin, his brother-
officers and crew from the Navy List.               This official act, and the
recent melancholy tidings bearing upon their fate, have rendered it
necessary to include in the list of deceased Fellows the names of
Sir John Franklin and Captain Crozier, both of whom there is too
much reason to apprehend have perished in their heroic endeavours
to bring to a successful issue the great enterprise confided to them.

                                          271
     Sir John Franklin was        descended     from  a respectable      Lincolnshire
family, who occupied         a  small estate for several years in that county.
In    consequence      of the improvidence of his grandfather, Sir John's
father was obliged to enter into business, in which                        he was so
successful as to have been enabled to give his sons a good education.
One, Sir Willingham Franklin, rose to the rank of a Chief Justice
of Madras      ;  another, Major Franklin, of the Bengal Cavalry, was
distinguished       for his     scientific   geographical     knowledge,         which
obtained for him the Fellowship            of this Society.
     The fourth son, the subject of this notice, who was born at Spilsby
in Lincolnshire in 1786, was intended for the Church, but while still
at school, he took advantage of a holiday to run from Louth to the
coast for the purpose         of seeing the      ocean, on which       it is stated he
gazed for hours with wonder and delight.                   His father, who         was
 extremely desirous that his son should not follow the profession of
a sailor, for which he manifested           the strongest partiality, conceived
 that by sending the boy in a small merchant-ship                     to Lisbon, the
 discomforts of the voyage would effectually cure him of his love for
 the sea   ; but in the case of young Franklin, as in many others, this
 expedient had      a  totally different effect, so that being evidently bent
 on a maritime career,         he was entered as midshipman on               board  the
 '
    Polyphemus'      in 1800, and was in that ship at the battle of Copen
 hagen.      On this occasion      he escaped without a wound, while a bro
 ther midshipman was          killed at his   side.
      He next sailed with his maternal cousin Captain                 Flinders on his
 celebrated      voyage of discovery to Australia, during which he
 acquired most of that skill and knowledge which was of infinite
 value to him in after-life.
      In the course of this survey        he had the misfortune to be wrecked
  with his commander on a coral reef in August 1803, and by his
  conduct during        seasons   of great hardship       gained the praise and
  esteem    of his superior officers.
                                                                    '
      Franklin next acted under Captain Dance in the                   Earl Camden,'
  and had charge       of  the signals during      the celebrated     engagement in
  the Straits of Malacca, with the French Admiral Linois.
                                                                       '
      On his return     to England he was appointed to the               Bellerophon,'

 musquetry.        Out of forty companions, only six,               beside   himself,
 escaped without wounds or death.
    During     the subsequent two years,          Franklin, who was now        mate,
 served   in the Channel         Fleet and    the   Rochefort     Squadron,    under
 Admiral Cornwallis, Lord St. Vincent, and Sir Richard Strachan.

    He then joined the          Bedford,' one of the convoy which escorted
 the Emperor      of Brazils to South America. Immediately afterwards,
 he  sailed in the Expedition against New Orleans, where he distin
 guished himself particularly in the attack on the American gun-boats,
 on which occasion he was wounded.                  His heroic conduct in this
gallant affair was prominently mentioned in the official despatches,
and led to his being promoted to a Lieutenancy in the 'Forth,' which
ship conveyed the Duchess d'Angouleme to France on the restoration
 of the Bourbons.
    In 1818 commenced the brilliant               series   of Arctic Expeditions
 with which Franklin's         name is so honourably associated.           From  the
 moment of their having been projected he evinced the strongest
 desire to be engaged in them, and he was indebted to Sir Joseph
 Banks, at that time President of the Royal                 Society, for the grati
 fication of his wishes.
    It has been stated, that, with the view of proving himself qualified
for surveying operations, Franklin surveyed              a  portion of the City of
London     by triangulations         taken from church steeples        and   towers,
and that he was in        a great measure indebted to the successful result
of this undertaking for Sir Joseph Banks's patronage and support.
    Sir Joseph, who had considerable influence with the Admiralty
in all matters relating to Arctic exploration, strongly recommended
his young friend for Arctic service, and he was accordingly appointed
                                  '                                     '
to the    command of the            Trent.'   This ship, with the         Dorothea,'
formed an expedition under the command of Captain Buchan, the ob
ject of which was to attain the North Pole, and to enter the Pacific
through     Behring's      Strait.     The ship sailed in the early part of
 1818, and reached      the latitude of 80° 34' North, when the ' Dorothea'
became disabled by severe pressure from the ice, and was incapable
of proceeding further.          But, although dangers of the most appalling

                                          273
nature were around Lieut. Franklin, yet as his ship was less damaged
than that of Captain            Buchan,     he  earnestly requested permission
to proceed alone in the execution of this discovery.               The nature of
Captain Buchan's           instructions    prevented this, and the Expedition
returned.
   Immediately on his return he was appointed to the command of
that celebrated Expedition            to explore the North American        coast,
which occupied the years 1819, 1820, 1821, and 1822, the history
of which, as told in his own manly and unaffected language, is
undoubtedly       one    of the noblest pictures of heroic exertion           and
patient endurance.
   The results of        the labours     of Franklin and of his distinguished
associate Sir John Richardson, in this memorable journey, deserve
more   full  and fitting recognition         than can be attempted on this oc
casion  ;  suffice    it  here   to observe, that    a vast extent of the North
American Continent, before unknown, was added to our Charts, and
large acquisitions gained for science by the careful study of the phy
sical geography and natural productions of that portion of the globe.
   Undeterred by the appalling sufferings he had already undergone,
Franklin, although lately united in marriage to Miss Porden, again
volunteered his services for Arctic exploration.                These were ac
cepted,    and in the course of 1825-27              an additional  tract of the
North American Continent              was carefully surveyed.
   For    these    arduous services,        which   extended over    a period   of
twelve years,        and in     the  execution of which he travelled nearly
 9000 miles, and added a coast-line            of upwards of 1200 miles to our
North American           Maps, he      was promoted to the rank of Captain,
knighted     by his Sovereign, and had the degree of           D.C.L. conferred
 on him by the University           of Oxford.       He also received the Gold
 Medal    from     the French        Geographical     Society, and was elected
 a  Fellow of       the    Royal    Society, on whose Council       he served   in
 1829 and 1830.
    In the former year, having had the misfortune to lose his first wife,
 he married the present Lady            Franklin, then Miss Jane Griffin, whose
persevering devotion           in endeavouring       to rescue  her unfortunate
 husband is well known.
    He now remained at home for two years, when he was appointed
 to the ' Rainbow,' and served in that ship in the Mediterranean for

                                      274
three years.       He was chiefly employed in the Greek waters, and
had the good fortune to be of considerable service in the delicate
 adjustment of complicated diplomatic relations.
    During this period, as indeed on all other occasions, he eagerly
 availed himself of every opportunity, not only to improve his know
 ledge of geology, to which science he was greatly attached, but
also   used  every exertion to add to the museum of the Geological
 Society and to the private collections of scientific men.
    After   a brief period  of rest, which followed his      services  in the
 Mediterranean, he applied to Lord Glenelg for employment under
 the Colonial department, and his Lordship, in a very complimentary
 manner, offered him the important post of Governor of Van Diemen's
 Land, which he held for seven years.
    During this time, that Colony received the convicts         sentenced   to
 transportation, New South Wales having ceased to                be  a  penal
 settlement, which rendered Sir John Franklin's position most onerous
 and trying.     But  he acquitted himself so entirely to the satisfaction
 of the colonists, that in grateful remembrance of his government,
 which was marked by the establishment of a College and a Philoso
 phical Society, they, unsolicited, subscribed £1600 towards the ex
 penses of the recent private expedition fitted out for his rescue.
    It might    be supposed that after so long       a period   of laborious
 services,  Sir John Franklin would       have desired repose, particularly
 as he had now attained high renown          ; but his wishes still pointed
 towards    active  employment, and consequently,        when the Arctic
 Expedition    was   contemplated, which in all human probability has
 cost him his life, he was willing and ready to take the command,
 when the Admiralty       were of opinion that he was the officer best
fitted to act as its chief.
    That Expedition, as will     be remembered,    was originated by the
late Sir John Barrow, who,       before resigning  his office of Secretary
to the Admiralty,      submitted  a  plan for the discovery of the North
west Passage to that branch of Her Majesty's Government, by whom
it  was referred to the Council of the Royal Society.
    Without concurring in all Sir John Barrow's views, the Council
gave it as their opinion that such an Expedition was likely materially
to increase our knowledge of geography and terrestrial magnetism,
and to promote the general interests of science, and that it was at

                                      275
that time peculiarly       desirable in connexion with the magnelical
inquiries then in progress.
    The history and fate of the Expedition, which left our shores in
May 1845, are still veiled in obscurity; this, however, we know,
that every thing was done to render it efficient, — that the officers
under    Sir John Franklin     were men of experience and zeal, and that
the last    accounts which were received from them represent their
commander as animated by all the ardour and spirit which charac
terized his early Arctic exertions.
    It would   have been unjust to have expected less from such a man,
and as his instructions       contained the usual discretionary latitude
given in these documents, there is too much reason to fear that in
his great     anxiety and daring attempts to solve the problem of the
North-west Passage, his ships became inextricably entangled in the
thick-ribbed ice of the Arctic regions, and his attempts to reach the
North American continent were rendered abortive.
    But although      the few facts that have reached      us point  to the
dreary shores of     the  Arctic regions  as the final resting-place of our
lamented Fellow and his brave          companions, his memory will ever
be enshrined on       British land within British hearts,    as an explorer
as eminent in discovery, as he was patient under trial and privation,
and    kind  and good in all the relations of life.
     Captain Francis Rawdon Moiha Crozier, R.N., the compa
 nion of Sir John Franklin on his last and fatal voyage, and second
 in the command of the expedition, was eminently qualified for the
 post by long experience in the navigation of the icy seas.
     He accompanied Sir W. E. Parry on his last three voyages to the
 Arctic Regions, and was made Commander for his services as First
                            '
 Lieutenant     of H.M.S.     Cove,' under Captain James Clark Ross, and
  despatched in the depth of winter to afford assistance to the missing
  whalers supposed to have been frozen in the pack of Davis Strait.
     Again, as second in command to Captain         J. C. Ross,  he obtained
  post rank for the first season's successful operations      of the expedi
  tion sent, at the recommendation of the Royal Society and British
  Association, for purposes of scientific research and geographical dis
  covery   to the Antarctic Ocean.
      Captain Crozier was distinguished for devotion to his duties as an

                                       276
officer, zeal for the advancement of science, and the untiring assiduity
and exactness     of his magnetic and other observations.             The Trans
actions of the Royal Society, as well as the           published results of the
Antarctic Expedition,        bear ample    testimony to his diligence           and
ability.
   Robert Jameson was born at Leith on the 11th of July 1774.
Of his early years it is reported that he showed a decided bent
towards the study of external nature, and although he went through
the course    of apprenticeship and college study then usual for young
men entering the medical profession, he never engaged in practice,
but devoted      himself to the pursuit      of natural history      as the main
occupation of his life.
   The first fruits of his labours       as an original inquirer were given
to the world in his       *'
                             Outlines   of the Mineralogy of the Shetland
Islands and of the Island of Arran," published while he was yet a
very young man      ; and this was followed by a more important work
entitled the    " Mineralogy of the Scottish Isles," and containing the
results of further local investigation.         The     success   of  these   early
essays    served only as an inducement           to   extend and deepen         the
foundations     of his knowledge, and with this view he spent nearly
two years in the great school of mining and mineralogy at Frey-
burg, under the tuition of the celebrated Werner.                      Returning
home     from Germany,       he was appointed       in   1804   to the chair of
Natural History in       the   University    of Edinburgh,      which     had be
come vacant by the death of his early friend               and preceptor, Dr.
Walker.       When thus established        as a teacher in the chief           seat
of learning in his native country,       he seems to have early entertained
the project of a great work on the Geology of Scotland, in which the
whole was to be described, county by county, and he made                   a com
mencement      with " The Mineralogy of Dumfries."            From this under
taking, however, he was soon called off to prepare various elemen
tary and systematic works for the geological student              ;  and accord
ingly  a   treatise " On the external Characters of Minerals,"               and a
" System of Mineralogy         and
                                                  "  soon                from his
                                      Geognosy              appeared
                                            " Manual of
pen, and, after a longer interval, his                       Mineralogy and of
Mountain Rocks." He also contributed several articles on different
branches of Natural History to the Edinburgh Encyclopaedia and

                                       277
Encyclopaedia Britannica, and to the Transactions             of  the Wernerian
 Society, of which he was the founder.               In  1819,   in conjunction
with Dr., now Sir David Brewster,            he commenced the Edinburgh
Philosophical Journal, which was afterwards continued, under his
sole editorship, under the title of the Edinburgh New Philosophical
Journal, and this duty he continued steadfastly to perform to the
end of his life.
    Mr. Jameson's      strong point was Mineralogy          ; and as he held a
knowledge of minerals to be valuable chiefly as subservient to prac
 tical geology and mining, he paid less regard to chemical than to
external characters in the definition and determination of mineral
species.     His consummate acquaintance with           the mineral characters
 of rocks stood him in good stead in the great controversy of which
 Edinburgh     became     the centre, between the respective supporters of
the Plutonian     and Neptunian theories of the earth.           Trained in the
 school of Werner, and deeply reverencing              his great master, Mr.
Jameson      naturally    imbibed his views    ;  and though       he eventually
became     convinced of their insufficiency, and candidly avowed his
 change of opinion, it is admitted that the doctrine which finally
triumphed gained much in solidity and precision by the searching
ordeal to which it had been subjected at the hands of its accom
plished opponent.
    His College lectures owed        no attraction to language or delivery,
but the solid instruction       imparted secured the earnest attention of
his audience.      His   success   as a teacher, however, was greatly due
to his field lectures and geological excursions         with his pupils in the
country round Edinburgh,          so rich in visible illustrations      of geolo
gical science.     These practical outdoor instructions,            conveyed as
they were in perspicuous and impressive language, and followed
up by easy and unrestrained            colloquial   explanation,     became   the
means    of infusing   a  love for the study in many of his youthful fol
lowers, and of sending forth          active and well-prepared         geological
labourers to most parts of the world.
    Mr. Jameson     was a member         of many learned societies both at
home and abroad      ;   he  was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in
1826.     In private life     he was much      esteemed      and could reckon
many attached friends.          His death took    place on the 19th      of April
1854.

                                    278
    The Society has lost another distinguished         member    in George
 Newport, who died in April last.
    The earlier incidents of Mr. Newport's personal history, although
simple in themselves, are well deserving of record, as important
passages   in the life of one who, through inborn love of knowledge,
just confidence in his own powers, indomitable energy and rigorous
self-denial, raised himself to eminence from a humble walk of life,
in spite of the difficulties   he had    to encounter from the want of
early training    and other aids which       a more    advantageous social
position supplies.
    George Newport was born on the 4th           July 1803, in    the  city of
 Canterbury, where his father was a wheelwright,           and at that time
in comfortable worldly circumstances.         The   son gave early indica
tions of mental activity, showing,      as soon as he could read, a great
fondness for books, and also a taste for drawing.          This latter  taste,
 though never aided by external cultivation,        abode by him through
life, and proved of great use to him in his subsequent studies by
enabling him to represent accurately, and at the moment, the sub
jects of his investigation.
    At the usual age he was sent to a day-school in Canterbury, where
he received the ordinary    English education obtainable by boys in his
station of life.  When   he had reached his 14th year he was removed
from school, and, very much, it is said, against his will, was bound
apprentice to his father.    Although    he soon became an expert work
 man in the lighter branches of the trade, he never got the better of
his dislike to the occupation, and often avowed his purpose of aban
 doning it at the expiration of his apprenticeship.
    Before this period arrived, however, his future prospects, humble
as they were at best, became      still more   clouded.     His father, it   is
said from no fault of his own, but from unavoidable circumstances,
became involved in pecuniary difficulties,      and the whole    of his little
property    had to be    sacrificed   for  the benefit of his creditors.
Under    this change of circumstances, the son,         instead of seeking,
as he had hoped to do, for some more        intellectual employment, was
compelled to continue at his father's trade, and by working hard for
three or four days in the week, he earned sufficient to enable him to
devote the remaining days to pursuits more congenial to his mind.
These were chiefly — reading on general subjects both literary and

                                       279
 scientific,  the study of antiquities, for which the locality afforded
  great opportunities, and, most of all, the pursuit of his earliest and
  latest love, the observation and investigation of insect life.       He had
  been a collector of insects from his early boyhood, but      it was during
 the two years of comparative leisure following         the close of his ap
 prenticeship    (from about July 1824 to November 1826), that his
  entomological studies assumed consistency and form.
     The Canterbury Philosophical and Literary Institution afforded
 means of instruction of which George Newport, at this time, took
 full advantage, having joined it        as a member in 1825.     Its library,
 its collections,   both in natural history and antiquities,     and its lec
 tures, were to him the source of endless recreation and instruction,       —
 advantages, which he was soon able to repay, in kind, by contribu
 tions both to its museum and theatre.         In September   1825 he began
 an elementary course of lectures on mechanics, and gave other lec
 tures on the same subject, at intervals, both during this and the
 subsequent session of 1826; and in October of the latter year he
 was    appointed    General    Exhibitor of   the  Museum,    with   a small
 salary.     During   this and the   following   year he gave some general
 lectures on entomology, as well as numerous demonstrations on the
 same subject, from his own collections          and the specimens in the
 museum     ; and his name stands on the books of the Society as a
 large donor of British insects collected and preserved by himself.
     Mr. Newport     gave much satisfaction in his management          of the
museum, and made numerous friends among its chief visitors, the
young     men    of the city,    several   of whom, subsequently, gave       a
striking proof how highly they estimated his character and services.
Among the members, and one of the occasional Honorary Lec
turers of the Society during the time of        Mr. Newport's curatorship,
was a Surgeon then residing at Sandwich.              The intimacy arising
from position and from pursuits of a kindred character, led to a con
nexion which ended in Mr. Newport's leaving Canterbury and going
to reside at Sandwich       ; Mr. Weekes agreeing to receive him        as his
apprentice without the payment of any premium, but also without
any remuneration       for services,  even in the form of board and lodg
ing.     All that  he had of present or prospective means to meet the
exigencies of such       a position,  consisted of a small sum in hand set
apart from his own scanty earnings, and the generous offer of such
    VOl. Vii.                                                    2 E

                                      280
 contributions    from his young friends in Canterbury as their very
  moderate  resources could supply.
    This period of Mr. Newport's        life was marked by the greatest
 privations, and he often, in after years, expressed some surprise how
  he was able to bear up against them.          Whatever his expenditure
 was (and it was marvellously small), it was still supplied by the
 same attached friends at Canterbury.         It is pleasing to be able to
 add,  that all these precious debts were carefully recorded          by him,
 and gradually liquidated,     in after years, as the means of doing so
 came slowly into his possession.
    At the expiration of his apprenticeship, Mr. Newport went to
 London to prosecute his medical studies.          Through    the friendly  in
 tervention of a Physician, to whom he had been fortunate enough to
 gain an introduction, he obtained a nomination to University College
 (then the University of London), at which he was entered on the
 16th of January, 1832 ; and on a representation of his peculiar cir
 cumstances being laid before the Professors, they all most readily
 gave him gratuitous     access to their respective lectures.      There, be
 sides attending to the ordinary branches of professional instruction,
 he became    a diligent   pupil in the class of Comparative Anatomy,
 under Dr. Grant.      After the usual course of study,       he received his
qualification   for practice both from the Company of Apothecaries
and the College of Surgeons;         and in April 1835 obtained the ap
pointment     of House Surgeon       to the Chichester     Infirmary.     This
appointment, slight as it was, may be said to have terminated his
struggles for existence, and placed him, for the first time, in a
position of comparative ease, security, and comfort.            He, however,
did not long retain the office, having resigned it in the beginning of
 1837.
    On leaving Chichester in January 1837, Mr. Newport returned
to London, entering soon afterwards into partnership with a young
 Surgeon who had been for some time established in practice.              This
partnership continued several years, but was not productive of satis
factory results, either in a social or pecuniary point of view.            On
its dissolution,   Mr. Newport    became more      and more occupied with
his scientific pursuits, relishing his professional avocations less and
less, and becoming, in some       measure,   unfitted for them, so that for
a  good many years before       his death, the whole of his professional

                                         281
  income was almost exclusively derived from a single family,                  and
  never   exceeded   thirty pounds per annum.           So circumstanced, his
  means    were necessarily extremely circumscribed             ; but his habits
  were, happily, of the most frugal kind, and the most scanty lodging
  served him for    all purposes of accommodation and study. But on
  the 1st July, 1847, Her Majesty was graciously pleased to grant
  him a pension of £100 a year, in consideration of his merits as a
  laborious and disinterested cultivator of science       ;  and from this time,
  feeling his mind more tranquil in his improved worldly circumstances,
  he continued his labours more steadily and vigorously               than ever,
  up to the day when he was stricken with his fatal illness.
     That illness may truly      be said   to have been brought on by         Mr.
  Newport's zeal for science.       It had   been his practice for some years
  to devote a day or two in the spring season to a search for frogs
  and other aquatic animals in the marsh lands west of London, in
  order to secure a supply of specimens for his physiological            investi
  gations.    In  these excursions he commonly contracted a cold, and
 on the last occasion this assumed the form of severe bronchitis, and
  being followed     by fever of a typhoid          character, terminated      his
  valuable life on the 7th of April.
     Mr. Newport was a member of the Entomological Society nearly
 from the time of its foundation, and during the sessions of 1844 and
  1845 served the office     of President.      In  1847, he became a     Fellow
  of the Linnean     Society   :  the date of his election into the Royal
  Society is March 26, 1846.          At the time of his death         he was a
  Member of the Council.

Phil. Trans. 1854.
    These    publications,   numerous as they are, were all produced
within    a period     of two-and-twenty       years.     His more important
researches were for the most part communicated to the Royal or
Linnean Society, and on two different occasions they                 received  the
 award of the Royal Medal.
    His earliest inquiries were directed to the structure and economy
 of insects and other articulated animals, and his           name first became
 generally known in science         by his admirable memoirs on the Ana
 tomy of      the  Nervous     System    of the Sphinx Ligustri,          and the
 changes which that system undergoes during the metamorphosis of
 the insect.      Continuing to prosecute       these researches     in the Crus
 taceans and other allied invertebrata, he arrived at the conclusion,
 that in all the higher Articulata, the central part of the nervous
 system    consists of two pairs of cords, the            one    gangliated, the
 other not, which, in accordance with the views of Sir Charles Bell,
 he conceived to minister respectively to sensation and motion.
     In a subsequent research on the nervous system              of the lulus, he
  observed   in the central cords, a set of fibres which connect together
  adjacent nerves on the same side of the body, and then extend with
  them to the surface of the animal.        These he regarded as associating
  in function the lateral      nerves   of the corresponding side, indepen
  dently of the brain, in conformity with the views which were at

                                   284
   that time gaining acceptance      on the mechanism of reflex action.
   In the  same   communication he related a remarkable set of experi
  ments, showing the correspondence in function between the central
  part of the nervous system of the invertebrata and that of ver-
  tebrated animals.
      The development of the embryo of the invertebrata largely occu
  pied Mr. Newport's attention, and among other more or less
  valuable results of his inquiries, he made out the remarkable process
  of growth of the young Myriapod, by the interpolation of successive
  new segments      at one determinate and limited region of the body.
  The paper in which        these  observations were communicated was
  nominated as the Bakerian Lecture for the year 1841.
      In the latter years of  Mr. Newport's suddenly interrupted life, he
  was led to investigate with his usual zeal and industry the recondite
  process of the impregnation of the ovum.       He chose the egg of the
  Frog   as the subject of his experiments,   and recorded the results in
 three papers communicated to the Society, the last of which, partly
  prepared at the time of his death, and afterwards completed from
 his written    memoranda by his friend Professor Ellis, is inserted in
 the present volume of the Philosophical Transactions.        In his in
 quiries into this question he endeavoured to determine the several
 conditions which affect fecundation, whether depending on the state
 of the parent animals and their generative products or on the in
 fluence of extrinsic circumstances ; but the main result at which
 he arrived was the confirmation,      by his observations on the Frog,
of   the view already adopted by some physiologists on other evidence,
 that in the process of fecundation the spermatozoids actually reach
 the interior of the ovum.
     In Mr. Newport's      studies of insects   and other invertebrated
animals, it was more to his taste to investigate structure, function,
and habits, than to occupy himself with zoological description       and
arrangement;       but that he could ably deal with the classification
and natural-history     relations of animals is shown in his admirable
monograph on the Myriapoda,          in the Transactions of the Linnean
Society.
     Mr. Newport was endowed with singular aptitude for the pur
suit he had chosen. His well-known skill of hand in minute ana
tomical research,     and   his ingenuity  in devising and dexterity in

                                          285
performing experiments, gave him great practical advantages               ; and
these qualities were combined        with patience and accuracy in obser
vation, and fidelity in recording what he saw, apart from what he
thought.       He had a nervous temperament, which was, as usual,
associated     with mental activity, and in Mr. Newport this was ren
dered effective by immoveable stedfastness of purpose and untiring
power of sustained application.
    Most faithful    as an observer    of nature, Mr. Newport was no        less
upright     as a man.      He was deservedly loved by         those who knew
him best, was most kind towards all who did him justice, and full of
gratitude to those who had aided him in his early struggles.
   By the      death   of Dr.  Wallich      this   Society has lost a highly
distinguished Fellow and Vice-President,           and the science of Botany
one   of its most zealous cultivators and ardent promoters.
    Dr. Nathaniel Wallich was born at Copenhagen, on the 28th Janu
ary 1786.       He was educated     for the medical profession and studied
Botany under Vatel the eminent professor, at that time in the Uni
versity of Copenhagen.          In   1807    he entered the service     of the
Danish East India Company, and was stationed at Serampore.               There
his love of botany attracted the attention of Dr. Roxburgh,                  the
superintendent       of  the  Botanic     Garden at Calcutta.       After the
seizure of Serampore by the           British,   Dr. Wallich was placed on
the staff   of  assistant  surgeons   in  the  Bengal army, and his services
secured    for the Botanic Garden, to the temporary charge of which
he was nominated in 1815, and finally confirmed in the appointment
shortly afterwards.        Before he had been four years in India, Dr.
Wallich's ardour in the pursuit of his favourite science led to the
first of a series of attacks of fever that gradually undermined his
constitution, and in 1812 he repaired to the Mauritius for the reno
vation of his health.        There he diligently explored the botany of
the island,     and contributed immense collections          of live plants to
Calcutta,     thus early proving his ability to employ to the best in
terests   of science     the  munificent    allowances    which were shortly
afterwards placed at his disposal.          At  the head  of the noblest bota
nical gardens in the world, supplied          with  a large staff of collectors
and artists, and with provision         for travelling   expenses   on a most
liberal scale, Dr. Wallich applied himself with indomitable zeal and

                                  286
industry to the extension of the gardens, the investigation              of the
East India Company's vast and then rapidly increasing dominions,
and the establishment of a correspondence and exchange of living
and dried plants, upon a scale which for magnitude and efficiency
has never been surpassed       by any scientific establishment whatever.
During the first ten years of his incumbency              he performed five
extensive journeys     ; he visited Nepaul,     then a terra incognita,       in
1820-1822, and on his return through the pestilential Tarai, at the
foot of the Himalayas, caught a second severe fever that obliged
him to go to sea immediately after his arrival at Calcutta.                This
opportunity he turned to the best account, and as soon as he could
rise from his bed and superintend his staff, he commenced diligently
investigating     the botany of the Bay of Bengal, Penang, and the
 Straits of Malacca.
    Within   less than another year   Dr.Wallich was personally exploring
 the kingdom     of Oude and the provinces of Rohilcund         and Kamaon,
reporting     on their forests and other vegetable         products   ; and   in
 1826-1827, he accompanied the British embassy to Burmah, visited
 Ava, and after that the newly-acquired provinces of Tenasserim and
 Martaban.     Throughout    this period he employed collectors in eastern
 Bengal, and in other parts of India which he could not himself visit           ;
 and he communicated       (in the  name   of the Hon. E. I. Company) the
 products of these labours with a lavish liberality to the botanists of
 Europe,   not only in the form of collections,          but of voluminous
 observations and drawings.
     Repeated attacks     of illness obliged Dr. Wallich to repair            to
 England,     where he arrived on       furlough    in   1828, and      applied
 himself assiduously for four years to the publication of his great
 work "    Plantae   Asiatics   rariores,"   in three volumes       folio,  and
 the distribution    of his enormous collections to the principal public
 and private museums in Europe.             This distribution,    of which     a
 catalogue was lithographed        by his own hand, constitutes the most
 valuable contribution     of its kind   ever made to botanists, and is of
 itself a sufficient monument of one man's devotion to science.
     Dr. Wallich returned to India in 1832, when it             soon    became
 apparent that his constitution was completely undermined by inces
 sant labour of both mind and body.         For  several  years he conducted
  the garden correspondence       with his wonted zeal      and   vigour, and

                                      2S7
 according to official reports, the astonishing number of 190,000 live
 plants were distributed in the short space of five years, to upwards         of
 2000   gardens in India,       Europe, North and South America, North
and   South Africa, and Australia.       In  1835 he undertook to conduct
a   deputation     to inquire   into the prospects of tea cultivation         in
Assam, a most unhealthy country, and on this occasion superintended
a  botanical exploration of the whole valley.          On his return to Cal
cutta he was again obliged to leave            India for his health, and      he
repaired to the Cape of Good Hope, much enfeebled               and in a very
critical state   ;  there however, with a partial restoration         to health,
his  latent zeal revived, and     he accompanied our eminent        Fellow, Mr.
Maclear the Astronomer Royal, upon an extensive journey into the
interior of the colony, botanizing diligently        as he went,     and trans
mitting his collections       to Europe   for distribution with his wonted
liberality.
    After another short sojourn at Calcutta and ineffectual attempt
to   resist the effects of a climate which five times drove him from
India, Dr. Wallich finally returned to England in           1847, relinquished
with regrets (that       he never could banish)      his arduous duties, and
retired upon the pension of his rank as Surgeon in the Bengal army,
after forty years of such incessant toil both of mind and body as has
never been paralleled in the history of botanical science.
    After his return to England Dr. Wallich's health gradually de
clined, but his love of botany and earnest desire to promote it never
forsook him.        He took  an active part in the meetings of our own
and other societies, and contributed,           chiefly  literary   notices,  to
various botanical periodicals.         He maintained an extensive corre
spondence and became a medium of communication between men of
science in all its branches, in this country and on the Continent ;
and up to within a few weeks of his decease, which               took place   at
his residence in Gower Street on the 28th of April, he was actively
 engaged    in establishing   a correspondence between the museums and
 gardens of his native and adopted countries.          Dr. Wallich published
 several important works on systematic botany in India, and a mag
nificent one in this country,        to which allusion      has   already been
 made   ;  he has further the merit of having introduced             the art of
lithography     into the East.      His acquirements     as a botanist     were
both varied and sound, and not confined to a familiarity with species           ;
     VOl. Vii.                                                      2 F

                                      288
for he possessed great knowledge of the habits, economic and medi
cinal properties and uses of plants, drew up many valuable reports
on the agricultural      products    and  forests of India,   and was very
extensively read in the literature of the science.       He was further an
elegant scholar, a classical writer, and an accomplished European
and Oriental linguist.       His loss  has been deeply felt by botanists   of
all classes, for he was always contributing information and materials to
those engaged in the study of the most abstruse as well as the most
popular branches of the science.       It may truly be said that no one ever
 applied to him in vain, nor has a book of any importance been
published      on botany in Europe       within the last thirty years, in
 which Dr. Wallich's name is not prominently introduced.
    Dr. Wallich was     a Doctor of Medicine     and of Philosophy,   Fellow
 of the Royal Danish Society of Copenhagen, a Correspondent of the
 Academies of Sciences of Paris and Berlin, and          a  member of most
 of the learned bodies of Europe.          He was a Vice-President of the
 Linnean Society of London, and a Knight-Commander of the Danish
 Order of Dannebrog.         He was elected a Fellow of this Society in
 March 1829, and nominated         a  Vice-President in 1852.
    On    the   motion   of   the Rev. Baden Powell, seconded by Dr.
 Warren,    the best thanks of the Society were given to the President
 for his excellent Address, and his Lordship was requested to permit
 the same to be printed.
    The Statutes relating to the election of Officers and Council
 having been read, and Dr. Roget and Thomas Webster, Esq. having,
 with the consent of the Society, been nominated Scrutators, the
 votes  of the Fellows present were collected.
    The    following Noblemen        and Gentlemen     were reported     duly

 The reading          of   Mr. Gosse's      paper,
                                                    " On   the Structure, Func
        tions, and Homology of the Manducatory Organs in the
        Class Rotifera," was resumed and concluded.
    In this      paper the author institutes an examination          of the mandu
 catory organs in the class Rotifera, in order to show that the vari
 ous forms which they assume can all be reduced to a common type.
 He further proposes to inquire what are the real homologues of
 these organs in the other classes of animals, and what light we can
gather, from their structure, on the question of the zoological rank
of the Rotifera.
    After     an investigation    of the bibliography of the     class from Ehren-
berg to the present time, in which the vagueness                  and inexactitude
of our knowledge of             these organs is shown,       the author takes up,
one by one, the various phases which they assume                    throughout the
whole class        ; commencing with Brachionus, in which they appear in
the highest state of development.             Their form in this genus is     there
fore taken as the standard of comparison.
    The hemispherical bulb, which is            so conspicuous in    B. amphiceros,
lying   across the breast, and containing organs which             work vigorously
against each other, has long been recognized as an                organ of mandu-
cation    :   it  has been called the gizzard       ;  but the author proposes to
distinguish it by the term mastax.               It is  a trilobate muscular sac,
with walls varying much in thickness, receiving at the anterior ex
tremity the buccal funnel, and on the dorsal side giving exit to the
oesophagus.
    Within this        sac are placed two geniculate          organs (the mallei),
and   a  third on which they work (the incus).              Each malleus consists
of two parts (the manubrium and the uncus), united by a hinge-joint.
The   manubrium          is a piece  of irregular form, consisting of carina of
solid matter, enclosing three areas, which are filled with a more
membranous substance.                The uncus consists of several slender
pieces,      more    or less parallel, arranged like the teeth of a comb, or
like the fingers of a hand.
   The      incus consists     of two rami, which      are articulated   by a com
mon base to the extremity of a thin rod (the fulcrum), in such a way
that they can open and close by proper muscles. The fingers of

                                          293
each uncus rest upon the corresponding                ramus,    to which they are
attached     by an elastic ligament.          The mallei    are moved      to and fro
by distinct muscles, which           the   author describes in detail       ;   and by
the action of these       they approach and recede alternately            ;   the rami
opening      and shutting       simultaneously,     with    a movement derived
partly from the action of the mallei, and partly                  from their own
proper muscles.
    All   these  organs have great solidity and density            ;  and, from the
action of certain menstrua upon them, appear to be of calcareous
origin.
    The writer      proceeds     to    describe the     accessory organs.          The
ciliated disc has an infundibuliform           centre, which commonly merges
into a tube before it enters the mastax.             The particles of food that
float   in the water,     or swimming animalcules, are whirled                  by the
ciliary vortex into this tube        ; and, being carried into the mastax, are
lodged upon the rami, between the two unci. These conjointly work
upon the food, which passes on towards the tips of the rami, and
enter the    oesophagus,   which opens immediately beneath them.
    From this normal condition,            the author traces the manducatory
organs through        various     modifications,    in    the genera Euchlanis,
Notommata aurita,      N.   clavtilata,   Anureea, N. petromyzon, N. lacinulata,
Furcularia,     N. gibba, Synchceta,       Polyarthra, Diglena, Eosphora, Al.
bertia,   F. marina, Asplanchna,Mastigocerca, Monocerca,             and Scaridium.
Some of these display peculiarities             and aberrations highly curious.
Notwithstanding       the anomalies and variations which occur, however,
the same type      of structure is       seen  in all ;  and the modifications in
general may be considered as successive             degenerations of the mallei,
and augmentations        of  the incus.
    The form of     the manducatory organs, which             occurs in Triarthra,
Pompholyx, Pterodina, (Ecistes, Limnias, Melicerta, Conochilus,                    Me-
galotrocha, Lacinularia,         and Tubicolaria, is next examined.                The
organs are shown to be essentially the same as in the former type,
but somewhat disguised by the excessive                 dilatation   of the      mallei,
and by the soldering         of  the    unci and the rami together, into two
masses,     each  of which     approaches in figure to the quadrant of a
sphere.
   Attention is then directed to what has been called (but by a mis
apprehension) the
                       " stirrup-shaped " armature of the genera Rotifer,
                                                                     2 g 2

                                           294
 Philodina, Actinurus, &c.            Here, however, the organs are proved to
have       no essential diversity      from the common type          ;    their analogy
with      those last described being abundantly manifest, though they are
 still further disguised by         the obsolescence     of the manubria.
    Floscularia         and Stephanoceros,    the most elegant, but the most
 aberrant forms of Rotifera, close the series.                The  mast ax, in these
 genera, is wanting           ;  and in the former genus the incus and the
 manubria          are reduced to extreme evanescence,          though the two-fin
 gered unci show, in their structure, relative position and action, the
 true analogy of these organs.
    Having thus shown that there is but             one model     of structure, how
 ever modified or disguised, in the manducatory organs                     of the Roti
 fera, the       author proceeds to the question of their homology.                   He
 argues on several grounds that they have                 no true affinity with the
 gastric teeth of the Crustacea, though                  he states     his conviction
 that the Rotifera           belong to the     great Arthropodous            division  of
 animals.
     It   is  with the Insecta that the author         seeks to ally these        minute
 creatures       ;  and, by a course   of argument founded       on the peculiarities
 of structure already detailed, he maintains the following identifica
 tions     : — that the    mastax is a true mouth    ;  that the mallei are mandi
 bles   ;    the manubria possibly representing the cheeks, into which they
 are articulated        ; that the rami of the incus are maxillee       ;  and that the
fulcrum represents the cardines soldered together.
     While the author maintains the connexion of Rotifera                           with
 Insecta, through           these  organs in their       highest   development, he
 suggests their affinity with Polyzoa,             by the same         organs at the
 opposite extremity of the scale,            since the oval muscular bulbs in
 Bowerbankia, which             approach and recede in their action on food,
 seem to represent the quadriglobular             masses of Limnias and          Rotifer,
 further degenerated.
     If    this affinity be correctly indicated, the interesting fact is appa
  rent, that the Polyzoa present the point where the two great parallel
  divisions, Mollusca and Articulata, unite in their course towards
  the true Polypi.
     Mr. Gosse's paper is illustrated            by ninety-six figures of entire
  Rotifera, or of the parts under review, all drawn from the life, and,
  for the most part, with a power of 560 diameters.

          I. " On the Perihelia and Nodes of the Planets."
 By Edward J. Cooper, F.R.S.                 Received February 2,      1855.
   Prefatory to my volume on Cometic Orbits, published in 1852,                I
invited the attention of astronomers to the several points of resem
blance between the planetary orbits and those of periodic comets.
Among these it was shown, that of the heliocentric longitudes of
perihelia and ascending nodes of the then known planets and periodic
comets, two-thirds        were situated    in the heliocentric       semicircle
between 315° and 135°.          The planets stood thus in quadrants —
                                  o         O
             L. P.'s between    45 and 135=             9 j
                     between    45 and 135    =
                               135 and   225=4
                               225 and  315=4
                               315 and    45  =
Here the     L. P.'s   appeared  as 16 to 7, and    the ascending nodes      as
14 to 8.      Two additional asteroids were subsequently discovered
leaving the L. P.'s as 16 to 9, and the ascending nodes as 15 to 9.
   Again, in 1853,      I sent a note upon the same subject to the      Royal
Astronomical      Society of London.      At that time   a considerable addi
tion had been made to the asteroids, and the total number of planets
had risen from 25 to 35.          Following the    same   distribution  of the

                                         296
perihelia and ascending nodes as in my previously published work,
the result was —

                                 315 and       45=
     The suspicion of     some yet undiscovered law became strengthened
by this further investigation       ;   and it occurred to me to ascertain                     if
any other heliocentric semicircles would mark the effect of such law
more clearly.       Let   me be permitted to extract the concluding                     pass
age from the note as       it is printed in the Royal Astronomical Society's
Notices : —
  " But    if,
            instead of the semicircles 315° to                  135° and 135° to 315°,
we adopt those from 45° to 225° and 225° to 45°, we see that                            of   the
ascending nodes of thirty-four planets, twenty-eight are found in the
first semicircle and only six in the second.                    Again,     the semicircles
that contain the greatest number of             L. P.'s of planets         are between 0°
and 180°, or 10° and 190°.          That which contains                  the greatest num
ber of nodes      is   between 35° and 215°.               In the first     case there are
twenty-six,      and in the latter twenty-nine.                The quadrant containing
the largest number        of L. P.'s of planets       is   that between     1   1° and 101°,
of which there are sixteen.            That containing           the largest     of   nodes   is
from 35^° to 125^°, of which there are twenty."
   At the present moment (January 1855) we have orbits, more or
less accurate, of forty-one planets.                 It cannot       be altogether unin
teresting to pursue once more            the    traces of       a   law still unknown,        if
it   have existence.      Our position now           stands thus —
            L. P.'s between       45 and       135=                 16

    But,   be   it  remembered,     that in 1853 of the then known planets
 the greatest number of         L. P.'s   were    found to be situated in the
 heliocentric     semicircles 0° to 180° or 10° to 190°.           At present     we
 shall find the perihelia of thirty out of the forty-one planets in either
 of these semicircles.      The greatest number of nodes were then (1853)
 between 35°       and 3 15°= 29 ; and 45° and 225°= 28. At present, of
 forty planets there are thirty nodes in either of these heliocentric
 semicircles.       These facts are at least very singular.        I  may tabulate
 them —
                                                           o         o
          Of forty.    one planets,   L. P.'s between 0 and 180=30
                                                         10 and   190=30
          Of forty planets ft between                   35 and   215=30
                                                        45 and 225=30
                 and between 354° to 355° and 174            to 175=31
    We   here perceive that there are thirty        L. P.'s situated in the helio
 centric semicircle between 0° to 10°            and 180° to 190°.       It is also
 the fact, that there are thirty ascending nodes between 357° to 7°
 and 177° to 187°, which may be called the same semicircle as that
 in which the thirty L. P.'s        are found.
    The quadrant containing the greatest number of L. P.'s of                    the
 forty-one planets, is that between 10° and 100°=20.
    Those containing the greatest number of ascending nodes, are
                     between 36 to 43 and 126 to 133 = 20
              and between 62 to 66 and 152 to            156=20.
    Surely    there    must be     an   undiscovered     cause  determining      the
orbits in this way.        Having laid these facts before my first assistant
Mr. Graham,         he computed the degree        of probability of such     a law,
arguing thus: — "Were the nodes and perihelia indifferent to all
heliocentric longitudes, it would of course be an equal chance in
the case of a planet whose orbit had not been determined, in which
semicircle either would        be  found  ;  and the a priori probability that,

                                                     298
of the forty-one known                  L. P.'s, thirty would             be in one semicircle, is
about           ;   and that of the forty ascending nodes, thirty-one would
be in one semicircle, is about                  4
                                                    6'j
                                                     i     .    Thus   the probability         that there
is   some influence causing                a   tendency to one semicircle, ascertained
from the facts before us,               is   very strong        :   for, for the      L. P.'s,   the odds
are about 660 to              1,   and for the ascending nodes about 4430 to                              1   in
favour of such           a   supposition."          But after all         it   may be an accidental
coincidence         ;    as, consistently           with the laws of planetary motion,
such      a   congregation          of perihelia or              nodes    may occur at periods
exceedingly remote.                 The further consideration of this subject must
be left to analysts,            of leisure and inclination                to pursue it.

          Affinity."           By    J.    H. Gladstone,                  Ph.D., F.R.S.                   Re
          ceived February             1,   1855.
     The question intended to                  be solved in this communication is, —
what takes place               when two binary                   compounds            AB   and    CD      are
brought together under such circumstances that both they them
selves and the products of their mutual action remain free to react                                           ?
Do they, according to               a   generally received opinion, remain unaltered,
or, should the affinities so preponderate, become                                     simply     AB and
CB    ?   Or do     A     and C, according to Berthollet's                       view, divide them
selves in certain proportions between                           B   and   D,    the said proportions
being determined not solely by the difference of energy in the affini
ties, but also by the difference                    of    the quantities of the bodies            ?   And,
supposing the latter to be the correct view, do the amounts of                                            AD
and CB produced by the reaction, increase progressively with the
relative increase             of AB, or do sudden transitions                          occur, such as
Bunsen and Debus have recently observed                                in certain cases where the
products were removed at once from the field of action                                     ?
     A    reply was sought in the colours produced upon mixing different
salts in aqueous solution.                   There were not many coloured salts suit
able for the         purpose, as        it   generally happens                 that   a   base gives the
same colour             with whatever        acid    it    is   combined, and vice versd              ;   but
the   compounds of sesquioxide of iron were peculiarly                                         adapted to

                                       299
the requirements of the experiment, as some are intensely coloured
while others are nearly colourless.
    The circumstances that attended the formation of the blood-red
sulphocyanide were first fully examined.            On mixing known quan
tities of different ferric salts   with known quantities of different sul-
phocyanides, it was found that the whole of the iron was never con
verted into the red salt     ; that the amount of it so converted depended
on the nature both of the acid combined           with the ferric oxide, and
of the base combined with the sulphocyanogen             ;   and that it mattered
not how the bases and acids had been combined previous to their
mixture, so long as the same quantities were brought together into
solution.     The  effect of mass was     fully tried by mixing equivalent
proportions of ferric salts and sulphocyanides, and then adding known
amounts of either one or the other compound.                  It was found that in
either case the amount of red salt was increased            ;   and that when the
numbers of equivalents of the salt added             were taken as abscissae,
and the amounts of red sulphocyanide            produced, as ordinates, the
numbers observed in the experiments gave regular curves, though
not belonging     to the second order.        The curves representing           the
experiments in which sulphocyanide            of potassium was mixed with
ferric nitrate, chloride, or sulphate, appeared            to be the same, but
hydrosulphocyanic       acid gave a different curve.           The deepest colour
was given when nitrate of iron was mixed with the sulphocyanide,
but even upon the admixture of one equivalent of the former with
three of the latter, only 0-194 equiv. of the intensely red ferric salt
was formed, and when 375 equivalents          of sulphocyanide of potassium
had been added there        was still a recognizable amount of nitrate of
iron undecomposed.          It was found that the addition of          a colourless
salt not only reduced the colour of       a solution of ferric sulphocyanide,
but also that the reduction increased in        a  regularly progressive ratio
according to the mass of the salt.
    Other ferric salts were likewise examined.          The black gallate gave
results precisely analogous to those obtained by means of the sul
phocyanide     ; the red meconate also confirmed Berthollet's                views,
but the action of mass was rendered obscure by the formation of
double or of acid salts      ; the red pyromeconate resembled the meco
nate  ; the red acetate bore similar testimony         ;    the blue solution of
the ferric ferrocyanide in oxalic acid gave results fully corroborative

                                        300
  of the influence both of the nature and of the mass of every sub
 stance present at the same time in the mixture             ;  the purple and the
 red comenamate         afforded similar    results    ; while   the red bromide
  (not the oxybromide), though somewhat indistinct in its testimony,
 corroborated to      a certain extent the preceding observations.
    Experiments were performed with a view to determine what effect
 the mass of water might have on the salts operated upon             ;  its influence
 in reducing the colour of the ferric sulphocyanide               was found to be
 very great, but the nature of it could not be exactly determined.
 As however it was uniform in its action in whatever manner the
 sulphocyanide had been produced, it could not affect the results of
 the preceding experiments.          Water did not appear to act in any
 similar manner upon the other ferric salts.
    From the mass of quantitative observations made during the inves
 tigation, it was possible to deduce        not only the order of affinity of
 the various acids for sesquioxide       of iron      as compared with potash,
 but also to assign approximative numbers.               Doubt may rest on the
 position of some terms in the series,              but hydrosulphocyanic        acid
 certainly had the least affinity for ferric oxide in comparison with
potash   : it was represented       by unity    :   the other acids followed in
the order — nitric,      4 ;  hydrochloric,    5  ;   sulphuric,   7 ;   gallic,  10 ;
pyromeconic      ;   meconic   ; acetic,   20  ;     hydrobromic   ;   comenamic     ;
citric, 100; hydroferrocyanic,        170.
    Other coloured salts were submitted to a more cursory investiga
tion.    The scarlet bromide of gold when treated with an alkaline
chloride gave a striking instance of the effect of mass in gradually
overcoming     a   strong affinity.   The intensely red iodide of platinum
afforded results which, though somewhat obscure, were not opposed
in their testimony.        So did the blue sulphate of copper when treated
with different chlorides.        The " manganoso-manganic oxide" dis
solves  in sulphuric or phosphoric acid of a red, and in other acids of
a deep brown        colour  ; and it was found that hydrochloric           acid was
capable of changing the colour of the sulphate according to its mass,
while on the other hand sulphuric or phosphoric acid altered in like
manner the tint of the chloride.         Somewhat similar results were ob
tained by means of the green chloride and the purple fluoride of mo
lybdenum     ; and the blue solution         that forms when gallic acid is
brought in contact with both the oxides of iron at once, bore testi

                                      301
mony to the same general laws.            The peculiar optical character of
certain salts   of quinine     was also     taken advantage of for deter
mining    what changes took place among the compounds in solu
tion.    The amount of fluorescence exhibited by a solution of acid
sulphate of quinine was found to be affected by the admixture of a
chloride, bromide, or iodide according to the nature and the mass of
the salt added, and the addition of sulphuric, phosphoric,          nitric and
other acids was found to produce         a  fluorescence in solutions either
of hydrochlorate of quinine, or of sulphate which had been rendered
non-fluorescent by hydrochloric acid.          Similar results were obtained
with quinidine   ;  and somewhat analogous ones with the organic bases
contained in horse-chestnut         bark, and in tincture of stramonium.
An experiment is      also   narrated showing      that the same laws hold
 good in respect to compound ethers as to salts               having metallic
 bases, alcohol being employed as the solvent.
     Beside the very diversified substances already mentioned in this
 abstract, several others, such as lead, mercury, zinc, potash, soda,
 baryta, lime, and ammonia, are shown by            a more   indirect proof to
 enter into compounds which obey the same laws.               Hence it is con
 cluded that what was observed in reference           to the ferric salts holds
 good very generally,    if not universally.
     The bearing of certain other phenomena upon the question at
 issue was also examined.         The fact that precipitation, when it oc
 curs, gives rise to a perfect interchange of bases and acids, is equally
 consistent with    either Bergmann's        or Berthollet's theory;    but not
 so is the fact that two soluble        salts cannot be mixed without the
 occurrence of precipitation,     if one of  the products that may be formed
  is an insoluble salt.    The only recorded exception to this law, which
  occurs with oxalate of iron in the presence of a salt of yttria, under
  peculiar circumstances,      was found on close examination to be in
  perfect accordance with        the principles    laid down    by Berthollet.
  Besides the argument founded on this universal fact, several expe
  riments were devised      for the purpose of proving that the complete
  precipitation of an insoluble salt on the mixing of two soluble salts,
  was due to the insoluble compound being removed at once out of the
  field of action on the first distribution      of the elements, thus    neces
  sitating a redivision, and so on until no more of it could possibly be
   formed.    The phenomena attending volatilization           have   the same

                                      302
bearing as those      connected with precipitation.      If   by the mutual
action of two salts     a substance be formed, which, though soluble in
water, requires more water for its solution than is present, it crystal
lizes out  : certain experiments were noted where this action occurs,
and it was found that they gave testimony in favour of the same
views as have been supported by the preceding observations.               The
bearing of the phenomenon of diffusion of salts upon the point at
issue    was also examined    : Malaguti's experiments were discussed         ;
and they, as well as some observations on the solution of certain
bodies by others set at liberty, were found to bear testimony also in
the same direction.
   During the whole of the experiments on this subject, most of
which were performed quantitatively,          no unequivocal instance oc
curred of two substances      having so strong an affinity for one another,
that they combined to the exclusion of other bodies of like kind pre
sent in the same solution.       After showing that   some reputed excep
tions are really not capable of being proved to be so, and after sug
gesting some probable limitations of the action of the general law,
the paper concludes with the following deductions         : —
    I. That where two or more binary compounds              are mixed under
such circumstances that all the resulting compounds are free to act
and react, each       electro-positive  element enters into       combination
with   each electro-negative element in certain constant proportions.
    II. That    these  proportions   are  independent   of    the  manner in
which the different elements were primarily arranged.
    III.  That   these proportions    are not merely the resultant      of the
various strengths of affinity of the several substances        for each other,
but are dependent also on the mass of each of the substances              pre
sent in the mixture.
    IV. That an alteration in     the mass of any one   of   the binary com
pounds present alters the amount of every one of the other binary
compounds, and that in a regular progressive ratio          ;  sudden transi
tions only occurring      where  a  substance is present which is capable
of combining with another in more than one proportion.
   V. That this equilibrium of affinities arranges itself in most cases
in an inappreciably short space of time, but that in certain instances
the elements     do not attain their final state of combination for hours.
   VI. That totally different phenomena present          themselves     where

                                       303
precipitation, volatilization, crystallization, and perhaps other actions
occur, simply because one of the substances is thus removed from
the field of action, and the equilibrium           that was first established is
thus destroyed.
   VII.   That consequently         there   is   a   fundamental      error   in  all
attempts to determine the relative strength of affinity by precipita
tion, — in all methods of quantitative analysis founded on the colour
of  a solution   in which colourless salts are also present, — and in all
conclusions    as to what substances exist in a solution, drawn from
such empirical rules as, that       " the strongest acid combines with the
strongest base."

I. "  Researches     on Organo-metallic            Bodies."       By E.    Frank-
      land, Ph.D., F.R.S., Professor of Chemistry in Owens
      College, Manchester.            Second Memoir. — Zincethyl.                Re
      ceived February 9, 1855.
   This compound, whose existence was mentioned in a previous
memoir*, is formed by the action of zinc upon iodide of ethyl, or a
mixture of iodide of ethyl and anhydrous ether, at a temperature ex
ceeding 100° C.       The materials      are enclosed       in a copper digester
capable of resisting great pressure.          When purified by rectification
in an atmosphere of carbonic acid, zincethyl possesses the following
properties  : — At ordinary temperatures it         is a colourless, transparent
and mobile liquid, refracting      light strongly and possessing         a peculiar
 odour, rather pleasant than otherwise, and therefore differing greatly
from that of zincmethyl.         Its specific gravity is 1-182 at            18°  C.
 Exposed to    a  cold of —22° C. it exhibits no tendency to                become
                   * Philosophical Transactions,    1852, p. 436.

                                        30i
solid.    Zincethyl boils at   1 18°   C., and distils unchanged. The spe
cific gravity of its vapour is4-251.           Several analyses of zincethyl
prove its formula to be
                                    C4 Hfl Zn.
    The vapour volume of zincethyl is highly remarkable, and almost
compels us to conclude that the vapour volume of the double atom
of zinc is only equal to that of oxygen, instead of corresponding
with the volume of hydrogen, in accordance with              the generally re
ceived supposition.       Zincethyl,     therefore, appears   to belong to the
so-called water type, and to consist of two volumes of ethyl and one
volume of zinc vapour      ; the three volumes being condensed         to two  :
for   if we were to assume       that an equivalent of zinc occupies the
 same vapour volume as an equivalent of hydrogen, we should then
 have the anomaly of the combination of equal volumes of two radi
cals being attended by condensation.
     Although zincethyl is remarkable for the intense energy of its
 affinities, which place it nearly at the head of the list of electro
 positive bodies, yet it does not appear to be capable of forming any
 true compounds with electro-negative            elements, its reactions being
 all double decompositions in which the constituents of the zincethyl
 separate.     Zincethyl   is spontaneously inflammable in atmospheric
 air or oxygen    ; but when a few drops, diluted with ether to prevent
 inflammation, are passed into a mercurial eudiometer containing dry
 atmospheric air,    a  rapid absorption of oxygen takes place, with the
  formation of    a white amorphous solid composed of zinc, ethyl, and
 oxygen.      This reaction, which is also common           to zincmethyl   and
  zincamyl, led me to suppose         that, like cacodyl, these    bodies com
 bined directly with oxygen       ;  but the results of a closer study of the
  action of oxygen upon zincethyl            prove that no such compound is
  formed   ; the white body being ethylate of zinc, and containing no
  organo-metallic    compound,       in the strict sense of the term.      The
  action of oxygen upon zincethyl is expressed          in the following equa
  tion : —
                         CaonH'H*OZna
     The ethylate of zinc thus produced is          decomposed    by water into
  hydrated oxide of zinc and      alcohol —
                    ZnOC4H5Ol               f C4H,OHO

   Zincethyl   is acted   upon with great energy by iodine          ;  when the
violence of the reaction is moderated, by the application of intense
cold and the intervention      of ether, the      sole  products are iodide of
zinc and iodide    of ethyl —
                          C4H5Znl            fC4HaI
                                1,1  J       L      Znl.
   Bromine acts with explosive violence on zincethyl, but the action
may be moderated by adding the bromine in the form of diffused
vapour and cooling      to 0° C.     The   sole products     of the reaction are
then  bromide of ethyl and bromide of zinc —
                       C4H6Zn-|           fC4H6Br
                          Br, Br J       I      Zn Br.
   Zincethyl burns with     a  lurid flame spontaneously in chlorine gas ;
the zinc and hydrogen are converted into chlorides, whilst carbon is
deposited   in the form of soot.       I have not studied the products of a
more moderate      action, as it is difficult to bring the materials toge
ther without too great an elevation of temperature.                There can be
no doubt, however, that the moderated action              of chlorine would   be
analogous to that of bromine or iodine, and that the products would
be  chloride of ethyl and chloride of zinc —
                       C4H5Znl = fC4Hsa
                           CI, CI  J     I      Zn CI.
   Carefully dried flowers of sulphur          have only a slight action upon
an ethereal solution      of zincethyl,     but the application      of a gentle
heat suffices  to produce a brisk reaction        ;  the sulphur gradually dis
appears,   a white flocculent precipitate is formed, and a strong odour
of sulphide of ethyl developed.          The chief product of this reaction
is the double sulphide     of ethyl   and zinc (mercaptide of zinc), which
is produced as    follows : —
                                                    + ZnS.
                        C4S5|n}=C4H5S
   A little free sulphide of ethyl is      also formed —
                          C4H5Zn-l
                              S.S     J- I    fC4H6S
                                                    ZnS.

                                            30(>
    Finally, zincethyl       is decomposed       by water into oxide of zinc and
hydride of ethyl —
    It is  also similarly acted       upon by the hydrated acids and by the
hydrogen        compounds of chlorine,            bromine,     iodine,     fluorine and
sulphur.
    The behaviour of zincethyl in contact with                  the    electro-negative
elements      is highly remarkable, and cannot fail to have an important
influence upon our views of the condition of bodies at the moment of
chemical change, — a subject so ably discussed by Brodie*, whose in
genious views        I consider to     receive a new support in these reactions
of zincethyl, by the singular way in which ethyl,                   a body low down
in the electro-positive         series,   unites with oxygen, chlorine,           &c, in
the presence       of  a large excess of the intensely electro-positive             zinc
ethyl.      This behaviour also strikingly confirms the suggestions I
ventured to make in my former memoirf,                    relative to the moleculo-
symmetrical form of organo- metallic compounds.                       In  the inorganic
combinations of zinc, this metal unites with one atom only of other
elements      ;  a very unstable peroxide, not hitherto isolated, being the
only exception.          The atom of zinc        appears,   therefore, to have only
one     point of attraction,        and hence,      notwithstanding         the intense
affinities of its compound with ethyl, any union with a second body
is necessarily attended by the expulsion              of  the ethyl.
II. " Note         on the Magnetic Medium."                 By Prof. A. W.         Wil
         liamson.          Communicated by Dr. Sharpey,                       Sec. R.S.
         Received March 15, 1855.
     In  a letter to    Mr. Faraday recently published in the Philosophical
 Magazine,        Dr. Tyndall brings forward some important considera
 tions on the subject of magnetic philosophy.
     It  has been      known     for some time that the phenomena of dia-
 magnetism may be produced artificially in bodies which are usually
    * Philosophical Transactions,     1850, p. 789.              f  Ibid. 1852, p. 438.

                                            307
considered      magnetic.          For this purpose it        is only necessary      to
plunge the magnetic body into a yielding                   medium more magnetic
than itself.     When thus exposed to           the action of a magnet it recedes
from the poles, because             the volume of the medium which             it dis
places is more powerfully            attracted.
   This fact naturally suggested              the idea,   that all repulsion by the
magnet might be owing to the attraction exercised on the medium
being stronger than that on the body repelled ; — just as balloons are
driven upwards by the superior weight of the displaced volume of
air.    And   as phenomena          of diamagnetism      are observed in a so-called
vacuum, it was thought that some "magnetic medium"                           might be
present there.
    I   do   not purpose on this occasion to enter upon the general
question of the evidence             which may be adduced for or against this
important conclusion         ;    for it could only be proved satisfactorily by
considerations including phenomena of the most varied kind, such
as electricity,     light, chemical action, &c, to which it must                neces
sarily apply.        But it might       be disproved by any one well-understood
fact contradictory to it.
     Now it    appears    to me, that the facts adduced by Dr.            Tyndall are
not inconsistent with the notion of a               magnetic medium, but follow
naturally from it       ; and that his argument involves a tacit assumption
foreign to the theory under consideration.
     The first fact    adduced is, that compression increases           the attraction
of magnetic bodies, and the repulsion of diamagnetic bodies by the
 magnet, in the direction of the line of compression. Now it is evident,
 that a variation        of pressure on a number of particles surrounded
 by a magnetic medium may alter the attraction of the mass by a
 magnet in two ways          ; — first, by altering     the density of the matter*;
 secondly, by altering the density of the medium.
     In   a cubical mass of carbonate of iron the               material particles are
 more magnetic than the medium which they displace, and the force
 with which it is attracted is proportional to this excess.
     If  it becomes     more magnetic by compression, we must conclude
 that the loss of magnetic medium from its interstices is more than
 supplied by the magnetic matter which takes its place.
     Carbonate of lime is less magnetic than the quantity of medium
    * The word    " matter"    is here used for brevity to denote ponderable matter.
 VOl. VII.                                                                2 h

                                      308
 which    its particles displace, and when these particles are brought
 closer together by pressure, with diminution of the intervening spaces
 occupied by the medium, the mass becomes more diamagnetic, be
 cause a certain quantity     of the magnetic medium is thus replaced by
 the less magnetic matter.
    Dr. Tyndall     seems   to   have  assumed,   that on the compression
 of an aggregate of particles of a diamagnetic substance, the medium
 is not displaced by the particles in their change of position;    — in which
 case his conclusion,     that compression must increase the magnetic
 functions of every substance,     would no doubt follow from the notion
 of a magnetic medium.
    The second fact adduced differs chiefly in form from the          one  just
 considered.    Crystals of carbonate of iron are attracted most strongly
by a magnet acting in the direction of the crystallographic               axis.
 Crystals of carbonate of lime, possessing the same form, are most
strongly repelled in the direction of the same axis.         In this direction
the functions    of   the  matter predominate more over those of the
medium than in other directions         of the crystal  ;  so that   with car
bonate of iron, we have the strongest magnetism          ; with carbonate of
lime, the strongest diamagnetism in this axis.         One crystal consists
of magnetic medium with strongly magnetic matter; the other               con
sists of the medium with matter of very slight magnetic force.
    The crystallographic      axis is in both crystals      the  direction   in
which the function of matter predominates most strongly over that
of the medium :     so that in the iron salt  it is the most magnetic     ;  in
the lime salt the feeblest magnetic direction in the crystal.

   The following communications              were read  : —
I. "Further        observations      on the Anatomy        of Macgillivraya,
        Cheletropis, and allied genera of pelagic Gasteropoda."              By
       John Denis Macdonald, Esq., R.N., Assistant-Surgeon
        H.M.S.V. 'Torch.' Communicated by Sir W. Burnett,
        K.C.B.      Received February 22, 1855.
   The author     states,   that in a late voyage from Sydney to Moreton
Bay, specimens of Macgillivraya,          Cheletropis and  a few other genera
of minute pelagic Gasteropoda, apparently undescribed, were daily
taken in the towing-net, and afforded him an opportunity of more
precisely determining        the mode of attachment of the ciliated arms
which he had at first presumed to be naked branchiae.
    In his former paper* it was       stated, more particularly  of Cheletropis
                                                              "          "
Huxleyi,    that the gills were of two kinds, viz.              covered      and
"naked;" the former, corresponding to             those of the pectinibranchi-
ate Gasteropoda generally,         he has never found to be absent      in any
of  the genera   ;  but from further observation of the so-called naked
gills, while the animals were alive in their native element, he is dis
posed to    think that they      are chiefly employed for prehension, and
probably as auxiliary         organs    of natation.     When   these   ciliated
appendages     are  fully extended, the line of cilia is perfectly straight,
so   that the frilled border, noticed in the previous account, turns out
to be a character depending simply on the partial contraction of the
longitudinal     muscular fibres, preparatory to complete retraction of
the organs.      They     have no connexion      with the mantle, but encircle
                                * Proceedings, p. 191.
                                                                2 h 2

the mouth together with the tentacula and eyes, and coalesce at their
bases   like the segments    of a deeply-cleft calyx.     In the specimens of
Macgillivraya     examined the arms were quite transparent, but marked
at irregular intervals with cross streaks of brownish purple.           In the
extended state they were several times the length of the shell, and,
like the arms of    a polype, they rolled themselves up when touched,
and started back into the shell with surprising rapidity.            They  ap
peared     also to be exquisitely sensitive, exhibiting       short twitching
movements when minute particles suspended             in the water    came   in
contact with them.
    In the   specimens   of Macgillivraya now referred to, the respiratory
siphon consisted of a process of the mantle converted into a tube by
the mere apposition of its borders without organic union ; it was
moreover much shorter than had been usually observed               in previous
examples, and the author thinks that those now under consideration
may be a variety,      if not a distinct species.
    In his former examinations of this tribe of Gasteropoda, the
 author had never found more than four arms encircling the head, but
he has since discovered six in a single genus with which he had been
long familiar by external characters.          In this   case the operculige-
rous lobe of the foot is quite cylindrical and of some length, bearing
 the peculiar operculum on its truncated extremity with the clawed
 process pointing to the left side.      The sucker-disc is very small, and
 presents an anterior and posterior lobe. The two tentacula bear
 each    an ocellus  on the outer side near the base, and the ciliated
 arms, in every respect save number, resemble          those of Macgillivraya
 and its congeners.        The clawed operculum is developed from a
 spiral nucleus situate near the internal thickened border ; it seems
 to be a weapon of defence, and is wielded with great dexterity by
 the little animal, which makes skips and jerks by means of its com
 plex foot, after the manner of Nassa or Strombus.
     The author notices another      member   of this diminutive tribe which
 is very commonly met with in the South Pacific, and has almost an
  indefinite range.      As regards both animal and shell, it in many
  points resembles a     miniature Natica. The shell is few-whorled, with
  small compressed     spire and ventricose mouth     ; the operculum pauci-
  spiral and well-marked      with the lines of growth.        The foot is not
  unlike   a  broad and square-toed shoe in form, receiving or bearing

                                      311
  the remainder    of the animal and the shell.        The shoe-upper,      as  it
  were, presents two rounded lateral lobes        which lie over the anterior
  part of the shell, like the mentum of Natica.             The little animal
  creeps  on its foot with  great rapidity, appearing     rather to slide along
  than progress by a vermicular movement,          and by spreading out and
 hollowing    this organ at the surface of the water, as a freshwater
 Lymnaead    forms a boat of its foot, it buoys up its tiny body and is
 cast abroad on the face of the ocean.
     The paper    was illustrated   with coloured figures of most of the
 objects described.
 II.  On the Anatomy of Nautilus umbilicatus, compared with that
       of Nautilus Pompilius."           By John Denis Macdonald,
       Esq., R.N.       Communicated by Sir W.            Burnett, K.C.B.
       Received February 22, 1855.
                                            '
    During   a visit of H.M.S.V.    '
                                      Torch     to the Isle of Pines in    July
 1854,   a recent specimen      of Nautilus umbilicatus    was picked up on
 the outer reef off Observatory Island.       It was alive when brought       on
board, but was too much exhausted to exhibit active movements.
Part of the hood appeared to have been eaten away behind by some
predaceous enemy, but in other respects the animal was perfect.
    The body when retracted lay more deeply in the shell than that
of N. Pompilius, so that no part was visible in a lateral view, and on
account of the great depth of the chamber of occupation the orifice
of the siphuncle in the last septum could not be seen when the soft
parts were removed.       As to this difference, however, the author ob
serves that   it may  depend   on the time elapsed since the formation         of
the last partition.
    Apart from the shells, the author finds a close          resemblance     be
tween the corresponding parts of the two species.
    The specimen of N. umbilicatus examined          proved   to be a  female   ;
a fact which may serve to modify the views          of  those who, adopting
the speculations of D'Orbigny on the sexes of the Ammonites as in
dicated by the characters of their shells, apply them also               to the
several kinds    of Nautili known.

                                       312
    The body of     N.  umbilicatus    is larger and       more  elongated than
 that of N. Pompilius     as  it occurs in the South        Seas,   although the
 specimens   of the latter species brought from the Chinese Seas much
 exceed both in size.     In the N.    umbilicatus,    the longitudinal    lamellae
 on the median lobe    of  the external labial processes        are divided by a
 wide groove into two lateral sets, and the corresponding lamellae be
 tween the internal labial processes        are about seventeen         in number
 and of considerable thickness. In N. Pompilius, the latter           lamellae are
 much thinner and more numerous, and the lateral sets of the former
 are united together    in the median line, commencing anteriorly with
 an azygos transverse      lamina.     In both kinds, however, the corre
 sponding tentacula may be distinctly           traced out, with only such
 minor differences as might be expected to occur in different speci
 mens   of either separately     ;  the digital,    labial   and ocular groups
 agreeing sufficiently both as to number and character in the two
 cases, considering the    liability of  these parts to slight modifications,
from arrest of development or redundance, in the same species.
    Referring to former observations of his own on the eye of             N. Pom
pilius, the author observes that they closely apply to N. umbilicatus,
which affords confirmation of his opinion that the pigmentary coat
ing is subjacent to the retina.        He finds   no vestige of a lens, and in
place of vitreous humour,          a mere    viscous matter protecting          the
retina from the sea-water.
    The organ of hearing, which had escaped detection in the                 speci
men of N. Pompilius dissected by Professor Owen, altered                      as  it
doubtless had been by long immersion in spirit, was discovered in
the example of    N. umbilicatus examined by the author.               It consists
of two spheroidal acoustic capsules placed,           one on each side,      at the
union of the supra and suboesophageal         ganglia, and measuring about
one-twelfth of an inch in diameter.           Each capsule rests internally
against the nervous mass, and is received on its outer side into a
little depression in the cephalic cartilage.          It is enveloped in a kind
of fibrous tissue and filled with a cretaceous pulp consisting of mi
nute, elliptical, otoconial particles, presenting under a high power a
bright point near each end, varying much in size, and sometimes
combined into stellate, cruciform         or other figures.      Cilia were not
observed within the capsules.
    The inside of  the mouth is furnished with three groups of papillae,

                                        313
one   of which occupies      the median line between the orifice of the
tongue-sac and commencement of the oesophagus.                    These lingual
papillae,  as  well  as the     rest, are clothed with long and slender
columnar epithelium-particles.
    The author   agrees with      Mayer in regarding      the well-known     folli
cular appendages     of  the    afferent   branchial vessels of the Cephalo
poda, as performing     the function        of kidneys, but admits that they
may also serve,   by altering their capacity, to regulate the amount of
blood passing through        the branchiae      under changes of pressure       to
which the animal may be subjected at different depths.                These fol
licles are subcylindrical     in form, and somewhat dilated at the free
extremity, to which is appended           a folded and funnel-shaped process
of membrane     which expands rather suddenly and presents              a jagged
border.    They   open by an oval or         slit-like orifice into the afferent
branchial vessels, on each of which, as Professor Owen has observed,
they are disposed    in three clusters.       The outer membrane is smooth
and glossy, homogeneous in structure, and sprinkled               over  with mi
nute, rounded, transparent bodies, resembling the nuclei of cells.
Beneath this layer, flat bundles of fibres, apparently muscular, are
traceable  here and there, principally        disposed in a longitudinal    direc
tion, and sometimes     branched.         The lining   membrane    consists of a
loose epithelial   pavement, similar in many respects            to that of the
uriniferous   tubules of the higher animals, the cells containing,             be
sides the nuclei, numerous minute oil-globules, or a substance much
resembling concrete fatty matter.              This membrane is thrown up
into very numerous papillae          and corrugations,      so as greatly to in
crease the extent    of surface.      The    papillae  are more numerous to
wards the attached end, and a circlet of longitudinal                folds, with
transverse zigzag corrugations,          radiate from the bottom of the fol
licle, in which a number of small pits or fenestrations are sometimes
visible.   The funnel-shaped membranous process above noticed is
continuous with the lining membrane. The cavity of each follicle,
therefore, communicates with the exterior through the centre of this
process,  and the aperture is thus guarded by a kind of circular valve
permitting the escape of secreted matters, but effectually preventing
the entrance   of fluid from without.
    Some considerations        are next     offered   in support of the view
adopted   as to the functions of these vascular appendages.

                                       314
     Lastly,  on the question whether the peculiarities       of structure    re
 cognized respectively in     N. Pompilius and N. umbilicatus         are suffi
 cient to establish a difference   of  species, or are attributable merely to
 variety, the author observes, that any tendency in a being to revert
 to an original type, when such has been determined, betrays variety;
 but this tendency is never manifested in the Nautili under conside
 ration by the occasional occurrence of specimens          presenting charac
 ters which place them intermediately           between    N. Pompilius      and
 N. umbilicatus. Having visited the Fijii         Islands since he formerly
 wrote on N. Pompilius, he finds that the umbilicated Nautili are not
 known to the natives, although N. Pompilius is very plentiful ; but at
 Fatuna or Wallis's Island, where both are found, the people recog
 nize the difference between them depending on the presence                    or
 absence   of umbilical pits. On this the author remarks, that although
 particular localities, with all attending circumstances, may favour
 the production     of varieties, yet the permanence of the distinctive
characters of these Nautili without symptom of amalgamation, and
the discovery of a female        specimen of     N. umbilicatus,   are   strong
arguments in support of the view that they are distinct                species,
though very closely allied.
    Further descriptive details       are  given in the explanation of the
figures which accompany the memoir.
III.   "On     a Class   of Differential Equations, including those
       which occur in Dynamical Problems." — Part II. By W.
       F. Donkin, M.A., F.R.S., F.R.A.S., Savilian Professor of
       Astronomy in the University of Oxford.            Received February
       17, 1855.
    This is the second and concluding part of          a paper of which the
first part was printed in the Philosophical          Transactions    for 1854.
In the fourth section (the first of this part)    some of the most import
ant results of the former part are recapitulated.
    In the fifth section the theory of the Variation of Elements is con
sidered under that aspect which belongs to         it in connexion with the
general methods of this paper       ;  and the facility of its application is
shown in two instances:        (1) the expressions for the variations of

                                             315
 the elliptic elements       of  a disturbed planet's orbit are deduced           from
 the results       of Art. 30 (Part        I.),  on undisturbed elliptic motion        ;
 (2)   the problem of determining the motion of a free simple pendulum
 (omitting the effect of the earth's rotation) is treated by considering
 the orbit of the projection of the bob upon a horizontal plane as a dis
 turbed ellipse. The differential equations which define the variations
 of the elements       of the ellipse are given in a rigorous form, and inte
 grated approximately so as to give the motion of the apsides of the
 mean     ellipse in any case where the pendulum never deviates much
 from the vertical, and the motion is not very nearly circular.                    The
 result agrees with the conclusions               of the Astronomer     Royal (Pro
 ceedings     of the Royal Astronomical           Society, vol. xi. p. 160).
    In   the fifth section the transformation of the differential equations
 by the substitution of new variables is considered, and particularly
 that kind of transformation, called by the author a normal trans
formation, which leads            to a new system of equations, not merely
 possessing the same general form as the old, but distinguished also
 by other common properties.                A definition is given of those trans
 formations which may be properly called, from analogy, transforma
 tions   of  coordinates, and it is shown that all transformations of coor
 dinates are normal.         General formulae are given for transforming the
 equations of any dynamical problem from fixed or moving systems of
 axes of coordinates ; and an illustration is drawn from the case of the
 motion of      a  planet referred to axes in the varying plane of its own
 orbit.
    In the      seventh   and last section the principles of transformation
 developed       in the preceding section are applied in a more general
 manner to the differential equations of the planetary theory ; and
                                                                                      it
 is shown that when the motions of a planetary system are referred
                                                                             sun, and
 to  a  system of rectangular axes having their origin in the
 otherwise moving in any arbitrary manner, the variations of
                                                                              the ele
 ments will still be determined by the same formulae as if
                                                                             the axes

 each planet, the expression

 in which     i  is the inclination of the orbit to the (moving) plane of xy,

                                                                   x, and to0, to,, wJ ;

axes themselves.        In this expression   tu0,  ai;, co2 may be any arbitrary
functions either of the time or of the elements; but in any case these
functions are to be exempted from differentiation with respect to the
elements     in taking the partial differential coefficients of the disturb
ing function.
   This result is illustrated by referring        the motion of a system con
sisting of     two planets to axes so chosen that the plane of xy shall
always coincide with the principal plane of the system, and the axis
of x, from which all longitudes are reckoned, shall always coincide
with the line of nodes        ;  there are thus obtained twelve rigorous
simultaneous differential equations, of which               nine form a system
apart, containing only the major axes, excentricities, epochs, longi
tudes of perihelia, and         mutual inclination       of the two orbits, and
afford   an example      of the    so-called "elimination of the nodes;"
whilst the remaining three (which contain also these nine elements,
but not their differential coefficients) determine the motion of the
principal plane and of the line of nodes,               relatively to fixed space.
The mutual inclination          of the two orbits being supposed           known,
their several inclinations       to the principal     plane are given by simple
relations  ;   and the positions      of the planets in their orbits (their
longitudes reckoned from the line of nodes) being supposed known,
their motions relatively to fixed space would thus be completely
determined.
IV. Extract of        a  Letter, dated January 6, 1855, from J.              Mit
       chell,     Esq., Quartermaster of Artillery, Bangalore,
                                                                             " On
       the Influence of Local Altitude on the Burning of the Fuses
       of Shells."
   " In the
                early part of the year 1848, at the annual practice of         the
Artillery in this garrison, it was observed that the fuses burned              too
long   a time.     The regular burning of      fuses being a matter       of much
importance, the circumstance was duly reported to Artillery Head
Quarters, and a portion of each kind was directed to be sent to
St. Thomas's       Mount (eight miles from Madras              and   on the same

                                        317
 level) for examination, where they were found to burn correctly, and
 as at that time no one suspected the real cause of the discrepance,              it
 was concluded there had been some error in the length of our pen
 dulum, and there for the time the matter rested.
     " But  as I was satisfied, for many reasons, that it was not owing to
 an   error in the pendulum, I determined to keep the subject in mind,
 and    for the practice in the following year (1849) I caused to be
 made an adjustable pendulum which beat seconds very correctly for
 several minutes.       This pendulum was daily compared with two or
 more seconds'     watches to make       all safe, and, as our longest time of
 flight did not exceed twenty seconds, no error could possibly arise
 from this source.        The result was that the        fuses again burnt too
long at Bangalore,         and were again found to burn              correctly   at
St. Thomas's Mount.
    ''
       This was  a  mystery to all  ;  but after the matte rhad cost me much
thought, it occurred to me that the cause was to be sought in the
difference    of altitude between St. Thomas's Mount and Bangalore,
nearly 3000 feet      ; and as a means of putting this to the test,          I sug
gested that some fuses should be burnt at the            Mount, or     at Madras,
under a receiver, exhausted until the barometer stood at the Banga
lore mean height, or about 27 inches.              This, however, it was not
found convenient to do       ; but, as an equally satisfactory way of test
ing the accuracy of my conclusions, a small number of fuses were
prepared     and burnt    at St. Thomas's Mount, at Bangalore,              and at
two different altitudes on the Neilgherry            Hills,  as will   be seen by
the annexed copy of an official memorandum             ; and although this ex
periment was too limited        to enable us to compile a scale of the pro
bable times a certain length of fuse composition would burn at given
altitudes, it amply proves the fact that combustion is retarded at
considerable elevations.
    " Memorandum of an experiment to ascertain whether the atmo
sphere influences the burning of fuses : —
    " Eighteen 8-inch fuses, made of the same description of wood
(Congo), were filled with composition            made for the purpose.         The
same man drove the whole on the morning of the 2nd August 1849,
using the same mallet and drifts. Six of the fuses were burnt at the
Mount, six at Bangalore, and six on the Neilgherry Hills ; all in the

    The following communications          were read   : —
I. " On      the existence of an element of Strength in beams sub
       jected to Transverse      Strain, arising from the Lateral Action
       of the fibres or particles on each other, and named by the
       author the ' Resistance to Flexure.' " By William Henry
        Barlow, Esq., C.E., F.R.S. Derby.           Received February 23,
        1855.
   The author        commences   by observing,    that under the existing
theory of beams, which recognizes only two elements of resistance,
namely      tension and compression, the strength of a beam            of cast
iron cannot      be reconciled   with the results of experiments on the
direct tensile strength, if the neutral axis is in the centre of the
beam.
    He then      proceeds   to describe experiments made on two solid
beams     of  cast  iron to determine the position of the neutral axis.
The   beams employed were        7 feet long,  6 inches deep and 2 inches
thick,    on each     of which small vertical ribs were     cast,   12 inches
 apart  ;  nine small holes were drilled opposite to each other in each
rib, for the purpose of inserting the pins of      a delicate measuring in
strument.       The distances of the holes of the centre division of both
beams     were measured      under various strains, and the results show
that the extensions and compressions proceed             in an arithmetical
ratio from the centre to the upper and lower sides of the beam           ; and
 that at any given distance on either side of the centre, the amount
of extension is equal to the amount of compression.
    The position of the neutral axis being thus conclusively ascertained
 to be in the centre, it is shown that, not only the ultimate strength,
    VOl.    Vii.                                                  2 K

                                       320
but also the amount of extension and compression with a given
strain, indicates the existence of another element of resistance, in
addition to the resistances to extension and compression.
   The author then points out, that in applying the law of " ut
                " to
tensio sic vis        contiguous fibres, under different degrees of exten
sion and compression, the effect of the lateral adhesion has been
omitted, and each fibre has been supposed to be capable of taking
up the same degree of extension or compression as            if it acted sepa
rately, and independently of the adjoining fibres.
   It   is then shown that this supposed independent action of the
fibres is inconsistent with other practical results, and evidence is
exhibited of a powerful         lateral action when unequal strains are
exerted.
    From these and other considerations,           the author is led to think
that the effect of the lateral action, tending to modify the effect of
the unequal and opposite strains in a beam, constitutes,            in effect, a
" resistance to flexure " acting in addition to the resistances of
tension and compression.
    In order    to   ascertain whether       the apparent difference in the
amount of tensile strength when excited by direct and transverse
strains is clue to flexure, the author caused open beams or girders to
be made, each      of which was formed by two bars of metal ; the upper
 and lower bars of the same beam were in every case of the same
form and dimensions        ; but the depth of metal and the distance to
which the bars were separated           vertically, was varied in the several
forms of girder experimented upon.             By  these means the bar form
 ing the lower side of each girder was torn asunder under different
 degrees    of flexure.     The different forms of girder experimented
 upon were of equal length, and were compared with solid beams and
 with bars of the same metal broken by direct tensile strain.
    From the mean of four experiments on each form of girder, the
 value of the total resistance at the outer fibre is ascertained, and
 exhibits the following results      : —
     1.  In girders having the      same depth of metal, namely about 2
 inches, but the total depth of the girder,             and consequently     the
 deflections different —

namely tension and compression, the strength of a beam of cast

  the girders, directly as the amount of deflection into the depth of
  the metal.
     The paper concludes by pointing out the important amount of
  this resistance, the operation of which has been hitherto unknown,
  and which in cast iron exceeds the tensile strength of the metal, and
  shows that comparisons of the strength of different forms of section,
 based    on the existing theory, which assumes the resistance at the
  outer fibre to be constant and equal to the tensile strength of the
 metal, must be entirely fallacious.
     The paper is accompanied by full details of all the experiments,
 and the measurements for determining the position of the neutral
 axis.
 II. "On      the Metallic    and some other Oxides,        in relation   to
        Catalytic Phenomena."         By the Rev. J. Eyre Ashby.
        Communicated by the Rev. John Barlow, F.R.S.                    Re
       ceived March 8, 1855.
    I purpose to detail some experiments on the metallic (and a few
 other) oxides, made with a view to ascertain their powers to produce
 and maintain, catalytically,   the combustion of various gases and va
pours   ;  and to annex such considerations as appear to be suggested
by the facts.     By catalysis  I  understand the operation of one body
upon another, under favourable circumstances, whereby the second
body is resolved into new chemical combinations,            while the first
(whatever      may happen during      the process) remains      finally un
changed.      This must be taken as not including        explosion by per
cussion, in which the change takes place owing            to the external
application of dynamic force.
    The apparatus for experimenting comprehends a variety of shal
low capsules ; wire-gauze, of iron, copper, and brass, of different de
grees of fineness,    cut into discs a little larger than the vessels    on
which they are to be superimposed       ;  a spirit-lamp with large wick   ;
a pair of pliers, and a few rings      of wire to support the gauze, if
necessary, while heating it in the     spirit flame.   The method of pro
cedure    is simple : the watch-glass,    or capsule, is nearly filled with

                                        3:23
the    liquid   whose vapour is to be tried         ;    on a wire-gauze      disc is
spread the oxide whose powers as a catalyser are to be tested,                    and
this being warmed (more or less) over the lamp, is set down upon
the upper rim of the capsule.           Sometimes it is necessary to heat a
layer of the oxide in the middle of a small combustion-tube,                      and
pass over it the gas, or mixture of gases.
   I tried the following substances with pyroxylic spirit (hydrated
oxide of methyl) and alcohol separately.
    1.   Co.O    appeared  to possess    the power in some degree,          but per
 haps the specimen was in too dense               agglomeration, which         is not
 essentially reduced by trituration.
   2. Co2 03 maintained the catalytic combustion very well.
   3.    Ag.O, reduced to metallic silver, which shows                a strong ten
dency on gauze, and acts perfectly in the combustion-tube.
   4. U2 03,      HO   became,    at red heat, anhydrous          mixture    of U O
and    U304, showing strong tendency. A very pure specimen cata
lysed the vapour as it changed from yellow to green, after which it
died away.        Will  not act below 570° (F.).
   5.    Sn.O; strong tendency.
   6. Sn.O^;       slight tendency.
   7.    W.O., apparently produces the         effect    if placed while glowing,
over alcohol, but gradually dies away, as             if very slowly cooling.
   8. Pb3 04 changed to Pb . O, and showed a strong tendency, but
quickly    faded and grew cold.
   9. Cd, O, placed while very warm over              pyroxylic spirit, burst into
glow and catalysed, but always died off after the lapse of from half a
minute to two or three minutes, and then became incapable.
   10.    Ca.O (on the gauze), no        effect.
   11.    Si . 02 exhibited  a tendency.
   1 2.   Stourbridge clay    ;  no effect.
   13. A1203 appeared to have no effect in maintaining catalytic
combustion on the gauze, but when made red-hot and quenched in
absolute alcohol, it changed from pure white to a black substance
and oxidized a portion         of the alcohol.        That this   is not owing     to
carbon in the alcohol is evident, because               the same change occurs
when it is quenched in strong liquid ammonia.                  I suspect that it is
a new oxide of aluminium.
   14.    Ni203, formed by heating carbonate of nickel nearly                to red

                                           324
 ness, failed   ;  prepared from the common nitrate, it acted for a short
 time   ; reduced as an intensely black velvety substance from the purest
 nitrate, then warmed but not made red-hot, it glowed and catalysed
 with alcohol or ether.         With pyroxylic spirit, it was left at the end
 of the operation of       a greenish drab, which I suspect to be a mixture
 of Ni2 03 with Ni.O, although it may be Ni2 Os changed only in ap
 pearance, for when treated with nitric acid no nickel is dissolved.
     15.   Mn02 is changed at        red heat into MnaOa, which, with            alco
 hol, ether, and pyroxylic spirit, continues the slow combustion very
 steadily.     A specimen of very pure Mn2 03 acted extremely well, as
 did also    a portion of
                             " euchrome "          hydrated sesquioxide of man
                                               (a
 ganese (impure) dug from the estate                of Lord Audley), after being
 heated in the air to drive away the carbonaceous matter with which
 it  was mingled.        Mn, 03 will, if sufficient        care  be taken, catalyse
 the moist gas arising from a strong solution              of ammonia.
     16. Fe2 03, when in the state of a         light puffy powder,    catalyses   the
vapour of ether, alcohol, and pyroxylic              spirit, only requiring     to be
heated on the gauze before           it is laid over the capsule.       It is cheap,
 easily employed, and of invariable action.              I have kept up     the com
 bustion for several hours on        a  surface of 120 square inches.
     By   means of a catalytic lamp in which the liquid employed is con
tinually supplied from        a reservoir and maintained at a constant level
in the capsule,      I  have used   7  or 8 square inches continuously during
thirty-six hours.         This lamp I     have occasionally used for laboratory
purposes, where a gentle and equable heat was required for several
hours.
     Pursuing     my experiments with the oxides of the metals, heated
on wire gauze,        I tried as many as     I could procure or       make, and by
a   tolerably wide induction        I   found that the sesquioxides        have   the
strongest tendency to produce and maintain the catalytic glow, and
do produce      it in every   case in which they are not decomposed            by the
amount of heat required to begin the operation.
    When hydrated        Fe2 O., is heated and placed over
                                                                  alcohol, its colour
is deepened       towards black, but not uniformly,             and when cold the
original colour returns.          But if it  be made red-hot and quenched in
boiling alcohol out of contact with air, it is converted into hydrated
Fe304,      and remains permanently           a deep    black magnetic powder,
soluble in acids.        A strong solution of ammonia           may be substituted

                                         325
for the alcohol with the same effect,           but in this case some of the
 sesquioxide will remain unaltered and mixed with the black oxide.
The alcohol or ammonia is correspondingly                 changed by oxidation
derived from the oxygen which has been released from combination
with the iron.      If  the hydrated Fe3 04 be heated in contact with air,
it immediately (even when it has been kept for many months) be
comes Fe2 03 by oxidation from the atmosphere, but              if heated to red
ness in vacuo,    it cools unchanged.         [Can   the black powder     of alu
mina be Al3 04, formed in a similar way ?]             The process of catalysa-
tion by Fe2 03 is thus evident ; the heated sesquioxide loses a por
tion of oxygen to the alcohol and becomes            Fe3 04, which is instantly
reconverted into Fe2 03 by receiving oxygen from the air, and this
alternation is constantly going on in every portion of the glowing
mass.      It is not   a mere action de presence,       but alternate reduction
and oxidation of the sesquioxide,          producing     a continuous oxidation
of the alcohol.
    This suggests a consideration apparently adverse to the atomic
hypothesis of Dr. Dalton.          How can a single compound molecule
Fe2 03 be changed by deoxidation            into another compound molecule
Fe304, when, according to theory, there are in it but two combining
proportions of iron, whereas the resultant contains three             ? and how
(by deoxidation) can the resultant molecule contain             four combining
proportions of oxygen when          the primary contained only three      ?  We
can indeed represent to the imagination            that three molecules of the
sesquioxide, acting as      if they  were one triple molecule, lose one com
bining proportion of oxygen, and are converted into two molecules
of the black oxide     ;  and conversely,     that two molecules of the black
oxide, acting as    if they were     one  double molecule, combine with       one
atom    of oxygen, and     are converted into three atoms        of sesquioxide.
The only way to account for this, in accordance with the popular
atomic theory, seems to be, to assume             that the notation for these
oxides is incorrect, and that
                     for Fe203 we should write Fe0Ofl,
                and for Fe3 04 we should write Fe6 08.
   If  the current notation be retained, and any law be admitted, in
virtue of which three molecules of sesquioxide may suffer reduction
as  if they were only     one molecule, and divide into two molecules of
the magnetic oxide, we might conceive a peculiar structure in the

                                          326
Fe3 04,   with    a tendency to separate again into     FeO,  Fe2 03  ; that it is
really in combination        as Fe3 04, but ready to yield to slight causes
and become       FeO,   Fe2 03.     This would explain Mr. Mercer's experi
ment (quoted by        Brande,  I.  716, edition 1848) of the chemical union
of a mechanical mixture of protoxide and peroxide of iron.
   Perhaps the sesquioxides occupy a middle place in the scale of
effects.    Take     the case  of iron  ;  we have
          Fe + O. pyrophorus,      — violent oxidation,
         Fe2O3-|-NH3 + 0i alternate reduction and oxidation,
          Fe 03 +     NH3 (in water), reduction.
   To show       the last, add ammonia to a solution         of Fe03, KO, and
Fe2 03   will   be precipitated.
   A mixture of ten parts by weight of powdered chlorate of potassa
with   one part    of  Fe2 03 disengages oxygen      with extreme facility and
great economy of heat as compared with the oxides of copper and
manganese      ;  and it is the more convenient because n grains of the
mixture will represent almost exactly n cubic inches of disengaged
oxygen.
   A  state of mechanical division          is not absolutely necessary   for the
catalysation of some inflammable vapours by Fe2 03 ; an old nail,
entirely transmuted into rust, will perform the operation ; and when
we consider that in many cases of fermentation, decay and putrefac
tion, this oxide may be present, divided or aggregated, while heat is
evolved,    and inflammable gases and vapours are set free, we may
hereafter be able to trace some instances of

bustion

       By James Jago, A.B. Cantab., M.B. Oxon., Physician to
       the Royal        Cornwall     Infirmary.     Communicated by Pro
       fessor    Stokes, Sec. R.S.           Received March 5, 1855.
   The present communication            is a revised and modified version    of  a
paper bearing the same title, which was read on the 18th of January
and 1st of February, and which was, by permission, withdrawn.                The
chief modification applies to the author's views respecting the struc

                                     327
ture of the vitreous body as deduced from entoptical phenomena. He
is now of opinion that the arborescent system of which he infers the
existence  in that part of the eye (Proceedings, p. 209) does not con
sist of tubes filled with globules or cells, as he at first supposed, but
of cell-constituted filaments.     In a  note, dated March 27, 1855, he
gives the  following enunciation of his present views      as to the struc
ture of the vitreous body    : —
    " In the vitreous humour      are innumerable    transparent globules,
beads   or cells, of less specific gravity      than the fluid,   extremely
minute, and of uniform size, which are arranged, without exception,
in rows to form the threads of a lax, elongated, irregular             web,
springing   from the general surface of the capsule by, commonly,
exquisitely small meshes,      and extending into the interior by others
of increasing size, so that the innermost part of the web — which lies
 nearer the circumference    of the vitreous body than its centre — con
sists of comparatively large ones.
    " Whenever the     eye rotates, this filamentous peripheral      system
will in its relative (counter) rotation, gradually, though soon, come to
the end of its tether, and in this interval and when there, act as a
check upon the relatively rotating fluid      ; perpetually reiterating ob
struction, above all in the immediate vicinity of the capsule and (by
 the disposition of the threads to float vertically)    most effectually in
the most important or horizontal          direction.   The middle of the
 vitreous body being free of impediment, relative rotation of the fluid
 expends itself there, whilst   a practical concurrence in the ocular ro
 tation ensues near the capsule.       And thus in the incessant      move
 ments of the eye, head and body, the      wall that confines the fluid can
 suffer no severe concussions from eddies         in the latter.   In other
 words, we have herein a provision that the crystalline lens may not
 be shaken, the circulation in the retinal vessels may not be deranged,
 and sensations of light   may not be ever assailing us from impulses
 of the vitreous fluid, perhaps that the retina may not itself suffer
 direct injury therefrom."

IV. "An Account of            some Experiments made with the Sub
       marine Cable of the Mediterranean Electric Telegraph."
       By Charles Wheatstone, F.R.S.                   Received     March 29,
       1855.
    The following results were obtained between May 24              and  June  8
in last year, with the telegraphic         cable manufactured by Messrs.
Kuper and Co. of East Greenwich,            for the purpose of being laid
across    the Mediterranean      sea, from Spezia on the coast of       Italy to
the island of Corsica.         The manufacturers,        in conjunction     with
Mr. Thomson the engineer of the undertaking, kindly                afforded  me
every   facility in carrying on the experiments.          The short time that
elapsed     between the opportunity presenting itself and the shipping
of  the cable for its destination, prevented me from determining            with
sufficient accuracy some points of importance, respecting which                 I
was only able to make preliminary experiments, but the following,
which     I  was able to effect with the means         at hand, may possess
sufficient interest to be made public.       They present perhaps nothing
theoretically new, but      I am not aware that experimental verifications
of  some of these points have been made before.             I assume that the
reader is acquainted with the experiments of Dr. Faraday described
in the Philosophical      Magazine,    N. S., vol. vii. p.  197.
    The cable was    110 miles in length, and contained six copper wires,
one-sixteenth      of an inch in diameter,     each   separately insulated in
a covering     of gutta percha one-tenth of an inch in thickness.           The
whole was surrounded by twelve thick iron wires twisted spirally
around it, forming      a complete metallic envelope       one-third of an inch
in thickness.      A section of the cable presented     the six wires arranged
in  a circle of half an inch diameter, and one-fifth of an inch from the
internal surface of the iron envelope.
    The cable was coiled in     a dry well in the yard, and one of its ends
was brought into the manufactory.             The wires were numbered          1,
 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and the ends in the well were indicated by an accent             ;
the ends      1'2, 2'3, 3'4, 4'5, 5'6 were connected by supplementary
wires, so that the electric current might be passed in the same direc
tion through all the six wires joined to a single length, or through

                                      329
 any lesser number of them, the connexions being made at pleasure
 in the experimenting room.
    The rheomotor employed was          an insulated      voltaic battery con
 sisting of twelve troughs, each of twelve elements, which had been
 several weeks in action.
                                 First Series.
    The following experiments show that       the iron envelope     of the com
 pound conductor gives rise to the same           phenomena of induction
 which occur when the insulated wire is immersed in water, as in
 Dr. Faraday's experiments.
    Exp. 1. One end of the entire length, 660 miles, was brought in
 connexion with one of the poles of the battery, the other end re
 maining insulated.     The wire     became    charged with negative elec
 tricity when its end touched the zinc pole, and with positive elec
 tricity when it communicated with the copper pole.                 A current,
 indicated by a galvanometer placed near the battery, existed as long
 as the charge was going on, and ceased when           it arrived at its maxi
 mum.     [The  feeble current attributed to imperfect insulation, which
 continues as long as the contact with the battery remains, is here left
 out of consideration.]      When the wire was charged, and the dis
 charge effected by a wire communicating with the earth, the current
 produced was in the same direction, whether the discharge was made
 near the battery or at the opposite end        ; i. e.  the current in both
 cases proceeded from the wire to the earth in the same direction.
    Exp.  2.  On bringing    one end of the wire     in contact with     one  of
the poles of the battery, the other pole having no communication
with the earth, the wire remained uncharged.                A very slight and
scarcely perceptible tremor was observed in the galvanometer needle
interposed between the battery and the wire.
    Exp. 3. To    each of the poles of the battery was attached          a wire
220 miles in length, and similar galvanometers were interposed be
tween the two wires (the remote extremities of which remained in
sulated) and the battery.       So long as one wire alone was connected
with   the battery no charge was communicated to           it, but on connect
ing   the other wire   with   the opposite pole both wires were instan
taneously charged, as the strong deflection of both needles rendered
evident.     On bringing   the free end   of one of the wires in communi

                                       330
 cation with the earth it alone was discharged, the other wire remain
 ing fully charged.
                               Second Series.
    Exp. 4. One pole of the battery was connected with the earth,
 and the other with 660 miles of wire, which had an earth commu
 nication at its opposite end    ;   three   galvanometers were interposed
 in the course of the conductor    ;  the first near the battery, the second
 in the middle of the wire, i.   e.   330 miles from each extremity, and
 the third at the remote end near the communication with the earth.
 When the connexion of the battery with the wire was completed,
 the galvanometers were successively acted upon in the order of their
 distances from the battery, as in the experiments recorded by Dr.
 Faraday.    When   the earth connexion at the remote extremity of the
 wire, on the contrary, was completed, the disturbance of equilibrium
 commenced at this end, and the galvanometers successively acted in
 the reverse order, i. e. the galvanometer which was the most distant
 from the battery was the first impelled into motion.           In the latter
 case, before the completion   of the circuit the    needles of the galvano
meters had assumed constant deflections to          a limited extent, owing
to a feeble current arising from the uniform dispersion of the static
electricity along the wire.
    Exp. 5. The two extremities of the 660 miles of wire were brought
into connexion with the opposite poles of the battery.            When one
of the   ends  previously disconnected from the battery was united
therewith, the galvanometers at the extremities of the wire, and con
sequently which were at equal distances from the poles of the bat
tery, were immediately and simultaneously acted upon, while that
which was in the middle of the wire was subsequently caused                to
move.     When the wire disconnected in the middle instead of near
one of the poles of the battery was again united, the middle galvano
meter, which was the most remote from the battery, was the first
acted upon, and those near the poles subsequently.
    The comparison of the two above-mentioned experiments show
that the earth must not be regarded simply as a conductor, which
many suppose to be the case. Since in the first experiment there were
not many yards' distance between the two earth terminations, did
the extent of ground between them act only as          a conductor, the two

                                        331
 galvanometers at the extremities of the wire should have acted simul
 taneously, as in the second experiment, and as would have been the
case had a short wire        united the two extremities which proceeded
to the earth.
                                   Third Series.
    Exp.  6. One pole    of   the battery was connected with the earth, and
the opposite pole with one extremity of the 660 miles of wire, the
other end remaining insulated; a delicate galvanometer wasinterposed
near the battery.      Notwithstanding      there was no circuit formed, the
needle showed a constant deflection of             33j°; the    feeble   current
thus rendered evident is not so much to be attributed to imperfect
insulation, as to the uniform and continual          dispersion of the static
electricity   with which the wire is charged throughout               its entire
length,   in the    same     manner as would       take place in any other
charged body placed in an insulating             medium.     The strength of
the current thus occasioned appears            to be nearly,   if not exactly,
proportional to the length of the wire added, as the following             table
will show   :  the first column indicates the number of miles of wire
subjoined beyond the galvanometer, and the second the correspond
ing deflections of the needle       : —

    Exp.  7. One end       of the 660 miles of wire was now allowed to
remain constantly in contact with one of the poles of the battery               ;
but the galvanometer was successively shifted to different distances
from the battery.        The strength of the current was now shown to
be inversely as the distance of the galvanometer from the battery,
becoming null at its extremity, as shown in the following table.            The
first column shows the distance from the battery at which the gal
vanometer was placed, and the second              column the corresponding
deflection of the needle.

    The deflections of the needle of        the galvanometer employed in
these experiments were, when they did not surpass 36°, very nearly
 comparable with the force of the current.         This I ascertained in the
 following way. I took six cells of the small constant battery de
 scribed in my paper
                        " On new Instruments and Processes for deter
 mining   the Constants      of a  Voltaic Circuit," printed in the Philo
 sophical Transactions for 1843, and placed in the circuit formed of
 the 660 miles of wire, the earth, and the galvanometer, successively
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6  cells.    Leaving   out of consideration the resist
 ances in the cells themselves      and in the earth, which were very in
 considerable in comparison with that in the long wire, the force of
 the current should be approximately proportionate to the number
 of the elements  ; and since the deflections of the needle nearly indi
 cated  this proportionality,    as the following   table will show, it may
be assumed    that the force of the current, when the deflection of the
needle   did not surpass      36°,  nearly corresponded with the angular
deviation.

    From the preceding experiments (6. and 7.) it seems to result,
that whatever length of wire is connected with the battery, if a gal
vanometer is placed at the farther extremity of the wire and a con
stant length added to the other termination of the galvanometer, its
indication remains always nearly the same.          Thus  the galvanometer
indicated   6^° when it was placed close to the battery and 110 miles

                                        333
of wire were subjoined beyond it          ; and 5° when 550 miles were in
terposed between the battery and galvanometer, the same length,
110 miles, being subjoined.          In like manner, when 220 miles were
added beyond the galvanometer placed near the battery, the indica
tion was   1 2° ;  precisely the same as when 440 miles were interposed
and 220 added.         So also when 330 miles were added, the deviation
of the galvanometer was 18°; and 15° when 330 miles were inter
posed    and 330 added.        I  have  no doubt that the correspondence
would have been closer had it not been for the fluctuations             of the
battery.
    It  would appear from this, that whatever be the length of wire
attached to the insulated pole of a battery, it becomes            charged to
the same degree         of tension throughout     its entire extent;   so that
another insulated wire brought into connexion with its free extre
mity exhibits precisely the same phenomena, in kind and measure,
as when it is brought into immediate connexion with a pole of the
battery.      Some important        practical  consequences   flow from this
conclusion, which       I will not develope    at present, as I  have not yet
had an opportunity of submitting them to the test of experiment.

I. " On the       descent of Glaciers."      By the Rev. Henry Moseley,
        M.A., F.R.S., Corresponding Member of the Institute of
        France.      Received March 15, 1855.
     If we conceive    two bodies of the same form and dimensions (cubes
 for instance), and of the same material, to be placed upon a uniform

                                                    334
horizontalplane, and connected by a substance which alternately
extends and contracts itself, as does a metallic rod when subjected
to variations of temperature, it is evident that by the extension of
the intervening rod each will be made to recede                                    from the other by
the same distance, and, by its contraction,                                 to approach       it by the
same distance.               But    if   they be placed on an inclined                       plane (one
being lower than the other), then when by the increased temperature
of   the rod its tendency to extend becomes                                 sufficient to push the
lower of the two bodies downwards,                               it will not       have become suffi
cient to push the higher upwards.                            The effect of its extension will
therefore be to cause               the lower of the two bodies to                     descend      whilst
the higher remains at rest.                       The   converse          of this will result from
contraction         ;    for when the contractile                    force becomes       sufficient to
pull the upper body down the plane it will not have become                                           suffi
cient to pull the lower up it.                     Thus, in the contraction of the                    sub
stance which intervenes between the two bodies, the lower will re
main at rest whilst the upper descends.                                  As often, then,     as the ex
pansion and contraction is repeated the two bodies will descend the
plane until, step by step, they reach the bottom.
     Suppose the uniform                  bar     AB placed                           Fig.   1.
on an inclined plane, and subject to ex
tension from increase of temperature,                                a
portion   XB will          descend, and the rest             XA
will   ascend   ;       the point   X where        they sepa
rate being determined by the condition
that the force requisite to push                        XA       up the plane is equal to that
required to push            XB down it.
     Let AX=x,            AB=L,          weight of each linear unit =k,                  i=       inclina

Now, the force acting parallel to                       an inclined          plane which is neces

     My attention was first drawn to the influence of variations in
temperature to cause the descent of                              a    lamina of metal resting on an
inclined    plane, by observing, in the autumn of 1853, that                                            a   portion
of   the lead which         covers the south side of the choir of the Bristol
Cathedral, which had been renewed in the year 1851, but had not
been     properly    fastened to the ridge beam,                                  had descended              bodily
18 inches into the          gutter;           so that           if   plates of lead had not been in
serted at the top,     a     strip of the roof of that length would have been
left exposed    to the weather.                     The          sheet of lead which                 had so de
scended measured,           from the ridge to the gutter,                                     19 feet   4    inches
and     along the ridge 60 feet.                        The          descent      had been continually
going on, from the time the lead had been laid down.                                                 An attempt
made to stop    it   by driving nails through                          it   into the rafters had failed.
The force by which the lead had                             been made to descend,                    whatever     it
was, had been found sufficient to draw the nails*.                                              As   the pitch    of
 *     The evil was remedied by placing                 a       beam across the rafters near the ridge,
and doubling the sheets round it, and fixing their ends with spike nails.

the roof was only 16£°, it was sufficiently evident that the weight of
the lead alone could not have caused it to descend.                          Sheet lead,
whose surface is in the state of that used in roofing, will stand firmly
upon    a surface of planed deal when inclined at an angle of 30° *,                      if
no other force than its weight tends to cause it to descend.                           The
considerations which          I  have stated in the preceding            articles led me
to the conclusion that the daily variations in the temperature (if the
lead, exposed        as it  was    to the action        of the sun by its southern
aspect,   could not but cause it to descend considerably, and the only
question which remained on my mind was, whether this descent
could be so great as was observed.                    To determine this       I took the
following      data  :—
    Mean     daily variation of temperature at Bristol in the month of
August, assumed to be the same as at Leith (Kaemtz, Meteorology,
by Walker, p. 18),         8°- 21   Cent.
    Linear expansion of lead through 100° Cent. '0028436.
    Length of sheets of lead forming the roof from the ridge                        to the

    Whence       the mean daily descent of the lead, in inches, in                      the
month of August, is determined by equation                     (2)  to be

    The   average daily descent gives for the whole month                    of August     a
descent of '803288.             If the average       daily variation of temperature
of the month of August had continued throughout                           the year, the
lead would have descended            10'19148 inches every year.              And in the
   * This may easily be verified.      I  give it as the result of a rough experiment     of
my own.      I  am not acquainted with any experiments        on the friction of lead made
with sufficient   care to be received     as authority in this matter.      The friction of
copper on oak has, however,      been determined     by General Morin to be 0-62, and its
limiting angle of resistance 31° 48'     ; so that  if the roof of Bristol Cathedral    had
been inclined at 31° instead of 16°, and had been covered with sheets of copper
resting on oak boards,      instead  of sheets of lead resting on deal, the sheeting
would not have slipped by its weight only.
                                                                          2 I. 2

two years from 1851 to 1853                it would     have     descended      20-38296
inches.      But the daily variations of atmospheric temperature are less
in   the other months of the year than in the month of August.                          For
this reason, therefore, the calculation is in excess.                 For  the  following
reasons    it is in defect    : — 1st, the daily variations in         the temperature
of the lead cannot but have been greater than those of the surround
ing atmosphere.           It must    have been heated         above the surrounding
atmosphere by radiation from the sun in the day-time, and cooled
below it by radiation into space at night.                  2ndly.     One variation of
temperature only has been assumed to take place every twenty-four
hours, viz. that from the extreme heat of the day to the extreme
cold of the night       ;   whereas     such variations are notoriously of con
stant occurrence during the twenty-four hours.                        Each cannot but
have caused a corresponding descent              of the lead, and their aggregate
result cannot but have             been greater than         if the temperature had
passed uniformly       (without oscillations backwards             and forwards) from
one extreme to the other.
    These considerations            show,   I  think,    that     the causes       I   have
assigned are sufficient to account for the fact observed.                      They sug
gest, moreover, the possibility that results of importance in meteor
ology may be obtained from observing with accuracy the descent of
a metallic     rod  thus placed upon an inclined plane.                    That descent
would be a measure of the aggregate of the changes of temperature
to which the metal was subjected during the time of observation.
As every such change of temperature is associated with a corre
sponding development of mechanical action under the form of work*,
it would     be a measure        of the aggregate of such changes and of the
work so developed          during that period     ; and relations might be found
between measurements              so taken in different equal periods           of   times,
successive     years for instance, tending to the development of new
meteorological laws.
    The following        are    the   results of recent experiments            f   on   the

Ice, therefore, has nearly twice the expansibility            of lead, so that a
sheet of ice would,     under similar circumstances,          have descended    a
plane similarly inclined,     twice the distance that the sheet of lead
referred to in the preceding article descended.              Glaciers are, on an
increased scale, sheets of ice placed upon the slopes of mountains,
and subjected to atmospheric variations            of temperature throughout
their masses    by variations in the quantity and the temperature of
the water, which flowing         from the surface everywhere percolates
them.     That they must from this cause descend into the valleys is
therefore certain.     That portion of the Mer de Glace of Chamouni
which extends from Montanvert to very near the origin of the Glacier
de Lechaud, has been accurately observed by Professor            JamesForbes*.
 Its length is 22,600 feet, and its inclination          varies from 4° 19' 22"
to 5° 5' 53".     The Glacier du Geant, from the Tacul to the Col du
 Geant, Professor Forbes estimates (but not from his own observa
tions, or with the same certainty) to be 24,700 feet in length, and
to have a mean inclination of 8° 46' 40".
    According    to the observations of De Saussure, the mean daily
range of Reaumur's thermometer in the month of                  July, at the Col
 du Geant, is 4c-257f.      and at Chamouni 10°-092.              The resistance
opposed by the rugged channel of a glacier to its descent cannot but
 be different at different points and       in respect to different glaciers.
 The following     passage   from Professor Forbes's work contains the
 most   authentic   information      I   am   able   to find   on this subject.
 Speaking of the Glacier of la Brenva, he says,
                                                             " The ice  removed,
a layer of fine mud covered        the rock, not composed however alone
 of the clayey limestone mud, but of sharp sand derived from the
granitic   moraines of the glacier, and brought down with it from
 the opposite side of the valley.          Upon examining        the face of the
 ice removed    from contact with the rock, we found it set all over
             * Travels through  the Alps of Savoy.   Edinburgh, 1843.
             t Quoted by Professor Forbes, p. 231.

                                           340
with sharp angular fragments, from the size of grains of sand to
that of a cherry, or larger, of the same species of rock, and
which were so firmly fixed in the ice                 as to      demonstrate the impossi
bility of such    a surface being forcibly urged forwards without                            saw
ing and tearing any comparatively soft body which might be below it.
Accordingly,     it was not difficult to discover in the limestone                     the very
grooves and scratches which were in the act of being made at the
time by the pressure of the ice and its contained fragments of stone."
(Alps of the Savoy, pp. 203-4.)                 It   is not difficult from this descrip
tion to account for the fact that small glaciers are sometimes                             seen to
lie on   slope of 30° (p. 35).
         a                      The most probable supposition would
indeed fix the limiting angle of resistance between the rock and the
under surface of the ice, set all over, as it is described to be, with
particles of sand and small fragments of stone, at about 30°, that
being nearly the slope at which calcareous stones will rest on one
another.       If we   take then 30° to be the limiting angle of resistance
between the under surface of the Mer de Glace and the rock on
which it rests, and       if we   assume         the same mean daily variation of
temperature (4-257 Reaumur, or 5-321 Centigrade) to obtain through
out the length of the Glacier du Geant, which De Saussure observed
in   July    at the Col du Geant     ;    if,   further, we take the linear expan
sion of ice at 100° Centigrade to be that ('00524) which was deter
mined by the experiments of Schumacher and, lastly,      we assume
                                                            ;                  if
the Glacier du Ge'ant to descend                as   it   would   if   its descent were un
opposed by its confluence with the Glacier de Lechaud, we shall ob
tain, by substitution
                    in equation (2) for the mean                           daily descent of
the Glacier du Geant at the Tacul, the formula —
                   /=24700x5-321                X^^x^°46'

                   /= 1-8395      feet.
The actual descent of the glacier in the centre was                       1   -5   foot.   If    the
Glacier de Lechaud          descended           at   a    mean    slope of 5°, singly in           a
sheet    of uniform breadth to Montanvert                     without receiving            the   tri
butary glacier of the Talefre, or uniting with the Glacier du Geant,
its diurnal descent would be given by the same formula, and would
be found to be -95487 foot.               Reasoning similarly with reference to
the Glacier du Geant, supposing            it    to have continued its course singly
from the Col du Geant to Montanvert                        without confluence with the

                                                  341
Glacier de Lechaud, its length being 40,420 feet, and its mean incli
nation 6° 53', its mean diurnal motion / at Montanvert                                   would, by
formula (2) have been 2-3564 feet *. The actual mean daily mo
tion of the united glaciers, between the 1st and the 28th July, was
Montanvert           (Forbes's
                                   '
                                       Alps of the Savoy,' p. 140), —
                   Near the side of the glacier             .   . .     1-441 foot.
                   Between the side and the centre                      1-   750 foot.
                   Near   the centre                                    2- 141 feet.
The motion of the Glacier                 de   Lechaut was therefore accelerated by
their confluence, and that of the Glacier du Geant retarded.                                       The
former is dragged down by the latter.
     I   have had the less hesitation in offering this solution                        of the      me
chanical problem of the motion of glaciers, as those hitherto pro
posed are confessedly imperfect.                    That of De Saussure, which attri
butes the descent of the glacier simply to its weight, is contradicted
by the fact that isolated fragments of the glacier stand firmly on
the      Elope on which           the whole nevertheless descends                ;    it being      ob
vious that         if the parts would remain at rest separately                      on the bed      of
the glacier, they would also remain at rest when united.
     That of Professor            J.   Forbes, which         supposes    a viscous or semi
fluid structure of the glacier, is not consistent with the fact that no
viscosity is to be traced in its parts when separated.                               They appear
as solid fragments, and they cannot acquire in their union proper
ties in this respect which individually                     they have not.
     Lastly,       the theory     of Charpentier, which attributes               the descent         of
the glacier to the daily congelation of the water which percolates                                   it,
and the expansion of its mass consequent thereon, whilst                                 it   assigns
a    cause which, so far as             it   operates,      cannot, as  I     have    shown, but
cause the glacier to descend,                  appears   to assign one inadequate to the
result    ;   for the congelation of the water which percolates the glacier
does not, according               to the observations of Professor Forbes                     f,   take
place at all in summer more than                        a   few inches from the surface.
Nevertheless         it   is   in the summer that the daily motion of the glacier
is   the greatest.

    The following       remarkable experiment of         Mr. Hopkins of Cam
bridge *, which is considered by him to be confirmatory of the sliding
theory of De Saussure as opposed               to De Charpentier's       dilatation
theory, receives      a ready explanation on the principles which            I  have
laid down in this note.           It is   indeed   a necessary   result of them.
" Mr. Hopkins        placed   a mass     of rough ice, confined by        a square
frame or bottomless box, upon           a  roughly chiselled flag stone, which
he then inclined        at a small angle, and found that          a  slow but uni
form motion was produced, when even it was placed at an incon
siderable slope."        This motion, which Mr. Hopkins attributed to
 the dissolution of the ice in contact with the stone, would,              I  appre
hend, have taken place        if the mass had been of lead instead of ice            ;
and it would have been but about half as fast, because the linear
 expansion of lead is only about half that of ice.

     Sir, — In   the month    of June last, the Lords of the Committee of
 the   Privy Council for Trade       caused     a letter to be addressed       to the
 President and Council        of the Royal Society, acquainting them that
 their Lordships were about to submit to Parliament an estimate for
 an Office for the Discussion of the Observations on Meteorology,                   to
   *  I  have quoted the above account of it from Professor  Forbes's book, p. 419.

                                      313
be made at sea in all parts of the globe, in conformity with the re
commendation of       a  conference held at Brussels in 1853          ;  and that
they were about to construct           a   set of forms for     the use    of that
Office, in which they proposed to publish from time to time and to
circulate such statistical results obtained by means of the observa
tions referred to, as might be considered most                desirable by men
learned in the science of Meteorology,           in addition to such other in
formation as might be required for the purposes of Navigation.
     Before doing so, however, their Lordships were desirous of having
the opinion     of the Royal Society,        as to what were the great desi
derata in Meteorological       science   ;  and as to the forms which may
be best    calculated to exhibit the great atmospheric laws which it
may be most desirable to develope.
     Their Lordships further    state, that as    it may possibly happen that
 observations on land upon an extended scale may hereafter be made
 and discussed in the same Office, it is desirable that the reply of
 the Royal Society should keep in view, and provide for such                a  con
 tingency.
     Deeply impressed with a sense of the magnitude and importance
 of the work which        has  been    thus undertaken       by Her Majesty's
 Government      and confided to the Board of Trade,            and  fully  appre
 ciating the honour     of being consulted, and        the responsibility    of the
 reply which they are called upon to make; — considering also that
 by including the contingency of land observations, the inquiry is, in
 fact, co-extensive     with  the   requirements of Meteorology            over  all
  accessible parts of the earth's surface, — the President and Council
  of the Royal Society    deemed    it advisable,    before making their reply,
  to obtain the opinion of those amongst their foreign members who
  are known as distinguished cultivators of Meteorological              science, as
  well as of others in foreign countries, who either hold offices con
  nected with the advancement of Meteorology,                 or have otherwise
  devoted   themselves   to this branch     of science.
      A circular was accordingly      addressed     to several gentlemen whose
   names   were transmitted     to the Board of Trade in June last, con
   taining a copy of the communication           from the Board of Trade, and
   a request to be favoured with any suggestions which might aid                Her
   Majesty's Government in an undertaking which was obviously one of
   general concernment.

                                       344
    Replies in some degree of detail have been received           from five of
these gentlemen *, copies      of which   are herewith transmitted.
   The President and Council         are  glad to avail themselves of this
opportunity of expressing their acknowledgements to these gentle
 men,   and more particularly     to Professor Dove, Director     of the Me
teorological Establishments       and Institutions in Prussia, whose zeal
for the advancement of Meteorology induced him to repair personally
 to England,    and to join himself to the Committee by whom the
present reply has been prepared.         Those who are most familiar with
the labours and writings of this eminent meteorologist will best be
able to appreciate the value of his co-operation.
   The President     and Council     have considered     it as the most con
venient course     to divide their reply under the different heads into
which    the subject naturally branches.          But  before they proceed to
treat of these, they wish to remark generally, that one of the chief
impediments to the advancement of Meteorology consists in the very
slow progress which is made in the transmission from one country to
another of the observations and discussions on which,               under the
fostering aid of different Governments, so much labour is bestowed in
Europe    and America     ; and they would        therefore recommend that
such steps as may appear desirable should be taken by Her Majesty's
Government,      to promote and facilitate the mutual interchange of
Meteorological      publications   emanating from the Governments           of

   It is known that considerable differences, apparently of          a perma
nent character, are found to exist in the mean barometric pressure
in different places   ; and that the periodical variations in the pressure
in different months and      seasons at the same place, are very different
in different parts of the globe, both as respects period and amount          ;
insomuch     that in extreme cases, the variations have even opposite
features  in regard to period, in places       situated in the same hemi
sphere and at equal distances from the equator.
   For the purpose of extending our knowledge of the facts of these
departures from the state of equilibrium, and of more fully investi-

                                       343
gating    the   causes   thereof, it is desirable to obtain, by means         of
barometric observations strictly comparable with each               other, and
extending     over   all parts of the    globe accessible by land or sea,
tables, showing      the mean     barometric   pressure in the year, in each
month    of the year, and in    the four   meteorological  seasons, — on land,
at all stations of observation, — and at sea, corresponding              to the
middle points of spaces bounded by geographical latitudes and longi
tudes, not far distant from each other.
   The manner of forming such tables from the marine observations
which are now proposed to be made, by collecting together observa
tions of the same month in separate           ledgers, each of which should
correspond to        a geographical space     comprised between        specified
meridians and parallels, and to a particular            month, is too obvious
to require to be further dwelt upon.             The distances apart of the
meridians and parallels will require to be varied in different parts
of the globe, so that the magnitudes             of the spaces     which they
enclose, and for each of which            a table    will be formed, may be
more circumscribed,       when the rapidity of the variation        of the par
ticular    phenomenon       to be    elucidated   is  greatest in regard      to
geographical space.         Their magnitude will also necessarily vary
with the number of observations which it may be possible to collect
in each space, inasmuch as it is well known that there are extensive
portions     of  the  ocean which     are scarcely ever traversed by ships,
whilst other portions may         be viewed as the highways of a constant
traffic.
   The strict comparability of observations          made   in different ships
may perhaps be best assured,          by  limiting the examination of        the
instruments to comparisons which it is proposed to make at the Kew
Observatory, before and after their employment in particular ships.
From the nature of their construction, the barometers with which
 Her Majesty's       navy and the mercantile marine are to be supplied
are not very liable to derangement, except from such accidents as
 would destroy them altogether.           Under present arrangements they
will all be carefully compared at Kew before they are sent to the
Admiralty or to the Board of Trade ; and similar arrangements may
easily be made by which they may be returned to Kew for re-examina
tion at the expiration       of each tour of service.     The comparison of
barometers when embarked and in use, with standards, or supposed

                                         346
standards, at ports which the vessels may visit, entails many incon
veniences, and is in many respects              a far less satisfactory method.
The limitation       here recommended is not, however, to be understood
as applicable in the case         of other establishments than Kew, where
a special provision may be made for an equally careful and correct
examination.
   At land stations, in addition to proper               measures  to assure the
correctness of the barometer and consequent comparability of the
observations, care should be taken to ascertain by the best possible
means      (independently of the barometer itself),           the height of the
station above the level of the sea at some stated locality.              For this
purpose the extension of levels for the construction of railroads will
often afford facilities.
   It may      be desirable to     indicate some of the localities where the
data, which       tables such as those which have been spoken of would
exhibit,      are required     for the solution     of problems of immediate
interest.
   1°.   It is known, that, over the Atlantic Ocean,                a  low  mean
annual pressure exists near the equator, and a high pressure at the
north and south borders of the torrid zone (23° to 30° north and
south latitudes) ; and it is probable that from similar causes similar
phenomena exist over the corresponding                 latitudes in the Pacific
Ocean    :   the few observations which we possess           are in accord with
this supposition      ;  but the extent of space covered by the Pacific         is
large and the observations are few            ;  they may be expected to be
greatly increased by the means now contemplated.                  But it is parti
cularly over the Indian Ocean, both at the                  equator and at the
borders of the torrid zone, that the phenomena of the barometric
pressure, not only annual but also monthly, require elucidation                by
observations.         The Trade-winds,       which    would    prevail  generally
round the globe        if it were wholly   covered by a surface     of water, are
interrupted       by the    large continental    spaces in   Asia and Australia,
and give place to the phenomena of monsoons, which are the indi
rect results of the heating action of the sun's rays on those conti
nental spaces.          These are the causes       of that displacement of the
trade-winds, and substitution of a current flowing in another direc
tion, which occasion the atmospheric phenomena over the Indian
 Ocean, and        on the north and       south sides of that Ocean,        to be

                                   347
different from those in corresponding localities     over,  and on either
side of the equator in the Atlantic Ocean, and (probably        generally
also) in the Pacific Ocean.
   It is important alike to navigation and to general science to know
the limits where the phenomena of the trade-winds           give place to
those of the monsoons     ; and whether any and what variations take
place in those limits in different parts of the year.      The barometric
variations are intimately connected with the causes   of these variations,
and require to  be known for their more perfect elucidation.
    The importance, indeed, of a full and complete knowledge of the
variations which take place     in the limits of the trade-winds gene
rally in both hemispheres, at different seasons of the year, has
long been recognized.       On this account, although the present
section is headed   " Barometer," it may   be well  to remark here, that
it is desirable that the forms supplied to ships should contain
headings, calling forth a special record of the latitude and longitude
where the trade wind is first met with, and where it is first found
to fail.
    i°.  The great extent of continental      space   in Northern     Asia
causes, by reason of the great heat   of the summer and     the ascending
current produced thereby, a remarkable diminution of atmospheric
pressure in the summer months, extending in the north to the Polar
Sea, and on the European        side as far as  Moscow.      Towards the
east it is known to include the coasts of China and Japan, but the
extent of this great diminution       of summer pressure beyond the
coasts thus named is not known.        A determination of the monthly
variation of the pressure over the adjacent parts of the Pacific Ocean
is therefore a desideratum   ;  and for the same object it is desirable
to have a more accurate knowledge than we now possess          of the pre
vailing direction of the wind in different seasons      in the vicinity of
the coasts of China and Japan.
    3°.  With reference  to regions or districts of increased or dimi
nished mean annual pressure, it is known that in certain districts in
the temperate    and polar zones, such as in the vicinity of Cape    Horn
extending into the antarctic polar Ocean, and in the vicinity of Ice
land, the mean annual barometric pressure is considerably        less than
the average pressure on the surface of the globe generally; and that
anomalous differences, also of considerable       amount, exist in the

                                      348
 mean annual pressure in different parts of the arctic ocean.         These
all require special attention, with a view to obtain a more perfect
knowledge of the facts, in regard to their amount, geographical
extension, and variation with the change of seasons, as well as to
the elucidation of their causes.
                        Dry Air   and Aqueous   Vapour.
   The apparently anomalous variations which         have been noticed to
exist in the mean annual barometric pressure, and in its distribution
in the different seasons and months of the year, are also found to exist
in each of the two constituent pressures which conjointly constitute
the barometric pressure.        In order to study the problems connected
with these departures from a state of equilibrium under their most
simple forms,— and generally for the true understanding of almost all
the great laws of atmospheric change, — it is necessary to have a
separate     knowledge of the two constituents      (viz. the pressures   of
the dry air and of the aqueous vapour) which we are accustomed            to
measure      together by the barometer.      This  separate   knowledge    is
obtained by means of the hygrometer, which determines the elasti
city   of the vapour,      and leads   to the determination      of that  of
the dry air, by enabling us to deduct the elasticity of the vapour
from    that    of the   whole    barometric  pressure.     It is therefore
extremely desirable that tables, similar to those recommended under
the preceding head of the barometer, should be formed at every
land station, and over the ocean at the centres of geographical spaces
bounded by certain values of latitude and longitude, for the annual,
monthly,     and season pressures,   — 1. Of   the aqueous    vapour;   and
2.  Of the dry air;      each  considered separately.     Each of the said
geographical spaces       will require its appropriate ledger for   each  of
the twelve months.
   It may      be desirable to notice one or two    of  the problems con
nected    with extensive and important atmospherical laws which may
be materially assisted by such tables.
   1°.   By the operation of    causes which   are too well-known    to re
quire explanation here, the dry air should always have a minimum
pressure     in the hottest months of the year.       But we know that
there are places where the contrary prevails, namely, that the pres
sure   of  the dry air is greater in summer than in winter.        We also

                                   319
know that when comparison is made between places              in the same
latitude, and having the same, or very nearly the same, differences of
temperature in summer and in winter, the differences between the
summer and winter pressures of the dry air are found to be subject
to many remarkable anomalies.         The variations in   the   pressure of
the dry air do not therefore, as might be at first imagined, depend
altogether on the differences between the summer and winter tem
peratures at the places where the variations themselves occur.          The
increased pressure in the hottest months appears rather to point to
the existence of an overflow of air in the higher regions of the
atmosphere from lateral sources     ;  the statical pressure at the base
of the column being increased by the augmentation of the super
incumbent     mass of air arising from an influx in the upper portion.
Such lateral sources     may well be supposed to be due to excessive
ascensional   currents caused    by excessive   summer    heats in   certain
places of the globe (as, for example, in Central Asia).            Now the
lateral overflow from such sources, traversing in the shape of cur
rents the higher regions of the atmosphere, and encountering the
well-known general current flowing from the equator towards the
pole, has been recently assigned with considerable probability (de
rived from     its  correspondence    with many otherwise        anomalous
phenomena      already known,    and which all receive     an explanation
from such supposition) to be the original source         or primary cause
 of the rotating storms or cyclones, so well known     in the West Indies
and in China under the names          of hurricanes   and typhoons.        A
single illustration   may be desirable.     Let it be supposed    that such
an excessive ascensional current exists over the greatly heated parts
 of Asia and Africa in the northern tropical zone, — giving rise, in
 the continuation of the same zone over the Atlantic Ocean, to a
lateral current in the upper regions      ; this would then be a current
 prevailing in those regions from east to west: and it would encounter
 over the Atlantic Ocean the well-known upper current proceeding
 from the equator towards the pole, which is a current from the
 south-west.     An easterly current impinging on    a south-west current
 may give rise, by well-known laws, to a rotatory motion in the atmo
 sphere, of which the direction may be the same as that which cha
 racterises the cyclones of the northern hemisphere.           To test the
 accuracy of this explanation, we desire      to be acquainted with the

                                         350
variations which the        mean   pressure      of   the dry    air  undergoes in the
different  seasons in the part      of the globe, where, according to this
explanation,      considerable    variations        having     particular    characters
ought to be found.
    2°. We    have    named     one   of the explanations           which    have   been
recently offered      of the primary cause of the northern cyclones.
Another mode        of explanation has been proposed, by assuming the
condensation of large quantities              of vapour, and the consequent
influx of air to supply the place.             In such     case the phenomena are
to be tested       in considerable measure            by the variations which the
other constituent     of the barometric pressure, namely, the                    aqueous
vapour,   undergoes.
    3°.  The surface of      sea in the southern hemisphere much exceeds
that in the northern hemisphere.                It   is therefore probable that at
the season when the sun is over the southern hemisphere, evapora
tion over the whole surface of the globe is more considerable than
in the opposite season when the sun is over the northern hemi
sphere.     Supposing the pressure of the dry air to be a constant,
the difference of evaporation in the two seasons may thus produce
for the whole globe           an annual       barometric variation,         the aggre
gate    barometric     pressure over        the whole        surface    being    highest
during    the northern       winter.     The separation of             the   barometric
pressure into its two constituent pressures would give direct and
conclusive     evidence      of the     cause      to which such a           barometric
variation    should be ascribed.          It would        also   follow,   that evapo
ration being greatest in the south, and condensation greatest in
the   north, the water which proceeds from south to north in                      a state
of vapour, would        have to return to the south in a liquid state, and
might possibly exert some discernible influence on the currents of
the   ocean.     The   tests   by which the truth of the suppositions thus
 advanced     may    be determined,        are    the variations       of  the meteor
ological   elements     in different seasons           and   months, determined by
 methods and instruments           strictly comparable with each other, and
arranged in such tables as have been                     suggested.       A still   more
direct test would indeed be furnished by the fact                      (if it could    be
 ascertained), that the quantity of rain which falls in the northern is
greater than that which falls in the southern hemisphere                       ;  and by
 examining     its distribution     into the different months and seasons

                                            351
    of its occurrence.       Data for such conclusions are as yet very insuf
    ficient  ; they should always, however, form a part of the record at
    all land stations where registers are kept.
        In order that all observations of the elasticity of the aqueous
    vapour may be strictly comparable, it is desirable that all should be
   computed by the same tables          ;  those founded upon the experiments
   of   MM. Regnault and Magnus             may be most suitably recommended
   for this purpose, not only on their general merits, but also as being
   likely   to be    most   generally adopted       by observers      in other coun
   tries.
                               Temperature      of the Air.
       Tables of the mean temperature of the air in the year, and in the
  different months and seasons of the year, at above 1000 stations on
  the globe, have recently been computed by Professor                      Dove, and
  published under the auspices            of  the   Royal    Academy      of Sciences
  at Berlin.      This work, — which is a true model of the method in
  which     a great body     of meteorological        facts,  collected by different
  observers     and   at different times, should be brought together and
  coordinated, — has conducted, as is well known, to conclusions of
 very considerable importance in their bearing on climatology, and
 on the general laws of the distribution of heat on the surface of the
 globe.       These tables have, however, been formed exclusively from
 observations       made    on land.       For the       completion     of this great
 work of physical geography, there is yet wanting a similar investi
 gation for the oceanic portion       ;   and this we may hopefully anticipate
 as    likely to  be now accomplished by means of the marine observa
tions about to be undertaken.               In the     case  of the temperature of
 the air, as in that      of the atmospheric pressure previously adverted
to, the centres of geographical spaces bounded by certain latitudes and
longitudes will form points of concentration for observations, which
may be made within those spaces, not only by the same but also by
different ships     ; provided that the system be steadily maintained of
employing only instruments which shall have been examined, and
their intercomparability        ascertained, by     a   competent and responsible
Authority ; — and provided that no observations                be used but those in
which careful attention shall have been given to the precautions
which it will be necessary to adopt, for the purpose of obtaining the
correct knowledge of the temperature of the external air, amidst the
     VOl. Vii.                                                          2 M

                                       352
many disturbing       influences from heat and moisture so difficult to
escape on board ship.        In this respect additional precautions must
be used     if night  observations    are to be required, since the ordinary
difficulties are necessarily much enhanced by the employment of arti
ficial light. Amongst the instructions which will be required, perhaps
there will be none which will need to be more carefully drawn, than
those for obtaining the correct temperature of the external air under
the continually varying        circumstances that present themselves              on
board    ship.
    In regard to land stations, Professor Dove's tables have shown that
data are still pressingly required from the British North American
possessions intermediate between the stations of the Arctic Expeditions
and those of the United          States   ; and that the deficiency extends
across the whole      North American Continent in            those latitudes from
the Atlantic to the Pacific.          Professor Dove has also indicated as
desiderata,     observations at the        British    Military    stations   in  the
 Mediterranean (Gibraltar, Malta and Corfu), and around the Coasts
 of Australia      and New Zealand : also that hourly observations,
 continued for at least one year, are particularly required at some
 one station in the West Indies, to supply the diurnal corrections for
existing observations.
    Whilst the study of      the distribution     of heat at   the surface of the
globe has thus been making           progress, in respect to the       mean   annual
 temperature     in different places,     and to its periodical variations in
different parts of the year at the same place, the attention of phy
sical geographers has recently been directed
                                                        (and with great promise
 of important results to the material interests of men as well as to
 general science), to the causes of those fluctuations in the tempera
ture, or departures from its mean or normal state at the
                                                                        same place
 and at the same period of the year, which have received the name
 of " non-periodic      variations."     It is known that        these   frequently
 affect extensive portions      of  the   globe at the same time          ; and are
 generally,   if not always, accompanied by         a fluctuation of an opposite
 character, prevailing at the same time in some
                                                            adjoining but distant
 region ; so that by the comparison of synchronous observations a
 progression is traceable, from a locality of maximum increased heat
 in one region, to one of maximum diminished heat in
                                                                            another
region.       For the elucidation of the non-periodic variations even

                                       353
 monthly   means     are insufficient;    and the    necessity has been      felt
 of computing the mean temperatures for periods of much shorter
 duration. The Meteorological Institutions of those of the European
 States which      have  taken the foremost part in the prosecution of
 meteorology, have in consequence adopted five-day means, as the
most suitable intermediate         gradation between daily and monthly
 means : and as an evidence of the conviction which is entertained
of the value of the conclusions to which this investigation is likely
to lead, it has been considered worth while to undertake the pro
digious labour of calculating the five-day means of the most reliable
existing    observations during a century past.         This work is already
far advanced     ; and it cannot be too strongly recommended, that at
all fixed stations, where observations shall hereafter           be made   with
sufficient care to be worth recording, five-day means may invariably
be added to the daily, monthly, and annual means into which the
observations are usually collected. The five-day means should always
commence with January 1, for the purpose of preserving the uni
formity at different stations, which is essential for comparison           :  in
leap years, the period which includes the 29th of February will be
of six  days.
    In treating climatology       as a science,    it is desirable that   some
correct and convenient mode should be adopted, for computing and
expressing the comparative         variability to which the temperature in
different parts of the globe, and in different parts of the year in the
same    place, is subject from non-periodic          causes.     The probable
variability, computed on the same principle as the           probable error of
each   of  a  number of independent observations, has recently been
suggested as furnishing     an index    " of  the probable daily non-periodic
            "
variation      at the different seasons of the year      ; and its use in this
respect has been exemplified by calculations of the
                                                                " index " from
the five-day means of twelve years of observations at Toronto,                in
Canada (Phil. Trans. 1853, Art. V.). An index of this description
is of course of absolute and general application ; supplying the
means    of comparing the probable variability of          the temperature in
different seasons at different places (where the same method of com
putation is adopted) as well as at the same place. It is desirable that
this (or some preferable method if such can be devised for ob
taining the same object) should be adopted by those who may desire
                                                                2  m 2

to make their observations practically          useful for sanitary or agri
cultural purposes, or for any of the great variety of objects for which
climatic peculiarities are required to be known.         Having     these three
data, viz. the mean      annual temperature, — its periodical        changes     in
respect to days,      months,    and   seasons, — and   the measure         of its
liability to non-periodic (or what would commonly be called, irre
gular) variations, — we may consider that we possess as complete a
representation    of   the  climate of any particular      place     (so    far as
temperature is concerned), as the present state of our knowledge
permits.
   It  is obvious that much of what has been said under this article
is more    applicable to land than to sea observations        ;  but the letter
of the Board of Trade, to which this is          a reply, requests that both
should be contemplated.
    Temperature    of the  Sea, and Investigations regarding Currents.
   It is unnecessary to dwell on     the practical importance to navigation
of a correct knowledge of the currents of the ocean         ;   their direction,
extent, velocity, and the temperature of the surface water relatively
to the ordinary ocean temperature in the same latitude                ;  together
with the variations in all     these   respects  which currents experience
in different parts of the year, and in different parts of their course.
As the information on      these points, which may be expected          to follow
from the measures adopted by the Board of Trade, must necessarily
depend    in great  degree    on the intelligence,   as well as the interest
taken in them by the observers,        it is desirable that the instructions
to be supplied with the meteorological instruments should contain a
brief summary of what is already known in regard to the principal
oceanic currents    ;  accompanied by charts on which their supposed
limits in different   seasons,   and  the variations in those     limits which
may have been observed in particular years,          may be indicated, with
notices of the particularities of the temperature of the surface-water
by which the presence of the current may be recognised.                     Forms
will also  be required for use     in such localities, in which the        surface
temperatures may be recorded at hourly or half-hourly intervals,
with the corresponding geographical positions of the ship, as they
may be best inferred from observation and reckoning.                    For such
localities also it will be necessary       that the tables, into which the

                                      355
observations of different ships at different seasons are                collected,
should have their bounding lines of latitude and longitude brought
nearer together than may be required for the ocean at large.
    In looking forward to the results which         are  likely  to be obtained
by the contemplated marine observations, it is reasonable              that those
which    may bear practically on the interests of navigation should
occupy the first place     ;  but, on the other hand, it would not be
easy   to over-estimate    the advantages         to physical    geography,       of
general tables of the surface temperature of the ocean in the dif
ferent months of the year, exhibiting,         as they would      do, its normal
and   its abnormal states,      the mean      temperature of the different
parallels, and the deviations therefrom, whether permanent, peri
odical,   or occasional.     The knowledge which such tables would
convey is essentially required for the study of climatology as a
science.
    The   degree   in which   climatic     variations   extending     over    large
portions of the earth's surface       may be influenced by the            variable
phenomena of oceanic currents in different years, may perhaps be
illustrated   by circumstances      of known      occurrence in the vicinity
of our own      coasts.   The admirable        researches    of Major Rennell
have    shown that in ordinary years, the warm water of the great
current known by the name of the Gulf-stream                is not found to the
east  of the meridian of   the Azores    ;  the sea being     of ordinary    ocean
temperature for its latitude at all seasons and in every direction, in
the great space comprised between the Azores, and the coasts of
Europe and North Africa       :  but Major Rennell has also shown that
on two occasions, viz. in 1776 and in 1821-1822, the warm water by
which the Gulf-stream      is characterised throughout its whole course
(being several    degrees above    the ordinary ocean temperature in the
same    latitude), was found to extend         across   this great expanse        of
ocean,    and in 1776 (in particular) was traced (by Dr. Franklin)
quite home to the coast of Europe.              The presence of a body of
unusually heated water, extending for several hundred miles both in
latitude    and in longitude,     and continuing for several weeks, at a
season of the year when the prevailing winds blow from that quarter
on the coasts of England and France, can scarcely be imagined to
be without a considerable influence on the relations of temperature
and moisture in those countries.       In  accordance    with this supposition.

                                   35G
we find in the Meteorological      Journals of  the more recent period
(which are more easily accessible), that the state of the weather in
November and December 1821 and January 1822 was so unusual in
the southern parts of Great Britain and in France, as to have excited
general observation    ; we find it characterised as  " most extraordi
                                                       " the
narily  hot, damp,     stormy, and oppressive," that         gales from
the  W. and S.W. were almost without intermission," " the fall of
rain was excessive
                      " and " the barometer lower than it had ever
been known for 35 years before."
   There   can   be  little doubt that Major Rennell      was right in
ascribing the unusual      extension of the Gulf-stream    in particular
years to its greater initial velocity, occasioned by a more than ordi
nary difference in the levels of the Gulf of Mexico and of the Atlantic
in the preceding summer. An unusual height of the Gulf of Mexico
at the head of the stream, or an unusual velocity of the stream at its
outset in the Strait of Florida, are facts which may admit of being
recognised by properly directed attention     ; and as these must pre
cede, by many weeks, the arrival      of the warm water of the stream
at above 3000 miles distance from its outset, and the climatic effects
thence resulting, it might be possible to anticipate the occurrence
of such unusual seasons upon our coasts.
   Much, indeed, may undoubtedly be done towards the         increase  of
our partial acquaintance with the phaenomena        of the Gulf-stream,
and of its counter currents, by the collection      and coordination of
observations made by casual passages of ships in different years and
different seasons across different parts of its course ; but for that
full and complete knowledge of all its particulars, which should meet
the maritime and scientific requirements of the period in which we
live, we must await the disposition of Government to accede to the
recommendation, so frequently made to them by the most eminent
hydrographical    authorities, of a specific survey of the stream by
vessels employed for that special service.      What has been recently
accomplished by the Government of the United States in this respect,
shows both the importance of the inquiry and the great extent of
the research  ; and lends great weight to the proposition, which has
been made to    Her Majesty's Government on the part of the United
States, for a joint survey of the whole stream by vessels of the two
countries.   The establishment of an office under the Board of Trade

                                         357
specially charged with the reduction and coordination of such data
may materially facilitate such an undertaking.
                                 Storms or Gales.
   It is much to     be desired both for the purposes           of navigation and
for those   of general science, that the captains of Her Majesty's ships
and masters of merchant vessels should be correctly and thoroughly
instructed in the methods of distinguishing             in  all  cases between the
rotatory storms or gales, which are properly                called Cyclones,     and
gales of a more ordinary character, but which are frequently accom
panied by a veering of the wind, which under certain circumstances
might easily be confounded with the phenomena of Cyclones, though
due to a very different cause.          It is recommended therefore that the
instructions, proposed to be given to ships supplied with meteorolo
gical instruments, should contain clear and                simple directions      for
distinguishing    in  all   cases and under    all circumstances      between these
two kinds of storms       ;  and that the forms to be issued for recording
the meteorological phenomena during great atmospheric disturbances
should comprehend a notice of all the particulars which are required
for forming a correct judgment in this respect.
                                   Thunder-storms.
   It is known that in the high latitudes of the northern              and southern
hemispheres thunder-storms are almost wholly                 unknown     ; and it is
believed that they are of very rare occurrence over the ocean in the
middle latitudes when distant from continents.               By a suitable classi
fication and arrangement         of  the  documents     which     will be hencefor
ward received by the Board of Trade, statistical tables may in pro
cess  of time   be formed, showing the comparative frequency                of these
phenomena in different parts of the ocean, and in different months
of the year.
   It is known that there         are localities on the globe where, during
certain months of the year, thunder-storms               may be considered as       a
periodical phenomenon of daily occurrence.                    In the Port Royal
Mountains     in Jamaica, for example,         thunder-storms are said to take
place daily about the hour of noon from the middle of November
to the middle of April.          It is much     to be desired that a       full and

                                   358
precise account of such thunder-storms,      and of the circumstances in
which they appear to originate, should be obtained.
   In recording the phenomena of thunder          and lightning it is    de
sirable to state the duration of the interval between the flashes of
lightning and   the thunder which follows.    This  may be done by means
of a seconds-hand watch, by which the time of the apparition of the
flash, and of the commencement (and of the conclusion also) of the
thunder may be noted.       The interval between   the flash, and the com
mencement of the thunder, has been known to vary in different cases,
from less than    a single second   to between 40 and 50 seconds, and
even on very rare occasions to exceed 50 seconds.          The two forms
of ordinary lightning, viz. zigzag (or forked) lightning,        and sheet
lightning, should always be distinguished apart; and particular atten
tion should be given both to the observation and to the record, in the
rare cases when zigzag lightning either bifurcates, or returns upwards.
A special notice should not fail to    be made when thunder and       light
ning, or either separately, occur in a perfectly cloudless sky.      When
globular lightning (balls of fire) are seen, a particular record should
be made of all the attendant circumstances.         These phenomena are
known to be of the nature of lightning,       from the injury they have
occasioned in ships and buildings that have been struck by them             ;
but they differ from ordinary lightning not only by their globular
shape,   but by the length of time they continue visible, and by their
slow motion.      They  are said to occur sometimes without the usual
accompaniments of a storm, and even with a perfectly serene sky.
Conductors are now so universally employed in ships, that it may
seem almost superfluous to remark that, should a ship be struck
by lightning,    the most circumstantial     account will be desirable    of
the course which the lightning took, and of the injuries it occa
sioned  ;  or to remind the seaman       that it is always prudent, after
such an accident has befallen a ship, to distrust her compasses         until
it has been    ascertained that their direction has not been altered.
Accidents    occurring  on land from   lightning will, of   course, receive
the fullest attention from meteorologists       who may be within con
venient distance of the spot.
                        Auroras and Falling Stars.
   Auroras are of such rare occurrence in seas frequented by ships

                                            351)
engaged     in commerce,   that it may seem superfluous to give any par
ticular directions    for their observation at             sea ;   and land observa
tories are already abundantly furnished with such.                      It   is, of course,
desirable that the meteorological reports received from ships should
always contain a notice of the time and place where Auroras may
be seen, and of any remarkable features that may attract attention.
    The letter from Professor Heis, which is               one of the foreign com
munications annexed, indicates the principal points to be attended
to in the instructions which it may be desirable to draw up for the
observation of     " Falling Stars."            For directions concerning Halos

                     Charts       of the Magnetic Variation.
  Although the variation of the compass                   does not belong in strict
ness to the domain of meteorology, it has                 been included,       with great
propriety, amongst the subjects treated of by the Brussels Confer
ence,   and    should not therefore be omitted here.                     It   is   scarcely
necessary     to remark,   that whatever may have been the practice in
times past, when the              phenomena of the earth's magnetism were
less understood than at present,             it should in future        be regarded as
indispensable, that variation-charts should always be constructed for
a   particular   epoch, and that         all parts of    the chart should show the
variation corresponding       to the epoch      for   which it is constructed.        Such
charts should also have, either engraved on the face or attached in
some convenient manner, a table, showing                    the approximate annual
rate of the secular change of the variation in the different latitudes
and longitudes comprised            :   so that, by means    of this table, the varia
tion taken from the chart for any particular                 latitude and longitude
may be corrected to the year for which                  it is required, if that should
happen to be different from the epoch for which the chart is con
structed.
     A valuable service would              be   rendered to this very important
branch of hydrography,             if,   under the authority of the new depart
ment of the Board of Trade,                 variation -charts for the          North   and
South Atlantic Oceans, for the North and South Pacific Oceans, for
the Indian Ocean, and for any other localities in which the require

                                       360
ments of navigation might call for them,           were  published   at stated
intervals, corrected      for the secular change that had taken place
since the preceding publication.           Materials would be furnished for
this purpose by the observations which             are now    intended to be
made, supposing        them to be collected and suitably arranged with
proper references      to date and to geographical      position, and to the
original   reports in which the results and the data on which they
were founded were communicated.             By means    of these observations
the tables of approximate correction for secular change might also
be altered from time to time as occasion should require, since the
rate of secular change itself is not constant.
   All  observed    variations, communicated or employed as data upon
which variation-charts may be either constructed or corrected, should
be accompanied by other observational data (the nature              of which
ought now to be well understood), for correcting the observed varia
tion for the error of the compass occasioned by the ship's iron.             It
is also strongly recommended that no observations be received as data
for the formation or correction of variation-charts, but such as are ac
companied by       a detailed statement of the principal elements both of
observation and of calculation.        Proper forms should be supplied for
this purpose   ;   or, what is still better, books of blank forms may be
supplied, in which the observations themselves may be entered, and
the calculation performed by which the results are obtained.            Such
books of blank forms would be found extremely useful both for the
variation of the needle, and for the chronometrical longitude           ;  (as
well as for lunar observations,       if the practice of lunar observations
be not, as there is too much reason to fear it is, almost wholly dis
continued).       By preparing and issuing books of blank forms suit
able for these purposes, and by requesting their return in accompa
niment with the other reports to be transmitted              to the Board of
Trade at the conclusion of a voyage, the groundwork             would be laid
for the attainment of greatly improved habits of accuracy in prac
tical navigation in the British mercantile marine.
   The President and Council       are aware that they have not exhausted
the subject of this reply in what they       have thus directed me to ad
dress  to you    ;  but they think that perhaps       they have noticed as
many points as may be desirable for present             attention ; and they
desire me to add, that they      will  be at all times ready to resume the

   " Dear Sir, — Will you        do me the favour of presenting            to the
Royal Society, for their acceptance,         the accompanying collection of
autograph    letters  from  Franklin,   Priestley, Sir J. Banks and others,
together with several documents which were formerly in the posses
sion of my great-grandfather, John Canton, F.R.S.
   " The   collection was given to me when a lad of about fourteen
years of age by my uncle        (Mr. Nathaniel Canton), who resides in
the neighbourhood of Spital Square.             It  was received  by him from
his father   (Mr. William Canton),       whose     residence was the same as
that now occupied by his son.
   " I mention, particularly, the      time when the letters came into my
possession in explanation of the circumstance of some of them being
wanting in address or superscription, for, being but a lad at the

                                        362
time of their receipt,      I was unaware of the value which attaches to a
'
   direction,'   '
                   post-mark,'   &c, and, in my ignorance, I tore away, in
a few instances, these important aids to proof            of authenticity.
    " Accompanying this note and          the above collection is one       of the

pleasure in their accepting it.

II. " Some         Observations    on the Ova      of the Salmon, in relation
         to the distribution       of Species; in       a  letter addressed to
         Charles Darwin, Esq., M.A., V.P.R.S. &c."                       By  John
         Davy, M.D., F.R.SS. Lond. & Edmb., Inspector-General
         of Army Hospitals.          Received March 27, 1855.
     In this paper the author describes a series of experiments on the
 ova of the Salmon, made with the intent of ascertaining their power
 of endurance under a variety of circumstances without                 loss of life,
 with the expectation suggested by Mr. Darwin,                    that the results
 might possibly throw some light on the geographical distribution of
 fishes.
     The details of the experiments         are given in five sections.        The
results obtained were the following : —
     1.   That the   ova of the Salmon in their advanced stage can be ex
posed only for a short time to the air if dry, at ordinary tempera
tures, without loss of life ; but for a considerable time, if the tempe
 rature be low, and      if   the air be moist   ; the limit in the former case

                                      363
not having exceeded       an hour, whilst    in the latter it has exceeded
many hours.
   2.  That the vitality of the    ova was as well preserved in air satu
rated with moisture, as it would have been had they been in water.
   3. That   the ova may be included        in ice without loss of vitality,
provided the temperature is not so low as to freeze them.
   4. That the ova, and also the fry recently produced, can bear for
some   time   a  temperature of about 80° or 82° in water, without
materially suffering; but not without loss of life, if raised above 84°
or 85°.
   5. That the ova and young fry are speedily killed by           a   solution
of common salt nearly of the specific gravity of sea-water, viz. 1026;
and also by a weaker solution of specific gravity 1016.
   Finally, in reference to the inquiry regarding        the distribution    of
the species of fishes, he expresses his belief that     some of the results
may be of useful application,       especially those given in the second
and third sections    ; inferring, that as in moist air, the vitality of the
ova is capable    of being long sustained, they may during rain or fog
be conveyed from one river or lake to another adhering to some part
of an animal, such as      a  Heron or Otter, and also during       a  time of
snow or frost   ;  and, further, that other of the results may be useful
towards determining the fittest age of ova for transport for the pur
pose  of stocking rivers,   and likewise as a help to explain the habitats,
and some of the habits      of the migratory species.
III. " Observations       on the Anatomy and Affinities        of the Phyl-
      lirrho-e bucephala (Peron)."        By John Denis Macdonald,
      Esq., R.N., Assistant-Surgeon of H.M.S.V. ' Torch.' Com
      municated by Sir W. Burnett, K.C.B.                  Received March
      30, 1855.
   As the true position of Peron's genus Phyllirrhoe, and even the
very existence of the animals composing it, have been matters of
doubt to zoologists, during a late cruise to the       Fiji Islands I deter
mined to ply the towing-net        with a little more diligence than usual,
hoping to obtain a few of these almost hypothetical beings, and was
rewarded by the capture of many specimens.

                                          364
   Some were taken in the neighbourhood                   of Lord Howe's Island,
S. lat. 31° 31", E. long. 159° 5", some near Norfolk Island, S. lat.
29° 2",    E. long.     168° 2", and others, although in smaller numbers,
in different parts of our track.           They generally      made their appear
ance after dusk in the evening,            and presented a great diversity in
size, form and other external characters, which is due to changes in
the muscular system,          a variable amount     of pigment      spots, &c.     In
deed at first    I   fully believed that     several    distinct species had been
brought up together, but this idea was abandoned when                     I  observed
the most dissimilar         forms gradually assume         so close a resemblance
to each other, as ultimately to render          it difficult  to distinguish them.
   From these facts         I am much inclined to think that the three spe
cies  described by Quoy and Gaimard, viz.                P.  amboinensis   . P. punc-
tulata and      P. rubra, P. Lichtensteinii         (Eurydice      Lichtensteinii   of
Eschscholtz)      and    P. rosea of D'Orbigny,       are all referable to Peron's
original species      P. bucephala.
   The body of Phyllirrhoe is elongated in form and                      compressed
laterally, presenting for description          an anterior and posterior extre
mity,   a  right and left surface, and a dorsal and ventral border.               The
head is surmounted by two lengthy, somewhat flattened and acumi
nate tentacula     ;   the eyes lie beneath the       skin, not being visible ex
ternally, and the mouth is in the form of a short truncated proboscis,
with a vertical opening.            The oval-shaped body is on           an average
about one inch and          a half in length, which      is something over twice
the measurement          from the dorsal to the ventral border taken at the
middle or broadest part.           The tail  is quadrilateral     in figure, gradu
ally widening        towards its posterior border, which             is exceedingly
thin.     The outer integument          is perfectly transparent       and lined by
muscular bundles, disposed longitudinally,              and somewhat more than
their own breadth apart.            These communicate with one another by
oblique branching slips, which thus form            a  kind of network enclosing
long lozenge-shaped spaces.              Here and there nerve-trunks          of con
siderable size accompany the longitudinal               bundles, dividing off into
smaller twigs, which distribute themselves at pretty equal distances
in a direction more or less perpendicular to that of the muscular
fibres.     Scattered about at irregular intervals amongst these struc
tures are numerous reddish-brown pigment-spots, in the centre of
each of which a clear vesicle is generally distinguishable.                  As above

                                        365
alluded to, the actual tint of this pigment, and the relative number
of spots deposited within a certain space, determine both                the general
quality and the depth of colour which are found to vary                  so much in
different specimens of Phyllirrhoe.
    The alimentary canal of this creature consists of              a muscular tube
lined with mucous membrane, extending without                      flexure from the
mouth to the vent.         It commences       anteriorly in an oral dilatation,
in connexion with which we notice             a pair of lateral horny jaws arti
culated with each other superiorly,           and beset with very minute and
sharp-pointed teeth along the cutting edge, altogether much resem
bling those of Glaucus, and         a lingual ribbon gradually increasing in
diameter from before backwards, and supporting                 a  pavement of long,
conical, flattened and gracefully           curved teeth with fine denticula-
tions at the base.       The central      series  of plates being symmetrical,
 the large tooth in each takes up a         middle position, but in the lateral
plates it inclines to the inner side.            In  some     examples     I have ob
 served   certain lobulated bodies lying in contact                with   the buccal
mass, and which        I  am disposed to regard as salivary glands.               The
 oesophagus is short,      and suddenly expands into             a moderately large
 stomach    ; and the latter, having received the biliary ducts near its
 posterior extremity,       is continued      into the rectum, which            passes
 directly backwards some        little distance,   and ends in the anus, on the
 right  side  of the body, at the union of its posterior and middle thirds.
 The liver in Phyllirrhoe consists of four elongated, tubular, and sac
 culated portions or lobes, disposed along the borders of the body,
 two lying above and two below the alimentary canal.                     Each of the
 superior hepatic glands opens           by a distinct      duct into the supero-
 posterior part of the stomach, while the ducts of the inferior ones
 unite to form a common tube joining it at its infero-posterior part.
 The opposite or     caecal extremities      of the two anterior hepatic lobes
 end   in the neighbourhood         of the head,      while those of the others
 extend to within     a  short distance of the tail.         The secreting cells of
 these organs are       of a rounded or polyhedral           form, containing, be
 sides the nucleus, a reddish-brown           pigment and fatty globules.
     Phyllirrhoe   possesses a simple systemic heart, consisting of a single
 auricle and ventricle.        This organ lies upon the stomach, between
  the ducts   of the two superior biliary glands          ;  and    a large vessel or
  sinus, with many circular constrictions           in its walls, may be traced

                                         366
   towards the auricle, bringing back the aerated blood from the hinder
  extremity of the body.         There are no visible respiratory organs, but
  it is probable that     the cutaneous surface permits          of the necessary
  exposure of the blood to the            air contained in the surrounding
  medium.
     The nervous     system    is well developed.      The supra- and      suboeso-
  phageal ganglia, with their commissural chords, form                a close  ring
  round the gullet immediately behind the buccal mass.                   The audi
  tory sacs, which are filled with vibratory        otokonia,    appear to lie be
 tween both sets of ganglia, and the rudimentary visual organs, con
 sisting each of a simple cell containing a refracting globule imbedded
 in black pigment, are also in contact with the nervous matter.                 Be
 sides the actual distribution of the nerves given off from the cephalic
 ganglia,    I noticed nodules of neurine lying at the base of the tenta-
 cula, communicating        by commissural threads, and sending off each
 a principal     nerve   to the corresponding        tentacle.    The ganglion-
 globules      were  lined   with   a  reddish-coloured       pigment,   deposited
 round the vesicular nuclei, and when twigs are given off from the
 smaller nerves, both the homogeneous neurilemma and the contained
nervous matter break up like a dividing             vessel, without     preserving
 the individuality     of distinct nerve tubes.
     The   sexes   are   combined     in  Phyllirrhoe, the male        and female
generative openings lying close           together on the right side of the
body in the inferior gastero-hepatic space, and before the anal aper
ture.     The ovaries lie in     the inferior recto-hepatic space, varying in
number from two to five, in general.            They   are dark- coloured, sub-
rotund,     and finely lobulated bodies,       from the fore part of each of
which    a  very delicate duct arises, and all the ducts unite to form a
single tube, with a trifling increase in its diameter.             This common
oviduct, lined by a pavement of transparent epithelial cells, passes for
wards beneath the stomach in a flexuous manner              ;  and in the inferior
gastero-hepatic space, it first unites with the duct of the testis and
again continues its devious course          until it ends in the fundus of        a
much larger tube, whose lining membrane is armed with numerous
conical and tooth-like processes, and to this is appended            a long  caecal
process    much resembling the spermatheca             of Helix for example.
The external orifice of the        male   generative apparatus lies immedi
ately posterior to that of the female          organs.     The testis is rather

                                            367
small, subglobular         in form, and closely            connected with a short
twisted tube*, much dilated at the middle part, and coated over with
a layer of dark pigment cells.             It  is with this tube, as above noticed,
the small oviduct communicates, in order, as                it would  seem, to permit
of self-impregnation,        or to answer some other purpose, with the na
ture of which we are unacquainted                 ;  but there is also an intromit-
tent organ, which, however,           I   have never seen properly exserted.
   As to the affinities of Phyllirrhoe with Gasteropods, it may                 be ob
served that the animal is bisexual, that the eyes, like those of Glaucus
and Ianthina, are very small and rudimentary, being closely applied to
the ganglia of the brain, after the manner of the acoustic sacs, and
that both Phyllirrhoe and          Glaucus agree in possessing two lateral
horny jaws, articulated          with     each     other superiorly,    and  bordered
with minute conical teeth.
   In  the Glaucidee,     the branchiae,        which consist of simple papillary
projections of the skin, are distributed                in an equable manner over
the dorsal region of the body          ;   and any deviation from this arrange
ment would naturally tend, either to a more definite localization, or
still further dispersion.        It is   the latter modification which         appears
to have    taken place in Phyllirrhoe             ;  so that its respiratory vessels
ramify minutely through           the common integument, just as the vas
cular trunks analogous to those which break up in the pectinate gill,
adapted    for aquatic breathing, are subdivided, and spread themselves
over the smooth walls of the lung-chamber in Pulmonifera.
   As   respects   its affinity to the Pteropods, here too the lateral jaws
of Phyllirrhoe must be borne in mind, together with the almost com
plete suppression of the organs of vision.                 It is worthy of note   also,
that its acoustic capsules contain otokonia, as in Pteropoda, instead
of single globular otolithes like            those of Glaucus, and there is some
reason to believe that the long tentacula, so called, are the homo-
logues of the cephalic fins of Pteropods.
   The particular features of Phyllirrhoe, expressed in the last para
graph, also serve to distinguish it from the Heteropoda, but it some
what approximates this order in the general conformation of its body,
which is elongated, laterally compressed, and presents                  a kind of pro
boscis at the anterior, and a rudder-fin                at the posterior extremity.
There is also, as it would appear to be,               a  small remnant of the foot
  * I  have distinctly traced the homologue of this tube in Pteropoda, Heteropoda,
and the Gasteropoda    proper.
   VOl.    Vii.                                                           2 N

                                         368
 on the inferior      thin margin of the body, and the lateral undulatory
 motion of the animal in the water exactly resembles               that of Cero-
phora, or Carinaria.
    The heart of Phyllirrhoe, in common with that of Heteropods in
 general, holds a dorsal position.            The auricle lies posterior to the
 ventricle, as in Cerophora and Firola, but the reverse is the case in
 Atlanta and Carinaria, the difference being due to the relation which
 the respiratory surface bears to the heart itself, lying in every case
 on the auricular       side.     Moreover   it is remarkable that the rectum
 is directed backwards in the former instances, but turns forwards in
 the   latter,   taking an opposite course to that of the circulation
 through the heart.
    It  may be observed        in conclusion, that in Heteropoda the viscera
 are closely packed together so as to occupy               the smallest possible
 space,    while they are widely distributed          through   the abdomen     in
 Phyllirrhoe    ;  thus, again, calling to mind its relationship           to the
 Pteropoda.
    This paper      is illustrated   with drawings representing the animal
 described and some of the details of its internal structure.
 IV. "Brief       sketch     of the Anatomy of        a  new genus of pelagic
        Gasteropoda,        named    Jasonilla."     By    John Denis Mac-
        donald, Esq., R.N.             Communicated by Sir W. Burnett,
        K.C.B.        Received March 30, 1855.
    This communication refers to          a remarkable genus     of pelagic Gas
teropoda, characterized, like Macgillivraya             and Cheletropis, by the
presence     of ciliated cephalic     appendages,    but having, as in the pre
sent instance, a beautifully         transparent, cartilaginous    and  perfectly
symmetrical shell.          The author   has seen but one species,     which was
frequently taken between Port Jackson and the Isle of Pines.
    The shell resembles that of Argonauta in shape, is less than one-
eighth of an inch in diameter, and the little animal, when fully re
tracted, occupies but         a  small portion of its cavity.    The margin of
the mantle is of considerable thickness, containing              loosely-packed
cells, similar to those of the middle or operculigerous lobe of many
Pteropods.     About eight ciliated     arms, identical in character with those
of Macgillivraya,       &c, encircle the head, including the mouth, which

                                       309
is furnished with two massive        lateral jaws bearing sharp prominent
dental processes     on the anterior border, and with a pair of simple
tentacula having     a  dark ocellus at the outer side of the base of each.
A well-formed foot      arises by a narrow pedicle from the under surface
of the body, immediately behind the ciliated collar.            The creeping
disc is elongated in form, subquadrate in front, and tapers off gradu
ally towards the posterior extremity.           The latter part, correspond
ing   to the   operculigerous    lobe of other species,    is speckled with
little clusters of dark pigment-cells,         disposed so much after the
manner of those of the ciliated arms as to lead to the impression that
it is one of the same series, or whorl of organs, to use botanical
phraseology.      A pectinate gill extends beneath the mantle, along
the anterior    third of the dorsal region, lying, as in most cases, in
advance   of the heart.      The visceral  mass of the body, though elon
gated, is but slightly curved upon itself, not exceeding half a turn.
The lobules of the liver, distended with large amber- coloured oil-
globules, may be distinctly seen through the transparent outer enve
lope and shell.        Single  spherical   otolithes  are  contained in the
acoustic sacs, and the lingual ribbon is lengthy and flexuous, pre
senting   a   row   of uncini   on each     side,  with  a series  of minute
denticulations,    pointing backwards on their anterior and posterior
borders.     The uncini of opposite      sides interlock  with   one  another
so closely as to      conceal the rudimentary       segments of the rachis
almost completely.        The shell is cartilaginous, transparent, planor-
bicular, and perfectly symmetrical,        presenting   four rows of minute
conical tuberculations on its convex or dorsal surface.           The gyri of
the involute nucleus are so curved as to leave a central perforation         ;
the mouth of the tube encroaches considerably on the last whorl,
and the outer    lip is deeply notched between the two lateral rows of
tubercles.     The author has named the species Jasonilla M'Leayiana.
The paper    is accompanied     with illustrative figures.
V. Note " On the position of Aluminum in the Voltaic series."
       By Charles Wheatstone, Esq., F.R.S.                   Received April
       25, 1855.
    Having, through the kindness of Dr. Hofmann, been permitted to
examine    a  specimen of aluminum prepared by          M. Claire-Deville,  I

                                     370
availed myself     of  the opportunity   to ascertain one of the physical
properties of this extraordinary        metal, which    it  does   not appear
has been     yet determined, viz. its order in the voltaic series.        The
following are the results of my experiments.
    Solution of potass acts more energetically and with a greater evo
lution of hydrogen gas upon aluminum than it does on zinc, cadmium
or tin.     In this liquid aluminum is negative to zinc, and positive to
cadmium, tin, lead, iron, copper and platina.          Employed as the po
sitive metal,     the most steady     and energetic     current   is obtained
when it is opposed       to copper as the negative metal      ;  all the other
metals    negative to it which      were tried became rapidly polarized,
whether above or below copper in the series.
    In  a solution  of hydrochloric   acid aluminum is negative to zinc
and    cadmium, and positive to all the other metals above             named.
With this liquid also copper opposed to it      as the negative metal gave
the strongest and most constant current.
    Nitric and sulphuric acids    are known not to act chemically in any
sensible manner on aluminum.            With the former acid diluted        as
the exciting liquid aluminum is negative to zinc, cadmium, tin, lead
and iron.      The current with zinc is strong; with the other metals
very weak, and it is probable that their apparent negative condition
is the result of polarization.     When aluminum is immersed in dilute
sulphuric     acid, this metal appears     negative to zinc, cadmium, tin
and iron, but with lead, on which sulphuric acid has no action, the
current is insensible.      In both  these liquids   copper and platina are
negative to aluminum,        and notwithstanding      the apparent absence
of chemical action on the latter metal, weak currents are produced.
    It is rather remarkable, that   a metal, the atomic number       of which
is so small, and the specific gravity   of which   is so low, should occupy
such a position in the electromotive scale as to be more negative
than zinc in the series.

The reading of Dr. Pavy's         paper,  entitled "An    Experimental
        Inquiry into the nature of the metamorphosis of Saccharine
        Matter,  as a  normal process of the animal economy," was
       resumed and concluded.
    The author begins by observing, that the saccharine matter met
with in the animal economy is derived from two sources — from the
vegetable kingdom, and from the liver of the animal itself    ; in each
case being poured into the general circulation     through the hepatic
veins.    The liver not only enjoys the power of forming sugar, but
it likewise exerts    (as shown by the experiments of Bernard) some
modifying influence over that which is traversing its capillaries and
which has been absorbed from the food, by which it is transformed
from vegetable into animal sugar, and thus rendered more apt for
serving in the processes of animal life.
    VOl. VII.                                            2 o

                                     372
   The sugar poured into the general circulation through the hepatic
veins is conveyed to the capillaries of the lungs, where it in great part
disappears,  but never entirely so, according to very numerous analyses
which the author has made on this subject.           If  the blood be traced
onwards from the arteries through the systemic capillaries into the
veins, the small amount of sugar which impregnates arterial blood
will  be found to be    still undergoing    a process   of destruction ;   and
what appears exceedingly interesting, this process of destruction is
not carried on with equal activity in the different parts of the
system at large.     In the capillaries of the chylo-poietic viscera,      the
destruction is so complete, that the blood in the portal vein may be
entirely free from saccharine principle,        when the blood returning
from other parts, as that contained in the femoral or jugular veins,
remains slightly impregnated.         This curious fact   has a bearing that
will  be presently    adverted to, with reference       to the views to be
advanced    concerning the nature of the metamorphosis of sugar in
the animal economy.
   The principal    seat  of destruction of saccharine matter in           the
animal system being located in the respiratory organs, seems at first
sight to support the theory of Liebig — that sugar is one of those sub
stances   which undergoes     a process  of combustion, by its direct    com
bination with oxygen and its resolution into water and carbonic acid.
Some experiments on the temporary obstruction of the respiration
and the examination of arterial blood before and after the operation,
led the author     to call in question this view, as he observed          that
notwithstanding    the supply of oxygen was cut off to such an extent
as almost to occasion death, yet a considerable destruction of sugar
took place in the lungs.        This, coupled with     the fact that a disap
pearance    of sugar takes place in the systemic capillaries, and un
equally so in different portions of them, induced him to push his
investigations, and see     if  there might not be some other cause in
operation in the living animal to effect         the  normal destruction of
sugar, besides the direct chemical action of the oxygen absorbed in
respiration.    The results of     these  investigations,   which were first
directed towards the changes produced in blood normally containing
sugar, injected through      the capillaries of lungs removed from the
animal, and artificially inflated with atmospheric air or oxygen gas,
have induced the author to refer the metamorphosis of sugar in the

                                       373
animal economy, to        a  process   which      is  perfectly     consistent and
analogous with the well-known          chemical bearings of this substance
apart from the animal system.
   In experiments which the author               has   now several times re
peated, he injected blood removed          from the right side of the heart of
an animal — and therefore normally containing               sugar — through the
capillaries of the artificially    inflated lungs of another;             and found
that as long as the blood retains its fibrine, there is as much de
struction of its sugar as would take place in the living animal                  ; but
that where the fibrine has been             separated     from     the serum and
corpuscles, the sugar ceases to be influenced by the presence                        of
oxygen, or ceases to disappear during this process of artificial respi
ration.     It would  hence appear,      that something besides           mere con
tact with oxygen is requisite for the destruction of sugar.                    But in
other experiments, he has found that oxygen is nevertheless a ne
cessary   agent concerned in the process of transformation                   observed
during the arterial ization of the blood that has not undergone spon
taneous coagulation.        It would therefore       seem, in fact, that oxygen
acts   secondarily on the sugar through the medium of the fibrinous
constituent of the blood :— that it exerts some changes                     upon this
azotized principle, which are capable          of inducing the metamorphosis
of sugar.
   If we   look to the ordinary chemical bearings of saccharine matter
apart from the animal system, we find that an azotized substance
undergoing      the molecular changes        of decomposition, placed in con
tact with sugar readily excites       a process      of fermentation,       and con
verts it by a mere alteration of the grouping                of its elements into
another substance, one atom of sugar          (C12 H12 012)    being resolved into
two atoms of lactic acid (C6 H6 Os).              We also find that sugar is
not susceptible of oxidation except under the influence of strong
chemical reagents.        Chemical analogy, therefore, would lead us to
look upon the secondary action of oxygen as the more probable pro
cess of physiological     destruction  ;  especially when we take into con
sideration, that nowhere do we meet with such                a  constant series of
molecular changes taking place as amongst the azotized constituents
of a  living animal.     In the above-mentioned experiment of injecting
fibrinated and      defibrinated   blood     through     an    artificially   inflated
lung, when the blood is capable of undergoing the molecular changes
                                                                 2 o 2

                                         374
  of assimilation on contact with oxygen           as in the  living animal,  the
  sugar in great part disappears, but so soon as the fibrine is sepa
  rated by spontaneous coagulation,          and the blood has thus lost its
  vital characteristics, oxygen is no longer capable of exerting any
  metamorphosing influence on its saccharine ingredients.
     If the   molecular changes occurring during the decomposition of an
 azotized substance be capable of converting sugar into lactic acid, why
 should not the molecular changes occurring during the building-up
  or elaboration of this same nitrogenized compound effect the same              ?
  Indeed, we have seen that the process of destruction is carried on to
 a   certain extent      in the systemic capillaries, and more        especially
 in those of the chylo-poietic viscera, where the molecular changes
 of nutrition     are also correspondingly    carried on with greater activity
 than elsewhere.         So that analogy and experiment would tend to
 show that the physiological destruction of sugar is owing to            a pro
 cess     similar  to  fermentation    induced    by the molecular changes
 occurring in the nitrogenized constituents of the animal during life.
 And, in accordance with this, we find lactic acid present in                the
 system, and largely separated        from arterial blood by the muscular
 tissue, and the secerning follicles of the stomach.
     As regards the lactic acid fermentation, it is well known that
the presence       of an alkali  favours, whilst that of an acid retards the
process.        In two experiments on animals, the author injected car
bonate of soda and phosphoric acid into the circulating current, and
observed       in the case of the latter that sugar immediately accumu
lated in the blood.
    The preceding observations refer         more   especially to the changes
that take place in the saccharine ingredient             of  the blood during
life  ;  and the author next proceeds to notice some interesting phe
nomena observable during the decomposition, and even the sponta
neous coagulation of blood containing sugar.
    If   the blood of an animal normally impregnated with             sugar be
placed aside, and allowed         to undergo spontaneous coagulation, on
examining separately the serum and clot on the following day,                  it
will    be found, that although      the serum may be largely saturated
with sugar, the clot is entirely,         or almost entirely destitute of it.
Now,      as the clot is moist and remains to a certain extent infiltrated
with     the  serum    from which    it  has partially   separated,   it would

                                        375
appear that even the molecular changes arising from the sponta
neous coagulation of the blood are sufficient to effect the destruc
tion of normal animal sugar.           And this conclusion    is strengthened
by the fact, that in diabetic blood (the sugar of which, as would
appear from other considerations also, is not so susceptible of
metamorphosis as the healthy variety)            the sugar does not disap
pear to a similar extent in the clot.
    Under the changes of the decomposition of blood, normal animal
glucose is very readily metamorphosed.            The rapidity of the meta
morphosis       depends   on the activity     of the decomposition of the
animal substances       present, and   when the destruction of the sugar is
complete the blood has assumed an acid reaction.
    This acid reaction of decomposing blood is only             observable   in
that which was previously pretty largely impregnated with sugar.
It  appears    to be owing to the formation of lactic acid.         Certainly,
it cannot      be due to carbonic acid, for the reaction remains after
exposure to a boiling temperature.
    The disappearance of sugar in the manner just pointed out             does
not depend on the oxygen of the air, except in so far as this agent is
concerned in exciting the decomposition of the azotized constituents
of the blood      ; for the sugar disappears    as rapidly when there is a
small, as when there is      a  large amount of surface exposed to the air.
But    if  the air be carefully and completely excluded, no signs of de
composition of the animal parts of the blood are to be observed, and
under these circumstances the sugar also remains.              The disappear
ance    of sugar is more rapid where the fibrine and corpuscles are pre
sent, than when the serum is exposed alone ; and in accordance
with this, the blood in the        one case undergoes decomposition much
sooner than in the other — a fact easily intelligible from the greater
amount of azotized ingredients present.
    If  blood normally impregnated with saccharine matter be placed
aside     until signs of incipient decomposition     are observed, and the
sugar is beginning to disappear, exposure to a current of oxygen
rapidly     completes the total disappearance of the saccharine con
stituent.      In this observation we     have a further illustration   of the
analogy that appears to exist, in the nature of the metamorphosis of
sugar as a physiological       process, and that which takes place chemi
cally under the influence of an azotized compound, whose clemen

                                       376
tary particles are in     a state   of molecular transition.      During life,
the higher organic constituents of the blood are capable of under
going   the  changes of assimilation        on exposure      to contact with
oxygen, and there is a considerable destruction of sugar effected                ;
for a short period after death         these  azotized constituents remain
stationary and uninfluenced by oxygen, and with this, there is a
corresponding suspension of the transformation of sugar          ;  but finally,
the animal matter of the blood on contact with oxygen, especially
during  a  warm temperature, assumes          a state  of decomposition, the
molecular changes of which again excite the destruction or meta
morphosis of saccharine matter.
   The sugar    disappears   far   less rapidly from diabetic blood under
the influence of exposure         to the atmosphere, than from healthy
right-ventricular   blood.     From these, and      a few other observations
which he has as yet been able to make on the blood in Diabetes
Mellitus,  the author, were he to hazard an opinion on the nature              of
that obscure disease, would be disposed to say that there appears to
be a modification of sugar produced by the liver, which is not suscep
tible of undergoing the normal process of destruction in the animal
system, and which, therefore, accumulating in the blood, is elimi
nated by the kidneys.         The experiments of Bernard           have shown
that vegetable glucose (grape-sugar)          is not susceptible of destruc
tion in the processes of animal life, unless converted into animal
glucose by the agency of the liver.            Diabetic   sugar would there
fore  seem to bear      a resemblance in its physiological         relations to
vegetable,  rather than to animal glucose.

         Cayljey, Esq., F.R.S.           Received    April 14, 1855.
    The author    discusses   the following     problem  : — "To find in how
many ways     a number     q can    be made up of the elements a, b, c        . .,
each element being repeatable         an indefinite number of times."       The
solution depends      upon   a  peculiar decomposition of an algebraical

of factors, the  same    or different of the form 1— j?", and upon the
expansion by means thereof of the fraction in ascending powers of *.
The coefficient of   the general term is expressed        in terms of circu
lating functions, such that the sums of certain groups of the coeffi
cients are severally equal to zero     ;  these functions the author calls
prime circulators.    The investigations show the general form of the
analytical expression for the number of partitions, and they also in
dicate how the values of the coefficients of the prime circulators
entering into such expression are to be determined.

in anywise involve the number m ; the denominator fx is the product
of factors of the form 1 — x0, and up to certain limiting values of a

that the researches    were made for the sake of their application to
the theory developed     in his " Second Memoir upon Quantics."

 I. "An      Experimental Inquiry undertaken with            the  view of
        ascertaining whether any force is evolved during Muscular
        Contraction analogous to the force evolved in the Fish,
        Gymnotus, and Torpedo."          By Henry Foster Baxter,
        Esq.   Communicated by Sir B. C.       Brodie, Bart., V.P.R.S.
        Received  April 17, 1855.
    After referring to the results obtained by Matteucci by means of
 the frog, by Du Bois-Reymond by means of the galvanometer, and
 those of Zantedeschi,      Buff, Tyndall, Despretz, Becquerel and
Matteucci in reference to Du Bois-Reymond's experiments ; in re
peating the     experiments   of Du Bois-Reymond,        the  author   has
been led to the   following conclusions   : —
    First. That during muscular contraction in man and in frogs          an
effect upon the galvanometer may be obtained, indicating the mani
festation of an electric current  ; and
    Secondly, That this manifestation of an electric current is due, in
a great measure,      to secondary reactions, viz. between the animal
secretions and the solutions on the one hand, and between the solu
tions and the surfaces of the platinum electrodes on the other       ; but
that there nevertheless remains      a residual effect, which we cannot
refer to either of these actions, or to those pointed out by Du Bois-
Reymond.
   The principal reasons upon which the author considers that the
effects cannot be entirely referred to secondary actions are these     : —
1st.   The current due to muscular contraction may      be made to over

                                      379
come a slight constant current circulating through the galvanometer        ;
and 2ndly, the fact obtained by Matteucci with the galvanoscopic
frog would indicate       that some force is evolved      during  muscular
contraction.
    Some differences appear to exist in the results obtained by the
author and those of Du Bois-Reymond,             viz. the direction of the
current.    Du Bois-Reymond        considers it as direct in the frog, and
inverse in man    ;  the author's experiments indicate it to be direct in
both cases, but he thinks        that this difference  will be found to be
more in appearance       than in reality, inasmuch as two distinct ques
tions may have been involved, viz.         1st, whether the muscular cur
 rent is affected    during the act of contraction   ; and 2ndly, whether
 any force is or is not evolved during muscular contraction.
    As the author wishes     the paper to be considered as strictly experi
 mental, and his object being to establish facts, he has endeavoured
 to avoid everything of a purely controversial character.

I.  "A   Second Memoir upon Quantics."              By     Arthur Cayley,
       Esq., F.R.S.      Received     April 14, 1855.
    The memoir is intended as a continuation          of the author's intro
ductory    memoir upon        Quantics   (vide Proc. R.S. p. 58, and Phil.
Trans. 1854, p. 245) ;    the special subject of the memoir is the theorem
referred to in the postscript       of the introductory memoir, and       the
numerous developments arising thereout in relation to the number
and form of the covariants of a binary quantic.      The author, after  some
remarks as to the asyzygetic integrals and the irreducible integrals of
a  system of partial differential equations, and after noticing that the
number of irreducible       integrals  is in general infinite,   proceeds to
establish the above-mentioned theorem, viz. that a function of any
order and degree satisfying the necessary condition as to weight, and
such that it is reduced to zero by one of the operations {xdy} — xdy
and {ydx}— ydx, is reduced to zero by the other of the two opera
tions, i. e. that it is a covariant ; and he shows how by means of the
theorem the actual calculation of the covariants is to be effected.      The
theorem gives at once (in terms of symbols P, P', which denote a
number of partitions) expressions for the number of the asyzygetic
covariants of   a given degree and order, or of     a   given degree only, of
a quantic of any order    ; this enables the discussion of particular cases,
but to obtain more general results it is necessary to transform the
expressions for the numbers of partitions by the method explained in
the author's " Further Researches on the Partition of Numbers."             It
appears by the resulting formulae       that the number of the irreducible
invariants or covariants does in fact become infinite for quantics of
an order sufficiently high ; the number of the irreducible invariants

                                      381
first becomes    infinite in the case of     a quantic of the order        7 ; the
number of irreducible covariants first becomes infinite in the case of
a quantic of the order 5.        In particular, the    formulae    show that in
the case of a quantic      of  the order 5, or quintic,       there  are 4 irre
ducible invariants of the degrees 4, 8, 12 and 18, respectively con
nected by an equation of the degree         36 ; and that in the case of         a
quantic of the order 6, or sextic, there are         5  irreducible invariants
of the degrees     2, 4,   6, 10 and     15  respectively    connected by an
equation of the degree 30      ;  so that the system     of the irreducible in
variants of a sextic is analogous to that of the irreducible invariants
of a quintic.     The memoir concludes with        a table of the covariants
of a quadric, a cubic, and     a  quartic, and of certain of the covariants
of a quintic.
II. " On    a Decimal Compass Card." By James M. Share, Esq.,
       Master    R.N.       Communicated by Rear-Admiral                  Smyth,
       Foreign Secretary R.S.          Received   April 23, 1855.
    The mariners' compass-needle having of late years received great
improvements, I am of opinion it is high time the card, as at present
 arranged, should take its place by the side of such things as are
 superseded   by others better adapted to the advancing spirit of the
 times.
    I venture  to make an attempt to innovate on an old custom, by
 suggesting the substitution      of a compass   card containing       thirty-six
 points of ten degrees each — every degree being one- tenth of            a point.
    By the use of this card the mariner will avoid the constantly re
 curring trouble of turning degrees into points, and vice versd.
    The ship's course having       been worked out in degrees,        the devia
 tion and local attraction have but to be applied to adapt it to the
 decimal   steering    card,  thus    rendering   the     " traverse    table   for
  points" no longer necessary to those steering by it; the course
 N. 35° E. being the same as " north three and a half points east,"
 &c.    The  same remark applies also to astronomical             bearings, azi
 muths, amplitudes, &c.
    Should the decimal card be adopted, the old-fashioned method of

                                              382
  " boxing         the compass," which takes young people so long to become
  familiar with, will be entirely superseded,           and  I think the sooner such
  method becomes obsolete the better it will be for the interests of the
  mariner, for, together with other advantages, the tedious operation
          "                 " will                of half
  of  a       day's work            be divested           the usual trouble.
     When giving           a course to the     " quarter-master," or " man at the
 wheel,"          no mistake, so liable to be the case at present, can well
 occur      ;  it will merely be necessary to direct him to steer, for instance,
  " north       five points east," or more briefly,     " north five east," " south
  six west," &c. &c.
     I   recollect an instance of a vessel            steering   N.W. by N. y N.,
 instead of W. by N.          \ N. during    thick weather in the Bristol Channel,
 thus running into danger from the similarity of sound between the
 courses alluded to.
     The practical application of the decimal card would not materially
 affect the charts previously             published, which      could have printed
 compasses          containing thirty-six points pasted over the others.        Such
 might be sold by any chart-seller.
 III. "On            the Theory     of the Electric Telegraph."            By Pro
            fessor William Thomson, F.R.S. Received May 3, 1855.
     The following investigation was commenced in consequence of                    a
letter received by the author from Prof. Stokes, dated Oct. 16, 1854.
 It is now communicated to the Royal Society, although only in an
incomplete form, as it may serve to indicate some important practi
cal applications of the theory, especially in estimating the dimen
sions of telegraph wires and cables required for long distances               ;  and
the author reserves a more complete development and illustration                   of
the mathematical parts of the investigation for a paper on the conduc
tion of Electricity and Heat through solids, which he intends to lay
before the Royal Society on another occasion.
   Extract from         a letter to Prof. Stokes, dated Largs, Oct. 28, 1854.
     " Let       c be the   electro-statical   capacity per unit of length of the

Editor's    hands   for publication,      I   proved that the value of c is

tro-statical measure (see a paper On the application of the Principle
of Mechanical Effect to the Measurement of Electromotive Forces
and Galvanic Resistances,' Phil. Mag. Dec. 1851).
   " Let y denote the strength at the time              of the current (also in
electro-statical measure) at a point P of the wire at a distance x from
one end which may be called O.              Let v denote the potential at the
same point    P, at the time    t.
   " The potential    at the outside of the gutta percha may be taken as
at each instant rigorously zero (the resistance of the water, if the
wire be extended as in a submarine telegraph, being certainly inca
pable of preventing      the inductive action from being completed in
stantaneously round each point of the wire.              If the  wire be closely
coiled, the resistance of the water may possibly produce sensible
effects).
   " Hence, at the time t, the quantity of electricity on a length dx of
the wire at P will be vcdx.
   " The quantity that      leaves it in the time    dt will be
                                    dt*ldx.

  "But   the electromotive force, in electro-static units, at the point P, is

which is the equation of electrical excitation in a submarine telegraph-
wire, perfectly insulated by its gutta percha covering.
     " This        equation agrees with the well-known equation of the linear
motion of heat in a solid conductor                                  ;   and various forms of solution
which Fourier has given are perfectly adapted for answering practi

suppose           the wire infinitely long and communicating with the earth
at its infinitely distant end                           :    let the end O be suddenly raised                             to
the potential             V (by being put in communication with the positive
pole of a galvanic battery of which the negative pole is in commu
nication with the ground, the resistance of the battery being small,
say not more than a few yards of the wire) ; let it be kept at that
potential for a time T ; and lastly, let it be put in communication
with the ground                  (i.   e.   suddenly reduced to, and ever                                afterwards
kept at, the zero                of potential).                 An elementary expression for                          the
solution of the equation in this case                                is

     That this           expresses          truly       the    solution with the stated conditions
is   proved by           observing, — 1st,                   that the second member                     of the      equa
tion, (4),          is   convergent for all positive values of                                   z   and vanishes
when      z        is   infinitely      great;               2ndly, that         it   fulfils the differential
equation (3)  and 3rdly, that when z=0                                                     vanishes except            for

curious to remark, that we may conclude, by considering the phy
sical circumstances of the problem, that the value of the definite
integral in the second member of (4)                                      is   zero for all negative values

obtained   widely discrepant results  ; and the apparent    velocity would, cateru pari-

The   effects   of pulses at    one end, when the other is in connexion
with the ground, and the length finite, will be most conveniently
investigated by considering a wire of double length, with equal positive
and negative agencies       applied at its two extremities.        The synthe
tical method founded on the use of the solution (11) appears per
fectly adapted for answering all the practical questions that can be
proposed.

   "An   application of the theory of the transmission            of electricity
along  a  submarine telegraph-wire,        shows how the question recently
raised as to the practicability of sending distinct signals along such a
length as the 2000 or 3000 miles of wire that would be required for
America, may be answered. The general investigation will show
exactly how much the sharpness of the signals will be worn down*
and will show what maximum strength of current through the ap
paratus, in America, would be produced by a specified battery action
on the end in England, with wire of given dimensions, &c.

 very important result is, that by increasing the diameter of the wire
 and of the gutta-percha covering in proportion to the whole length,
 the distinctness of utterance will be kept constant             ;  for n varies
 inversely as the square of the diameter, and            c (the electro- statical
 capacity of the unit of length) is unchanged when the diameters of
 the wire and the covering are altered in the same proportion.
    " Hence when the French submarine telegraph              is fairly tested, we
 may make sure      of the same degree       of success in an American tele
 graph by increasing all the dimensions of the wire in the ratio of
 the greatest distance to which it is to extend, to that for which the
French    one   has been     tried."    It will  be an economical problem,
easily solved by the ordinary analytical method of maxima and mi
nima, to determine the dimensions of wire and covering which, with
stated prices of copper, gutta percha, and iron,             will give   a stated
rapidity of action with the smallest initial expense.

gradually rises, or gradually rises and falls, after the end operated
on   is   put in connexion with one pole of                   a    battery, and either kept

permanently in connexion with the battery.                                It    so nearly coincides
with the line of abscissas                  at first as to indicate no sensible current
until the interval of time corresponding                      to   a   has elapsed       ;   although,
strictly speaking, the effect at the remote end                            is   instantaneous        (i.   e.
according to data limited as regards knowledge of electricity, to such

compressible, or the velocity of sound in                    it   considered infinitely great,
which requires instantaneous effects                       to be propagated through the
whole mass of the water, on                     a     disturbance being made in any part

of it).       After the interval        a, the current very rapidly rises, and after
about 4a more,        attains to half its full strength.           After   10a from the
commencement, it has attained so nearly its full strength, that the
farther increase would be probably insensible.                   The full strength is
theoretically reached           only after an       infinite time has passed.    The
first (1) of the smaller curves represents the rise and fall of the
current in the remote instrument when the end operated on is put
in connexion with the ground after having been for a time a in
connexion with the battery; the second (2) represents similarly
the effect   of the battery for a time 2a ; the third (3) for a time 3a
and so    on. The curve (II) derived from the primary curve (I) by
differentiation (exhibiting in fact the steepness of the primary curve
at its different points,         as regards the line          of abscissas), represents
the strength of current at different times through the remote end of
the wire, consequent upon putting                   a very intense battery     in com
munication with the end from which the signal is sent, for a very
short time, and then instantly putting this end in communication
with the ground.              Thus, relatively to      one another, the curves         (1)
and    (II)    may be considered as representing                the relative effects of
putting       a certain battery in communication                for the time a, and      a
battery of ten or twenty times as many cells for a time                       a   or   ^a.
If
 I    were to guess what might be called                  " the retardation," which
in the observations between Greenwich                    and Brussels was found to
be about yVth       of    a   second,   I   should say   it   corresponded to four or
five times a, but this must depend on the                 kind of instrument used,
and the mode          of making and breaking contacts with the battery
which was followed.

    I think clearly      the right way of making observations on telegraph
retardations would be to use either Weber's                 electro-dynamometer,
or any instrument           of suitable sensibility     constructed on the same
principle,     that is, adapted to show deflections experienced by a
moveable      part of    a  circuit,  in virtue of the mutual electro-dynamic
force between it and the fixed part of the same circuit                    due to a
current flowing for a very short time through the circuit.                  Such an
instrument,       and an ordinary galvanometer, (showing impulsive de
flections of    a  steel needle,) both kept in the circuit at the remote end
of the telegraph-wire from that at which the signal is                 made, would
give the values of I           y*dx, and    I   ydx (or the area), for any of the
curves   ;  and the ratio of the time            a  of the diagrams     to the time
during     which      the battery was held in           communication      with  the
 wire, might be deduced.              The method will lose sensibility if the
battery be      held too long in communication, but will be quite suffi
 ciently precise     if this be not more than ten or twenty times a. I
 believe   there will be no difficulty in applying the method to tele
 graph-wires of only twenty or thirty miles long, where no retarda
 tion would be noticed by ordinary               observation.     Before, however,
 planning any observations of this kind with a view to having them
 executed,    I wished to form some estimate of the probable value of a
 certain   element,    — the number of electro- statical units in the electro
 magnetic unit of electrical quantity,          — which I      hoped to be able to
 do from the observation          of -jLth 0f  a second as the apparent retarda
 tion of signals between Greenwich and Brussels.                 I therefore applied
 to the Astronomer Royal for some data regarding the mode of obser
 vation on the indications of the needle, and the dimensions and cir
 cumstances of insulation of the wire           ;  and he was so good as to send
 me immediately          all the information that was available for my pur
 pose.     This   has enabled        me to make the estimate,       and so has con
 vinced me that        a  kind of experiment which        I proposed   in a paper on
 Transient      Electric Currents in the Philosophical Magazine for June

                                                  39fi
 1 853,    and which        I  hope to be able before long to put in practice,            will
be successful in giving a tolerably accurate comparison                       of the electro-
statical and electro- dynamic units                    ;  and, with a further investiga
tion of the specific inductive                   capacity of gutta percha which will
present no difficulty, will enable me to give all the data required for
estimating telegraph retardations, without any data from telegraphic
operations.           This experiment is simply to put two plane-conducting
discs    in communication with the two poles of a Daniell's battery (or
any other battery of which the electromotive force is known in
electro-magnetic              units),     and     to    weigh   the   attraction     between
them.          I   now find that 100 cells of Daniell's                 so   applied    would
give a force of not less                 than four grains between two discs each
a square         foot in area,        and     placed -f^th of a foot apart. As the
force varies inversely as the square of the distance between the discs,
the weighing           will    be rather troublesome in consequence               of instabi
lity, but I think with                 a good balance          it will   be    quite   practi
cable.
    In making this estimate,             I   suppose the retardation observed between
Greenwich            and Brussels to be chiefly due to the subterranean part
of the wire, and          I   have taken      it as  if it were actually observed      in 180
miles of coated copper wire.                   Not having worked out the theoretical
problem in the case of a                number of insulated wires under the same
sheathing,         I  have considered the cases of a single wire excentrically
placed in the iron sheathing, and insulated from it by gutta percha,
 and a single wire in its own gutta percha tube with the others re
 moved,       and itself symmetrically             sheathed   with tow and iron wire in
 the usual manner.               In  the former case the electro-statical capacity          of
the wire would be                     p- — ^ approximately*, if R,          the inner radius
                                   6' 5-^1

of the conducting sheath, be a considerable multiple of R' the radius
of the copper wire,             f  denoting       he distance between their axes.          In
the latter case it is           —   .      ,   where R, is the        inner radius of the

bably is for             gutta percha,         nearly        enough),      and      R=,5,         R,=I
R'=-0325,            as the information            given me by the Astronomer Royal
indicates.           Whatever the theory may show for the influence of the
other wires, the result as regards retardation must be intermediate
between what it would be                     if the other wires were removed, and if
the one used were separated from them by a sheathing of its own.
We may therefore apply the theoretical result by taking                                   c   something
between — — and —— .                      Hence       if "the retardation"                    agree

I   think     it    quite certain that what was observed                          as the retardation
must be in reality intermediate between                          a      and 9a of the diagrams.
Hence the true value of              k   for   1   foot of the wire must be between the
greatest and least of the preceding estimates,                            that is, between
                                      '                         1

But the value of           K    (the "resistance" in British absolute electro-mag
netic measure of            1   foot of the wire) must, according to Weber's obser
vations on copper, be about 99810, or nearly enough 100,000*.                                         Hence
a (the number              of electro-statical units in the electro-magnetic unit)
being equal to             v|, must be between 104,000,000 and                        4   19,000,000.

  According      to the observations         of Weber,      Joule, and others, the
  quantity of water decomposed by a current of unit strength during
  the unit of time, that is, by the electro-magnetic                 unit of electricity,
  is very exactly j^th of a grain.          Hence from 2,000,000 to 8,200,000
  electro-statical units are required to decompose              a  grain of water.       A
  positive and a negative electro-statical unit at a foot distance attract
  one another     with   a force   of ^5 of     the weight of a grain.           Hence    if
  the electricities separated in the decomposition of a grain be concen
  trated in two points a foot asunder, they will attract with a force of
  more than 10 tons, and less than 42 tons           !    Faraday long ago conjec
 tured that less electricity passes in the greatest flash of lightning than
 in the decomposition of a drop of water, which is now                       I think  ren
 dered very probable.
     The expression for the force, in British dynamic units, between
 two plates, each of area S, at           a  small distance, a, asunder, when
 connected with the two poles of a battery of which the electro-
 motive force in electro-magnetic units is F, is              — —          ,  or in terms
                                                                   (     )
 force of 100 cells of Daniell's, which, as           I  have found from          Joule's
 observations, must be about 250,000,000t,               and  if  a be y^th     of a foot,
and S a square foot,        I  conclude from the preceding estimates for a,
that the force of attraction between the plates cannot be less than
4-4 grains, nor more than 72 grains.
    It  would be easy at any time to make a plan for observing tele
graph indications by means of either Weber's electro-dynamometer,
or an instrument        constructed      on the same principle,            or by mea

of different wires insulated from         one another under the same sheath-

what the retardation,       if similarly estimated, would     be found to be in
other cables of stated dimensions.            Thus,   if the retardation in 200

IV. " Observations        on the Human Voice."           By Manuel Garcia,
      Esq.      Communicated by Dr. Sharpey, Sec. R.S.                       Re
      ceived March 22, 1855.
   The   pages which      follow are intended to describe        some   observa
tions made on the interior        of the larynx during the       act of singing.
The method which         I   have adopted is very simple.         It consists in
placing a little mirror, fixed on a long handle suitably bent,            in the
throat of the person experimented on against the soft palate and
uvula.     The party ought to turn himself towards the sun, so that
the luminous rays falling on the little mirror, may be reflected on
the larynx.      If  the observer experiment on himself, he ought, by
means   of   a second mirror, to receive       the rays of the sun, and direct
them on the mirror, which is placed against the uvula.                 We shall

                                            400
now add our own deductions from the observations which the image
reflected by the mirror has afforded us.
                                Opening    of the Glottis.
   At the moment when the person draws                     a deep breath, the epi
glottis being raised, we are able to            see the following series of move
ments : — the arytenoid cartilages become               separated   by a very free
lateral movement        ;  the superior ligaments are placed against the ven
tricles  ;   the inferior ligaments are also drawn back, though in a less
degree, into the same cavities          ;  and the glottis, large and wide open,
is exhibited so as to show in part the rings of the trachea.                   But
unfortunately,        however dexterous we may be in disposing these
organs, and even when we are most successful, at least the third
part of the anterior of the glottis remains concealed by the epi
glottis.
                               Movement      of the Glottis.
   As   soon      as we prepare to produce a sound, the arytenoid carti
lages approach each other, and press                  together   by their interior
surfaces, and by the anterior apophyses, without leaving any space,
or intercartilaginous         glottis ;   sometimes even they come in contact
so closely as to cross each other by the tubercles               of Santorini.  To
this movement of the anterior               apophyses, that of the ligaments of
the glottis corresponds, which detach themselves               from the ventricles,
come in contact        with different      degrees   of energy, and show them
selves   at the bottom of the larynx under the form of an ellipse of a
yellowish colour.           The superior ligaments, together with          the ary-
teno-epiglottidean         folds, assist to form the tube which surmounts
the glottis     ;  and being the lower and free extremity of that tube,
enframe       the ellipse, the surface of which they enlarge or diminish
according as they enter more or less into the ventricles.                These last
scarcely retain a trace of their opening.               By anticipation, we might
say   of   these cavities, that, as       will afterwards appear clearly enough
in these pages,         they only afford to the two pair of ligaments a
space      in which       they may easily range themselves.             When the
aryteno-epiglottidean          folds contract, they lower the epiglottis, and
make the superior orifice of the larynx considerably narrower.
    The meeting of the lips of the glottis, naturally proceeding from
the front towards the back, if this movement is well managed, it

                                                      401
will allow, between the                  apophyses,         of the formation of a triangular
space,       or inter-cartilaginous                 glottis,   but one       which,         however, is
closed as soon as the sounds are produced.
     After    some        essays, we perceive               that this internal disposition of
the larynx is only visible when the epiglottis                           remains raised.                 But
neither all the registers of the voice, nor all the degrees of intensity,
are equally fitted for its taking                       this position.         We      soon    discover
that the brilliant and powerful sounds of the chest-register contract
the cavity of the larynx, and close still more its orifice                              ;    and, on the
contrary, that veiled notes, and notes of moderate power, open both
so as to render any observation easy.                        The falsetto register especial
ly   possesses          this prerogative, as            well as the first notes of the head-
voice*.          So as to render these facts more precise, we will study in
the voice of the tenor the                        ascending      progression           of the chest-
register, and in the soprano that of the falsetto and head-registers.
                                Emission of the Chest-voice.
     If   we emit veiled and feeble sounds, the larynx opens at the notes
                                do, re\        mi,    #=--               + .
                                    2     2     2
and we        see      the glottis agitated by large and loose vibrations through
out its entire extent.                   Its lips comprehend in their length the ante
rior apophyses of the arytenoid cartilages                         and the vocal cords               ;   but,
I repeat         it,   there remains no triangular space.
     As the sounds           ascend,          the apophyses, which are slightly rounded
on their internal             side,      by   a   gradual apposition commencing at the
back, encroach on the length of the glottis                              ;    and as soon            as we
     * Let   us here observe,           that three registers of voice are generally admitted, —
chest, falsetto, and head.                The first begins lower in       a    man's    voice than       in   a
woman's      ;   the second extends equally in both voices;              the third reaches higher in
the female voice.

In   some   organs these summits are       a   little vacillating     when they
form the posterior end of the glottis, and the two or three half-tones
which are formed show a certain want of purity and strength, which
is very well known to singers.       From    the dojf, t6,     flfao.   "=z the

vibrations, having become     rounder and purer, are accomplished by
the vocal ligaments alone, up to the end of the register.
    The glottis at this moment presents the aspect of a line slightly
swelled towards its middle, the length of which diminishes still
more as the voice ascends.     We also    see that the cavity of the larynx
has become very small, and that the superior             ligaments have con
tracted the extent of the ellipse to less than one-half.
    When instead of veiled and       feeble   sounds, we make use of full
and vibrating ones, the glottis      becomes      visible only at the sounds
                         and those    above them, a       limit which   depends
to a certain extent on the dexterity of the singer.             For all the rest,
the organs act as we have just said,         but with a double difference        :
1.   The cavity of the larynx contracts itself more when the voice is
intense, than when it is feeble. 2. The superior ligaments are con
tracted so as to reduce the small diameter of the ellipse to a width
of two or three    lines.   But however powerful             these  contractions
may be, neither the cartilages of Wrisberg, nor the superior liga
ments themselves, ever close sufficiently to prevent the passage of
the air, or even to render it difficult.          This fact, which is verified
also with regard to the falsetto and head-registers, suffices to prove
 that the superior ligaments do not fill a generative part in the forma
 tion of the voice.    We may draw the        same conclusion by consider
 ing the position occupied by the somewhat              feeble   muscles which
 correspond to these ligaments    ;  they cover externally the extremity
 of the diverging fibres of the thyro-arytenoid             muscles, and take
 part especially in the contractions of the cavity of the larynx during
 the formation of the high notes of the chest- and of the head-
 registers.

show the glottis infinitely better than the unisons of the chest-voice
and produce         vibrations           more     extended         and      more distinct.               Its
vibrating    sides,      formed by the anterior apophyses of the arytenoid
cartilages, and by the ligaments, become gradually shorter as the
voice ascends       ;   at the notes la,           si,
part only at their summits                ;   and in these notes there results a weak
ness similar to that which we have remarked in the chest-notes an
octave     below.        At the notes
alone continue to act           ;   then begins the series of notes called head-
voice.  The moment in which the action of the apophyses ceases,
exhibits in the female voice a very sensible difference at once to the
ear and    in the organ itself.               Lastly, we verify, that, up to the highest
sounds of the register, the glottis continues to diminish in length
and in width.
   If    we compare the two registers in these movements, we shall find
some analogies in them               :   the sides       of the glottis, formed at first by
the     apophyses and the ligaments, become                            shorter by degrees, and
end by consisting              only of the ligaments.                     The chest- register is
divided into two parts, corresponding                            to these two states of the
glottis. The register of falsetto-head presents                           a complete similarity,
and in a still more striking manner.
   On other points, on the contrary,                           these   same registers are very
unlike.      The length of the glottis necessary to form                            a falsetto note,
always exceeds that which produces the unison of the chest.                                          The
movements which agitate the sides             of the glottis                        are      also aug
mented, and       keep the vibrating orifice continually half                       opened, which
naturally produces a great waste of air.                           A last trait of difference,
is in the increased extent of that elliptic surface.
   All    these   circumstances, which we shall refer to again, show in
the mechanism of the falsetto, a state of relaxation, which we do not
find in the same degree in the chest-register.
                        Manner      in   which the sounds are formed.
   As     we have       just   said, and what we have                     seen proves        it,   the   in-

 ferior ligaments, at the bottom of the larynx, form exclusively the
voice, whatever may be its register or its intensity                     ;  for they alone
vibrate at the bottom of the larynx*.                    But by virtue of what prin
ciple is the voice formed           ?   It  seems    to me, that the answer to this
question can be but this          ; the voice is formed in one unique manner, —
by the compressions           and expansions       of  the  air, or   the successive       and
regular explosions         which it produces in passing through the glottis.
    The ligaments of           the   glottis are situate about the mean level of
the upper border of the cricoid, close the passage,                         and    present a
resistance to the air.              As   soon as the air has         accumulated suffi
ciently, it parts these folds and produces an explosion.                          But  at the
same instant, by virtue of their elasticity, and the pressure from be
low being relieved, they meet again to give rise to a fresh explosion.
A    series    of    these  compressions and expansions, or of explosions,
occasioned by the expansive force of the air and the reaction of the
glottis, produces the voice.
    This thecry, though now generally admitted for                         reeds,    and un
doubtedly evident in the liquid vein, the toothed-wheel                           of Savart,
the syrene of the           Baron Cagnard Latour &c,             has not to my know
ledge, been yet applied to the glottis                  \.   If we consider that the
lips of this aperture, taken separately, can give no kind of sound,
however we may try to make them speak, we must admit that the
sounds which they give forth by their mutual action, are only owing
to the explosions of the air produced by their strokes                        J.    It is not
necessary in order to obtain the explosion of sound, that the glottis
should be perfectly closed each time after its opening                          ; it  suffices
that it should oppose an obstacle to the air capable of developing its
elasticity.       In this   case the rushing of the air is heard accompanying
   * We gladly        acknowledge   that this most important       fact    has been    already
announced      by   J. Midler, although we have our objections         to the theory which
accompanies      it. — Handbuch   der Physiologic del Menschen.
   t I  find that Dr. Midler hints at the possibility of the voice being thus formed,
but only to attack and reject the notion. — Ibidem.
   J  Many controversies      have arisen   respecting   the sounds sometimes emitted by
animals    after   the section of the superior and recurrent laryngeal        nerves ; sounds
which have been perhaps occasioned            by the struggling of the animal causing a
swelling of the neck and a mechanical         contact of the vocal ligaments.        However,
without doubt, after the section of these nerves, voice,        as a  voluntary act, can no
longer take place.

 the sounds, and they take             a  veiled, and sometimes an extremely
 muffled character        ;   an observation which we have already presented
 to the reader's notice in speaking of the falsetto.
           Conjectures      on the Formation     of the   different  Registers.
     As the entire system of vibrations arises solely from the inferior
ligaments, it is evident that the cause of the different tones called
registers, must be sought for in the muscles which set these liga
 ments     in motion   ;     and that the other parts of the          larynx must       be
 considered only as apparatus for strengthening the sounds obtained,
 and for modifying their quality.            In our efforts to discover the more
 intimate processes          of the vocal organs which produce the sounds,
 we shall recur at once to the observations already mentioned, to
 some anatomical remarks which we are going to make, and to the
 sensations which we feel in the organ itself whilst                   it is producing
sounds.
     If  we detach one of the halves of the thyroid cartilage, we shall
 see a large muscular            surface of oblique fibres, which fills all the
 space between the arytenoid and thyroid                   cartilages.     At its upper
 end    is to be seen the         muscle corresponding to the superior vocal
 ligaments,     and which          sometimes extends           to  the notch      in   the
thyroid.      After detaching this generally frail muscle, all the                  fibres
 constituting    this muscular surface seem to start from two opposite
 centres, viz. the anterior surface of the arytenoid, and the re-enter
ing angle of the thyroid. These centres, occupying the extremities
of a diagonal line, send their fibres towards each other in parallel
lines.      Those which start from the anterior face of the arytenoid
descend obliquely        ;   the most external ones go to the cricoid, whose
posterior half they cover at the side              ;    the most internal ones de
 scend    to the vocal membrane*,             which they cover entirely.              The
fibres which terminate at the membrane become                     longer, as they be
come more internal.             Those which start from the re-entering angle
of the thyroid,      reascend       obliquely to the summit of the arytenoid,
then diverge in order to form the sides of the ventricles, and then
disappear in the aryteno-epiglottidean               folds and even the under sur
face of the epiglottis.            If we cut   it away in     successive    layers, pro-
    * We thus designate that part of the membrane which
                                                                   goes from the bottom
of the vocal ligament, to the edge of the cricoid.
                                                                      2 q 2

                                       406
   ceeding from the outside to the in, we reach a thick bundle of fibres,
  perfectly horizontal, which line the outer aspect of the vocal liga
  ment, and which go from the anterior apophyses             of the arytenoid
  to the re-entering angle of the thyroid *.
      This bundle   has   its posterior half covered      by the lateral crico
  arytenoid muscle, and its anterior half by the diverging fibres which
  start from the thyroid.        If we cut away the horizontal          bundle in
  successive   layers, we see that the fibres are not all of the same
  length  ;  the most external fibres are the longest, and the succeeding
  ones get gradually shorter as they become          more internal    ;  but they
  all originate in the anterior cavity of the arytenoid, and the muscle
  is inserted in the manner above explained throughout the whole
  length of the vocal ligaments, the thyro-arytenoid portion of it ex
  cepted.     As the fibres all begin from the arytenoid, and terminate
  successively at more distant points of the membrane, we see that the
 muscle is thicker behind than before.
     Thus   the vocal ligament, and the membrane which            depends      from
 it, the  sole sources  of all vocal sounds,    are under the direct action of
 the fibres which come from the anterior cavity of the arytenoid             ;   the
 ligament under the action of the horizontal bundle, the membrane
 under that of the oblique fibres.          The long horizontal      fibres,     ex
 tending from one cartilage to the other, are placed at the exterior of
 the short horizontal      fibres, and at the interior of the oblique fibres.
 The diverging fibres which start from the thyroid, acting only                   on
 the superior vocal ligaments and the folds, seem to influence by
 their contractions only the quality and volume of the voice.
     The remarkable arrangement of        the fibres which we have       just ex
 amined, enables    us to explain a fundamental fact, — the elevation             of
the voice.      The fibres of the horizontal       bundle being placed over
each other, in layers, one covering the other, and getting gradually
longer and longer, as they become more external, extend their action
to the more anterior parts of the edges of the glottis.         This progress
ive action from the back to the front, encroaches gradually on the
length of the vibrating portion of the ligament, and likewise increases
its tension, and its faculty of accelerating its pulsations.
    Another portion     of the thyro-arytenoid      muscle at the same time
stretches and raises the vocal membrane more and more, causing a
                 * Another portion of the thyro-arytenoid muscle.

                                          407
  lesser depth of the ligaments to be in contact, in proportion as the
   sounds become higher, and thus assists by increasing the mobility
   of  the ligaments.
       We shall      see in   a few moments that         the rotatory movement,
  which the external        fibres  of the lateral crico-arytenoid muscles give
   to the arytenoid,        by making     the vocal membrane deeper,           partly
  counteracts the above effect, and produces the chest-register.
       The crico-thyroid muscle, on the contrary, is a powerful auxiliary
  in the elevation of the voice.         This muscle, which at the same time
  causes the thyroid to come forwards and downwards,                 gives rise to a
  mechanical tension, not only in the vocal ligament, but even in the
  whole vocal membrane.             The meeting of       the  thyroid   and cricoid
 cartilages,       which we can feel by the touch,             becomes    especially
  marked when the inter- ligamentous glottis alone produces the sounds,
  which takes place       as we have seen at the notes dojf, re,
                                                                3    3
  in the chest-register, and an octave above for that of the head            ;  with
  this difference, however, that for the latter             a more vigorous      and
 complete connexion is necessary.
      Let   us now see what we may learn from the sensations we feel               in
 the vocal organ.        When we produce       a chest-note, the least attention
                                                 " at the
 enables      us to distinguish    a "pinching               posterior part of the
 glottis, which       becomes     more vigorous as the notes         ascend.    This
 pinching seems to be formed by extension of the depth of the touch
 ing     surfaces,  and may become very painful        ;  whilst the notes of fal
 setto, when higher than chest ones, give comparatively great relief to
 this part, and the surfaces in contact seem to have become thinner.
      If  we combine these sensations with the different remarks which
 have      been   furnished to us by the examination          of the muscles, we
 can fix the particular mechanism          of each register.
                                    Chest Register.
     In fact, when the arytenoid muscles          have brought      in contact the
arytenoid cartilages, and closed the glottis, the voice may take two
very different characters ; nay, more, it will be produced in pitches
widely       apart from one another, and will give forth the chest, or
falsetto registers,       according    as the fibres     of the   thyro-arytenoid
attached to the vocal membrane             are active or not.        By the action

                                         408
of these fibres, as we have seen, this muscle raises the vocal mem
brane, and makes its apposable part thinner              ;  whereas the lateral
crico-arytenoid     gives a rotatory movement to the cartilage, which
brings the apophyses into deep contact.              This   deep contact, which
continues even after the apophyses no longer partake in the vibra
tions, gives a deep tension to the membranes,            increases the depth of
their contact*,     and, as a necessary consequence,          augments the re
sistance they present to the air.         It is to the extent of this resistance
that we attribute the formation of the chest-register, so distinct by
its particular amplitude.         To it we attribute also the slowness of
the beats of the glottis, and the consequent low pitch of the sounds,
a pitch which, even in the highest tenor voices, is at least an octave
lower than the head notes of ordinary soprani.
                              Register    of Falsetto.
    When, on      the contrary, the external fibres of the lateral crico
 arytenoid    muscle remain inactive, we produce the falsetto.               The
lips of the glottis, stretched by the horizontal           bundle of the thyro
arytenoid, come in contact by their edge alone, formed at once by
the ligament       and the apophyses, and offer little resistance to the
air.    Hence arises the great loss of this agent, and the general
weakness of the sounds produced here.
    But  as soon as we reach the sound do, the beats are produced by
                                                 4
the ligaments exclusively, and we have attained the head-register.
 It is certain,  as we may deduce from the movement            of the ligaments,
that then the vocal membrane          is raised by the action    of the fibres of
the thyro-arytenoid muscle, and its surface is diminished to an edge             ;
but we think that the external fibres of the lateral crico-arytenoid,
which would prevent this movement, remain inactive.                   Then   also
the very decided tension, which the crico-thyroid              muscle effects on
the vocal tendons, and which             accelerates their movements, takes
place.
    During the chest-register,          therefore, the vocal ligaments        are
stretched, and are in contact to an extent corresponding with the
depth of the anterior apophyses of the arytenoid,                 whilst in the
falsetto the edges alone of the ligaments are stretched and apposed              ;
in. both cases the sounds being formed, not by the actual vibrations
         * It is then that we feel the pinching of which we have spoken.

explosions which they allow.
                                    Pressure     of the Air.
   Until now, in our remarks on the manner in which the voice is
formed, we have only referred to the rigidity of the glottis, a rigidity
necessary    to accomplish the 1056 vibrations in one second*, which
form the do of the chest-voice, and to accomplish the double number
             4
which produces the octave above in the head-voice. There                           is,   notwith
standing, another indispensable element for the production of vocal
sounds, the pressure of the air. Pressure, as                      is   well known, developes
an elastic force          in this agent, in           a   degree       inverse to the volume
which   it   occupies.        It   is   by means of this power that the intensity
of the sounds        is   obtained.      The intensity of the sound can only                   de
pend on the quantity of air which goes to each sharp explosion.                                    I
say   sharp explosion,            as an express condition               :   the glottis should
close itself perfectly after every vibration                 ;   for   ifthe air found    a   con
stant passage,         as in the notes         of falsetto, then the greatest              move
ments of the glottis, and the greatest waste of air, would produce
precisely the weakest              notes.     To reject this theory would                  be to
attribute the intensity of the sound to the extent of the vibrations
accomplished by the lips of the glottis,                     and to suppose        that these
lips, each taken separately, possess the power of producing sounds,
suppositions quite contrary to the facts.
  The elastic force of the air               arises       not only from the compression
of the lungs, but          also    from the contractions of the trachea, which
adjusts its calibre to the different dimensions of the glottis.                               It   is
by means of this force that the air conquers the continually-in
creasing     obstacle presented by the lips of the glottis when they
produce sounds more and more intense.
   Thus the problem of the elevation of the voice, always complicated
with that of its intensity, in order to be complete, ought to show
the connexion which               exists between the tension of the lips of the
glottis, the pressure of the air, and the number and intensity of the
explosions       obtained.         As   a   consequence, we may state                that the
greater pressure of air necessary to produce the greater intensity,

would at the same time increase the number of pulsations, and so
raise the tone  ; hut to prevent this, the glottis must at the same
time be lengthened, and vice versd      ; or, in other words, that the dif
ferent lengths of the glottis can, under different degrees of pressure,
produce the same number of shocks,             but at different degrees   of
intensity.
                     Of    the Qualities  of the  Voice.
    Various simultaneous     causes  modify the qualities of the voice  : —
 1, according as the glottis partially     or entirely closes the passage
between the explosions, it produces veiled or brilliant sounds ; 2, the
tube which surmounts         and surrounds     it also greatly  affects the
quality of the voice ;   by its contractions it gives brilliancy to it and
its widening volume    ;  3, the epiglottis    also plays a very important
part, for every time that it lowers itself, and nearly closes the orifice
 of the larynx, the voice gains in brilliancy ; and when, on the other
hand, it is drawn up, the voice immediately becomes veiled.

   The following communications     were read  : —
I. "Remarks      on the Rev.    H. Moseley's Theory of the Descent
      of Glaciers."    By James D. Forbes, D.C.L., F.R.S., Corr.
      Inst. France, and Professor of Natural Philosophy in the
      University of Edinburgh.       Received May 22, 1855.
   In  a paper
                " On the Descent of Glaciers," communicated to the
Royal Society on the 19th of April, 1855, and printed in their Pro
ceedings, the Rev. Henry Moseley has proposed an explanation of
that phenomenon.
   The first part of his paper contains a lucid description of the
                                             the roof of Bristol Cathe
gradual motion of a sheet of lead covering
dral, which he ascribes (I have no doubt justly) to the successive
expansions and contractions of the lead by atmospheric temperature.
He explains the influence of the slope of the roof and of the measure
of friction upon   the motion  with his customary precision and clear
ness.    He also finds for the probable measure of the effect or creep
ing motion of the lead, a quantity which, considering the imperfect
nature of the data with regard to temperature, agrees sufficiently
well with observation.
   In the latter and shorter part of the paper is a transition to the

                                           413
  case  of glaciers, whose motion          over   their beds may, he thinks, be
  accounted for in the same way, namely, by the alternate contraction
  and expansion     of the ice by diurnal changes of temperature, and he
 then enters into certain calculations             founded principally     on data
 contained in my 'Travels in the Alps of Savoy' in confirmation of
 this view.
     Entertaining    as  I do the highest respect        for Mr. Moseley's    emi
 nent attainments as a theoretical mechanician, it is with extreme
 regret that   I find it necessary,     in maintenance of the views regarding
 glacier motion which       I  have elsewhere advanced,        and in the interest
 of scientific truth, to show         (as I believe I can) that Mr. Moseley
 has been    led, apparently by a sudden inadvertency, to uphold an
 opinion completely indefensible.
     I must first object to        Mr. Moseley's description or definition of
 a glacier, as calculated to mislead the inquirer            :  he says  (p. 339),
 " glaciers   are, on an increased scale
                                                 "
                                                    [compared to the sheet lead
 covering of a     roof], "   sheets of ice placed upon the slopes       of moun
 tains."    There    are certainly       some   inconsiderable    glaciers of the
 second order to which          this description     might possibly apply, with
 the exception of the small thickness inferred by the word               " sheet ;"
 but the true glaciers, whose theory has been                  so often discussed
 (which theory must evidently likewise include that of glaciers of the
 second order), cannot fairly be called either sheets of ice nor be
 accurately described as lying on the slopes of mountains.               They   are
 vast icy accumulations whose depth bears a considerable proportion
to their breadth, and which fill mountain ravines or valleys.
     Glaciers are very generally hemmed in by precipitous rocks which
 determine their contour or ground plan              ; they have often to make
 their way through contracted gorges where the ice occupies (as in
 the case of the Mer de Glace of Chamouni), within a short distance,
a   channel but half as wide as it did before.             Yet the glacier, pre
serving its continuity as        a whole, expands or contracts in conformity
with the irregularities,       not only of its lateral walls, but of its bed,
forcing itself over obstacles,        or even occasionally allowing itself to
be cleft into two branches by them, and closing again into a united
mass after the insular obstruction has been past.               To  speak of such
resistances of the channel to the progress of the ice as mere friction,
or of a glacier considered as a solid body and in its whole extent
                                                                   2  r2

                                        414
(or in any considerable part of it) as having an angle of repose, as in
the case of a substance with a flat base resting on an inclined plane,
is evidently inadmissible and tends to mislead.               The valley of      the
Mer    de Glace might have almost any possible inclination              before the
ice would tend to slide out       of it  en masse,   for it is moulded to every
sinuosity or protuberance of the bed, whether vertical or horizontal.
Let Mr. Moseley imagine a sheet of lead having the ground plan of
the Mer de Glace and confined by margins of wood accurately
adapted    to it, and he will see that unless lead were so ductile as to
be entitled to the appellation of a semifluid, no motion could possibly
result, however great might be the slope on which it lay.
    I am sorry to find that      Mr. Moseley denies entirely (p. 341)            the
viscous or plastic structure of a glacier as " not consistent with               the
fact that no viscosity can be traced in its parts when separated."
The answer to this objection seems to be merely this ; that the
viscosity, though it cannot be " traced" in the parts, if very minute,
nevertheless     exists there, as unequivocally       proved by experiment on
the large scale, or even on spaces several yards or fathoms in extent*.
The plastic condition of      a  glacier is, as   I  have repeatedly stated,      no
longer an hypothesis, but a fact, since         I have in many places demon
strated that, account for it as we may, different portions of the same
continuous mass of ice are moving at the same moment with dif
ferent velocities.      That  a  small piece of ice is not sensibly plastic, is
not more strange than that the fine blue colour so perceptible in the
glacier totally vanishes in its constituent fragments.              That ductility
and   fragility  are not incompatible qualities, is shown by the fact, that
sealing-wax at moderate atmospheric temperatures                will mould itself
 (with time) to the most delicate inequalities of the surface on which
 it rests, under a pressure of not more than half an inch of its sub
 stance, but may at the same time be shivered to atoms                  by a blow
 with   a hammer.
    The question of plasticity,        however, affects      only mediately      Mr.
 Moseley 's theory of the primary cause of motion by dilatation and
contraction.       According    to the views    I   support, the dilatation and
contraction of the ice of glaciers (assuming it to exist) would be in
 efficient to move the mass unless it moved plastically ; and if it
 moves plastically, the supposition        of its thermal expansion is, at all
     * See Phil. Trans. 1846, p. 162, and Phil. Magazine   (1845), xxvi. p. 414.

events,      superfluous, since gravity is in that case a sufficient moving
force.
     But, it will       be argued,         if    the ice be really acted on by heat and
cold as Mr. Moseley supposes, it is a vera causa of motion and can
not be neglected.              And        here    we join issue respecting the physical
theory proposed.
     Mr. Moseley's explanation of the descent of the lead on                                  a roof at
an angle much below that                         at which motion could take place by
gravity, friction being allowed for (the angle of repose), amounts
to this, that every increase of temperature of the mass by the heat
of the day expanding                it,   pushes the lower end downwards more than
it   pushes the upper end upwards                      ;    whilst the cold of the night               re
tracts   a     little   the lower end,            but (being favoured by the slope)                      it
pulls down the upper end more than                            it   had been pushed up during
the heat of the day, and thus by                       a    species   of vermicular motion im
pels the body down the                    inclined plane.             The motion        is   calculated
from    a   formula including the absolute expansibility of lead, the slope
of the roof, the angle of repose, and the diurnal range of tempera
ture.       Taking then corresponding                        data for the Mer de Glace of
Chamouni, assuming 30° to be the angle of repose of                                 a   glacier upon
its bed, taking the expansion of ice to be nearly double that of lead
(according to experiments made at St. Petersburgh), and the daily
range of temperature                of   the ice to be the same as that              of   the   air   ob
served by De Saussure on the   Col du Geant in the month of July,
Mr. Moseley calculates the daily descent of the glacier opposite the
Montanvert and compares     with my observations.
                                           it
     Waiving for        the moment all other objections, can we possibly                            attri
bute to the ice         of   the entire mass           of   this vast glacier an average daily
range     of   temperature     Reaumur or 9\°
                                 of             of                          of   Fahrenheit     ?     The
idea seems to me to be perfectly untenable.
     The expansion            and     contraction           of ice by heat and cold can of
course      only take place below the freezing-point,                           or 32°.      Let    it   be
percolated by water as              it    may,    it   cannot rise above that temperature
nor expand in the smallest degree.                             But    it   is   a matter perfectly
notorious, that, at least in summer, and throughout                               the whole extent
of   the Glacier Proper,             and even far into the region of the                      neve', the
glacier     is   charged with percolating water derived from superficial
fusion.        Mr. Moseley admits this, and                        even attributes        the diurnal

                                         416
oscillation of temperature which he assumes,             to the action of water,
                                      ''
as in the following       passage  :     Glaciers are, on an increased scale,
sheets of ice placed upon the slopes of mountains, and subjected to
atmospheric variations of temperature throughout their masses by
variations in the quantity and the temperature of the water, which
flowing   from the surface       everywhere percolates them"              (p. 339).
This action therefore clearly brings the temperature of the ice up
to 32° during the day.         But how     is the cold of the night to operate
in reducing the temperature of a mass of ice certainly from 300 to
600 or more feet in thickness through the enormous average                   depres
sion of 9£ degrees ? The water so efficient by its percolation in
raising the temperature (if necessary) to 32°, being frozen, is now
powerless.      Cold can be conveyed downwards,                or to speak     more
correctly, Heat can be transmitted upwards through the ice only by
the slow process of conduction, and this on the supposition that the
depression of superficial temperature is all that the theory might
require.    But how stands        the fact    ?  Mr. Moseley      quotes   from De
Saussure the following daily ranges of the temperature of the air in
the month of      July at the Col du Geant and at Chamouni, between
which points the glacier lies.
                   At the Col du Geant           4°-257 Reaumur.
                   At Chamouni                  10°092 Reaumur.
And    he assumes    "  the same mean daily variation          of temperature to
obtain throughout        the length" [and depth?] "of the Glacier du
 Geant which      De  Saussure observed in July at the Col du Geant."
But between what limits         does the     temperature of the air oscillate       ?
We find, by referring to the third volume of De Saussure's Travels,
that the mean temperature of the coldest hour* (4 a.m.) during his
stay at the Col du Geant was 0°-457 Reaumur, or 33°- 03 Fahrenheit,
and of the warmest (2 p.m.)4°-714 Reaumur, or42° 61 Fahrenheit-)-.
 So that even upon that exposed ridge, between 2000 and 3000 feet
 above   where the glacier can be properly said to commence, the
 air does not, on an average of the month of           July, reach the freezing-
point at any hour of the night.           Consequently the range         of tempera-
lure attributed to the glacier is between limits absolutely             incapable of
     * The observations were made every two hours day and
                                                                 night.
     t  The corresponding  extremes  at  Chamouni   are 53°-25  and  75°-96 Fahr.

                                       417
effecting the expansion    of  the ice in the smallest degree.     This would
of course  be still more applicable if we take the mean of the tempe
ratures at Chamouni and the Col du Geant to present the general
atmospheric conditions to which the glacier is exposed.
   It is in summer that the glacier moves fastest : it is with my
observations of motion in July that Mr. Moseley compares the results
of his theory    :  and therefore it is of no avail to say that there are
periods of the year when congelation penetrates at night some inches,
or even it may be some feet into the ice, and when therefore the
sensible heat of the glacier may be considered to vary, though,              if
regard be had to its vast thickness, it must be on an average and in
the   most extreme circumstances           to an    absolutely   inappreciable
degree.
    Lastly, Mr. Moseley, whilst condemning in the following passage
the theory of glacier motion by the dilatation of water in the inter
stices of the ice, clearly passes sentence on his own, which could not
come into action       until the other had already produced its effects        :
" The theory of Charpentier, which attributes the descent of          the gla
cier to the daily congelation of the water which percolates it, and
the expansion of its mass consequent thereon, whilst it assigns a
cause   which, so far as it operates, cannot, as         I  have   shown, but
cause a glacier to descend,       appears   to me to assign one inadequate
to the result  ;   for the congelation of the water which percolates the
glacier does not, according to the observations of Professor Forbes,
take place at all in summer more than a few inches from the sur
face.    Nevertheless it is in summer that the daily motion of the
glacier is greatest."      (Moseley, Proc. R.S. vol. vii. p. 341.)

       William        B.   Carpenter, M.D.,           F.R.S.,     F.G.S.   &c.
       Received     May 21, 1855.
   The group of Foraminifera           being one as to the structure       and
physiology of which our knowledge             is confessedly very imperfect,

                                      418
and for the natural classification of which there is consequently no
safe basis, the author has undertaken a careful study of some of its
chief typical forms, in order to elucidate (so far as may be pos
sible) their history as living beings, and to determine the value of
the characters which        they present to the systematise         In the  pre
sent memoir, he details the structure of one of the lowest of these
types, Orbitolites, with great minuteness;         his object having been,
not merely to present the results of his investigations, but also to
exhibit the method by which they have been attained            ;  that method
essentially consisting in the minute examination and comparison of
a  large number of specimens.
    The Orbitolite    has been chiefly known,   until recently, through the
abundance of its fossil remains in the Eocene beds of the Paris
basin ; but the author, having been fortunate enough to obtain an
extensive series       of  recent  specimens,  chiefly  from the coast of
 Australia, has applied himself rather to these as his sources of in
formation    ;  especially as the animals of some of them have been suf
ficiently well preserved      by immersion in spirits, to permit their cha
racters to be well made out.
    As might     have been anticipated from our knowledge         of their con
 geners,  these animals belong to the Rhizopodous type       ;   the soft body
 consisting of sarcode, without digestive cavity or organs of any kind          ;
 and being made up of a number of segments, equal and similar to
 each other, which are       arranged in concentric zones round a central
 nucleus.      This body is invested by     a calcareous shell, in the sub
 stance of which no minute         structure can be discerned, but which
 has the form     of a circular disk, marked on the surface by concentric
 zones of closed cells, and having          minute pores at the margin.
 Starting from the central nucleus, — which consists of         a  pear-shaped
 mass  of  sarcode,   nearly surrounded by a larger mass connected with
 it by a peduncle, — the development of the Orbitolite       may take place
 either upon a simple, or upon a complex type.         In the former (which
 is indicated by the circular or oval form of the cells which              show
 themselves at the surfaces of the disk, and by the singleness of the
 row of marginal pores), each zone consists of but a single layer of
 segments, connected together by a single annular stolon of sarcode             ;
 and the nucleus is connected with the first zone, and each zone with
 that which surrounds it, by radiating peduncles proceeding from this

                                    419
annulus, which, when issuing from the peripheral zone, will pass out
wards through the marginal pores, probably in the form of pseudo-
podia.    In  the complex type, on the other hand      (which is indicated
by the narrow and straight-sided form of the superficial cells, and
by the multiplication of the horizontal     rows of marginal pores), the
segments of the concentric zones are elongated into vertical columns
with imperfect constrictions at intervals    ; instead of   a  single annular
stolon, there are two, one at either end of these columns, between
which, moreover, there are usually other lateral communications              ;
whilst the radiating peduncles, which connect one zone with another,
are also   multiplied, so as to lie in several    planes.      Moreover,  be
tween each annular stolon and the neighbouring surface of the disk,
there   is a layer of superficial segments,     distinct from the vertical
columns, but connected with the annular stolons         ; these occupy the
narrow elongated cells just mentioned, which constitute two super
ficial layers in the disks of this type, between which is the interme
 diate layer occupied by the columnar segments.
    These two types seem to be so completely dissimilar,            that they
 could scarcely have been supposed to belong to the same species             ;
 but the examination of      a large number of specimens          shows, that
 although    one  is often developed   to a considerable size upon the
 simple type, whilst another commences         even from the centre upon
 the complex type, yet that many individuals         which begin life, and
 form an indefinite number of annuli, upon the simple type, then take
 on the more complex mode of development.
    The author then points out what may        be gathered from observa
 tion   and from deduction      respecting the Nutrition and mode           of
 Growth of these creatures.       He shows that the former is probably
 accomplished, as in other Rhizopods, by the entanglement and draw
 ing in of minute vegetable particles, through the instrumentality          of
 the pseudopodia    ; and that the addition of new zones probably takes
 place by the extension of the sarcode      through the marginal pores,
 so as to form a complete annulus,      thickened at intervals into seg
 ments, and narrowed between these into connecting stolons, the
 shell being probably produced by the calcification of their outer por
 tions.    And this view   he supports by the results    of the examination
 of  a number of specimens,    in which reparation    of injuries   has taken
 place.    Regarding    the Reproduction of Orbitolites,      he is only able

                                            420
to suggest that certain minute spherical masses of sarcode,                       with
which some of the cells are filled, may be gemmules                 ; and that other
bodies,      enclosed    in firm envelopes,        which he has more rarely met
with, but which          seem to break their way out of the superficial cells,
may be ova.           But on this part of      the inquiry, nothing save observa
tion of the animals in their living state can give satisfactory results.
    The regular type of structure just described is subject to nume
rous variations, into a minute description of which the author next
enters     ;  the general results being, that neither the shape nor dimen
sions of the entire disk, the size of the nucleus or of the cells form
ing the concentric          zones, the surface-markings        indicating the shape
of the superficial cells, nor the early mode of growth (which, though
typically cyclical, sometimes approximates to                a  spiral), can serve as
distinctive characters of species           ;  since, whilst they are all found to
present most remarkable differences, these differences, being strictly
gradational,         can   only be considered as distinguishing            individuals.
 It thus follows that          a very wide range         of variation exists in this
type   ;     so   that   numerous      forms which        would   be   unhesitatingly
 accounted specifically different,            if  only the most divergent     examples
 were brought into comparison, are found, by the discovery of those
 intermediate       links which a large collection can alone supply, to be
 long to one and the same specific type.
    After noticing         some   curious monstrosities,     resulting   from an un
 usual outgrowth of the central nucleus, the author proceeds to in
 quire into the essential character of the Orbitolite,              and its relations
 to other types of structure.              He places it among the very lowest
 forms of Foraminifera          ;  and considers that it approximates closely
 to sponges,        some of which have          skeletons not very unlike the cal
 careous net- work which intervenes between its-fleshy segments.                    Of
 the species which the genus has been reputed to include, he states
 that a large proportion really belong to the genus Orbiloides, whilst
 others are but varieties of the ordinary type.                This last is the light
 in which he would regard the Orbitolites complanata                     of the Paris
 basin   ;    which     differs from     the    fully-developed    Orbitolite   of the
 Australian       coast in some very peculiar features (marking a less com
 plete     evolution),      which   are   occasionally    met with among recent
forms, and which are sometimes                  distinctly transitional   towards the
 perfect type.

   The author concludes by calling attention to          some general prin
ciples, which arise out of the present inquiry, but which are appli
cable to all departments of Natural History, regarding the kind and
extent of comparison       on which alone specific      distinctions   can be
securely based.

I. " On     a supposed   Aerolite or Meteorite found in the Trunk of
       an old   Willow Tree in the Battersea Fields."            By Sir Ro
       derick Impey Murchison, F.R.S., Director-General of
      the Geological      Survey of Great Britain.           Received    June
      21, 1855.
   In bringing this notice before the Royal Society, it is unnecessary      to
recite, however briefly, the history of the fall of aerolites or meteorites,
as recorded for upwards of three thousand years, though              I may be

                                       422
pardoned for reminding         my Associates,    that the phenomenon was
repudiated by the most learned academies of Europe up to the close
of the last century.       The merit of having first endeavoured to          de
monstrate the true character of these extraneous bodies is mainly
due to the German          Chladni   (1794), but his efforts were at first
viewed with incredulity.          According   to Vauquelin  and other men
of eminence who have reasoned          on the phenomena, it was in        1 802
only that meteorites obtained a due degree of consideration and some
thing like a definite place in science through the studies of Howard,
as shown in his memoir published in the Philosophical Transactions.
   Vauquelin,    Klaproth, and other distinguished chemists, including
Berzelius and llammelsberg, have successively analysed these bodies,
and the result of their labours, as ably brought together in the work
of the last-mentioned author, is, that whilst they       have a great gene
ral resemblance and       are  distinguishable on the whole by their com
position from any bodies found in the crust of the earth, each of
their component substances is individually found in our planet.
They   are also peculiarly      marked by the small number of minerals
which     have  collectively been detected in any one of them        ;  nickel
and cobalt, in certain relations to iron, being the chief characteristics
of the metallic meteorites.
   Of the various theories propounded to account for the origin of these
singular bodies, it would indeed ill become a geologist like myself to
speak  ;   and referring in the sequel to some of the various works in
which the subject has been brought within formula,            I will   at once
detail the facts connected with the discovery of this metalliferous
body in the heart of a tree, as now placed before the Members of
our Society, feeling assured that, whatever be their ultimate deci
sion, my contemporaries will approve of the efforts that have been
made to account for this singular and mysterious phenomenon.
   On    the 2nd of   June,   a  timber merchant, residing at North Brix
ton, named Clement Poole, brought the specimen now exhibited to
the Museum of Practical Geology,          when it occurred to Mr. Trenham
Reeks, our Curator, that it might be a meteorite, and on inspecting
its position in the mass of wood, and having heard all the evidence
connected with it,      I was disposed to form    the same conclusion.       On
submitting a small portion of the metallic part to a qualitative test
in the metallurgical laboratory of our establishment, the presence of

                                   423
nickel, cobalt and manganese      was detected   in the iron included   in
the  mass,   and as the surface was scorified, indented, uneven,      and
partially  coated  with a peculiar substance,     the surmise as to the
meteoric nature of the imbedded       material seemed to be rendered
much more probable.       Again, in looking   at the wood which imme
diately surrounded that portion of the mass which remained, as it is
now, firmly inserted in the tree, a blackened substance was observed
to be interpolated     between the supposed     meteorite and the sur
rounding sound wood.       On the outside of this substance (which had
somewhat    a charred aspect) we observed a true bark, which follows
the sinuosities of the wood wherever the latter appears to have been
influenced by the intrusion of the foreign mineral matter.      [The  spe
 cimen is represented in the annexed wood-cut.]
    Seeing thus enough to satisfy our conjecture,        if sanctioned by
 other evidence,  I desired Mr. Poole to bring all the fragments of the
 wood he had not destroyed which surrounded this body. On placing
 the ends of some of these (also now exhibited) on the parts from
 which they had been sawed off, they indicated that the space be
 tween the mineral      substance   and the   surrounding     sound  wood
  widened upwards    ;  the decayed   wood passing into brown earthy

                                                        424
matter with an opening or cavity into which rootlets extended.                                                On
interrogating          Mr. Poole, who cut down the                        tree and superintended
the breaking up of its timber,                      I   learnt from him all requisite parti
culars respecting             its dimensions,                 the position of the ferruginous
mass, the quantity             of wood        above and below             it,   a description            of the
place where the stool of the                        tree was        still to    be seen, and             of   the
parties who, living on the spot, were acquainted with every circum
stance which could throw                    light on the          case.
   At this period of              the inquiry, the Museum in                    Jermyn Street                 was
visited by Dr. Shepard, Professor in the University                                      College, Am
herst, United           States, whose researches                      on meteorites are                  widely
known,       and       who has furnished an able classification                               of them by
which they are divided into the two great classes of stony and me
tallic.      Having        carefully examined the specimen, Dr. Shepard ex
pressed his decided belief that                     it was      a true meteorite, and the next
day wrote to me the              following account of it ; at the same time re
ferring me most            obligingly to a series of interesting publications on
the subject as printed in America and Europe •: —
   " Concerning the highly interesting mineral                                  mass,      lately found
enclosed in the trunk of a tree, and of which you have done me the
honour to ask my opinion,                     I    beg leave to observe, that                  I    have       no
hesitation in pronouncing it to be a true meteoric stone.
  " Aside from the
                    difficulty of otherwise accounting for                                         it,   under
the      circumstances         in which            it   is    found, the mass presents those
 *    Dr. Shepard's       numerous         memoirs       on meteorites     are all to be found in the
volumes of the American             Journal of Science and Art, and in the same work the
reader will find not only the general                classification   of these bodies by this author,
who possesses      a   collection    from 103 localities, but also essays on the same subject
by his countrymen         Dr. Troost, Professor              Silliman, jun., and Dr. Clark.
   In our own      country,       Mr. Brayley published            some years ago      a   comprehensive
view of this subject in the Philosophical Magazine,                     and recently     Mr. Greg has in
the same publication put together                 all the previous and additional materials, with
tables    showing the geographical                distribution of meteorites.          Among the well-
recorded examples of the fall of metalliferous                   meteorites,    no one   is   more remark
able than    that which happened             in the year 1851, about            sixteen leagues S.E. of
Barcelona    in Spain.       In   describing       that phenomenon,        Dr. Joaquim Balcclls, Pro
fessor of Natural Sciences            at    Barcelona,        has illustrated the subject with much
erudition, whilst his theoretical           views       are ingenious     in his endeavour to explain
how meteorites are derived from the moon.

                                        425
 peculiar traits that are regarded as characteristic of meteorites.               It
 has, for example, a fused, vitrified black coating, which is quite con
 tinuous over a considerable part of the mass, and contains several
 grains and imbedded nodular and vein-like portions of metallic iron,
 in which    I understand nickel and cobalt have been detected.
     " The general character of the body of the stone is indeed pecu
 liar  ; and as a whole, unlike any one        I  have yet seen   ;  it being prin
 cipally made up of      a dull greyish yellow, peridotic mineral, which           I
 have    nowhere met with among these              productions,     except in the
 Hommoney Creek meteoric iron mass, and which exists in it only in
 a  very limited quantity.         It is singular to remark         also,  that the
 stone under notice strikingly resembles in size, shape and surface,
 the iron above alluded to.
    " The    absence    of the black, slaggy coating on        one of the broad
 surfaces   of the stone, may     arise from its having been broken away,
 by the violence to which it must have been subjected in entering
 the tree ; for   it appears   to have buried itself completely at its con
 tact, an operation which would           probably have been impossible, in
the case of     a stone, but for its wedge-shaped configuration, and the
coincidence of one of its edges with the vertical fibres of the wood."
    In reply to     a question   I  subsequently put to Dr. Shepard as to
whether he knew of any examples of meteorites having struck trees
in America, he replied as follows        :—
    " I think you will find in the volume I left with Mr. Reeks at the
Museum, an account of the fall of Little Piney,             Missouri, February
 13th,   1839; in which it is stated that the stone struck a tree and
was shattered to fragments,         it being  one   of a brittle character.      In
the interior of the Cabarras county,          N. Carolina,     a stone (October
31, 1849)     I  know struck a tree, and      I  found it was difficult, indeed
impossible, to separate        completely the adhering woody fibres from
the rough hard crust of the meteorite.             The  stone   in this case is a
peculiarly tough one, having a decidedly trappean character, render
ing it   as nearly infragile as cast    iron."
    Aware that some time must elapse before               the  precise analysis,
which    I wished to be made in the laboratory of Dr. Percy, could be
completed, and that the last meeting of the Royal Society was to be
held this evening, I announced the notice I am now communicating.
At   the same time     I resolved to visit the locality where the tree stood,

                                                    126
and to obtain on the spot all the details required.                              Having done so.
accompanied by Mr. Robert Brown,                            Sir Philip Grey Egerton,             Pro
fessor    J.   Nicol, and Mr. Trenham Reeks, the information ultimately
obtained was as follows               :   —
  The man who helped to cut down the                              tree confirmed in every re
spect the evidence of       Mr. Poole              as to its position, height, and dimen
sions, and pointed out to us the stump or stool we were in search of,
which is to be seen at nearly 200 yards to the east of the St. George's
Chapel, Lower Road, Battersea Fields,                         and at the eastern end of                a
nursery        garden, between the railway                     and the road, occupied by
Mr. Henry Shailer.
  The                    willow, probably about sixty years of age,
           tree was a large
which stood immediately to the east of the old parsonage house re
cently pulled down.  Its stem measured about 10 feet in circum
ference    at 3 feet above the ground, and had a length of between                                     9
and 10 feet      ;    from its summit three main branches extended, one of
which, pointing to the            S.W. or W.S.W., had                      been for many years
blighted,       and was    rotten to near its junction with the top of the
main trunk        ;   a portion           of this blighted        main branch is exhibited.
The other two main branches, which                           rose to a height          of 50 or 60
feet, were quite sound            ;       a   part of one of these offsets is also exhi
bited.
   The stool of the        tree was visibly perfect and without a flaw, and
at the wish of         Mr. R. Brown,              a section of     it   has been obtained since
our visit, which is also here, and the rings of which seem to confirm
the supposition as to the age of the tree.
   Mr. Poole having conveyed                       the tree to    Brixton, cut     the trunk into
two nearly equal parts, intending                        to make cricket-bats out of each.
In doing       so, he perceived that the upper portion                      of   the lower   of the
two segments was in a shaky or imperfect condition,                                 and hence he
resolved to saw off the upper part of                       it,   intending thereby to obtain
                                              "          " of
wood large enough for the                         pods        his cricket-bats, but not          such
entire bats as he was making out of the upper segment.
   In dividing the tree, the saw was stopped at about                              8   inches from
the surface on one side (or the breadth of a large saw) by                                   a   very
hard, impenetrable substance, which was supposed to be                                 a   nail, and
hence      Mr. Poole resolved to break up the portion of                             the wood he
had previously condemned as of inferior quality, and hewing                                it   down

                                                            427
from the sides he uncovered, to his astonishment, the great lump of
metalliferous           matter, as now seen.                       Attaching        little value to it,
much of the surrounding                     wood was thrown               away or used up before
the specimen was brought                         to    Jermyn Street      ;   but enough has been
obtained to throw               light on              the    probable or possible origin of the
included mass.
   On interrogating Henry Shailer,                             a market gardener, who has long
lived on the spot and managed                                the ground       where the tree grew,
when it was part of the garden of the former clergyman                                       (Mr. Wed-
dell), I learnt from him that                         he had known the spot for sixty years,
that in his days of boyhood it was a fellmonger's yard, before it was
attached to the garden.                     He had observed that the tree was blighted
in one of its main branches for many years, and had always sup
posed     that it was struck by lightning in one of two storms, the
first of which happened about 1838 or 1839, the other about nine
years ago.
   So far the evidence                     obtained might be supposed to favour the
theory that this ferruginous mass* had been discharged near to the
blighted branch, and had penetrated downwards into the tree, to the
position in which we now see it, charring                                 and warping            the wood
immediately around it in its downward                               progress    ;    whilst in the six
teen years which have elapsed,                              the wood renovating itself, produced
the appearance               which has so much interested the eminent botanists
who have examined                    it,   viz.      Mr. R. Brown, Dr. Lindley, Professor
Henfrey, Dr.            J.   Hooker, and Mr. Bennett.
   On the other hand,                  I        must now point out some features of this
extraordinary case which check the belief in the included mass being
a meteorite.
   We found lying near                      the root of the tree two fragments, one of
which             similar to the substance included in the tree, while the
          is is
other             decidedly an iron slag.                         On bringing        these    fragments,
weighing several              pounds, to Jermyn Street, and on breaking one of
them,     it   was found, like the supposed meteorite, to contain certain
small portions of metallic iron, in which both nickel and cobalt were
also    present     ;   and hence the scepticism which had prevailed from
       The ferruginous
 *
                              mass is,     it   is   supposed, about thirty pounds in weight         ;   but as
one of its extremities         is   still imbedded in the wood,         the precise weight cannot be
stated.
   VOl. Vii.                                                                                 2   s

                                           428
   the  beginning      of  the   inquiry in the minds of some of my friends,
  was worked up into a definite shape.
      The occurrence of stones enclosed in wood is not                 a novel pheno
  menon.       Mr. Robert Brown          has called my attention         to two cases
  as recorded in the      following works       : —
      " De  lapide in trunco betulae reperto. G. F. Richter in Acta Phys.
  Med. Acad. Nat. Curios, volume 3, page 66*."
      " Descriptio Saxi       in Quercu inventi.          Kellander,   Acta Literaria
  et Scientiae    Sueciae." 1739, pp. 502, 503.
      Since the Battersea phenomenon was announced. Professor Hens-
  low, to whom       I had applied, wrote to me saying, that he possessed
 a   remarkable example of a stone which was found imbedded                      in the
 heart of a tree, in sawing it up in Plymouth Dockyard                   ;  and he has
 obligingly     sent up the specimen, which is now also exhibited.                    In
 this case, judging from the mineral character of the rock, and its
 being slightly magnetic, Professor Henslow                    supposed    that it was
 perhaps     a  volcanic bomb.         On referring it to Dr. Shepard, that
 gentleman entertains the opinion that it is also a meteorite, and
 states that it resembles certain meteoric stones with which he is ac
 quainted    ; suspicions of which had also been entertained by Professor
 Henslow,        From the examination of           a minute fragment which        I  de
 tached from this stone, it appears            to be composed        of a base of fel-
spathic matter, with minute crystals of felspar and of magnetic iron
pyrites.       Externally it     has  a trachytic      aspect,   though, when frac
tured, it more resembles,           in the opinion of      Mr. Warington Smyth,
a pale    Cornish elvan or porphyry           than any other British rock with
which it can be compared.              Whatever       may have been the origin of
this stone, which is of the size of a child's head, it is essentially dif
ferent from the metalliferous mass from Battersea, to which atten
tion has been specially invited,            and    its position in the heart of an
oak is equally remarkable.            Like the Battersea specimen, the              seg
ment of wood from Plymouth Dockyard is characterized by an inte
rior bark which folds round the sinuosities of the included                  stone.
     In respect to    the envelopment      of manufactured materials in          trees,
    * " Lapis  praedurus subalbicans   et manifesto siliceus pruni ferine aut juglandis
minoris magnitudine.     * * * * Nidus ad figuram lapidis     non plane accommodatus,
sed quadrangulus,    et hinc illinc in mediocrcs   rimas desinens, corticeque  imprimis
notabili, non multum ab exteriori cute diverso, maximam partem vestitus."

                                        429
my friend,     Mr. H. Brooke,      the distinguished      mineralogist, tells me
that he perfectly remembers the case of an iron chain which had
been enclosed     in the heart of a tree, the wood of which was sound
around the whole of the included             metallic body.        This specimen
was to be seen some years ago in the British Museum.                      Again,    he
informs me that at Stoke Newington                he recollects to have       seen    a
tree, the trunk     of which   had grown over and completely enclosed                 a
scythe, except on the sides where its ends protruded*.
    Whatever may have been the origin of the metalliferous mass from
Battersea, its discovery has at all events served to develope certain
peculiarities in the growth of plants which appear to be of high in
terest to the eminent botanists who have examined the parts of this
tree which surrounded the supposed meteorite.                Unwilling to     endea
vour to anticipate the final decision as to the origin of the body in
question,    I may be permitted to feel a satisfaction that its discoverer
 brought it to the Establishment           of which     I am the Director,        and
 which numbers among its officers          a Fellow of this Society, who         is so
 well calculated, by his analytical researches, to settle the question on
 a  permanent basis.      Should the metallurgical analyses now under the
 conduct of Dr. Percy lead to the inevitable conclusion that the com
 position    of this body is different from that of well-authenticated
 meteorites, and is similar to that of undoubted iron slags, we shall
 then have obtained proofs of the great circumspection required be
 fore we assign a meteoric         origin to   some    of these crystalline       iron
 masses, which though not seen to fall,            have,  from their containing
 nickel, cobalt and other elements,          been    supposed    to be formed by
 causes extraneous to our planet.
     Postscript, 30th June 1855. —The following are the analyses above
referred to, which have been given to me by Dr. Percy since the

II. "On      the  Magnetism of Iron Ships, and its accordance
       with Theory,   as determined        externally,      in recent Experi
       ments."    By the Rev. W. Scoresby, D.D., F.R.S., Corr.
       Memb. Inst. France, &c.          Received June 21, 1855.
   The magnetic condition of iron ships is a subject of so much im
portance, practically and scientifically, that     I   have been induced to
submit to the Society       a few characteristic      facts (hastily      indeed
brought together) derived from recent experiments.
                                                       '
   In  a work in the Society's    library,  entitled       Magnetical    Investi
gations,' it was shown, by deductions from an elaborate series of
experiments on plates and bars of malleable iron, that the magnetic
condition of iron ships should, theoretically, be conformable to the
direction of terrestrial   induction whilst on the stocks         ;  and the re
tentive quality, which   is so highly developed by virtue of the ham
mering and other mechanical action during the building, should be
so far fixed in the same direction, as to remain after the ships might
be launched, until disturbed by fresh mechanical action             in new posi
tions of their head or keel.     In this view, taking, for instance, the
condition of the middle, or the main breadth section of                a ship on
the stocks, the magnetic polar axis should assume the direction of
the dipping-needle (with an equatorial plane, or plane of no-attrac
tion at right angles to it), passing through or proximate to the
centre of gravity of the iron material in such section.              Thus every
ship should have    a  characteristic magnetic distribution,           primarily,
dependent on her position whilst on the stocks           ;  so that, being   built
with   the  head north or south, the equatorial plane should appear
 externally on the same horizontal       level, the polar axis only being
inclined from the vertical, in correspondence with the direction of
the axis of terrestrial magnetism (Magnetical         Investigations, vol. ii.
pp. 331, 332).
    It was also inferred, that whilst such individuality of the             mag
netic distribution would be rendered retentive on the same principles
as this quality  of magnetism is developed in bars or plates of iron
by mechanical action, so the axial direction of the ship's magnetism
would be liable to change, under mechanical action, in new positions
 of the ship's head, or under new relations of terrestrial magnetism.

                                    432
just   as the retentive magnetism is liable to change in bars or plates
 of iron    if hammered, vibrated, or bent whilst        held in new po
 sitions.
    And it was further inferred, that the analogy with plates and bars
 might be expected to hold, notwithstanding         the numerous pieces of
 which the ship's hull might be composed,          because,  in experiments
 on combining short magnets into long series, or submitting           piles of
 short bars of iron to terrestrial induction, it was found that no ma
 terial difference in the effects occurred betwixt a single steel magnet
 of  a given length, or a single bar   of iron, and the     same substance
 and dimensions combined in short or small pieces in contact.          Hence
 it was considered that     an iron ship should      exhibit in its general
fabric the characteristic     phenomena of one undivided         mass,    or a
 unity as a magnetic body.
    These anticipations, it will be seen (published betwixt three and
four years ago), have, so far as we have now time to elucidate them,
had verifications, in actual experiments on iron ships, as beautiful as
they are conclusive.
    In  the case of the 'Elba,' an iron ship of 200 feet in length, built
recently on the Tyne, the magnetic condition             before   launching,
which    I was invited to investigate by  Mr. Robert Newall, the owner,
was found satisfactorily accordant with theory.          Her   head  pointed
south a few degrees westerly, and her lines of no-deviation (indica
tive of the position of the magnetic equatorial plane) were at a small
distance in elevation different on the two sides, that of the starboard
side being the highest.      Proceeding in  a  direction at right angles to
the dip, and passing through, or near to, the ship's general centre
of gravity, the lines of no-attraction (descending forward) came out
near the junction of the stem with the keel.          And there, it was re
markable, as     I had suggested as probable to       Mr. James Napier of
Glasgow, before making any experiment, there was found a depart
ure from the ordinary regularity of the lines of no-attraction            in a
considerable downward bend.
    Towards the stern, the equatorial lines rose out of and came above
the iron plating of the top-sides,     about 40 feet from the tafrail         ;
thus giving to the after-part of the ship    a  uniform northern polarity.
The ship, consequently,       had become    a huge simple magnet — the
north pole at the stern and the south at the head.           The attractive

                                           433
  power, as was expected,          was highly energetic.        At the distance of
  50 feet, a compass       on the level of the keel, at right angles to it
  abreast of the stern, was deviated to an extent of above 10°              ;  at 100
 feet distance the ship's magnetism caused a deflection                of about half
 a  point; and at      150 and       even   200 feet there was a very sensible
 disturbance     !
     In the                  '
             case  of the      Fiery Cross,' built at Glasgow and launched
 in January last (a    case which      I have elsewhere referred to), the lines
 of no-deviation,     as taken for me by           Mr. James Napier, were still
 more    rigidly in accordance with theory, — the difference of elevation
 of the observed lines of no-deviation at               the main-breadth      section
 agreeing with calculation, theoretically,            to within an inch or two.
 In  the other case, that        of the  '
                                           Elba,'  a slight discrepancy as to the
 comparative level of the lines of no-attraction on the two sides, might,
 perhaps, be satisfactorily explained by the proximity and somewhat
 disturbing    influence of another iron ship (advanced only to the
 frames or angle irons) on the port side of her.
    In the   case  of the  '
                               Elizabeth Harrison,'      a large iron ship built at
 Liverpool, the first    I  had carefully examined, the correspondence of
 the magnetic polar axis and equatorial plane with those                  of terres
 trial action was equally characteristic          and conclusive.
    Hence we may perceive a sufficient reason for some of the pecu
liar phenomena in iron ships of the compass disturbances and their
 changes. We may see why a ship built with her head easterly or
 westerly, and having the polar axis inclined over 18° or 20° to the
starboard or port side,            should    be particularly    liable to compass
changes,    if severely strained or struck by the sea with her head in
an opposite direction.          We   see why the compasses        of the 'Tayleur'
should have been exposed to such             a change as appears to have taken
place   in her lamentable       case.    We    see in the case   of the 'Ottawa*'
(one I have elsewhere referred to), why a heavy blow of the sea, with
the ship heeling and her head pointing eastward, would be likely to
produce a change in her magnetism, when her previous magnetic
distribution was solicited by terrestrial action in an angle of 30° or 40°
of difference.      And we      see why the deviations of the compass in iron
ships should, differently from those of wooden ships, be sometimes
westerly and sometimes          easterly in ships    built and trading in      home
                * Where  the compass suddenly      changed two points.

                                     434
latitudes   ; for here, whilst in wooden ships, where the iron work is
in detached masses, the ship can have but little, externally, of the
character of a true magnet, and can possess        but small comparative
differences from the position of her head whilst building            ; in iron
ships, on the converse,       where the ship is rendered by percussive
action a powerful and, retentively,     true magnet, her deviating action
must be expected to be different, as the polarity of the head or stern
may differ in denomination, or as the ship's magnetic polar axis may
happen to lie over to starboard or port.
    As  an objection might be made to deductions from experiments on
simple individual      bars or plates of iron being applied to the case of
iron ships built up of thousands of pieces,     I have repeated     the expe
riments, substituting for an entire plate or bar of iron a plate about
 18  inches long and    3 broad, made up of numerous separate           plates,
and combined in the manner of the plating of iron ships.                   The
compound or combined          plate of some eighteen or twenty pieces
yielded, under percussion, vibration        or bending,    results precisely
 similar to those obtained by the use of single plates or bars.
 III.   Extract of    a  Letter from Professor Langberg           of Christi-
        ania to Colonel     Sabine, dated June 10th, 1855.               Com
        municated by Colonel Sabine, V.P. and Treas. R.S.
    " Of all the important results from the discussions of the British
 Colonial Observatory, the discovery of the direct action of the sun
 on the magnetism of the earth is certainly a fact of the highest in
 terest, in opening quite a new field for investigation  ;  and few modern
 discoveries in this branch of science      have interested me more than
 yours of the annual variation of the diurnal variation of declination.
 It seems that    M. Secchi of Rome has nearly touched at the same
 discovery, and I am indeed glad that the enormous quantity of cal
 culations, which you are superintending,       did not prevent you from
 publishing your results before the ripening fruit was plucked by an
 other.    The first beautiful result of this annual variation is      the ex
 planation of the fact, which you have deduced       from the observations
 at St. Helena and the Cape of Good Hope, that the horary variation

                                         435
of declination does not vanish in passing from the northern to the
southern magnetic hemisphere, hut only changes signs at the equi
noxes.     I think every physicist will       agree with you, that no thermic
hypothesis will be able to explain this annual variation, but as you
                                       '
say (Toronto,      ii. p. xix), it is     obviously connected with, and de
pendent on, the earth's position in its orbit relatively to the sun,
around which it revolves,         as the diurnal variation is connected with
the rotation of the earth on its axis.'           But you    have   given no hint
how this different position in its orbit can affect the magnetic condi
tion of the earth, except so far as you suppose that the excentricity
of the orbit is    the reason that the total magnetic force is about
greater at the perihelion than at the aphelion (page xciii) ; but even
granted that this variation is the effect of the excentricity, it cannot
be the cause      of the annual variation of the declination,          as this is  of
contrary signs in the two semiannual periods.
    "I have thought that this annual variation might possibly be ex
plained by the following considerations,               which  I  (although     with
extreme     diffidence) shall venture to lay before you.
    " As  the recent magnetic observations have proved without doubt
the direct magnetic action of the sun, or that the sun itself is a
magnet, the sun must accordingly have magnetic polarity or mag
netic poles.       Now in our ignorance of the causes of the magnetic
condition of the heavenly bodies,           I think it reasonable to connect it
 in some way with their rotation on their axes, and to assume that
generally their magnetic axis will nearly coincide with the axis of
rotation   ;  at all events,   if these do not coincide, but include a small
acute angle, the sum of the magnetic              influences on a distant mag
 netic body during a whole rotation, will be nearly the same as               if the
 magnetic poles were placed in the axis of rotation.                If we suppose
 a magnet     E revolving about another S, the magnetic axis of E                 re
 maining parallel with itself, but not parallel with the axis of S (as
 the earth around the sun), then the magnetic induction of S on E
 will depend on the relative position of both magnetic axes. More
 over, if we only regard the mean of the magnetic induction of the sun
 on the earth during several rotations of both on their axes, we may
 approximately assume that the magnetic axis of both coincides with
 the axis of rotation,       and compare       their relative position during        a
  whole revolution or annual period, with the magnetic variation in

                                        436
  question.      Now, if   a plane is laid   through the sun's axis parallel
  with the axis of the earth, this plane intersects the ecliptic in two
  points, whose longitudes are 286° and 106°, and has an inclination
  of 83°-2, both axes forming        an angle of 25°- 8.     Accordingly,   the
  northerly prolongation      of both axes will converge     (as in  1 and   2)
 when the longitude is 286°, or about seventeen days after the summer
 solstice, and the southerly prolongation         (as in  2 and 3) when the
 longitude     of the earth is    106°,  or sixteen days after the winter
solstice.     About sixteen days after the equinoxes the axes are in the
position 2, and the radius vector forms the greatest angle with the
above-named plane, viz. 830-2.           It is therefore evident, that the
greatest magnetic induction        takes place at the two solstices, but of
opposite character, as the north poles converge in one, and the south
poles    in the other semiannual period       : the change takes place six
teen days    after the equinoxes, exactly as you have found by observa
tion, and     I regard this circumstance as very important evidence for
my hypothesis, although you have shown that              it could also be ac
counted for by the fact, that all magnetic induction takes some time
ere  it attains its maximum.
    " If  the sun's magnetic axis does not coincide with the axis       of ro
tation, then     I suppose  we shall find, by more minute examination of
the observations, that there exists also a small magnetic variation
corresponding to the sun's geocentric rotation, or 27 -68 days.
   " There     seems also to be strong reason to suppose     that Hansteen's
discovery about the annual periodic frequency of the aurora borealis,
which has a marked maximum at the equinoxes, and even a more
marked maximum at the solstices, is connected with the same cause."

 IV. "Anatomical Notices."                   By Professor Andrew Retzius,
        of Stockholm.         Extracted from a Letter to Dr. Sharpey,
        dated 10th May, 1855.                Communicated by Dr. Sharpey,
         Sec. R.S.      (Translation.)
              "I.   On the Form      of  the Cranium in the Embryo.
    " So far   as I  am aware, due attention has not hitherto been given
to the different forms presented by the cranium in its earlier stages
 of growth.      In  the skeletons    of early human embryos to             be seen in
 most museums, the imperfectly ossified cranium is for the most part
 shrunk up and disfigured.         To obtain      a correct view of the form of the
cranial cavity,    I first  remove the skin, fascia and muscles          ;  I then, by
 injecting    water through       the vertebral canal, thoroughly             wash out
 the soft brain and spinal cord            ;  and lastly, fill the cerebro- spinal
 cavity with quicksilver        or with melted tallow,          taking care not to
 distend it over-much.          The opening in the vertebral canal is to be
 stopped     with a    little plug of wood, and the preparation allowed
 to dry.
    " In the skeleton of        a human embryo           of the fourth month, pre
pared in this way, the occipital bone was found to have the form of
a  funnel, the narrow part of which passed into the vertebral canal,
as represented in the accompanying figure                  1.
    " It thus   appears that the human occipital bone, in its early con
dition, approaches in form to the vertebral canal, and in this respect
also   it resembles    the occipital bone in several quadrupeds, which so
obviously represents the first cephalic vertebra.
    " For the    sake    of comparison,       I  divided the skull of another em
bryo of the same age into two halves by a vertical median section,
washed out the brain and examined the preparation while                      it lay im
mersed      in weak spirit of wine in a shallow glass capsule.                     The
occipital bone had the same funnel-shape as in the former case.                      As
development advances,          the funnel-like form is gradually lost, whilst,
on the other hand, the bone appears more deepened or tubular the
earlier the embryo to which               it belongs.         The  same    is true of
quadrupeds.
    " In the beautiful figure of        the embryo-skull,        given in Kolliker's

longation of the occipital bone appears         much less, but whether less
than it ought to be      I  cannot venture to say, as    I happen to have no
specimen of that age (one month older than the one               I have given)
with which to compare the figure.
                                      Fig. 1.
     " The early form of the occipital      bone  I have here    described be
 comes    easily intelligible    when we remember      that the shape of the
 skull is regulated by that of the brain       ; and that as the latter is at
 first greatly elongated, and its ganglia imperfectly covered,         the cra
 nium must then also have         a correspondingly elongated form.
                          "  2.  On the Antrum   Pylori.
     " I have now for some time directed my attention to the determi
 nation of the true form of the stomach, and have become more and
 more    convinced    that the antrum pylori        of the older anatomists
                    '
 (' PfortnerhShle      of the Germans) is really      a  special compartment
 of the general cavity.        I have had occasion to make      numerous ex

V. " On the Effect of Local Attraction upon the Plumb-line at
       stations on the English Arc of the Meridian, between Dun-
       nose and Burleigh       Moor ; and    a   Method of computing its
       Amount."       By the Venerable Archdeacon Pratt. Com
       municated by the Rev. J. Challis, F.R.S.                 Received June
       5, 1855.
   The author    states that in a former communication he had pointed
out a method for calculating the deflection of the plumb-line at sta
tions on the Indian arc, caused by the attraction of the Himalayas
and of the vast regions beyond, with a view to the correction of the
astronomical     amplitudes of the measured          subdivisions    of  the  arc
before they are applied to the determination of the           ellipticity of  the
earth.
    The   same subject is taken up in the present paper, but in refer
ence to the    English arc between Dunnose          and Burleigh    Moor   ; and
a different method     of calculating the attraction is given.
    The paper consists of     three parts.    In  the first, the   ellipticity of
the English arc is calculated without taking account of attraction.
The arc is divided into      five parts, and the lengths       and amplitudes
assigned to them       in Mudge's Trigonometrical        Survey of England,
vols. ii. and iii., are made the basis     of the calculation.       These por
tions of the arc are compared two and two, and ten values of the
ellipticity thence   deduced    ; the mean of which is —                     The
                                                               ^   gggy-
ten values, of which this is the mean, differ considerably among each
other, indicating    that there is some disturbing        cause,  like local   at
traction,   affecting the plumb-line,     and   therefore the apparent lati
tudes.     The variations of      the observed     amplitudes    are   then dis
cussed   ; and the necessity of calculating      the local attraction pointed
out.
    In the second part a formula is obtained for calculating the at
traction.    The method is different from that given by the author in his
first communication.       The curvature of       the earth   is neglected, as
this would have no sensible effect on the results in the British Isles.
The attracting      mass   is divided into a number of smaller masses
standing on rectangular bases at the sea-level, and the height of each

                                           441
is taken equal to the average             height of the surface above the sea-
level.      The dimensions of the        bases may differ from each other, and
are determined by the contour             of the surface in such       a way that the
average       height in each mass may not depart materially from the
height of any part of it.           The investigation       leads    to the following
Rulefor determining the horizontal attraction deflection of theplumb-
line caused by any one of these Tabular Masses (as the author calls
them)     : —
   Rule. — Take         the origin     of coordinates at the station where the
plumb-line is.        Let  the  plane of xy be horizontal, and the axis of x in
the vertical plane in which the amount            of  deflection is to be found.
    Write      down the coordinates     XY   xy of the furthest and nearest angles
of the Tabular Mass from the origin; Y is always to be considered
 +**, and y + n or —n accordingly.
   Form      four ratios,   by  first dividing   each ordinate     by the abscissa not
belonging to it, and then by dividing each ordinate by its own abscissa,
viz.                                Y    y     Y     y
                                      '
                                    x    X' X'       x
   Look       in a Table   of  Tangents   for  the  four   angles   of which  the tan
gents equal the above ratios.
   Form      four   more angles by adding (subtracting            if they be negative)
half of     each  of these  angles  just found   to  (or from) 45°.
   From the sum of the log- tangents of the first two of these angles
subtract      the sum  of  the log-tangents    of the   second two.
   This result, multiplied by         H feet  and by    —1"
                                                             , will give  the required
                                                               —
deflection     of the plumb-line in seconds of a degree H being the height
of the Tabular Mass above the sea-level, and its density being taken
equal to half the mean density of the earth, which is that of
granite.
   The only restriction to           be attended to in the application         of this
Rule is, that the ratio of the height of the attracted station above
the sea to each of the horizontal              coordinates of the nearest angle
of the Tabular Mass, must               be  so small      that its square     may   be
neglected.
   If  any part of the attracting mass is nearer to the station than
this, it must be divided into vertical prisms and the attraction of each
found   ;   for which the author gives a formula in             a  note.

                                     442
    In the third part   the  Rule is applied, for    the purpose of   illustra
 tion, to obtain an approximate value of the deflection of the plumb-
line at Burleigh Moor, the north station of the arc under considera
tion, situated on the north coast of Yorkshire.             The deflection is
found to be 3"- 644 to the south.       The data upon which this calcula
tion is based are gathered by the author from the Map which accom
 panies General      Madge's   account of the English Survey,         and the
 heights marked down on that map.
    The deflection at   several other stations is deduced    from this result
of calculation, by using the amplitudes given in Mudge's work, and
also in Captain Yolland's ' Astronomical Observations made with
 Airy's Zenith Sector,' published in 1852, and by supposing the cur
vature of the meridian to be the mean curvature of the whole globe
as laid down by      Mr. Airy in his article on    the  Figure of the Earth.
Thus the deflection at Black Down on         the  Dorsetshire coast (one of
the places mentioned in Captain Yolland's volume), the author finds
 to be 5"-886 to the north, a quantity which tallies well with the de
flection assigned to Burleigh Moor on the Yorkshire coast,          if the re
lative heights of the two coasts are compared.           This affords  a satis
factory evidence of the correctness of the principles laid down in the
paper; and, as the author thinks, makes the subject well worthy the
 attention of those who are interested in the English Survey, and
who have it in their power to furnish the most accurate data for the
application   of  the Rule    he lays down.     The subject is also no less
important to the     mathematician in his investigation of the figure of
the earth.
    In a Postscript the author makes the       following remarks upon the
Astronomer Royal's method of accounting for the large amount of
deflection on the Indian arc deduced by the author in his former
communication      : —
    " Since the above was written,     I have had the opportunity       of see
ing a notice of the communication of the Astronomer Royal on the
Density of Table-lands      supposed  to be supported by     a dense   fluid or
semi-fluid mass    ;  and the use he makes of his suggestions to remove
the discrepancy, pointed out in my first communication, between the
values of the deflection of the plumb-line in India, as determined by
calculating the attraction of the Himalayas, and as indicated by the
results of the Great Trigonometrical       Survey.      The following diffi

                                    443
culties occur to me in the way of this highly ingenious and philoso
phical method of removing the discrepancy       : —
    "1. It  assumes that the hard crust of the earth is sensibly lighter
than the fluid or semi-fluid mass, imagined to be      a few miles below
the surface.     But  I know of no law, except the unique law of water
and ice, which would lead us to suppose that the fluid mass in con
solidating   would    expand and become     lighter.   One would rather
expect it to become      denser, by loss of heat and mutual approxima
tion of its particles.
    " 2. There is, moreover, every reason      to suppose,   that the crust
of the earth    has long been so thick, that the position       of its parts
relatively to a mean level cannot be any longer subject to the laws
of floatation.    If the elevations and depressions of the earth's surface
have always remained exactly what they were at the time when the
 laws of floatation ceased to have an uncontrolled         effect, then the
 same reasoning would no doubt apply in our case, as       if they still had
 their full sway.    But geology shows that other laws     are in constant
 operation (arising     most probably, as   Mr. Babbage    has suggested,
 from the expansion and contraction        of the solid materials of the
 crust), which change the relative levels of the various parts of the
 earth's surface, quite irrespectively    of the laws of floatation.       If
 Mr. Hopkins's estimate of the thickness of the crust       be correct, viz.
 at least 1000 miles, these laws of change in the surface must have
 been in operation for such an enormous interval of time, as quite to
 obliterate any traces of the form of surface which the simple prin
 ciples of hydrostatics would occasion.     Indeed, it seems to me highly
 probable that the elevation of the Himalayas        and the vast regions
 beyond may have arisen altogether from the slow upheaving force
 arising from this cause.
    "I  am inclined    to think that the only explanation of the discre
 pancy between my calculations and the results of the Indian Survey,
 is to be found in the greater curvature of the Indian     Arc."

VI. " Contributions           to the History of Aniline, Azobenzole and
       Benzidine."         By A. W. Hofmann, Ph.D., F.R.S.                      Re
        ceived May 30, 1855.
    The transformation of nitrobenzole into aniline by the action of
sulphuretted hydrogen is attended with such difficulties and requires
especially so much time, that chemists hitherto have generally pre
ferred to prepare this base from indigo.             Lately a new modification
of Zinin's process has been adopted by M. A. Bechamp*, which
consists in submitting nitrobenzole to the reducing action of acetate
of protoxide of iron. This process — M. Bechamp simply uses a
mixture of iron and acetic acid — is applicable to all nitro-compounds,
and has been extensively tried with the most perfect success in the
laboratory of the Royal College of Chemistry.                  The facility of the
process, its rapidity, and the large amount of product it yields in
most cases, cannot fail materially to assist the study of the volatile
organic bases.
    During    these experiments several observations were made, which
I  beg leave to bring under the notice of the Society.
    When employing about double the amount of iron which is recom
mended by M. Bechamp (2-5 instead of 1-2 of iron to 1 part of
nitrobenzole), Mr. Alfred Noble found that the latter portion of the
distillate solidified partly in the receiver and partly in the condenser.
Washed with hydrochloric acid from adhering aniline, and once or
twice recrystallized        from boiling alcohol, the solid matter was ob
tained in fine crystals of a yellowish-red            colour, and fusing below
the boiling-point       of water.    These crystals possessed all the proper
ties of  azobenzole,     which was moreover identified by combustion.
   0-260 gramme of substance              gave   0-755 grm. of carbonic acid
and 0-   1 34  grm. of water.
   The well-established formula of azobenzole, C„              H5   N, requires the
following     values  : —              Theory.

     The azobenzole obtained in this manner          is so readily purified that
  this process is greatly preferable to the action of alcoholic potassa
 upon nitrobenzole, since the latter process simultaneously produces
 several substances     which can be separated only with difficulty from
  the azobenzole.
     A portion of the azobenzole obtained in             the above process  was
 converted by means of sulphuretted hydrogen into benzidine.                  Of
 the    beautifully crystallized    compound,     a  platinum salt was made
 which was analysed by         Mr. Noble.
     0-268 grm.     of the salt left 0-088 grm. =32-88 per cent. of
 platinum.      The formula C„ Hs N, HC1; Pt Clt requires 33 09 per
 cent. of platinum.
     Benzidine    exhibits   a  very interesting     deportment with nitrous
 acid  ; gently warmed in the gas of this acid, obtained by treatment
 of starch with nitric acid, it gives      rise to a powerful reaction.     The
 substance assumes an orange-red colour, and exhibits, after treatment
 with water, when recrystallized from alcohol, all the properties of
 azobenzole.

 in the following numbers       : —

      John Barlow, F.R.S.,           Sec.   R. Inst.     Received June 14,
       1855.
   The object of this memoir is to detail the process by which             an
organic base, provisionally named         Cymidine,  was obtained from the
hydrocarbon,    cymol, and to describe some of its properties,            and
certain phenomena attending its production.
   The substitution-product, nitrocymol, was procured by acting on
cymol by strong nitric acid, both liquids being kept at the tempera
ture — 17J-° Cent. (0°Fahr.).        From nitrocymol, cymidine was ob
tained by Bechamp's modification of Zinin's process, and results of
analyses, made by combustion of the platinum salt, and likewise by
a silver determination of the hydrochlorate, were found to coincide
with the formula   C20 H15  N.     In  the formation   of cymidine a neutral
oil occurred, having the   same boiling-point       with cymol. From this
hydrocarbon    a substitution    compound was derived, apparently iso
meric with, but possessing a less specific gravity than nitrocymol.
This nitro-compound was       also subjected to the process     of reduction
already described, and a    basic substance was formed from it, which
was identified by a platinum       determination with cymidine.         Some
qualitative experiments, made with cymidine, were also described,
and the memoir concluded with the following synoptical table of the
homologues of the benzol series.

  My dear Sir, — Will you                  do me the favour to announce to the
Royal Society, that           I   have been engaged,          during some months past,
in investigating the optical and chemical properties of some crystalline
compounds of iodine and strychnine which appear                           to be strongly
indicative       and peculiar      ?     One of these bodies, from the analysis
hitherto made, would seem to have a formula not very different from
the following,         viz.   C42 H22   N2 O4 +   Is,   and crystallizes in hexagonal
prisms, passing by the ordinary                   replacement planes to the acute
rhombohedron           and other forms, all apparently derived from the
rhombohedric system; some of these crystalline forms are very strange
and unusual.          This substance         possesses
                                                              " double absorption" in       a
very evident degree, and when examined by vertically plane polar
ized light, the hexahedral prisms are all obstructive of the polarized
beam when the length               of the prisms lies parallel to the plane of the
incident ray      in this position they appear dark sienna-brown in
                  ;
colour   ;   when the long axis of the prisms lies perpendicular to the
plane of primitive polarization the crystals transmit                    a   lemon-yellow
tint, passing through greenish yellow to sherry-brown.
  The other substance appears to be the sulphate of iodo-strychnia,
and has      a   decidedly metallic green reflexion, crystallizes in stellate
aggregations          of prisms, brilliantly green by reflected light, but
having   a   deep blood-colour by transmission               ;   these also possess double
absorption and are very peculiar, as                    a   slight increase in thickness
renders them wholly impervious to light.
  When        these matters have been more carefully worked out,                  I   hope
to have the pleasure of communicating the results to the Society: in
the mean time the present notice will be sufficient for the object in
view.

  IX. " On the Existence of a Magnetic Medium." By T. A.
        Hirst, Esq. Communicated by Dr. Tyndall, F.R.S.
        Received    April 14, 1855.
     In a note on the above    subject, communicated to the Royal So
 ciety on March 16, 1855, Professor Williamson objects to a certain
 conclusion deduced by Professor Tyndall in       a letter addressed by the
 latter to   Mr. Faraday and recently published in        the Philosophical
 Magazine.       Professor Tyndall's conclusion was that, according to
 the hypothesis of the existence of a magnetic medium in space and
 of the identity of magnetism and diamagnetism, a compressed            dia-
 magnetic cube ought to be less repelled when the magnetic force
 acts on the line of compression than when       it acts at  right angles to
 that line ;  a result which his own experiments have contradicted.
Against the legitimacy of this conclusion Professor Williamson
urges that
               " Dr. Tyndall seems to have assumed, that on the com
pression of an aggregate of particles of a diamagnetic substance, the
medium is not displaced by the particles in their change of posi
tion."     We shall   be better able to estimate  the value of this objec
tion by recalling the steps of Professor Tyndall's argument.
    A magnetic     cube was taken which had already been compressed         :
its deportment before a magnet was experimentally examined, and
deductions drawn concerning the changes that would occur in that
deportment by merely conceiving the magnetic capacity of the ma
terial particles to be diminished,     without   in any way altering the
distances between those particles, and consequently without in any
 way displacing the magnetic medium in the interstices of the body.
    Instead of the assumption attributed to Dr. Tyndall, he might,
with greater justice, be accused of having disregarded the possible
presence of the medium within the body ; but in his own defence he
may with perfect justice      reply, that in Mr. Faraday's experiments,
which originally gave rise to the discussion, no such interpenetration
of two media existed.
   Admitting,     however, that the interstices of    a  body are occupied
by the medium, it may be interesting to inquire whether, from an
argument similar to Professor Tyndall's, the same decided conclu
sion could, with equal accuracy, be deduced.            To answer the in

                                                449
 quiry, it must be remembered that the force of the argument in
 question depends      essentially upon the justness of the supposition,
 that a diamagnetic cube may, theoretically,                           be    produced from a
 magnetic one by conceiving the magnetic capacity of the particles
 of the latter to be sufficiently diminished.                     It     is evident that the
total attraction of the cube by             a   magnet will be equal to the sum of
the attractions of the material particles, and of the medium con
tained in its interstices.          If    this sum be greater than the attracting
force upon the quantity of medium which the cube and its contents
displace, the substance is called magnetic,                        for it will be drawn
towards the magnet       ;   if   less,    it is called diamagnetic, for it will be
repelled from the magnet.                  But in our present knowledge of the
properties of the medium there is nothing incompatible                                with the
supposition that the density of the internal medium may so far ex
ceed that   of the external, that the attraction of                         the former by the
magnet is itself greater than the attraction of the medium displaced
by the cube and its contents.   If so, however, no conceivable dimi
nution of the magnetic capacity of the material particles could pos
sibly render such a cube diamagnetic.
   This   is sufficient to show that, admitting the presence                        of   the me
dium within the cube, the method of argument adopted by Professor
Tyndall would not       be strictly applicable, unless the density                        of the
internal medium were subjected to limits which the advocates of its
existence might possibly be unwilling to grant.
   But it may     be asked,       if,   whilst admitting that the medium may
exist in the interstices of the body,             it   be granted that         a   diamagnetic
may be produced from         a    magnetic cube in the manner assumed by
Professor Tyndall, does           it   still follow, necesarily, that attraction                  is
always greatest —repulsion least —when the force acts in the line of
compression   ?    In other words, can                a   conclusion contradictory            to
experimental facts be then legitimately deduced                      ?
   In attempting     a reply to this question,             it   will,    perhaps,   be best to
employ the following symbols.                    Let      W   represent the attracting
force of the magnet upon the medium displaced by the cube and its
contents. The value of W will, of course, be unaltered, no matter
whether the force acts in, or at right angles to the line of compres
sion.   When      the force acts in the line           of compression, let           P,   repre
sent the attracting force upon the particles,                   W,      the attracting force

                                      450
upon the internal medium, and let        F, be proportional  to the resultant
attraction of the cubical mass towards the magnet.               Let  P2,  W2
and F2 have similar significations when the force acts at right angles
to the line of compression.        Then we may put
                              F^+M.-W,
                              F2=P1 +    M2-W.
Now, in     a compressed    magnetic cube, experiment proves that
                               F,>F2,
 or                           P;+M^Pj+Mj,
i.e.                          Pi-P, >-(M,-Ma).
     As long  as we are ignorant    of the properties of the medium within
 the body, we    will, for the  sake  of completeness, consider the follow
 ing three distinct cases.
     I. The attracting force upon the medium within the           cube is the
 same when the force acts in either the one or the other of the two
 directions, with respect to the line of compression.         Here
 hence                              P, >Pa.
     II.  In whichever of the two directions of the force the attraction
 of the particles may be greatest, the attraction of the internal me
 dium is also greatest in the same direction.         Here, according as P,
 is greater or less than P2, Mt is greater or less than           M,  ; hence,
  inasmuch as
                           P, +  M^+NLj,
                            P,>P,    and M,>M2.
      III. In whichever   of  the two directions of the force the attraction
  of the particles may be greatest, the attraction of the internal me
  dium is greatest in the direction perpendicular to the same.            Here,
  according as   P, is greater or   less than  P„ Mt is  less or greater than
  M2, so that the two hypotheses
                      (1)    P,>P2 and M,<M2, and
                      (2)    P1<P2and M,>M2
   are both compatible with the sole condition,
                                P,+M,>P2+M3.

                                          451
     In order to test the applicability of Professor Tyndall's method of
argument in each of these cases, let us conceive, with him, that the
magnetic capacity of the particles is so far diminished                 that their
 attractions P, and Ps are reduced to         px  and p3.   This may evidently
be done by making           pl=aPl   and /»2=aP2, where a represents a posi
 tive fraction whose magnitude can be diminished indefinitely.                  If,
 under this supposition,        the resultant attractions     F, and   F2 become
/1 and f2, then it can easily be proved that, however small the value
 of a may be, we shall always have
 in the cases       I., II. and III. (1).    That is to say, with the distribu
 tions of the internal        medium assumed in these cases, the resultant
 attraction of the cubical mass          will always   be greatest, or repulsion
 least, when the force acts in the line of compression, no matter how
 diamagnetic the cube may have become by diminishing the magnetic
 capacity of its particles.      It may just as  easily be proved, however, that
 in case   III.   (2) a value of   a may be chosen sufficiently small to make
 that is to say, with the distribution          and properties of the internal
 medium here supposed,            it is quite possible   so far to diminish    the
  magnetic capacity of the particles as to obtain a cube which will be
  attracted least, or repelled most strongly when the force acts in the
  line of compression.        This conclusion involves nothing contradictory
  to experimental facts, whereas the former one does.
      I will not here enter into the question of the relative probability
  of these three cases, supposing the medium to exist.                My sole ob
 ject has been to show that, although the method of argument adopted
  by Professor Tyndall is strictly           applicable in a great number of
  cases, even      when the medium is supposed to fill the interstices of
  the body, yet it is possible to attribute properties to this medium of
  such a nature as to avoid the conclusion, contradictory to fact, which
  he has deduced.          This may    be done   in two ways.      First, the den
   sity of the internal medium may be such as to render it impossible
   to produce a diamagnetic from a magnetic cube                  in the manner
   assumed,    i.  e.  by diminishing    the magnetic capacity of the material
   particles.      Secondly, granting     that a diamagnetic cube may be so

                                            452
produced, the distribution             and properties of the internal medium
may still be such as to cause the cube to be attracted least, or repelled
most strongly when the force acts on the line of compression, and
thus,   if  the  substance be diamagnetic, to cause it to agree, in its
deportment, with experimental results.                  On the other hand,       if these
hypothetical properties of the internal medium be discarded as arti
ficial or inadmissible, then at present I              see   no way of escaping the
conclusion of Professor Tyndall's argument.
    With regard to the explanation given by Professor Williamson, it
will  be observed     that he pursues        a path quite different from that of
Professor Tyndall, when he considers the effects produced by com
pressing a number of particles surrounded by a magnetic medium.
This compression,          he states,      may alter the attraction of the mass
by a
                                         "
       magnet in two ways ; — first, by altering the density of the
matter    ;  secondly, by altering the density of the medium."                   By the
term 'density      of matter' is usually understood                the relation    which
exists between the quantity of matter which                      a  body contains, and
the volume       of the    space     enclosed by its external surface.            But in
the present case, where a comparison                    is instituted      between the
matter of the body and the medium which is supposed to fill all its
pores,    we must,      I    imagine, understand          by the term
                                                                            '
                                                                              density of
matter,' the relation which exists between the sum of the masses of
the particles, and the sum of their volumes                ;  but  if so, then, the par
ticles themselves      being incompressible, it is clear that compression
                           '
could not alter the           density of matter.'
    As to    the second       effect  of compression, viz.        an alteration of the
density of the medium, it may be quite conceivable, although                         I do
not find that Professor Williamson has any where taken it into con
sideration.      The  effects     of compression      may, therefore, be more cor
rectly described as either — first, a diminution                 of the interstices of
a body, without         altering      the density of the medium which                 fills
them   ;   or secondly,    a diminution      of the interstices, accompanied by
an alteration of the density of the medium within them.
    Let  us   assume,     as Professor     Williamson        has   virtually done, that
the first    of these   effects takes place      ;   then,   if we admit that " in        a
cubical mass of carbonate of iron the material particles are more
magnetic than the medium which they displace, and the force with
which it is attracted is proportional              to this excess," we can by no

                                         453
   means admit that, because      " it  becomes   more magnetic by compres
  sion, we must conclude that the loss of magnetic medium from its
  interstices is more than supplied by the magnetic matter which takes
  its place ;" for, according to what has already been advanced,              the
  excess  of  the attraction  of the material particles       above  that of the
  medium they displace is the same after, as it was before compression            ;
  inasmuch as compression merely changes the relative situations of
  the particles, by bringing    them closer together, but does not in the
  least alter their volume, and consequently does not in the least alter
  the quantity of medium they displace.
     With respect to carbonate of lime, Professor Williamson's con
 clusion is, of course, untenable, because it is based upon the fore
 going one.      He says,     " when     these" particles   are brought    closer
 together by pressure, with diminution of the intervening spaces oc
 cupied by the medium, the mass becomes more diamagnetic, because
 a  certain quantity of the magnetic medium is thus replaced by the
 less  magnetic matter."       It is, however, manifest that exactly the
 same quantity of magnetic medium is displaced by the less magnetic
 matter after, as there was before compression.             Why, then, should
 diamagnetic action be increased by compression           ?
     Lastly, with respect to the crystals of carbonate of iron and car
 bonate of lime, Professor Williamson's explanation, although inge
nious, is liable to the same objections as those already mentioned.
 It cannot, in fact,     be said that the functions       of matter predomi
nate most strongly over those           of the medium they displace in any
one direction, merely because the particles maybe closer together              in
that direction    ; for, as long as each particle is surrounded by the
medium, the predominance of that function               of the particles with
which we are concerned, i.       e.  their attraction, over that of the me
dium they displace      will be the same, whatever may be the distances
of the particles asunder.
    From the foregoing remarks, therefore, it is manifest that,          if Pro
fessor Tyndall has not yet succeeded             in demonstrating      that the
hypothesis of the existence of        a  magnetic medium and of the iden
tity of magnetism and diamagnetism is           necessarily   at variance   with
experimental facts, neither has Professor Williamson succeeded in
proving that this hypothesis is in accordance with those facts.             The
question of the existence of     a  magnetic medium is still an open one,

                                      454
and   will continue to  be so  until the many important principles which
it involves, but which       have  not been introduced into the present
discussion, have been further elucidated by new investigations             and
new thoughts.
X. " On the ultimate arrangement of the Biliary Ducts, and on
        some other    points in the Anatomy of the Liver of Verte
        brate Animals."       By Lionel S. Beale, M.B., Professor of
        Physiology and Morbid Anatomy in King's College, Lon
        don.    Communicated by F. Kiernan, Esq., F.R.S.                   Re
        ceived  June 14, 1855.
    In his valuable communication          to  the Royal Society in 1833,
 Mr. Kiernan describes and figures          anastomoses     between branches
 of the biliary ducts in the left triangular         ligament of the human
 liver.   The   same author considered that the interlobular        ducts ana
 stomosed with each other, and communicated with a lobular biliary
 plexus, although he had never succeeded          in injecting this plexus to
 the extent shown in his figure, neither had he directly observed the
 anastomoses     between interlobular ducts.        It must be borne in mind
 that these    observations were made before the liver-cells         had been
 described.
    Since the appearance of Mr. Kiernan's paper, various hypothetical
 views have been advanced         by different observers, with reference to
 the arrangement of the minute biliary ducts and the relation which
 the liver-cells   bear to them.      These points, however, have not yet
 been decided by actual observation.
    Miiller considered that the ducts terminated in blind extremities.
 Weber showed that       the  right  and left hepatic ducts anastomosed     by
 the intervention    of branches in the transverse fissure of the liver,
 which he described under the name of Vasa aberrantia.
     Krukenberg,    Schroder Van der Kolk, Retzius,            Theile, Backer,
  Leidy and others have adopted the view that the liver-cells lie within
 a network of basement membrane.              On the other hand, Handfield
 Jones and Kiilliker describe       the liver-cells   as forming  a  solid net

                                     455
work, against the marginal cells of which Kolliker believes the ex
tremities of the ducts impinge, while Handfield Jones holds that the
ducts terminate by blind extremities.
   Henle, Gerlach, Hyrtl and Natalis Guillot look upon the finest
gall ducts as communicating with intercellular passages.
   Dr. Handfield Jones looks upon the small cells in the extremities
of the ducts as the chief agents in the formation of bile, and to the
liver-cells he assigns an office totally distinct from this.        Busk and
Huxley concur in this view, which would place the liver in the           cate
gory of vascular glands, spleen, suprarenal capsules, &c.
   The observations of      the author have been made        upon the livers
of  several   different animals examined under various circumstances.
The results of the examination of injected preparations precisely
accord with the observations made upon uninjected specimens some
months before.        The points which     he   hopes   to establish are as
follows   : —
    1. That the hepatic cells lie within    an exceedingly delicate tubu
lar network of basement membrane.
    2. That the smallest biliary ducts       are directly   continuous with
this network.
   3.  That at the point where the excretory duct joins the tubes
which contain the secreting cells, it is very much constricted,
being many times narrower than the tube into which it becomes
dilated.
   Lobules. — With reference to the nature of the lobules of the liver,
the author offers      some  remarks.    The only liver in which he has
been   able to detect distinct lobules, consisting of perfectly cir
cumscribed portions of hepatic structure and separated             from each
other by fibrous tissue, is that of the pig.       In this liver  each lobule
has a distinct fibrous capsule of its own, and is separated              from
its neighbours by the branches of the vessels            and  duct for their
supply.
   The lobules of the liver of other animals        are not thus separated
from each other, but the capillary network and the cell-containing
network of one lobule are respectively connected with those of the
adjacent lobules at certain points between the fissures in which the
vessels and duct lie.       In these livers there is not a trace of fibrous
tissue between the lobules.

      The exceptional liver of the pig, with its distinct lobules,            seems
  to bear in structural      peculiarity the same relation to the livers          of
  other animals, as the much-divided kidney of the porpoise bears                 to
  the more solid organ of most mammalian animals.
      In a physiological sense      the livers of all vertebrate animals may
  be said to be composed       of lobules   ; but in a  strictly anatomical sense
  this term can only be used with reference to the liver of the pig, and,
  according to Miiller, that of the polar bear.           The    vessels and duct,
  at their entrance into the liver, are invested with much areolar
  tissue, which is continued          for a considerable distance along the
  portal canals; but it gradually ceases as the vessels become smaller,
 and, with the exception of the liver of the pig above referred to, the
 lobules are not separated        from each other by any areolar tissue, or
 by any fibrous tissue whatever, neither is any prolonged into their
 substance.      Hence the investment of areolar tissue round the vessels
 in the portal canals of the liver       seems to present no peculiar charac
 ters in its distribution.      It must    be borne in mind, that in the exa
 mination of uninjected specimens             the small vessels    and   ducts are
 liable to be much stretched and torn in manipulation, and, in conse
 quence,    a  striated appearance      is produced which closely resembles
 fibrous tissue.
     Method     of preparing   specimens.    — In order to demonstrate the
 arrangement of the ducts described by the author, it is absolutely
necessary to harden the liver previously.              This hardening may be
effected    by soaking    a portion of the liver for some time in strong
syrup, or in alcohol, and afterwards rendering the section trans
parent by soda.         The mixture of alcohol and acetic acid recom
mended     by   Mr. L. Clarke in his investigations upon the spinal cord,
has also been employed, as well as many other solutions which are
not described.       The fluid to which       the author gives the preference
is alcohol, to which a few drops of solution                 of  soda   have been
added.
     Method   of injecting the biliary ducts.   —The following      is the method
by which, after numerous trials, the author succeeded                 in effecting
this object.        Lukewarm      water is injected into        the portal vein.
After    a  time, when the liver has become             fully distended, much
bloody water will escape from the hepatic vein, but at the same
time it will be remarked that bile escapes              from the duct.       This

                                           457
bile gradually becomes thinner, and at last nearly pure water flows
from the duct, showing              that the bile has been washed out.            The
liver is now placed in soft cloths to soak up the water, and after
some hours       it will  be found to have diminished much           in volume, and
to have a clayey consistence.               The ducts   are now empty, and may
be injected        with    a carefully    prepared prussian-blue       injection,   to
which     a  little alcohol     has been     previously added.      The mixture is
to be well stirred, and after having been carefully                   strained, it is
slowly and cautiously injected into the duct.                   Plain clear    size  is
next thrown into the portal vein, until the liver has become fully
distended with it in every part.               Lastly,  a  little plain size    is in
jected into the duct, the vessels carefully tied, and the liver placed
 in cold water until the size has set, when very thin sections can be
 readily obtained with the aid of a sharp knife.              The author    has tried
 many other plans of injection, but the above has afforded                  the most
 satisfactory results.          On   one  occasion a human liver was success
 fully injected with four different colours ; the portal vein with flake-
 white, the artery with vermilion, the duct with prussian blue, and
 the hepatic vein with lake.
    Evidence     of the   existence   of a tubular basement membrane in which
                              the liver-cells are contained.
     Not unfrequently liver-cells           are set free  with   shreds   of delicate
  membrane       attached     to them, and this can sometimes          be seen to be
 prolonged either way in the form of a narrow tube.
     In certain     specimens     which have been exposed          for some time to
  the action of dilute soda, the walls of the cells appear to be dis
  solved and the tubes are seen to be occupied              with  a highly refractive
  mass, and their outline is rendered very distinct.
     When portions of the cell-containing           network are placed in strong
  syrup or glycerine,          exosmose    of the water occurs, the diameter of
  the tubes is much diminished, and their outline becomes                     distinct,
  but uneven, in consequence of the shrunken state of the tubes of
  the network.
     At  the edge      of  a very thin section   of liver stretching between two
  capillary     vessels,   a very thin     membrane,     recognizable only by the
  granular matter adhering to it, can sometimes               be seen.
     The    tubes    of  the network can be distended to a great extent by

                                         458
injection,      so that the walls      of contiguous      tubes   meet,  while the
capillary vessel       between them becomes so compressed             as not to be
recognizable.
    The injection often forms a sharp line towards the capillary ves
sels on either side of the tube in which the cells lie, and gradually
shades      off towards the centre of     the tube.
    The cells which       escape into the surrounding         fluid from injected
specimens        often have portions of injection adhering to them.
     If  a section be made at right angles to the intralobular vein, the
cells are seen to form lines radiating            from the centre towards the
 circumference        of  the   lobule,  as   authors    have   before   described.
These lines of cells are really tubes            of basement membrane,        com
 municating with each other at intervals by narrow branches.                      In
 injected specimens         the walls of the tube can be demonstrated, and
 are seen to be distinct from the capillary vessels.
     In   the foetus, the cells are seen to be separated        from the cavity of
 the vessels by two lines separated           by  a  clear space.    One of these
 lines is caused      by the outline of the tube containing          the cells, the
 other is that of the capillary wall.
     The author      supposes    that, originally, the liver is composed       of   a
  double network of tubes (cell-containing             network and capillary net
  work), the walls of which in most situations               become incorporated,
 so that the secreting cells are only separated            from the blood by one
  thin layer of basement membrane, which is very permeable to water
  in both directions, but the greatest force which can be applied with
  out causing rupture is incapable of forcing bile through it.
   Of   the contents   of  the tubular network    of   basement membrane, and      of
                       the arrangement     of the  cells within it.
      Within     the tubular network      lie the hepatic cells, with      a certain
  quantity of granular matter and cell debris, and, in some instances,
  free oil-globules      and granules of colouring matter.            The cells   are
  not arranged with any order or regularity.                 Some observers     have
  endeavoured to show that the hepatic cells are arranged in               a definite
  manner.        Professor Lereboullet,      one   of  the latest writers    on this
  subject (1853), describes          the cells as forming double rows.           The
  two rows of cells may be separated            by injection, and he gives two
  diagrams to illustrate         their arrangement.        The author     has never

                                       459
seen anything     like this in any liver which has been examined by
him.    In Mammalia, according to his observation, the cells                are for
the most part arranged in single rows (human subject, pig, dog, cat,
rabbit, horse, seal, Guinea-pig and others), but in some situations
two cells lie transversely across          the tube, and they may be forced
into this position by injection.         The cells    do not completely     fill the
tubes, and are not always placed quite close together, being sur
rounded with granular matter.             Injection   passes   sometimes    on one
side  of the tube, and        sometimes     upon the other     ; often it entirely
surrounds a cell.      In the human        foetus and in the foetal calf there
are two or three rows        of cells within    the tubes, and this is also the
case in the livers    of most adult reptiles and        fishes which have fallen
under the author's observation, and in many parts of the network of
the bird's liver.
                       Of the Ducts of the Liver.
   The duct, like the artery, lies          close  to the portal vein   ;  usually
this vessel is accompanied by one branch of the artery and duct, but
not unfrequently there         are two or three      branches of these vessels
with the vein.
   Anastomosis    of the   ducts near the trunk from which they come off. —
The author    observes     that the anastomoses       between the larger ducts
and between the larger branches of the interlobular ducts are pretty
numerous in the human liver, but these communications take place
only near the origin of      the trunks by means      of intermediate branches.
Different  interlobular ducts do not anastomose             with each other, but
the branches resulting from the division of a small trunk are often
connected together.
   In  some animals these         communications        are so numerous, that a
complete network        is formed at the portal aspect of the lobule, or
around a small branch of the portal vein.
   Not only   are the    right and left hepatic ducts connected together
by intermediate branches in the transverse fissure of the
                                                                          liver, as
E. H. Weber long ago demonstrated, but the branches coming off
from these communicate with each other as well as with the trunks
from which they come off. These branches are very numerous, and
form an intimate        network      of irregular    branched ducts.       Similar
communications       occur between the branches in the portal canals,
   vol. vir.                                                         2 c

                                     460
but they are not so numerous.         This arrangement occurs to a less
extent in the dog and in the calf, but it is not present in all animals.
The author has not been able to demonstrate it in the pig, seal, rab
bit, horse, cat and monkey, although he is not prepared to say that,
absolutely, no communications        take  place between the ducts near
their origin, in these animals.
    Of   the glands  of the ducts. — The  so-called glands are small cavi
 ties of a rounded or oval form, or more or less branched, which com
 municate with the cavity of the duct by a very constricted neck.
The simple glands      are for the most part situated in the coats of the
 ducts, so that, when injected, they scarcely project beyond the ex
ternal surface.      These cavities or glands are most easily demon
 strated in the pig.
    When    a small duct from the human liver is laid open, two lines
 of orifices are seen opening upon the internal surface, as Kiernan
described.      The great majority of these, however, are not the open
ings of glands, but almost all of them are the orifices of branches of
the duct which communicate with each other in its coats, or just at
the point where they leave it.        Very few of    them are the openings
of caecal cavities, which are very rare in the smaller ducts of the
human subject.
    Vasa aberrantia. — There are many curious branches of communi
cation between the ducts in the transverse       fissure of the liver, which
have been    well  named    " vasa aberrantia
                                              "
                                                by Weber.       Theile looks
upon all these ducts as anastomosing mucus-glands.               The author
has seen these ducts in the portal        canals, down to those not more
than one-eighth of an inch in diameter.           They present the      same
characters as the branches in the transverse          fissure, but are not so
numerous.       The  coats of the vasa aberrantia are thinner than those
of the ordinary ducts, and, like them, are lined with epithelium,
principally of a subcolumnar form.        These branches are always sur
rounded by areolar tissue, in which lymphatics are very numerous.
The arrangement of the vessels about the vasa aberrantia is pecu
liar. The arteries and veins form a network, and each small branch
of the artery lies between two branches of the vein, which com
municate with each other at frequent intervals by numerous trans
verse branches, some      of which  pass over and some under the artery.
The author     observes   that this beautiful arrangement of the vessels

                                         461
  occurs in the gall-bladder, in the transverse fissure, and in the portal
  canals. This disposition of the veins has the effect of ensuring free
  circulation   through them under different conditions, as when they
  are stretched or compressed.
     The   vasa aberrantia in the transverse fissure of the adult human
  liver are nearer to the branch of the portal vein than to the hepatic
  substance, and can be readily removed without any of the latter.            A
  few small straight branches are sometimes observed to come off from
  the vasa aberrantia and to enter the hepatic substance.         In the foetus,
  on the other hand, the vasa aberrantia are fewer in number, their
  course generally is more direct, they lie so close to the hepatic tissue
  that they cannot be removed unless          a portion of the latter is taken
  away with them, and very many of the branches can be traced into
  the hepatic substance.
     The author regards the vasa aberrantia in the adult liver in the
 light of altered secreting tubes, and believes that at one time they
 formed    a part of the secreting structure of the liver.       At the termi
 nation of intrauterine life the portal vein increases in size, and the
 pressure thus produced may account for the gradual wasting and
 partial disappearance of the hepatic substance closely surrounding
 it.   In  the very thin     edge  of a  horse's liver, which consisted prin
 cipally of areolar tissue, the gradual alteration of the ducts and
 ultimate complete disappearance           of the secreting cells was traced.
 Upon the surface of the portal vein in the rabbit's liver the trans
 itional stages between the compact lobule of secreting structure and
 the branches of the vasa aberrantia have been well seen.
     Function  of   the glands and vasa aberrantia. — It has always        been
 considered that the office of the ducts was to secrete the mucus of
the bile, and a similar function was assigned to the vasa aberrantia
by Theile.       It   seems to the author that a cavity communicating
with a tube by a neck of less than -joVcfth of an mcn 'n diameter,
cannot be well adapted          for pouring out    a viscid, tenacious mucus.
If   these cavities contained mucus, the injection            would not enter
them so readily as       it does, nor is it easy to conceive   how the mucus
poured out by these little glands would become              thoroughly mixed
with the bile as it passes along the ducts.            Again, the bile of the
pig, in which animal these glands are very abundant, does not con
tain more mucus than the bile of the rabbit, in which they are few
                                                                2 u 2

                                        462
in number and only found on the largest branches of the duct.                 The
vasa aberrantia do not possess any characters which, in the opinion
of the author, justify the inference of their being mucus-glands. He
regards the little cavities in the coats of the ducts (glands of the
ducts) and the vasa aberrantia as reservoirs for containing bile,
whilst   it  becomes     inspissated and undergoes other changes.              By
these cavities in the ducts with thick walls, the bile is brought into
close relation    with the    vessels which ramify so abundantly upon          the
external surface of the ducts.
    Of the finest   branches   of the duct, and of their  connexion with the
                             cell-containing network.
    Mammalia. — In well-injected         preparations the smallest branches
 of the duct can be readily traced up to the secreting cells of the
lobules.     In most Mammalia, but not in the pig, a few of the finest
branches of the duct can be followed for some distance beneath the
 surface  of the lobule.       These branches appear       to lie amongst the
 secreting cells, but are not connected with them.               They become
 continuous with tubes         of the cell-containing   network     at a deeper
 part, while those secreting tubes nearer the surface of the lobule are
 connected with branches of the duct which do not penetrate.
    In many animals, particularly in the rabbit,         and to a less extent
 in man and in the dog, the smallest branches of the duct are con
 nected together so as to form a network, which is continuous with
 that in which the secreting cells lie.
    In the pig, the small ducts       are, as it were, applied to the surface
 of the lobule    ;  from these smaller branches come off, which pene
 trate the lobule and are immediately connected with an intimate
 network, which lies partly in the capsule of the lobule itself.              This
 network is continuous with, and may be looked upon as the most
 superficial portion of, the cell-containing        network.      In  a perfectly
 normal state    it contains only oil-globules     and granular matter      ;  but
 when the liver is fatty, it is found to contain liver-cells loaded with
 oil.   From such      a liver the author has a very beautiful preparation,
 in which the continuity of the very narrow duct with the wide              tubes
 of the network, distended with large cells containing oil, can be well
  seen.   The duct and the tubes in which the secreting cells lie, both
  contain a little injection.

                                       .463
    The author     has succeeded    in demonstrating       the communication
between the ducts and cell-containing            network in several mamma
lian animals, as well as in the human subject, by injecting the ducts
in the manner described.         Of  these, the seal, hedgehog, rabbit and
Guinea-pig       have afforded the best specimens.
    In Birds, the continuity in injected specimens has been traced in
the common fowl and in the turkey.              The quantity of epithelium in
the ducts of birds forms a great obstacle to the passage of the injec
tion, and from their extreme tenuity, the capillaries do not bear the
 preliminary injection of much water.
    Reptiles. — The author has seen the continuity between the ducts
and cell-containing        network,  in an uninjected       preparation of the
 newt's liver, and in an injected liver of the adder.
     Fishes. — In consequence of the very fatty nature of the liver of
 fishes,   it was found to    be very difficult   to harden it sufficiently to
 cut thin sections.      The frequent     presence   of entozoa and their ova,
 renders it difficult     to inject the ducts.      The author     succeeded   in
 injecting     the ducts and part    of  the cell-containing    network in the
 sturgeon and in the Lophius, and in one instance, those of the very
 fatty liver of the cod.       The continuity was also traced in an unin
jected liver of the common flounder.             The injection often passes a
 certain distance into the finer ducts of fishes, but cannot be forced
 into the cell-containing       network.      In this way the     appearance    of
 blind    terminations to the ducts is produced, as the continuity              of
 the tube cannot be traced beyond the point at which the injection
 stops.
     The continuity of the finest ducts with the cell-containing net
 work has been demonstrated in all classes of Vertebrata, both in in
 jected and also in uninjected specimens.            In all the livers of  verte
 brate animals which        have been    examined, the duct becomes much
 narrowed at the point where it joins the network in which the cells
 lie.    The arrangement of the small ducts varies somewhat in dif
 ferent animals.      Sometimes a network of minute ducts is formed,
 which is continuous with that in which the cells lie.              In other in
 stances     the communications     between these terminal ducts are very
 few in number, or are altogether absent.            Upon the latter point the
 author does not express himself positively, as he is sure that in the
 most perfect injection which he has been able to make, the whole of

                                       464
  the numerous branches of the minute ducts have not been injected                  ;
  and from observations upon these specimens         alone, he feels that only
  a very imperfect     idea can be formed of their number or of their
 arrangement.
     Diameter   of the  ducts. —A   table is given, showing the thickness
 of the coats of the ducts in different parts of their course.                 The
 walls of the smallest ducts are composed         entirely of basement       mem
 brane, and are often not more than the         <6»0<)th
                                                         of an inch in diame
 ter in the uninjected state.       In the pig, the diameter of the smallest
 ducts containing injection was about the 8t»66th of an inch ; in the
 human subject, about the i^^th         ; in the seal, i6'4ath ; and in some
 fishes not more than the T oVffth      °f an inch. It may be remarked,
 that this narrowing       of the excretory duct, just       before   it  becomes
 continuous with the secreting portion of the organ, is seen in the
 kidney and in other glands.
    Epithelium   of the small   ducts. — The epithelium lining the small
 est ducts presents very similar characters in different animals.              The
small cells are for the most part oval or circular in form          ;  sometimes
they are angular, which probably results from pressure or stretch
ing of the ducts in the preparation of        the specimen     ; sometimes      the
smallest ducts appear to be entirely filled with epithelium             ; in other
instances the cells are very sparingly and irregularly scattered over
the interior of the tube, while frequently no cells whatever can be
distinguished.
    The author    believes   that, in a perfectly normal state, the minute
ducts are lined by a single layer of delicate epithelial cells.
    This ductal epithelium      does not pass gradually into the secreting
epithelium, but ceases at the point where the latter begins.                Hepa
tic cells are sometimes seen in tubes lined with this ductal epithe
lium, but probably their presence is the result of accident.              In these
cases the ducts are      of course much stretched or dilated *.
    With   reference    to the relation of the ductal epithelium to the
secreting cells of the liver, the author observes          that a very similar
arrangement occurs in the gastric glands.              The secreting epithe
lium is alone found in the lower part of the gland (stomach tube),
while the ductal portion of the gland is lined with columnar epi
thelium.

     The secreting cells   appear to occupy the entire cavity of the tube,
  and are not arranged in any order        ;  so that the secretion, having
  escaped from the cells, must pass off towards the duct by the slight
 interstices between them.         A similar disposition of the secreting
  epithelial cells occurs, but in a less remarkable degree, in some other
 glands   ; as the pancreas, lacteal, sebaceous,      and sweat glands.
    The conclusions to which the author         has arrived may be summed
 up as follows    : —
     1. That  the liver of vertebrate animals essentially consists     of two
 solid tubular networks       mutually   adapted    to each other.    One of
 these networks contains the liver-cells,       and the other the blood.
    2.   The cell-containing     network    is continuous    with the ducts.
 The small delicate epithelial cells lining the latter channels contrast
 remarkably with the large secreting cells, which are not arranged
 in any definite manner within the tubes of the network.
    3.  The duct is many times narrower than the tubular network at
 the point where it becomes continuous with it.
    4. Injection passes sometimes      on one, and sometimes     on the other
 side of the tube, or between the cells, when two or more lie across
 the tube.     Often, a cell becomes      completely surrounded with in
jection.     As injection   can   thus be made to pass readily from the
ducts into the network and around the cells, it follows that there
can be no obstacle to the passage of the bile along the same chan
nels in the opposite (its natural) direction.
    5. In some animals, the most minute ducts are directly connected
with the tubes of the cell-containing          network  ; of these branches,
some pass amongst the most          superficial meshes to join the network
at a deeper part.      In other animals the finest ducts first form     a net
work which is continuous with that containing the liver-cells.
    6.  The interlobular ducts      do not anastomose,     but the branches
coming off from the trunk are often connected with each other, as
well as with the parent trunk, near their origin from it.
    7.  The walls of the smallest ducts         are  composed   of  basement
membrane only.        The thick complex coat of the larger ducts con
tains within    it small cavities (the so-called glands of the ducts), by
means    of which the bile in   these ducts would      be brought  into close
proximity with the arteries, veins and lymphatics, which are very
abundant wherever the ducts ramify.

                                       466
    8. The   office  of the vasa aberrantia, which are so numerous in
the transverse fissure of the human liver and in the larger portal
canals, appears     to be similar to that      of the cavities in the walls of
the ducts.      It is worthy of remark, that the network of             vessels
ramifying     so abundantly     in the coats of the gall-bladder,       in the
transverse fissure, and in the larger portal canals, are arranged in a
similar manner, each branch of artery being accompanied by two
branches of the vein.
    9. The liver is therefore      a true gland, consisting     of a formative
portion and     a system   of excretory ducts directly continuous with it.
The secreting cells lie within         a delicate tubular network     of  base
ment membrane, through the thin walls of which they draw from
the blood the materials of their secretion.
 XI.    "Experimental        Researches      on the   Movement of Atmo
       spheric    Air in Tubes." By W. D. Chowne, M.D. Com
       municated by John Bishop, Esq., F.R.S.                  Received June
       14, 1855.
    In the year 1847, the author        of this paper  made numerous expe
 riments for the purpose of ascertaining what are the conditions under
 which atmospheric air is placed with regard to motion or rest, when
 within  a vertical tube having one extremity communicating              within
 the interior  of  a building,  and the other in the open atmosphere.
    The paper now submitted to the Royal Society contains the results
of investigations undertaken in the year 1853 and continued to the
 present time, to ascertain whether the ordinary state of atmospheric
 air contained in a vertical cylindrical       tube, open at both ends, and
placed in the still atmosphere of a closed room, is one of rest or of
 motion  ; and    if of motion, to investigate      the influences   of certain
 changes in the condition of the atmosphere which either produce,
 promote, retard, or arrest the movement.
    He demonstrates, by       a series   of experiments, that when      a tube,
 open at both ends, is placed      in   a vertical position, every precaution
 being taken to exclude all extraneous causes             of movement in the
 surrounding atmosphere, an upward current of air is almost imme

                                         467
diately established, and continued so long as these conditions                      are
maintained.
    The experiments         were  made    in a  room   12 feet square         by 8 feet
6  inches high    ;  the windows and chimney being carefully secured, and
all crevices closed, by pasting paper over them, the floor carpeted,
the door double, and the inner door surrounded with list. The
outer wall, having a north aspect, was so sheltered by surrounding
buildings that the direct rays of the sun never fell upon the window.
Discs of delicate tissue-paper were suspended               in   several parts   of the
room, to indicate currents of air,            if any existed, and observations
were taken only when these were perfectly quiescent.
    Mason's     hygrometer was first employed in these experiments, to
test the presence        of   a current  of air in the tube        ; on the principle
that as evaporation produces cold, and as evaporation is increased,by
a   current of air, the wet-bulb thermometer would show                  a greater de
pression    if any current existed, than if the air were perfectly quiescent
within    the tube.      The tube    was placed     in the middle of         the room,
and isolated from the floor by a cylinder of thick glass laid under it.
     It was found that in ninety-one          observations of the hygrometer,
suspended in the          free air of the room, the mean depression of the
wet-bulb thermometer was 3°-9 Fahr., while in ninety corresponding
observations, with the hygrometer at the lower aperture of the tube,
the mean depression was increased to 4°'9 Fahr., clearly indicating
 the existence      of a current   of air within the tube.
     Partial closure of the upper orifice of the tube, by placing a piece
of fine muslin upon it, produced a sensible influence on the hygro
meter.      In   seventeen     observations with the tube thus partially ob
structed, the mean depression was 2°-5 Fahr.              ;    but in an equal num
ber of comparative observations, with the tube perfectly free, the
mean depression was increased to 3°- 1 2 Fahr.               ;  showing    a  consider
 able diminution       of the force of the current within the tube,                as a
result of the partial obstruction of its upper aperture.
     Similar comparative observations, with the hygrometer placed at
the upper aperture of the tube, yielded similar results.
     In these experiments the lower extremity of the vertical tube was
 bent thrice at right angles*,         for convenience in making the obser-
    * The  tubes used in these experiments   were bent either at t heir lower or upper
extremities   for convenience merely.

                                         468
 vations, and it appeared        desirable to ascertain what influence the
 long branch of the siphon-like tube had in the production of the cur
 rent.    For this purpose the long vertical tube         was   made moveable,
 so that the apparatus could be alternately converted into               a  siphon
 with   equal     limbs 4 inches in length,       or one with a short leg of
 4 inches, and a long one of 96 inches.          In twelve observations, when
 the long leg was inserted, the mean           depression of the hygrometer
 was 2°-5 Fahr.       ; when the limbs were of equal length, 2°-25 Fahr.
    Considering it possible that the current of air existing in the tube
 might have sufficient force to move a light body delicately suspended
 in its track,     an elbow was inserted into the upper orifice      of  the tube,
 to which a piece of glass tube of the same diameter was adapted,
 6 inches in length, and a disc        of tissue-paper, weighing      one grain,
 which nearly occupied the area of the tube, was delicately suspended
by a hair, at right angles to the axis of the tube.           A slide valve was
 so adapted to the lower orifice, that this aperture could be opened or
closed without entering the room.             The air of the room being qui
 escent,  it was found that when       the slide valve closed the lower orifice
of the   tube,     the disc of tissue paper remained perfectly quiescent           ;
but that when the slide valve was withdrawn,                 leaving the lower
 orifice open, oscillations of the paper occurred, and it was projected
at a small angle towards the upper orifice of the tube, demonstrating
 the existence of a feeble current of air through the apparatus.
    The preceding experiment having proved the existence of a cur
rent of air within the tube, of sufficient force to move a light body,
the author next proceeded to ascertain the velocity of the current
by means of an anemometer,           in the form of an horizontal fly-disc,
suspended within         the lower orifice of a tube, bent twice at right
angles below.          The revolving disc was      made  of  a circular piece    of
stout writing-paper,       cut into twenty-four equal segments,         from the
circumference to near the centre, each of the segments being after
wards inclined at an angle of twenty-five degrees*, like the vanes of a
windmill     ;  so that when properly suspended, a current of air entering
the lower orifice of the tube would cause the disc to revolve                 from
right to left.       The disc was suspended in       the same manner as the
needle    of   the mariner's compass,     and by the same means.
   * A nearer approach to an angle of    45 would have crippled the paper, so that
it would not have preserved the horizontal position.

                                      469
   When    the apparatus was arranged, the door           of the room closed,
and the atmosphere in a quiescent state, it was found that a con
stant regular rotation of the disc was established, and kept up by
the upward current of air through the apparatus, and continued so
long as the atmosphere of the room was quiet            ;  but that agitations
of the surrounding        air either rendered the rotation uncertain, or
reversed it.
   Having thus ascertained that       the current  of air within the vertical
tube possessed      sufficient force to cause the rotation        of a lightly
suspended    fly-disc, the question arose, what influence elongation or
shortening of the tube would exert on the velocity of the current.
For this purpose three tubes of precisely similar construction, but
with long limbs of 12, 24, and 48 inches respectively, were fitted as
before with fly-discs, and placed near each other in the centre          of the
room.
   In nineteen observations, the number of revolutions in the tube,
with a long limb of 12 inches, varied from 0-75 to 4-5 per minute;
in that with a long limb of 24 inches, from 1-5 to 9-0, and in that
with the long limb of 48 inches, from 3-75 to 14-0 per minute.
The gross number of revolutions in the three tubes, in the nineteen
observations, were respectively 51-25, 111- 25, and 199-75; and the
mean revolutions       per minute, 2-697, 5-855, 10-513, which, allow
ing for errors of observation, yield the ratios      1,   2, 4 nearly ; so that
it may  be said that the velocity     of the revolutions is in   a direct ratio
to the lengths of the vertical tubes.
   The influence of      the  conoidal form of the tube being suggested
by Dr. Roget as worthy of investigation, a tube, 96 inches long by
3 inches diameter below and 6 inches above, was fitted to a rec
tangular tube containing the rotating disc.            Another     tube of the
same length, 3 inches in diameter throughout, was placed near the
 conical tube as a term of comparison.         The revolutions of the disc
in the conical tube were more rapid than in that of uniform diameter,
in the proportion of 8-8 to 3-0. When the position of the cone was
reversed,   and the entrance and exit orifices were equal, the revolu
tions   still continued      more   rapid  than in    the tube of uniform
diameter.
   To determine      the influence  of the area of the tube on the velocity
of the current, four tubes,        96 inches in length in the long,         and

                                          470
 4 inches in the short branch, but varying              in diameter, were placed
 in the room near each other and simultaneously observed.
     In a  tube of  3  inches uniform diameter, the revolutions were 3-0
 per minute; in one of 5 inches £H5, and in one of 6-75 inches 13-15;
 their respective     areas    being    7 065,   15-708, and 21-205.         In  the
 conical tube on its base, whose area was 14-529, the revolutions
 were 8-8 per minute.          It would    seem, then, that the velocity has re
 lation rather to the mean            area   of the tube than to that of the
 entrance and exit orifices, as the latter were the same in the tube of
 3 inches uniform diameter, and in the conical tube on its base, while
 the revolutions of the disc were 3-0 per minute in the former, and
 8-8 per minute in the latter.           When the exit orifice of the tube of
 6-75 inches diameter was reduced to 3-5 inches, the rapidity of the
 revolutions was reduced only about 10 per cent.
    The influence of temperature in accelerating or retarding              the cur
 rents through the tubes next engaged               the author's attention    ;  but
 before entering into direct experiments, he found by very numerous
observations, that on some occasions no appreciable difference could
 be observed    in the temperature of the atmosphere of the room near
 the floor and the ceiling, while on others there was a mean excess
 of 0°-17 Fahr. near the ceiling without causing any perceptible dif
ference in the velocity of the revolutions          of the discs.    In forty  com
parative observations of the temperature of the external surface of
the tube and of the surrounding air, that of the tube was 0'09 higher;
in twenty-three it was equal, but in only five was it lower than the
surrounding air.
    Of thirty- six comparative observations of the temperature of the
air within, and external to the tube, by a delicate mercurial thermo
meter,    it was found     to be  slightly higher within the tube in twenty-
seven, and in the remaining nine it was equal, but never lower than
that of the external air.          The greatest     excess was 0°-4    Fahr., and
the mean excess       0°-14 Fahr.
    The accuracy of      these results was tested by an extremely delicate
differential   thermometer, which also indicated a minute excess of
temperature within the tube           ;  the author is led however to infer,
that in the thirty-six observations the mean of 0C-14 is rather above
the true excess    ;  taking this however to be the exact amount, and
as the atmospheric air is increased only           j-J-j of its volume, for every

                                       471
degree    of Fahrenheit's     thermometer, we shall have              of j-J-j for
the increase of the whole bulk of        that in the tube.
   The disc continued to rotate while       the thermometer indicated equal
temperature in the tube and external to it, in eight of the cases,
and was arrested by an accident in the ninth.
   In another experiment, when the lower orifice of the tube was
alternately closed     and opened by a valve, the temperature appeared
under both circumstances to be the same ; hence, if we assume that
a  minute excess of temperature of the air within the tube, over that
of  the air external to it, exists, yet the experiment shows that             it is
not attributable to any heat being disengaged by the movement of
the air itself.
    Increase and decrease of the temperature of the room exercised                a
considerable influence on the velocity of the rotations of the discs,
which increased as the day advanced, and -declined as the tempera
ture fell towards evening, although the direct rays of the sun never
fell upon the window of the room.
    Partial exclusion of light, by a blind covering the whole window,
produced a considerable reduction in the velocity of the rotations of
the discs, but a screen of a foot in breadth, interposed between the
window and an individual          tube, merely reduced the velocity of the
 rotations from 12-5 to 11-0 per minute.
    The influence of reduction of temperature of the long branch of
the tube, by placing around it two coils of wet tape*, reduced the
revolutions of the disc from 4'0 to l-75 per minute           ; a third reduced
 the revolutions to    TO  ;  a fourth to 0-5   ; and a fifth caused complete
 cessation.
    To ascertain the influence of the abstraction of        aqueous vapour on
 the rotation   of the discs,  a shallow vessel, containing strong sulphuric
 acid, was placed, at the suggestion of the Rev. Dr. Booth, imme
 diately below the disc in the short branch of the tube.               After    the
lapse   of thirty minutes, the rotation had        ceased altogether    ;  at the
commencement the disc was rotating at the usual rate.                 The    same
vessel, placed in the tube without         the sulphuric acid, had no effect
 on the rotation.
    In another experiment        a bell-glass was suspended      over the short
 branch of the tube, so that the short branch projected into it, and a
   * Half an inch broad, and not so wet that any of the water ran away from it,

                                             472
  saucer, containing concentrated sulphuric acid, wasal so placed under
  the bell-glass, on a level with the orifice of the tube.             The rotations
  of the disc were         accelerated    by placing the warm hand for a few
  seconds in contact        with   the long branch of the tube      ; but at the end
  of  five minutes after      it was withdrawn,     and the room left and closed,
 the disc had ceased to rotate.
     To determine the influence of partial                abstraction    of aqueous
  vapour from the entire atmosphere of the room on the velocity of
 the rotations, the three tubes, with long limbs of 12, 24, and 48
 inches, employed in a previous experiment, were placed near each
 other, and three bushels of quicklime were spread in shallow vessels
 on the floor and other parts of the room. Before the lime was placed,
 the disc    in  the 12-inch      tube was revolving at the rate of 0-75 per
 minute;       that in the 24-inch        tube at 2-0; and that in the 48-inch
 tube at 4-0 per minute.            At the  end of fifty minutes the rotation had
 ceased in the 12-inch tube, and was reduced to 1-75, and 3-5 in- the
 24- and 48-inch tubes.             After seventy minutes, rotation had ceased
 in the 24-inch tube,          and   was reduced to 3-75 in the 48-inch tube.
 Finally, after ninety minutes, the rotations in            the 48-inch tube were
 reduced to      2- 75   per minute.
     Similar reductions in velocity were              observed   after the removal
and reintroduction of the quicklime              in a second    and third series  of
observations.         Thus in all      these   experiments the rotations in the
 12- and 24-inch tubes entirely ceased; and those in the 48-inch
tube, although continued, were much diminished                 ; a result most pro
bably attributable to the greater quantity of aqueous vapour remain
ing in the upper strata of the air in the room.
     The mean depression of the wet-bulb thermometer, the hygro
meter being placed 48 inches above the floor, and the lime being
absent, was 3-2        ;  when the lime was present, 3-4. When the hygro
meter was on the floor the depression of the wet bulb was 3 -5.
    As the abstraction of          aqueous   vapour from the atmosphere dimi
nished and even abolished the currents of air within the tubes, it
was to be expected that increase of vapour in the atmosphere would
produce the contrary effect, and accelerate the currents and the cor
responding revolutions of the discs, and the following results coin
cide with that expectation.
    In   the first experiment, the tube and bell-glass previously described

                                          473
were employed, but substituting folds of damp linen for the saucer of
sulphuric     acid, so as fully to charge the air in the bell-glass with
vapour, the rotations rapidly rose from 4-0 to               17  or 18 per minute.
    But  as the cold produced by the evaporation               of the water in this
experiment might be a source of fallacy, an arrangement was made
to supply the bell-glass with air, previously charged with vapour,
formed at a distance of 5 feet from the glass. The rapidity of the
revolutions was however still considerably increased.
    Augmentation of the quantity of aqueous               vapour, in the general
atmosphere      of the room, by spreading wet cloths on the floor and
other parts, also produced increase in the rapidity of the rotations,
though to     a small extent.
    These experiments*        would seem to demonstrate that the ordi
nary condition of atmospheric air within vertical tubes, open at both
extremities, is one of continual upward movement.
    If the atmosphere were a strictly homogeneous elastic fluid, and
in   a state   of perfect equilibrium,       any portion of it contained in a
vertical tube would of course           be perfectly     stationary unless some
adventitious     cause   produced disturbance of its equilibrium.                But
our atmosphere being a mixed fluid, and the aqueous vapour being
of a much lower specific gravity at all atmospheric temperatures
than the compound of which it forms a part, it is constantly rising
within   a tube, as   in the  free air   ; entering at the lower, and making
its exit at the upper orifice of the tube.
    The experiments      appear further to demonstrate, that the presence
of aqueous vapour in the atmosphere is essential to the production
of the current within the vertical tubes,           since by the abstraction of
vapour from the air by quicklime,             the rotations of the discs were
invariably either diminished or caused to cease               ; while on the other
hand, when the proportion            of aqueous vapour in the air was in
creased,    the  currents and the rotations of the discs were simulta
neously accelerated.
   * Throughout the entire series the results were carefully observed during the
night, when the atmosphere    of the room was free from solar influences.     The dry-
and the wet-bulb thermometers     yielded the same relative differences, and the discs
rotated with the same constancy.      The night  as well as the day observations were
continued  through all the changes of temperature,   from March 1853 to the present
time.

     In concluding  the details of these experiments, the author considers
  that they all tend to prove the existence of an upward current, under
  the circumstances described in the commencement of this paper.
     They moreover yield a series of results which      he hopes the Society
  will deem to be not without interest.
     These results show it to be probable,    if not certain, that the ordi
  nary temperature of air within tubes, under the circumstances in
  which these were placed, is higher than of that external to them, all
  other relations of the tubes and surrounding objects being the same        ;
  they also show that in eight instances, when the thermometers in
  dicated an equality of temperature, within and external to the tube,
  the rotations of the discs still continued    ;  and that when four coils
  of tape, moistened with water,     were applied round the external sur
 face of the tube, the rotations    of the disc did not wholly cease.
     They  also show, that when the atmosphere of the room, in which
 the tubes were immersed, contained a larger or smaller proportion of
 aqueous vapour, all other things being equal, the discs revolved with
 more or less velocity   ; but that when the atmosphere was deprived
 in a great degree    of aqueous    vapour by the presence of quicklime,
 the thermometric state in all other respects remaining the same, the
 revolutions of the discs ceased.
    Adverting   to the indications cited above, of a minute excess         of
 temperature in the interior of the tubes, and assuming that even
that slight excess would be sufficient to rotate the discs, still the
rotations diminished or ceased in proportion as the aqueous vapour
was withdrawn.
    Any increase of temperature which might          have been produced by
the quicklime would have had a tendency rather to increase than
diminish    the revolutions   of the discs, but we have seen that the
abstraction of the vapour entirely arrested their rotation.
    With regard to the specific influence of      each  of the circumstances
and agents most probably concerned in producing              the phenomena
described above, such as protection of the air within the tube from
lateral expansion and mechanical agitations, to which the external
air is exposed;    gaseous   diffusion;   the unequal specific gravity of
air and vapour;      and the subtle operations of temperature at all
times, the author is fully conscious that he has not ascertained their
respective values.

                                      475
   He is also conscious that the phenomena themselves             are the chief
ground on which he can rest a claim for originality,              and that the
explanation of them may be better treated by those who are more
accustomed to deal with similar researches.
   In  the course  of these experiments the author has been especially
indebted for many valuable suggestions              to the   Rev. Dr. Booth,
Dr. Roget, Professor Sharpey,       and   Mr. Bishop    ; and he is also under
obligations to Professor Stokes and to Mr. Brooke.
XII. " On      the   Constitution and Properties of Ozone."                  By
       Thomas Andrews, M.D., F.R.S., Professor of Chemistry
       in Queen's College, Belfast. Received May 16, 1855.
   The conflicting views which have so long existed as to the true
constitution of ozone, induced the author to undertake a careful in
vestigation of the subject, particularly as he had reason to doubt the
accuracy of the only quantitative        experiments which have yet been
made to elucidate this difficult question.          According   to the experi
ments referred to, two substances          have been confounded under the
name of ozone, one a compound body having the formula HO.,,                  the
other an allotropic variety of oxygen. To ascertain whether, in con
formity with this statement, ozone obtained in the electrolysis of
water contains hydrogen         as a constituent,      the author made two
series   of experiments.     In  the   first series,  he followed    nearly the
same method     of investigation by which its compound nature is sup
posed to have been established, but modified so as to avoid a source
of error, which,  if neglected, vitiates altogether     the results.   Electro
lytic oxygen, unless very great precautions           be taken, is always ac
companied by a small but appreciable quantity                of carbonic acid,
which is liable to be partially absorbed by the potassa set free when
a neutral solution    of iodide of potassium is        decomposed     by ozone.
By adding a little hydrochloric          acid  to the solution of iodide of
potassium before the commencement of each experiment, this error
may be avoided.
   The method of performing       the experiment was to conduct a stream
of electrolytic   oxygen through       a   compound apparatus previously
    VOl. VII.                                                      2 x

                                           476
weighed, which contained on one side an acid solution of iodide of
potassium, and on the other sulphuric acid             ; the former to decompose
the ozone, the latter to prevent the escape of moisture.                The increase
in weight of this apparatus gave the entire weight of the ozone ; the
iodine set free, when reduced to its equivalent in oxygen, the weight
of the active oxygen.           The precautions to       he taken in conducting
this experiment are fully described in the communication.
    The following        are the numerical     results of five experiments per
formed according to the above method               : —
    Volume  of electrolytic      Increase in weight of     Active oxygen deduced
           oxygen.               compound apparatus.         from iodine set free.
              litres.                     grm.                       grm.
             10-20                       00379                     00386
                2-72                    00107                      0-0100
                2-86                     0-0154                    00138
                645                      00288                     00281
                680                      0-0251                    00273
                      Total             0-1179                     0 1178
    The agreement in         these numbers proves that the active oxygen is
 exactly equal to the entire weight of the ozone, and is therefore iden
 tical with it.
     In the next      series of experiments the author shows that no water
 is produced in         the decomposition       of electrolytic     ozone   by heat.
 Large quantities         of electrolytic   oxygen, containing        from 38 to 27
 milligrammes of ozone, were decomposed                 by heat, but no water was
 obtained in      a weighed absorption apparatus, in which the gas was
 exposed, not only to the action of sulphuric acid, but was also passed
 through a tube containing anhydrous phosphoric acid.
     Having     confirmed by new experiments the fact that ozone                      is
 formed by the action of the electrical spark on pure and dry oxygen,
 the author proceeds         to institute a comparison between the properties
  of ozone    derived from different sources.             These he finds to be in
  every respect the same.             Thus ozone, however prepared, is              de
  stroyed, or rather converted into ordinary oxygen, by exposure to a
  temperature of about 237°          C,  and catalytically, by being passed over
  peroxide of manganese,          no water being formed in either case           ; it is
  not absorbed        by water, but when sufficiently diluted             with other

                                      477
gases, is destroyed by agitation      with  a large quantity of water  ;  it is
also, contrary to the common statements, destroyed by being agi
tated with lime-water and baryta-water,          provided a sufficient quan
tity of those solutions       be used  ; it has always the same peculiar
odour   ; it bleaches without producing previously        an acid reaction     ;
it oxidizes in all   cases the same bodies,    &c.
   From the whole investigation the author draws the conclusion,
" that ozone, from whatever source derived, is           one  and the same
substance,    and is not a compound body, but oxygen in an altered or
allotropic condition."
XIII. "On          Rubian    and its Products       of Decomposition."      —
       Part   III.    By  Edward Schunck, F.R.S.             Received    June
       13, 1855.
           Combined Action     of Alkalies  and Oxygen on Rubian.
   In  the preceding part of this paper the author has shown that the
action of alkalies is essentially the same as that of acids on rubian,
the   only difference being that the rubianine produced by acids is
replaced by rubiadine when alkalies are employed.              Now though
this is in all cases   the final result of the action of alkalies, there still
remained a possibility of the existence of bodies intermediate between
rubian and the final products of decomposition.           Such bodies do in
reality exist, but their formation is dependent, in part at least,          on
the simultaneous action of oxygen.
   When alkalies        or alkaline   earths,  as potash,   soda,  ammonia,
baryta or lime, or the bicarbonates of baryta or lime are added to a
watery solution      of rubian, and the solution is exposed to the air,
oxygen is absorbed,       and three distinct bodies are formed, to which
the author has given the names of Rubianic Acid, Rubidehydran and
Rubihydran.       The method of separating these bodies and obtaining
them in a    state of purity is fully detailed.      Even oxide of lead is a
sufficiently   strong base to cause rubian to undergo this process           of
decomposition in the presence of oxygen.           From this  cause the lead
compound of rubian, after being exposed for some time to the atmo
sphere,   no longer contains unchanged rubian, but products of its de
composition     ; and hence also it follows that in the processes         pro
                                                              2x2

                                     478
posed by Kuhlmann,       Berzelius and others for the preparation of the
so-called xanthine, and in that of Rochleder for the preparation of
his ruberythric acid, all of which depend on the use of alkaline earths
or basic acetate of lead, products of decomposition of rubian must in
every case be formed.         Besides the substances just mentioned, a
little acetic acid, and sometimes      also  rubiadine, and sugar in small
quantities are formed.       Whether    the first is an essential product   of
decomposition or not, the author leaves undecided         ; but the other two
he considers as decidedly       secondary products,       resulting  from the
decomposition of rubidehydran or rubihydran.
    Rubianic acid is soluble in water and alcohol, but not in ether.
 It crystallises in lemon-yellow      silky needles.     Its watery solution
has a distinctly but not strongly bitter taste.       When heated it yields
a sublimate    of alizarine.   By the action of strong acids, as well as
of caustic alkalies and of erythrozym, it is decomposed into alizarine
and sugar.      Its compounds with potash and ammonia crystallize in
small puce-coloured needles.        The soda salt is deposited from the
watery solution as a mass of small red spherical grains, which are
very   sparingly   soluble in water.      These compounds possess        very
little stability.   The baryta and lime salts are obtained by double
decomposition as red precipitates.         The acid is completely precipi
tated from its watery solution by basic acetate of lead, the precipi
tate being red, and resembling       that produced by the same salt in a
solution of rubian.
    The composition of rubianic acid      is expressed    by the formula
                          C52 Hw 0,-,
that of the potash salt by
                          CwH^O^KO.
that of the neutral baryta salt by
                          C^H^O^+BaO + HO.
The conversion of the acid into alizarine and sugar is symbolized by
the following equation : —
            C« H.*,      + 5HO=2C14 H5 04+ 2C12 H12 012.
In order to leave no doubt regarding the correctness of the formula,
the author determined the quantity of alizarine formed by the decom
position of the acid. According to calculation, 100 parts of acid
should yield 43-44 parts of dry alizarine.          In two experiments the
author obtained 42-47 and 45-17 per cent,          of alizarine.

                                    479
   The  presence of oxygen is necessary for the formation       of this acid.
If a  watery solution of rubian made alkaline with soda or baryta be
kept out of contact with       the air, no rubianic      acid is produced,
whereas an abundance of the latter is obtained from the same solu
tion on exposure to the atmosphere.          The manner in which it is
formed from rubian may be represented by the following equation           : —
           CM      Om+ 10O=CM HM O2- +4COs + 5HO.
   The author considers this     as the first known    instance of a body,
belonging to the class of glucosides, or conjugate compounds con
taining sugar, having been observed       to form by a process of oxida
tion.
   The author thinks it probable that this acid and         the ruberythric
of Kochleder are identical, but the description given of the latter by
the discoverer is not sufficiently minute to enable him to come to a
decision on this point.     Rochleder    has moreover given a very        dif
ferent composition for his acid.      Until  the properties and composi
tion of the latter have been more accurately investigated, the author
prefers considering the two acids as distinct.       If  they are identical,
then Rochleder has merely committed the common error of mistaking
a product for an educt.
   Rubidehydran     and rubihydran    have both properties very nearly
resembling those of rubian, from which they can only with difficulty
be distinguished.      Neither of them however is capable of yielding
rubianic acid when treated in the same way as rubian.             The   com
position of rubidehydran is expressed      by the formula
                              ^66 ^32 0-28 .
that of rubihydran by
The former contains therefore the     elements of 2 equivs. of water less
the latter, the elements     of 5 equivs. of water more than rubian.
Both substances     give, when decomposed      by strong acids, the same
products, viz. alizarine, rubiretine, verantine, rubiadine      and sugar.
The products formed      by acids are therefore the same as those        pro
duced from rubian by alkalies, which renders it probable that the
latter, when acted on by alkalies, is first converted into rubidehydran
or rubihydran, or both.
   Rubiadine   may be obtained from rubihydran          in large quantities

                                            480
and in    a state   of great purity, and the author had thus an oppor
tunity of examining the properties             and composition      of this substance
more accurately than heretofore.               From the new analyses which he
made he infers that its formula is
                                     C^H^Og,
which differs from
                                     C.i2 H12  08,
the one formerly given, by            1  equiv. of water.
                          Action     of Chlorine   on Rubian.
    When chlorine       gas is passed through a watery solution of rubian,
the solution deposits lemon-yellow               or orange-colour flocks and be
 comes colourless.        The flocks consist of        a  peculiar substance,   which
 the author calls Chlororubian.             The liquid contains sugar.         Chloro-
 rubian    crystallizes     from its solution in alcohol           in small orange-
 coloured needles.          It is soluble in     boiling water, but not as easily
 as in alcohol.      On being     heated,    however carefully, it is decomposed.
 It is dissolved by caustic and carbonated alkalies, forming blood -red
 solutions.     The baryta        and lime compounds are red and insoluble.
The watery solution produces with basic                  acetate  of  lead a light red
 precipitate.     The author gives for the chlororubian the formula
                                     C44 H27 C1024-
 Its formation from rubian         is represented by the following equation        : —
       CB6 H»4  0M+6HO + 2C1=C<4H27C10W + C12H12Oia+ 2C1H.
     Chlororubian     is decomposed          by strong acids      and splits up into
 sugar and another body, which has the formula
                                      Ca2H12C109,
  and which,     in consequence          of  the  relation in which it stands        to
  rubiadine, the author calls Chlororubiadine.               The manner in which
  this process     of decomposition takes           place   will   be seen from the
  following equation —    :
                  H„ C102J= Ca H12 C10H+              CM Hi2    0,„+ 3HO.
      Chlororubiadine     is soluble in alcohol.           The boiling solution     de
  posits it on cooling in yellow shining needles.                   It is insoluble in
  boiling water.       It    is not   decomposed       by dilute nitric acid or on
  boiling,   but nitric      acid of sp. gr. r.5-2 dissolves,          and  on boiling

                                               t81
decomposes      it,   and nitrate       of silver now        gives      a   precipitate of chlo
ride of silver.       Chlororubiadine          dissolves        in caustic and carbonated
alkalies with a red colour.             With baryta        it   gives   a   compound, crystal
lizing in long    red needles.           The author did not succeed in convert
ing rubiadine into chlororubiadine, nor, on the other hand, was he
able to substitute the           chlorine of the latter by hydrogen, and thus
form rubiadine.
  The sugar which           is   formed from chlororubian, together with chlo
rorubiadine, may be obtained in               a   crystallized state, when               it   has the
properties and composition of crystallised grape-sugar.
  When chlororubian              is   treated with caustic soda, the chlorine                        is
entirely separated,      forming chloride of sodium.                        The other products
of decomposition       are verantine, rubiretine,               a   body resembling rubia
dine, sugar, and        a   yellowish-brown               substance         insoluble in water,
in alcohol, and even in alkalies, the probable formula of which                                 is
                                       C+4 H14 012<
and for which the author proposes the name                           of Oxyrubian, since             it
owes its formation to the chlorine of chlororubian being replaced by
oxygen.
   By the continued action of chlorine chlororubian      converted                  is
into   white body, which the author calls Per chlororubian.
       a                                                      This
body   is   insoluble in water and caustic alkalies, but soluble in alcohol
and ether.      It crystallizes from the alcoholic solution in colourless,

       Face, and all their Summits           Triedral."      By the Rev.      Tho
       mas   P. Kirkman, A.M., Rector of Croft-with-Southworth.
       Communicated by A. Cayley, Esq., F.R.S.                          Received
       June 13, 1855.
   The object of the      paper is to enumerate the x-edra which have an
                        and all their summits triedral            or, what is the
(x— l)-gonal      face,                                        ;
same thing, to find the number          of the x-acra which have       an (x— 1)-
edral summit, and all their faces triangular.
   Every x-edron having an (x— l)-gonal face has at least two trian
gular faces.      Let A be an x-edron having all its summits triedral,
and having about its       (x— l)-gonal     face k triangular   faces.    Suppose
all these triangles to become infinitely small ; there arises an (x — k)-
edron B, having an (x — k — l)-gonal face, and all its summits tri
edral.    B  will   have k' triangular faces,     k  being not less than two,
nor greater than k.          And    there  is no other (x— A)-edron but B,
which can arise from the vanishing of all the k triangles of A ; i. e.
there is no (x— A)-edron but B, from which A can be cut by re
moving k of the summits of B in such a way as to leave none of its
k' triangles untouched.
   If we next suppose the k' triangles of         B to vanish,    there  will  arise
an  (x — k— A')-edron C, having         an (x — k— k'—    l)-gonal face, all its
summits triedral, and k" triangular faces,          k" not <2, nor >-k'.       And
thus we shall at last reduce          our x-edron, either to a tetraedron, or
to a pentaedron having triedral summits.
   All x-edra   here considered fall into six varieties, differing           in the
sequence    of the x—   1   faces that are collateral with the (x — 1 )-gonal
base.    They   are either irreversible,      as the octaedron 6435443, the
seven faces about the base reading differently both backwards and
forwards from every face          ; or doubly irreversible, as the heptaedron
543543, whose six faces about the base are a repetition of an irre
versible period of three        ;   or triply irreversible, as the decaedron
643643643, whose faces exhibit a thrice-repeated irreversible period;
or they are reversible, doubly reversible, or triply reversible, as the
hexaedrou 53443,         the enneaedron 63536353, or the heptaedron
535353, exhibiting a single, double, or triple period, all reading

varieties that make up P,.
    Each variety is again subdivided according to the number of tri
angular faces.        Thus, if P(x, k) denote the number of *-edra on an
(x  —   l)-gonal base, having k triangular faces, and all their summits
triedral,

The number         k is not    <2, nor              . and   P,= i;P(*, k), for all
                                           5*~2_
values of k.
    It is necessary to     solve the following
    Problem.—      To   determine the number of (* + A + /)-edra, none of
which shall be the reflected image of another, that can be made
from any x-edron having k triangular faces, by removing k +                   I of its
base- summits, thus adding         k+l    triangular   faces, so that none of its
k triangular faces shall remain uncut.
    Thex-edron is supposed to have an (x— l) gonal face, and all its
 summits triedral; no edge is to be removed, and k + l not >-x — 1.
    When       the x-edron,    the  subject of operation, is irreversible, all
the resulting {x+ A + /)-edra will be irreversible.              If it is reversible,
some of them will be reversible and others irreversible ; if it is mul
 tiple, some of them will be, and others           will not  be, multiple.
     If  the subject of operation is irreversible, the number required by
 the problem is
    v       J                         aK        '         ta+1        U^a + l
 taken for all values of      a  not greater than the least of k and         /; i.  e.
 k—   a   not <0, 0 not >-l—a.
     The complete answer to the problem is expressed by the follow
 ing equations, in which, of the capitals on the left, the first ex
 presses the result, and the second the subject of operation.               That is,

     XV. " Notes on British Foraminifera." By    Gwyn                                                                J.                     Jef
          freys, Esq., F.R.S. Received June 19, 1855.
      Having, during                    a          great many years, directed my attention to the
recent Foraminifera which inhabit our own shores,                                                                    I    venture to offer
a few observations on this curious group, as                                                            Dr. Carpenter, who                      has
favoured the Society with an interesting                                                              and valuable memoir on
the subject, seems not to have had many opportunities of studying
the animals in the recent                                    state.

                                     486
    Rather more than twenty years ago         I  communicated        to the      Lin-
nean    Society a paper on the subject, containing             a  diagnosis       and
figures of all the species.      This paper was      read and ordered          to  be
printed in the Transactions of that Society          ; but it was withdrawn
by me before     publication,  in consequence       of my being dissatisfied
with D'Orbigny's theory (which         I  had erroneously adopted),              that
the animals belonged to the Cephalopoda;              and my subsequent ob
servations were confirmed by the theory of Dujardin.                I have since
placed all my drawings      and specimens      at the disposal of Mr. Wil
liamson of Manchester, who has given such a good earnest of what
he can do in elucidating      the natural history of this group, by his
papers on Lagena and the Foraminiferous           mud of the Levant.
    The observations which I     have made on many hundred recent and
living   specimens   of various species,    fully confirm Dr. Carpenter's
view as to the simple and homogeneous nature of the animal.                      His
idea   of their reproduction by gemmation is also probably correct ;
although I cannot agree with him in considering the granules which
are occasionally found in the cells as ova.         These bodies      I have fre
quently noticed, and especially in the Lagena            ;   but they appeared
to constitute the entire mass, and not merely           a   part of the animal.
 I am inclined to think they are only desiccated           portions of the ani
mal, separated    from each other in consequence        of the absence of any
muscular or nervous structure.        It may    also be questionable          if the
term   "ova" is rightly applicable    to an animal which has no distinct
organs of any kind.      Possibly the fry may pass through a metamor
phosis, as in the case of the Medusa.
    Most of the Foraminifera    are free, or only adhere by their pseudo-
podia to foreign substances.       Such are the Lagena of Walker, Nodo-
saria, Vorticialis and Textularia, and the Miliola of Lamarck.                  The
latter has some, although a very limited, power of locomotion             ; which
is effected by exserting its pseudopodia to their full length, attach
ing itself by them to a piece of seaweed, and then contracting them
like india-rubber, so as to draw the shell along with them.                   Some
of the acephalous mollusks do the same by means of their byssus.
This   mode of progression is, however, exceedingly slow           ;  and   I  have
never seen, in the course of twenty-four hours,         a  longer journey than
a quarter   of an inch accomplished by a     Miliola,     so that, in compari
son with it, a snail travels at a railroad pace.

                                    487
    Some are fixed or sessile, but not cemented at their base like the
testaceous   annelids.   The only mode of attachment appears to         be a
thin film of sarcose.    The Lobatula of Fleming, and the Rosalia        and
Planorbulina of D'Orbigny belong to this division.
    Dr. Carpenter considers the Foraminifera to be phytophagous, in
consequence    of his having detected in some specimens, by the aid
of the microscope, fragments of Diatomacece and other simple forms
of vegetable life. But as I have dredged them alive at a depth of
108 fathoms (which is far below the Laminarian        zone), and they are
extremely abundant at from 40 to 70 fathoms, ten miles from land
and   beyond the range of any seaweed, it may be assumed without
much difficulty, that many,    if not most of them,  are zoophagous, and
prey on microscopic animals, perhaps even of a simpler form and
structure than themselves.       They  are in their turn the food   of mol-
lusca, and appear to be especially relished by Dentalium Entale.
    With respect to Dr. Carpenter's idea that they           are  allied to
sponges,   I may remark that Polystomella crispa (an elegant and not
uncommon species) has its periphery set round at each segment with
siliceous spicula, like the rowels of a spur.    But  as there is only one
terminal cell, which is connected with all the others in the interior
by one or more openings for the pseudopodia, the analogy is not
complete, this being a solitary,       and  the sponge    a compound      or
aggregate animal.
    I believe the geographical range or distribution of     species in this
group to be regulated by the same laws as in the Mollusks and other
marine animals.      In the gulf of Genoa I   have found (as might have
been expected) species     identical with those of our Hebridean coast,
and vice versd.
    In common with Dr. Carpenter, I cannot help deploring the ex
cessive multiplication of species in the present day, and I would in
clude in this regret the unnecessary formation of genera. Another
Linnaeus is sadly wanted to correct this pernicious habit, both at
home and abroad.
    The group now under consideration exhibits a great tendency to
variation of form, some of the combinations (especially in the case of
Marginulina) being     as complicated and various as a Chinese puzzle.
It is, I believe, undeniable, that the variability of form is in      an in
verse ratio to the development     of animals in  the scale of Nature.

                                       188
   Having examined thousands          (I   may say myriads) of these elegant
organisms,     I  am induced to suggest the following          arrangement    : —
    1.  Lagena (Walker) and Entosolenia (Williamson).
   2. Nodosaria and Marginulina (D'Orb.), &c.
   3.    Vorticialis  (D'Orb.), Rotalia (Lam.), Lobatula (Flem.), Globi-
gerina (D'Orb.), &c.
   4.    Textuluria (Defrance), Uvigerina (D'Orb.),           &c.
   5.   Miliola (Lam.), Biloculina (D'Orb.), &c.
   This division must, however, be modified by             a more extended      and
cosmopolitan view of the subject, as           I  only profess to treat of the
British    species.    To illustrate MacLeay's        theory of    a  quinary and
circular arrangement, the case may be put thus.
                                    Lagenadsc.
                                          1
   The first family is connected by          the typical     genus Lagena with
the    second,    and by Entosolina with the fifth       ; the second    is united
with     the third    through   Marginulina     ;  the third    with   the  fourth
through Globigerina       ; and  the fourth with       the last through Uvige
rina.
   Whether       these singular and   little-known animals        are Rhizopodes,
or belong to the Amoeba, remains yet to be satisfactorily made out.

XVI. " Preliminary          Research     on the Magnetism           developed     in
        Iron Bars by Electrical Currents."            By   J. P.  Joule, F.R.S.
        Received June 21, 1855.
   The author had, many        years ago, found that the magnetism deve
loped by electro-magnetic coils in bars of upward of               ird  of an inch

                                     489
diameter, was nearly proportional to the strength of the current and
the length    of the wire, any alteration, within certain limits, of the
diameter of a har heing attended with only trifling effects, so long
as the point of saturation was not nearly approached.           The Russian
philosophers Lenz and Jacobi had, however, stated             that the mag
netism developed was, ceteris paribus, proportional to the diameter
of the bar.    The discrepancy between the       above results is considered
by the author to be owing        rather to the different circumstances
under which the experiments were tried than to any inaccuracies in
the experiments themselves.        Further,   it  appeared   to him that in
any case of induction by electric currents, careful distinction         should
be made between the several effects,        which, compounded together,
constitute the total magnetic action.          Especially should    a  distinc
tion be made between the magnetism existing under the inductive
influence of the current and that permanently developed               so as to
remain after the electrical   circuit is broken, and therefore the first
efforts of the author were directed to ascertain the laws which regu
late this permanent effect, or, as he thinks        it may  be conveniently
termed,   the magnetic set.
   In his experiments the magnetism of any bar was ascertained, by
placing it vertically with its lower end near a delicately suspended
magnetic needle.      This was a piece of sewing-needle -^ths of an
inch long, furnished with an index of fine drawn glass tube tra
versing over a graduated circle six inches in diameter.          It was    sus
pended by a filament of silk.       The tangent of the deflection of the
needle was found to be     the exact measure of the attraction of a bar.
In working with this instrument, it was found that the resistance of
the air prevented the needle      from swinging       even once beyond the
point of equilibrium    to which it always arrived in less than ten
seconds.     This resistance of the air,      so useful    for bringing     the
needle rapidly to a state of rest, rendered it necessary to keep the
entire instrument    at a uniform temperature, for the slightest local
application of heat produced currents of air within the glass case of
sufficient strength to occasion considerable deflections.            The cir
cumstance points to the possibility of constructing a new and very
sensitive thermometer which might be useful, particularly in experi
ments on the conduction of heat.
   The method of experimenting consisted in observing, — 1st. the
magnetic attraction    of any bar when      a  current circulated through

                                                           190
its spiral     ;                      still subsisting after the circuit was
                     2nd. the attraction
broken    ;    3rd. the attraction of the other pole of the needle on the
reversal of the current                    ;    and    4th. the attraction             remaining        after
this reverse           current was cut off.                       The    sum      of the      1st and    3rd
observations gives the total change in the magnetism of a bar by
the reversal of the current.                      The          sum   of the 2nd       and 4th gives the
total permanent change of magnetism, or the magnetic set.
     The experiments                were       made        with iron bars of the              several   dia
meters,       jij,    jJ^,       j-,           and one inch, the length being in each
case one yard;               and also      with iron bars               ^,   £   and one inch diame
ter, of the length of two yards.                                In all the    bars of small diameter
up to i       of an inch, the magnetic set obtained by the use of feeble
currents was found to be proportional                                to the square of the current
employed in producing                          them.           This law       was     found to subsist
through a long series of electric intensities                             ;    but when the current
was increased to a certain amount, the set, as observed                                       in the bars
of      and        -jij of   an inch diameter, increased in                      a   much higher ratio,
so as to vary, in some instances, with the 4th and 6th powers                                             of
the current.             The point at which this phenomenon                              takes    place    is
called the magnetic breaking point.                              A   further increase of the cur
rent was attended with a rapid decrease of this ratio as the satura
tion of the bar was approached.
     The total change of magnetic condition by reversal of the cur
rent, minus the magnetic set,                         is   found to be nearly proportional                to
the intensity of the current.
     Results of exactly similar character were obtained by the use of
an electro-magnet, consisting                         of   a   bar of hard steel        ^   of an inch in
diameter and             7|   inches long.
     In conclusion, the author points out the striking                                  and    instructive
analogy which exists between the above phenomena and those of
the set of materials as exhibited                           by Professor Hodgkinson,              who, in
his admirable researches,                       has    proved that the set, or permanent
change of figure, in any beam                          is   proportional         to the square of the
pressure to which              it   has been exposed.

         tions."    By G. B. Airy, Esq., F.R.S., Astronomer Royal.
         Received June 2, 1855.
     The author refers, in the first place, to his paper in the Philoso
 phical Transactions       for 1839,    on the Disturbance      of the Compass
 in Iron Ships, for     a theory of the forces produced by the transient
 induced magnetism of iron.            Using the term    " polar-magnet-devia

       " to             a deviation    similar to that which would be pro
             express
 duced by a magnetized steel bar partaking of the movements                 of the
 ship  ;  and using the      term " quadrantal deviation
                                                              " for    a deviation
 following     the  law of the sine        of double the azimuth,        and thus
 having, if
                " positive," the signs H          — in the four

four successive     quadrants    :  then it appears   that the deviation pro
duced by the transient induced magnetism of               a ship will consist of
two parts    ;  of which    one  will  be a  " polar-magnet-deviation,"       such
as would be produced by a magnetized steel              bar whose axis is par
allel to the keel of the ship, and whose absolute intensity is propor
tional to the terrestrial vertical force         at the place   ;   and the other
will   be a  " quadrantal     deviation," which, in angular deviation, will
be absolutely the same in         all magnetic latitudes and with all mag
nitudes of terrestrial magnetic force, and will usually be " posi
tive."     Now combining        these   forces  with  the force     of the " sub-
permanent magnetism" of a ship, which in its nature is essentially
similar to the magnetism of a steel bar, and would therefore,                    if

isolated,    produce "polar-magnet-deviation;"            and remarking      that
the combination        of two polar-magnet-forces will produce a third
polar-magnet-force,        the resulting deviations of which will be
" polar-magnet-deviations        ;
                                   " it is evident that the analysis of the
observed deviations of the compass in any given instance will con
sist in resolving them into two systems,            one of which follows      the
laws    of " polar-magnet-deviation,"       and the other is    a
                                                                   " quadrantal
deviation."
     The practical solution of this problem, without            the assistance
 of tables, is troublesome.         In order to diminish the difficulty, the
 author    has   prepared a Table       of polar-magnet-deviations,       for the
 whole    circumference     as regards     azimuths,   and for all values of
 " modulus " or proportion of the disturbing force to the earth's
 horizontal force, up to 0-8.
     To discover the elements of " polar-magnet-deviation,"              that is,
 the neutral point and the modulus, in any given case, it is neces
 sary so to combine the observations that the "quadrantal deviation"
 shall  be   eliminated.     Simple rules are given for this    ;  and the pro
 cess  of investigating the elements, with       the assistance   of the Tables,
 is illustrated   by exhibiting     the work from beginning to end, in an
 actual instance.
     When the elements       are found, the   Tabular Polar- Magnet-Devia
 tions are to be    formed from those elements ; and the excess of the
 Observed Deviations over these Tabular Deviations ought to consist
 simply of Quadrantal Deviation and Errors of Observations
     From the neutral point and the modulus, with the absolute mea
 sure of the terrestrial horizontal force, it is easy to form the abso
 lute measures of the apparent permanent forces of the ship, in the
                               "                    "
 directions of " headward and " starboard respectively. The star
 board force (on the assumption of general symmetry) can arise from
 nothing but subpermanent magnetism            ; the headward force will con
 sist of subpermanent magnetism          added algebraically to a multiple      of
 the terrestrial vertical force, the multiplier being an unknown con
 stant different for each different ship.
     The process is then applied by the author to four wood-built sail
  ing ships, two wood-built steamers, and five iron-built steamers,
  whose compass-deviations have been observed              at twenty-nine     sta
  tions in all.   The results    are as follows  :—

                                     193
   1.  In all cases, the principal part of the deviation follows the law
of polar-magnet-deviation.
   2. When the polar-magnet-deviation        is computed accurately from
the Table, and subtracted from the observed deviation, the residual
quantity   in all cases follows    very closely the law of quadrantal
deviation, leaving very little to be accounted for by errors of ob
servation.
   3.  For  each ship, the coefficient   of quadrantal deviation is sen
sibly the same in all localities.       The small deviations from exact
equality cannot be referred to geographical position, and evidently
depend on accidental changes in the distribution of the iron, espe
cially of that which is near to the     compass.
   4. As the test of theory must reside in the comparison of residual
quantities, and as it appears that these residual quantities obey with
great exactness the law which         theory assigns, it follows that the
theory,
         " that the deviation may in all       cases be  represented by  a
combination     of two deviations, of which       one is a polar-magnet-
deviation, and the other is a quadrantal deviation whose angular
coefficient, for the same ship, is constant under all circumstances,"
is practically accurate.
   5. Consequently in every case the deviation at any locality may
be perfectly corrected   ; by the application of a steel magnet to neu
tralize the polar-magnet-force     ;  and of a mass of soft iron on one
side of the compass, and at the same level, to correct the quadrantal
deviation (as the author had previously explained).
   6. The mass of soft iron will not require to be changed, under
any circumstances.      It will depend on the variability or constancy
of the subpermanent force to determine whether the steel magnet
must be or must not be changed in different localities or after the
lapse of time.
   7.  On forming the expressions for the absolute values of the head-
ward and starboard polar-magnet-forces, it appears that in some
ships the subpermanent magnetism is really (to sense) a permanent
magnetism, but that in others there is a sensible change.          In one
instance the change was such that, supposing the deviations to be
accurately corrected by magnets and soft iron in England,            there
would have been at the Cape of Good Hope an error whose maxi
                                                            2 y 2

                                          494
mum was nearly 5^° ; in all other cases the error would be smaller,
and in some practically insensible.
   8.  The proper way of counteracting              these      changes evidently is,
to readjust the magnets        ;  and for this purpose the magnets should
be so mounted        as to admit       of adjustment at any time.              The   re
adjustment can be effected            in  a very short time when a ship is in
port, and can probably also be very easily effected                 at sea, in favour
able weather, when a compass             of reference can        be carried high up
one of the masts.
    9. The author strongly condemns any               system     of navigating    a ship
by forming a table       of compass-deviations from observations at one
place, and using that table until observations have been obtained at
some other place.        It does not in the smallest           degree guard against
 die effect of change in the ship's subpermanent magnetism                     ; and it
introduces errors which are purely gratuitous and unnecessary, and
which are entirely avoided         if the    compass     is corrected by magnets
and soft iron.      In elucidation of the amount of errors that may                   be
introduced,    if from any       cause    this system      is carried to extremes,
                                                    '  Trident,' sailing from
he remarks that in the instance of the                                               the
Thames to Rio Janeiro, the table of compass-deviations formed in
the Thames would have been so erroneous when the ship arrived at
Rio Janeiro, that on       one course the error would have been 6° or 7°
in one direction,      and on another course it would have been 8° or
9° in the opposite direction        :   yet during this voyage the ship's sub-
permanent magnetism had not changed at all                   ;  and  if  the compasses
had been corrected in the Thames by magnets and soft iron, there
would not have been an error of a single degree in any part of the
voyage.      In other   cases, where there was a real change                 of subper
manent magnetism, the error would have been fully doubled by
carrying on the original table of observed compass-deviations.
    The communication         is closed by the Table of Polar-Magnet-
Deviations.      It is  a table    of double entry,         one    of   the  arguments
being the azimuth of the ship's head from the neutral point, the
other argument being the modulus or proportion of the polar-mag
net-force to the terrestrial horizontal            force. The azimuth is ex
pressed   in  points  and   decimals     of a point, and is given for every OP- 1
from OP-O to 16p-0; the second half of the circle being a repetition

                                        495
of  the first, but with sign changed.        The modulus is given for        every
O'Ol from     O'OO    to 0-80.   The corresponding deviations are given in
degrees    and    minutes.     For each modulus there is also given the
mean    of all the deviations in     the semicircumference,      for that modu
lus  ; by use of which, in comparison with the mean in any given
instance, the modulus in that instance is determined.

       W. J. Macquorn Rankine, C.E., F.R.SS. L. & E.                           &c.
       Received      June 14, 1855.
   An Axis of        Elasticity    is any direction    with respect      to which
any kind of elastic force is symmetrical.
   In this paper the deviation of       a molecule of a solid from that con
dition as to volume and figure which         it preserves when free from the
action of external forces, is denoted by the word            " Strain,"   and   the
corresponding effort of the molecule to recover           its free volume and
figure by the word
                          " Stress."
   In devising      a  nomenclature for quantities relating to the theory
of elasticity, strain is denoted in composition by            OXixpis,  and stress
by rdatt.
   Every possible strain of a molecule, when referred to rectangular
axes, may be resolved        into six elementary strains   ;  three    elongations
or linear compressions, and three distortions.          Every possible      stress,
when referred to rectangular axes, may be resolved into six elemen
tary stresses   ;  three normal pressures, and three tangential pressures,
which tend to diminish the corresponding elementary strains.
   The elementary strains being in fact approximately linear func
tions of the elementary stresses, are treated in this investigation as
exactly so.
   The   sum of the six integrals     of the elementary stresses, each taken
with respect      to the corresponding elementary strain         from its actual
amount to zero, is the Potential Energy         of Elasticity,    and is a homo
geneous function of the elementary strains of the second order, and
of twenty-one terms, whose constant coefficients             are here called the
Tasinomic Coefficients, or coefficients of Elasticity.

                                       496
   The principles of the Calculus of Forms, and in particular the
 Umbral Notation of Mr. Sylvester, are applied to the Orthogonal
Transformations of the Tasinomic Coefficients.
    Several functions of these coefficients are determined, called Tasi
nomic Invariants,     which are equal for all systems of orthogonal axes
in the   same solid.
   Certain functions       of the Tasinomic        Coefficients   constitute   the
coefficients of two Tasinomic Ellipsoids, designated respectively as
the Orthotatic and Heterotatic Ellipsoids,           whose axes have the      fol
lowing properties.
                               Orthotatic Axes.
    At  each point   of  an elastic solid there      is one position in which a
cubical molecule may        be cut out,   such,   that  a  uniform dilatation or
condensation    of that molecule by equal elongations or compressions of
its three axes, will produce       no tangential stress      at the faces  of  the
molecule.
   The existence of orthotatic       axes    in a solid constituted of mutu
ally   attracting   and repelling    physical points was first proved by
Mr. Haughton       ;  it is proved in this paper independently of any
hypothesis as to molecular structure or action.
                              Hetbhotatic Axes.
    At  each point   of  an elastic  solid there is     one  position in which   a
cubical molecule may      be cut out,   such, that   if  there be a distortion  of
that molecule    round x (x being any one of its axes) and an equal dis
tortion round y (y being either of its other two axes), the normal stress
on the faces normal to x arising        from    the distortion round x,   will  be
equal   to the tangential stress      around    z arising from the distortion
round y.
   The six coefficients of the Heterotatic Ellipsoid represent parts of
the elasticity of a solid which it is impossible to reduce to attrac
tions and repulsions between points.
   Fifteen constants called the Homotatic Coefficients, which are com
posed    of Tasinomic     Coefficients and their linear functions so con
stituted as to be independent of the Heterotatic Coefficients, are the
coefficients of the fifteen terms of a homogeneous biquadratic function
of the coordinates, which being equated to unity, characterizes the

                                      497
Biquadratic     Tasinomic Surface.      This surface, for solids composed
of physical points, was discovered by Mr. Haughton ; it is here in
vestigated independently of all hypothesis.
   By rectangular       linear transformations,        three   functions     of the
Homotatic     Coefficients may be made to vanish.              Three orthogonal
axes are thus found, which        are called the   Principal Metatatic Axes,
and have the following         property  :   if there    be a   linear elongation
along    any one  of  these axes, and an equal        linear compression       along
any other, no tangential stress      will result   on planes normal to these
two axes.
   In  each of the three planes     of the principal Metatatic        Axes, there
is  a  pair of Diagonal      Metatatic   Axes bisecting the right angles
formed by the pair of principal axes in the same plane.
   In   each plane in an elastic solid, there is a system of two pairs of
metatatic axes, making with each other eight equal angles of 45°.
   Various kinds and degrees of symmetry are pointed out, which the
tasinomic coefficients may have with respect to orthogonal axes.
   The Potential Energy of Elasticity may be expressed as a homo
geneous function of the second order of the Elementary Stresses.
The twenty-one coefficients of this function are called Thlipsinomic
Coefficients.
   The Thlipsinomic       and Tasinomic     Coefficients are related to each
other as Contragredient Systems.
   The Orthogonal       and Diagonal Tasinomic and Thlipsinomic                Axes
coincide.
   For the complete determination of the properties of                 the Homo
tatic Coefficients, it is necessary to refer them to oblique            axes  of  co
ordinates.
   The application of oblique co-ordinates to this purpose is much
facilitated by the employment along with them of three auxiliary
variables called Contra-ordinates.         The contra-ordinates of         a point
R  are the projections      of the radius-vector        OR on the      three  axes.
For rectangular    axes, co-ordinates and contra-ordinates are identical.
The co-ordinates x, y, z       and contra-ordinates        u, v, w  of a point     R
are connected by the equation
                              ux + vy + wz = O R3   .
   As there    are  six independent quantities in the directions of a
system of three      axes   of indefinite obliquity,      there is   a   system of

                                        498
right or oblique axes in every solid for which six of the coefficients
of the characteristic function of the Biquadratic surface disappear,
reducing that function to its canonical form of nine terms. These
three axes are called the
                        Principal Enthytatic Axes.
   Every Enthytatic axis has this property, that        a direct linear elonga
tion or compression      along such an axis, produces a normal stress, and
no oblique or tangential stress on a plane normal to the same axis.
   Every Enthytatic       axis is normal to the Biquadratic       Surface, and
is a line along which the direct elasticity of the body is either a
maximum or a minimum, or in that condition which combines                    the
properties of maximum and minimum.
    It  is probable that the faces or edges of primitive crystalline forms
are normal to      Enthytatic    axes,   and that the planes of cleavage in
crystals are normal to Enthytatic axes of minimum elasticity.
    It is  also probable that the symmetrical summits of crystals cor
respond to Enthytatic axes.
   There are, in every solid, at least the three principal           Enthytatic
Axes, which are normal to the faces of a hexahedron, right or oblique
as the case may be.          In certain    cases  of symmetry of     these  axes
and of the Homotatic        Coefficients, there are Secondary or Additional
Enthytatic Axes, which are determined by the following principles              :
    1.   When    the three principal axes and the Homotatic         Coefficients
are    symmetrical     round a central axis, that axis is an additional
 Enthytatic axis.
    2. When there      are a pair  of orthogonal Enthytatic    axes in a given
 plane, there may be, under certain conditions specified in the paper,
 a pair    of additional or   secondary    axes in that plane, making       with
 each other a pair     of angles bisected by the orthogonal      axes.
    In   the first column of a table, the possible systems       of Enthytatic
 axes are arranged according to a classification and nomenclature of
 their degrees and kinds of symmetry           ; and in the second and third
 columns are stated the primitive crystalline forms to the faces and
 edges    of which such     systems    of axes   are respectively normal,    and
 which embrace all the primitive forms known in crystallography.
    The six Heterotatic        Coefficients   are independent    of the fifteen
 Homotatic Coefficients which determine the Enthytatic axes.

    The  paper   concludes with observations on some real and alleged
differences between the laws of solid elasticity and those                   of the
luminiferous force, — on some hypotheses in connexion with the
wave-theory of light, — and on the refraction of light in crystals as
connected with the symmetry of their Enthytatic axes.

       the Calculating Machine           of M. Scheutz."           Inserted for

    The various applications of mathematics to physical questions, or
to the transactions of common life, continually require the compu
 tation of numerical      results.    At  one    time isolated results have to
be calculated from particular formulae         ;   at another it is required to
 calculate   a series of values of the same analytical formula         ;   in other
 words, to tabulate a function.          It is only in    the latter     case that
 different   instances have so much in common as to permit of the
 application of general methods irrespective of the particular function
 to be calculated.     But   even  in the tabulating        of functions     one  or
 other of two objects may be kept in view.               At  one time a result
 may be arrived at expressed         in  a complicated,      perhaps transcen
 dental, formula, and the mathematician may desire to know merely
 the general progress of the function.              In such   a case   it will    be
 sufficient to calculate values at rather wide intervals, and the mode
 of calculation     must depend     upon the peculiar function.             But at
 other times functions present themselves           which are of such common
 occurrence, or of such practical importance, that it is desirable to
 tabulate them for values of the variable increasing by small steps.
 In  these cases general methods of interpolation          come into use      : it is
 sufficient to perform the calculations directly for comparatively wide
 intervals of the variable, and the intervening values of the function
 can be supplied by the mere addition of differences.

    It is well known that Mr. Babbage was the first person who con
ceived the idea of performing all these systems of additions mechani
cally, and thereby saving both the mental labour and the risk of
error attending their calculation in the ordinary way.             This  idea was
actually carried out, and resulted in the invention of his Difference
Engine. The engine, so far as it has yet been executed, was constructed
at the public expense,      and is now deposited in the Museum of King's
College, London.       The part constructed contains      19 digits and   3 orders
of differences    ; and as all the essential movements are comprised in
this part, a more extended engine would consist merely of the same
members       oftener repeated,    and would     not involve any additional
difficulty    of construction.      It was part of Mr. Babbage's original
design that machinery for printing off the results calculated should
be included in his engine, and some of the mechanism for this purpose
was actually executed.         The portion placed in King's College           con
tains machinery for calculating          only.    It  does not fall within the
province of this report to do more             than mention the Analytical
Engine subsequently invented by Mr. Babbage,                 as the machine     of
M. Scheutz is a Difference Engine, and nothing more.
    A full account of the principles and action of Mr. Babbage's
Difference Engine, but without any details of its mechanism, was
published in the 'Edinburgh Review' for April to                July,  1834.     It
was, as we are informed, the perusal of this paper which induced
M. Scheutz to        set about the invention       of  modes    of mechanically
executing the necessary        changes.    The result was the completion of
the present engine, which has now for some time been in the apart
ments of the Royal Society.              In this machine M. Scheutz has
followed     the general ideas     of Mr. Babbage in the distribution of
digits and differences, and in particular          in throwing     back the dif
ferences    at every alternate order one stage, from whence results the
possibility of acting simultaneously         on all the odd and on all the
even differences, and thereby making the machine advance one stage
by two addition-motions         only  ; whereas otherwise as many separate
addition-motions      would have been necessary as there were orders of
differences retained.        But the mechanism by which the additions
and carriages are      effected in the machine of M. Scheutz is different
from     that of    Mr. Babbage.        The engine is      also   provided with

                                         501
 mechanism for printing, or rather for furnishing stereotype plates of
 the calculated results.
     As M. Scheutz      has taken out a patent for his engine,          it will   be
 unnecessary to give a detailed description of the machinery, which
 may be obtained in the specification, a copy of which has been
 presented to the Royal Society.             It will be sufficient to give an
 idea of its general construction and extent with a view of estimating
 its powers.
     The machine takes in the function          to be tabulated     and the first
 four orders of differences, each to fifteen       digits.    Of  these only the
 first eight (in the case of the function itself) are printed, the others
 being reserved to guard against errors arising from decimal places
 left out.
     The  places of the digits are represented     by fifteen vertical spindles,
 around which, but not usually connected with which, are placed
 horizontal wheels in five separate tiers.         Each wheel has its circum
 ference divided into ten equal parts, and is marked with the digits
 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. In the normal state of the machine the
 numbers on the wheels of the highest tier represent the function
 (a,) to be tabulated, and those on the tiers below represent respect-
                                                                                     •
ively    Ak,_!, A*»,_1,     A.3uI_2, and A4«,_2.      In   each case the digits
by which these numbers are represented run from left to right, as in
print.    The mechanism is such, that by turning a handle continuously
in   one  direction an indefinite succession of movements is produced
which are alternately backwards and forwards.                  The  effect  of the
forward motion is, that the numbers on the third and the fifth tiers
 (or as they may conveniently be called the A2 and A4 tiers) add them
selves respectively to those on the tiers above, altering thereby the
positions of the wheels of the          A1 and A3  tiers, while the wheels of
the A2 and     A4 tiers remain at rest     ; and the backward       motion does
for the    A1 and A3   tiers what the forward motion does for the A2 and
A4   tiers. Thus the numbers on the several tiers will be as follows            : —
At first                               u„    Aa,_1 A2a,_,       A3a,_s    A4a,_s   ;
After   the forward motion      ...  . ux    Au,    A2a,_,                A4a,_a   ;
After the complete motion          . . u,+l Aat     A2a,,      A*vc_i     A4m,_,,
 A4a,_, in the last      term    being written instead of A4at_a, which is

                                         502
allowable, since the fourth differences are supposed              to be constant.
Hence the effect of the complete motion, consisting of one forward
nnd one backward motion, is to make all the numbers advance one
stage   ; and therefore by continuing        to turn the handle the numbers
        u,+2,   uM+a
                       &c,        he calculated in      succession.    According
as these numbers are calculated they are impressed,              by the action of
the machine itself, on      a plate of lead, by means of steel punches, while
a  numerator at the same time impresses              beside   them the values of
the argument x.         These plates are afterwards taken out, and stamped
on an easily fusible alloy just on the point of solidifying, and thus
are    obtained     stereotype plates of the calculated           results,  fit for
printing from.
   In retaining      a given number of decimals, it is usual to add one to
the last figure     if the first digit left out     be 5  or a higher number.
This is    effected    in the machine in the simplest possible manner,
namely by placing the cog which occasions the carriages from the
ninth to the eighth place in the highest tier in such a position that
the carriage takes place when the ninth wheel changes from 4 to 5,
instead of from 9 to 0.
   The principle of the machine is not of          course dependent upon the
circumstance that the radix of the scale of notation commonly em
ployed has the particular value 10         ;  and it would be as easy to con
struct a machine adapted to the senary or duodenary as to the denary
scale.     Not only      so, but the machine actually constructed admits
of being changed very readily from            the denary to the senary scale,
or rather to a mixture of the denary and senary scales, which                    is
required in tabulating        degrees,    minutes,    and   seconds.     For this
purpose it is sufficient to take off the ordinary figure- wheels from
those spindles which are to count by sixes, and put on spare wheels
which are provided, adapted to the senary scale.
   The machine works with           the greatest freedom and         smoothness.
The parts     move with the utmost facility, in fact, quite loosely.            On
this account no amount of dust which it would                     reasonably    be
expected to receive        in any moderate      time seems likely to interfere
with its action.          Besides, it can easily be taken to pieces            and
examined,     if need be.     Those motions which are not the direct con
sequences     of the revolution of the handle acting through a train of
rigid bodies      are performed in consequence          of gravity,   no   springs

                                         503
being employed in the whole construction except two, the office of
which is quite subordinate. When the parts are moved, they remain
in their new places either from their weight or from friction, there
being nothing to disturb them.               This circumstance, which renders
a   wilful derangement of         the machine exceedingly easy, permits of
great simplicity and consequent cheapness of construction ; nor does
the machine seem likely to get out of order if reasonable care be
taken of it.
     The machine is competent to tabulate               to any extent a function
 whose fourth differences are constant, so long as the expression of
 the numerical value of the function does not involve more than eight
 digits.    The   most general form        of such  a function is of course
                                a + bx+cx* + dx'                                      (1)
 Were     the machine restricted to such functions,                  its use would be
 limited indeed      ; its utility must of course depend               on its being ap
 plicable to functions in general, which, except in singular cases, may
 be expressed     within    a limited range of values of the variable x by a
 function     of the above form.        To estimate       the capacities      of  the ma
 chine, or rather of a difference engine in general, whatever may be
 its particular    construction, it will be necessary             to investigate how
  soon the quantities neglected begin to tell in the result.
      Now   these quantities are of two kinds         ;  first, the fifth and higher
 differences; secondly, the decimals of the fifteenth place. The effect
  of these may be examined separately.              We     may always suppose          the
  first spindle to represent the first place of decimals, since it will
  only be necessary       to multiply or divide by some power of 10 should
  that not be the case.
      Suppose the machine set for u,, and its first four differences (or
  to speak more exactly, the differences Au,_l, A*«J_1, A3u,_si
  A4ujr_,), and worked        n periods, so as to give what ought to be «,+„.
   We   have
                                   »A«,+                                              (2);

   and since the machine would give             «2.+n  exactly     if the fourth differ
  ences were constant, the error         (E)   will  be
   — — l.B 2.n 3.n— 4                       n.n — 1 .n— 2.n — 3.n — 4.n— 5 .

  The first term in this expression will usually              be  the most important       ;
  and for practical purposes the expression may be                 still further simpli
  fied.   Ifnbe tolerably large,       the product n     . n—    1 . n— 2 . n — 3 . it— 4
 may be replaced without             material error by the fifth power              of the
 arithmetic     mean      of  the  factors, or by (n — 2)\ Again, if y be the
 variable of which           u is a function, x being merely the numeral
 marking      the number of increments of y, each equal to k, we shall
 have near enough

      In expressing     a number to eight         decimal places, we are always
 liable to an error which             may amount to 5 in the ninth place.
 Hence      10-9x5 maybe regarded              as the greatest allowable            error,
 though in truth the error should not be allowed to amount to this,
 if we wish to        have    the  last figure true to the nearest              decimal.
 Equating then       E   to 10_g   x5, we find

which gives       the greatest number n of times the machine may be
worked without         stopping and fresh setting, so far as the limitation
depends      on the cause of error now under consideration.                     The in
crement of y during the action of the machine, which is equal to nk,
or to (n— 2)k nearly, n being large compared with 2, is therefore
nearly independent of the closeness or wideness of the intervals for
which the value of the function               is required, a given range, so to
speak, of the function being taken in.                Hence, so far as this cause
of limitation is concerned, the utility of the machine will                  be propor
tional to the closeness of the intervals for which it is desired to tabu
late the function.

only four orders of differences, since the effect of omitting the fifth
and higher orders has been already investigated.              Let E,, Ej,  E3, E4

setting the machine.         Then in the    same manner as before these may
without sensible error be regarded as the errors in A«,, A'u.,, A3at,

   If each     of the quantities E,,    E2, E3, E4 be liable to be as great as
 10~l6x5, the last term in this expression will              be the most im
portant   if   n be  considerably greater than 4.       Equating this term to
 10-9 X 5, the greatest allowable error in        E, we find
                                 104)*.       n=126 nearly,
                 »-|=(24x
so that the machine may be worked             about 100 times without       fresh
setting.
   In practice the limitation       may be even less than this     ; for it may
happen that £*uM is smaller, perhaps much smaller, than 10-l6x5,
in which case the limitation will depend upon the absolute value of
A4!/,   or the possible value        10_l6x5 of     E3, as the case may be.
Should the restriction arise from the latter cause, we get by equating
the third term in the second member of (4) to 10~Bx5, n=392
nearly.
   To illustrate     these limitations   by an example, suppose that it was
required to make a table of sines to every minute.             In this  case we
have
         u=siny,   *    *=              = -0002909,     ^.   = cosy.
                                                                   y
                              180x60                    rfy>
Putting for this last differential coefficient its greatest value unity,
and substituting in (3), we get »=196 nearly.                The fourth differ
ence is very nearly equal to — k* sin y, which may contain figures              in
the fifteenth place, so that n=126 is about the greatest allowable
value of     n  in consequence     of the restriction arising from decimals

                                          506
left out, which in this example is what limits the working.               Should
the intervals be a good deal wider than 1', as 5', it would then be
the omission of fifth differences that would impose the limit, for
the greatest allowable range on this account would be nearly the
same    as before,     or about 3°, which would contain only thirty-six
values to be calculated.           Should it happen that both causes of error
were about equally restrictive, it must be remembered               that the cor
responding errors in            u, would   be  comparable with one another,
and might be added together;               and in this case it may easily be
shown that 126        x2"',      or 106 nearly, is somewhat inferior to the
greatest allowable value of n.            Should eight figures not be required
 to be retained, but seven, six, or five be sufficient, the last one, two,
 or three of the first eight spindles might be used for calculating
 instead of printing      ;   and since the greatest allowable value of n, so
far as depends on omission of decimals, varies nearly as the fourth
root of the greatest allowable error in a,, that value would be in
creased in the ratio of 1 to the fourth root of 10, or 100, or 1000,
and from 126 would become                224, or 398, or 708.      The greatest
allowable value of          n   as regards the omission     of fifth differences
would increase in a somewhat slower ratio, since it varies nearly as
the fifth root of the greatest allowable error in          uz-
                                                                If, for example,
it were   196,  it would       become  311, or 492, or 780.
    The   above   is a fair specimen of the application of the machine.
The particular function chosen is, it is true, a familiar one, which
 has been long since tabulated, but it is not the worse fitted for
an example on that account.               It  may be seen at once how much
 mental labour and risk of error is saved by the use of such a machine,
 when tables have to be calculated to close intervals.                The whole
 exertion of mind is confined to calculating the function and its dif
 ferences   at wide intervals, say for every 100th or 60th number to be
 tabulated, and setting the machine.            Even this exertion (except so
 far as relates to the setting, which is easy,) might be reduced to one
 half, if desired, by setting the machine to calculate backwards as
 well as forwards.            In order to give in succession the numbers

  cession the numbers ur,                     . . . the machine would simply
  have to be set to

  D'=D-',     and   A'=D'- 1 =D"'        - 1 =   -D-IA,      so that the required
  numbers are
          a,    -Aa,       A*D-Iax      -A3D_,a,          A4D_\,
 or
          u,    -Am,       A\.,         -A'b,-i           A4a,_s.
 Hence the numbers on the top, A*, and              A4 tiers are the same as for
 the forward calculation, while those         on the    A  and A3 tiers are the
 arithmetical complements of the numbers found on those tiers after
 the machine has made one complete              movement in calculating for
 wards from a,.        The printing      part, however, is not adapted to
 such a change    :  the numbers would be printed off correctly, but in a
 wrong order    ;  so that unless some reversing movement were intro
duced into the      printing part,  the printed results would only serve to
set types from.
    In the example     chosen above, and in similar cases, the differences
required for setting the machine would be calculated from their
mathematical expressions.          It might, however, be required to tabu
late for small intervals    a  function which had been given by observa
tion for larger ones, or to tabulate          a   mathematical function of so
complicated a form that the differences could not be got directly
without great trouble.        In such   a case there would be no difficulty     ;
the differences for the smaller intervals would first have to be calcu
lated from those for the larger ones by formulae in finite differences,
and then the setting and       working of the machine would           proceed  as
before.
    It must  be confessed,    however, that except in the case of mathe
matical tables like those of sines, cosines, logarithms, &c, it is not
ordinarily required to tabulate functions to intervals at all approach
ing, in closeness,     to those in    the example selected.          Hence it is
mainly, as it seems to us, in the computation of mathematical tables
that the machine of M. Scheutz would come into use.                     The most

important        of such tables have long       since been     calculated   ;  but
various others could be suggested which it might be worth while to
construct, could it be done with such ease and cheapness                 as would
be afforded by the use of the machine.            It has been suggested to us
too, and we think with good reason, that the machine would be very
 useful even for the mere reprinting of old tables, because it could
 calculate and print more        quickly than a good compositor could set
 the types, and that without risk of error.

     P.S. Some time since, I received from Mr. Babbage, to whom                    I
 had written for information on one point connected with his machine,
 a letter, written      subsequently to his first answer, in which he said
 that he had forgotten to mention an addition to his machine which
  enabled     it to calculate a function when the last differences, instead
 of being constant, were dependent on the functions then under cal
 culation in the other parts of the machine, provided the coefficients
 of the variable part were small enough to be expressed by a mode
 rate number of digits.         This was especially designed for the calcu
 lation of astronomical       tables, where  a  difficulty occurs in the appli
  cation of      a   machine with constant      differences, arising     from the
  circumstance that in the case of functions of short period the omitted
  differences soon become sensible even though the coefficients be but
  small.      Mr. Babbage did not then recollect that this contrivance
  was accessible to the public, but in a subsequent letter he pointed
  out that such was the case.         The following     is an extract from this
  letter  : —
     "  1st.    The portion at Somerset House contains             axes   specially

 employment of an exterior whirlpool           ;    a sum    of £50 from the
 Government Grant of 1853 was allotted by the Council of the Royal
 Society in aid of the inquiry.         The experiments,     as originally  con
 templated, have been arranged and conducted by                  Mr. Thomson,
 and the present Report       of his progress is    here  inserted by order of
 the President and Council       for the information of the Fellows.]
    In last year's Report of the Committee it was stated, that an appa
 ratus for making experiments on the friction of discs revolving in
 water had been constructed, and that experiments had been com
menced     with it.    I have now further to state respecting the experi
ments for which       that apparatus was adapted,       that   I have since  got
them completed and carefully arranged for the purpose of obtaining
from them laws applicable for practical use.
    I now beg to lay before the Royal Society, as         a  brief statement    of
the most essential results, the following general equation to show
the relation between the velocity        of revolution of     the disc, the dia
meter of the disc, and the mechanical work consumed in friction              : —
                                   2
                                       90,000'
in which rf=diameter of the disc in feet,
            y=number of revolutions of        the disc per minute,
       and  z=number of foot-pounds of mechanical work consumed
                    per minute.
    This equation is     based on experiments which range for the most
part between the limits yrf=192           and yrf=518, and may be used
with confidence, as sufficiently correct for most practical purposes,
if  the product of the number of revolutions             per minute and the
diameter of the disc in feet be between those limits.               It is to   be
observed    that the friction     is slightly affected   by the width of the
water space within the case, and the coefficient 90,000 stated in the
formula above is, for simplicity in the present brief report, taken
between the coefficients obtained by two sets of experiments with
different widths.       A full report on the experiments already           made,

                                           511
  explaining the manner of conducting them and stating the detailed
  results, would be rather lengthened, and would require drawings
 and diagrams, for all of which          I  have carefully preserved    the requi
 site data     ; but before proceeding to put these in form suitable to be
 submitted to the Royal Society,             I am desirous    of prosecuting the
 remainder of the very interesting and important experiments which
 have been        entrusted to me, — that portion of the whole, namely,
 which relates especially to centrifugal pumps.             I  have also to state,
 that   if my engagements permit, I should          be desirous of proceeding
 with    a  renewed and more extended set of experiments on the fric
 tion of discs, with an apparatus depending on the same leading
 principle as that which I have already used, — a principle which on
 trial has been found remarkably well suited for the desired purpose.
 For the attainment of greater accuracy and of a wider range of the
 experiments, it seems to me that no better method of procedure
 could be adopted, than to follow the same leading principles, with
 an apparatus        of rather   more   refined construction,     involving  such
improvements in details as have been suggested by the experience
 gained in the course of the experiments already made, and for the
 sake of greater steadiness        of motion, worked by steam power instead
of   the hand of an operator.          Should   I have it in my power to con
duct this renewed set of experiments, a detailed account of them
will   be preferable to a detailed account of those already made.
    In   respect    to the experiments on Centrifugal           Pumps,  I have to
say that      I  have   prepared plans for an experimental apparatus on
principles which        1  consider are peculiarly well suited for the attain
ment of useful and accurate results, and that             I   intend to proceed
with the experiments as soon as my engagements shall permit.
    I  have further to state, that from the Experimental            Fund of £50
granted by the Royal Society, the entire outlay as yet incurred has
been    £6    5s. 9d  ,   leaving a balance of £43 14s. 3d. for the more
extended experiments yet remaining to be made.

to the Council to be reinstated, alleging that he     " had inadvertently
omitted to pay his subscription at the proper period."         Notice was
therefore given that the question of       Mr. Beaumont's re-admission
would be put to the ballot at the ensuing Meeting of the Society.

I. The   reading of Dr. Faraday's paper, "Experimental Researches
      in Electricity — Thirtieth Series," was resumed and con
      cluded.
    The following is an abstract             : —
   *
      § 38.    Constancy       of differential magnecrystallic force        in different
media. — That        a magnecrystal formed into a sphere
                                                                     (or some equiva
lent shape, so that mere length should have no
                                                                influence) sets with
the same force in the magnetic field, whatever the magnetic nature
of the medium around it, has been shown generally, and for a few
cases, on former occasions.               The author     was under the necessity      of
verifying    and enlarging          the old results     ; and upon employing the
following magnecrystals, namely bismuth, tourmaline, carbonate of
         * Series    XXIX.   is published  in the Phil. Trans, for 1852, p. 137.

                                            525
iron, red ferroprussiate of potassa, and also compressed             bismuth, sur
rounded in succession by the following media, — phosphorus, alcohol,
oil, camphine, water, air, and saturated solution of protosulphate of
iron, he found the result to be the same as before.                   The  mode of
estimating the set was as follows            : — The selected crystal being   sus
pended     in the magnetic field by a torsion-wire,            right-handed force
was then slowly applied by the revolutions             of the torsion-head above,
until  the crystal being gradually carried round, attained that position
at which any additional torsion-force would cause it to advance sud
denly and considerably          ; this position was called the upsetting point     ;
then left-handed torsion was put on until the like point was attained
  n the opposite side     :  the amount of the revolution of the torsion-index
from one upsetting point to the other, minus the angle between the
upsetting points, was considered as the measure of the set of the
crystal under the constant magnetic force employed.
    As  the setting force of a crystal remained constant for any sur
rounding medium, it was evidently possible to select a crystal and                a
medium such, that in one position the crystal would be attracted,
and   in another, at right angles to the first, be repelled in the
same medium.           This    case was realized with      the paramagnetic red
ferroprussiate of potassa and a solution of sulphate of iron, and also
with the diamagnetic crystal carbonate of lime and diluted alcohol.
A crystal    was sought for amongst the ferrocarbonates of lime having
this relation to the assumed natural zero presented by a vacuum or
carbonic acid     ;  but this case was not realized.
    § 39.    Action    of   heat on     magnecrystals. — When magnecrystals,
subjected to the same constant magnetic force, were raised or lowered
to different temperatures,           it was   found that the setting force was
affected   ;  and    at all temperatures from 0°           F. upwards the    force
diminished as the temperature became higher.                    Thus the torsion-
force of a crystal of bismuth at 92° being 175, was at 279° dimi
nished to 82       ;  that of a tourmaline,        by passing     from   the tem
perature of 79° to 289°, was so far diminished               ;  that the power at
the lower temperature was nearly double that at the higher.                      A
like result occurred with carbonate of iron, and also with com
pressed bismuth.          In all    these   cases the bodies resumed their first
full power on returning to lower temperatures, nor was there any
appearance of magnetic charge in any part of the range of observa-
                                                                     8a2

                                      526
tions.   Between 32° and 300° the force of bismuth appeared             to alter
by regular equal degrees     ; but with tourmaline and carbonate of iron
the change was greatest for an equal number of degrees at the lower
temperatures.      At  a  full red   heat,   however, both tourmaline and
calcareous spar retained a portion        of their magnecrystallic force or
condition,   and so   did carbonate of iron up to that temperature at
which it was decomposed.
    It is known that pure calcareous spar points with its optic axis
 equatorially,   but that calcareous spar containing            a trace  of iron
points with its optic axis axially.         Calcareous spar retains its mag
netic characters at very high temperatures, but carbonate of iron and
oxide of iron lose almost the whole of their magnetic force at a dull
red heat.      It was therefore expected that        a ferrocarbonate   of lime
crystal might become absolutely reversed in condition              by change of
temperature, and this was found to be the case          :  at low temperatures
 the optic axis pointed axially, and at high temperatures equatorially          ;
and that through any number of changes, as the temperature of the
crystal was alternately lowered and raised.
    § 40. Effect   of heat upon the absolute magnetic        force of  bodies. —
 Results were     sought for, by which the magnetic force of bodies,
already examined in the condition of magnecry stals, might be com
pared with the whole paramagnetic or diamagnetic force of the same
bodies taken in the granular or amorphous state            ;  but they were not
 satisfactory.    The carbonate of iron gave the most distinct results ;
 and in its case the change of power by change of temperature was
 not the same for the two conditions.           An examination of the three
 metals, iron, nickel, and cobalt, at temperatures between 0° and
 300° F., gave a very interesting          result, which     the author is not
 aware has as yet been noticed.         As the temperature rises, the force
 of the nickel diminishes, the force of the iron remains constant, the
force of the cobalt increases      ;   these   facts  suggest that there is a
temperature at which the magnetic force is a maximum, and above
 or below which it diminishes.           The order with the three bodies
accords perfectly with that in which they lose the chief amount of
their magnetic power, for much loss occurs with nickel at the tem
perature of boiling oil, with iron at a dull red heat, and with cobalt
at a temperature near that of melting copper.

    These results will be obvious at          a  glance  ; but a few remarks
 upon the instruments employed, and upon the degree of reliance to
 be placed upon them, may not be uninteresting.
    The dry- and wet-bulb thermometers (for which we were indebted
 to the kindness of Prof. Cherriman, Director of the Magnetic Ob
 servatory, Toronto) were made by Negretti and Zambra, and their
 index errors were ascertained, above 32° by Mr. Glaisher, and below
 32° by ourselves, by comparison with a Kew standard.                  The divi
 sions upon these thermometers were too small to read                  0°'l with
 great accuracy     ; and in discussing our observations at low tempera
 tures, we were in consequence         obliged to reject such as would, with
 an error of 0°- 1 in the reading, introduce a considerable error into
 the factor.
    You will     observe    that the table does not extend below —16°,
 although we have repeatedly every winter the mercury below —20°,
 and occasionally below — 30°.            The only thermometer, however,
 which we could trust as a wet-bulb in investigations so delicate was
 not graduated below — 16°.
    For obtaining the dew-point by direct observation, we used the
 condensing hygrometer invented by           M. Regnault.
    We obtained dew with this beautiful instrument               at all tempera
 tures (limited only by the graduation of the thermometer — 35°),
 the only requisites when the thermometer is very low being time
 and  pure ether*.        I  can testify from experience that this hygro
 meter obviates all the disadvantages of Daniell's, which           M. Regnault
 enumerates     in his hygrometrical researches.
    In order to show      the reliance that may be placed upon our results,
 we have put opposite each factor in the table the probable error and
 measure  of precision of the single      data (from which the factor     (/)  was
 derived), and also the probable error, measure of precision, and limits
 of certainty of the adopted factor.         The nomenclature       and notation
 are  thus employed by Encke in his Memoir on the Method of
 Least Squares.
    The  measure      of precision (A),    as was indeed to have been ex
pected, decreases with the temperature.             This fact is not however
of  so much importance as might at first appear.
   * The ether we employed     below —20° was the first that passed over, resulting
from the distillation of washed ether with quicklime.

                                          530
     For   the dew-point is given by the equation, —
                                    T=t-f(t-t').
where      (T)     is the temperature of the dew-point,         (/) that of   the air,
(f—          the difference between the dry- and wet-bulb thermometers,
and   (/)        the factor whose value is given in the table.
   Now taking the temperatures 42° and 22°, it appears from the
table that the probable error of (/) for a single observation is at the
latter     temperature three times greater than at the former.                        But
   —              on an average about three times as great at 42° as at 22°.
(f     /')   is
Hence the probable error of the dew-point at both temperatures                         is
very nearly the same.
     We    have extended       our table to 51° for the purpose of comparison
with      the
                 " Greenwich factors."      I    must however remark, that        it   is
probable that the factors, which we have given above 40°, are rather
greater than they would have been had the observations discussed
extended through a longer space of time, the majority at these tem
peratures having been              taken last spring, when the air was very
remarkably dry;    and experience shows that when (f—            un        /')   is
usually great, the deduced factor, instead of being more accurate,                     is
generally much too large.
     As    an instance,    I   may cite an observation taken on April 29th,
when the temperature of the air was 43°-               6,   that of evaporation was
31°-6, and that of the dew-point 3°-2.                 The fraction of saturation
on this occasion was Jqq<
                               19
                                     ^    the factor derived from this observa
tion was 3-36          ;   this being much the largest deviation           from the
adopted mean 2-53.
     The     cause    of this discrepancy   is   doubtless owing to the heat that
the wet-bulb thermometer derives from the radiation of surrounding
objects      ;    and were observations sufficiently numerous,       it   might con
duce to accuracy were the factors calculated for every degree                          of
difference in the value of (/—f').
  We purpose instituting comparison between two wet-bulb ther
                                     a
mometers placed in similar boxes, the one box coated with lamp
black, the other with          a   polished metallic surface.
     Below 32° our results do not appear             to coincide with the factors
deduced          from the Greenwich observations        ;   and the causes of these
discrepancies        I   must leave to time.

                                         531
   As, however, we have had considerable experience at these tempe
ratures,     I may perhaps      be doing     service to observers in bringing
before their notice two causes          of error, to which we    have found our
selves particularly      liable when the thermometer is near 32°.
    1st.   If the air is a little above, and has been below 32°, there          will
frequently be a small button of ice at the foot of the wet-bulb ther
mometer, which is not easily perceived, and which will keep it at
32° when the temperature of evaporation is really above that point.
    2ndly.     It is well known that under certain circumstances water
may be       cooled below 32° without freezing ; and an example will
perhaps best show the error which this fact may occasion.
    Let    us suppose     that the temperature of the air is 27°, and that
when the thermometer is wetted it sinks to 26°, and then rises.
Should it rise very slowly, or not at all, the probability              is that 26°
is the true temperature of evaporation, but             if rapidly, the rise may
be due to the conversion of the water into ice          ; and  it will  be prudent
 to observe whether or not the thermometer again commences to sink.
    We     have frequently observed       this phenomenon, and       I am quite at
 a loss to what to ascribe its uncertainty.
    It  has occurred both in a high        wind and   a calm (the thermometers
 are protected from the        full force of  the wind), and  it  also appeared  to
 be quite uncertain at what temperature the water might freeze.
    I  am obliged to admit that the limits          of certainty of the factors
 below zero are not quite so close as          could be desired. This is partly
 attributable to our being obliged to reject many observations made
 with    a  thermometer which was broken before its index-errors were
 fully ascertained     ;  but  Mr. Campbell and I must claim the indul
 gence of those        who know        the difficulty   of taking      observations
 requiring so much time and accuracy at such temperatures, and fre
 quently at six o'clock in the morning.

                          Communicated by William Allen Miller, M.D., F.R.S.
                          Received October 27, 1855.
                                          Solubility       of the Sulphate of Baryta.
     The author                       observes          that sulphate of baryta is not an insoluble
salt, as is generally admitted, for he has found that 1000 grs. of nitric
acid, of spec. grav.                         1-   167, are capable of dissolving 2 grs. of sulphate
of baryta                      ;   and what renders the knowledge                           of this fact still more
useful in analytical chemistry is, that the insolubility of this salt is
affected even by the weakest nitric or hydrochloric                                                 acids   ;    for whilst
0-062 gr. of sulphate of baryta only requires 1000 grs. of nitric acid,
of   spec. grav. 1-032, to hold                                  it in solution, the            same quantity of salt
requires 50-000 grs. of pure distilled water to dissolve it.
     What is not less useful to know                                      is,   that the solubility of sulphate
of baryta                     is    affected in    a     higher degree by the bulk of the acid than
by its strength.    The two following tables, taken from amongst
many others contained in the paper, will not only illustrate this fact,
but will also give an insight into the way in which the experiments
were conducted.                             The first table illustrates the influence which in
creasing bulks of the same nitric acid exert on the formation of sul
phate of baryta, and the second table the action which increasing
strengths of acid have                             —

   These tables clearly show the influence which                             a given strength
of nitric acid         has on the       solubility of       the sulphate         of baryta     ;  for
there is a precipitate in three minutes in all the jars of the first
table, whilst we have                a precipitate        only in the first four jars of
Table     II.
   Another fact which is observed in these tables is, that whilst 240
divisions of the alkalimeter                of nitric      acid,    spec.    grav. 1-167, are
capable      of dissolving, or preventing the formation of, 4-46 grs. of
sulphate of baryta, 240 divisions of an acid, of spec. grav. 1-032,
only retained in solution 0-086 gr.                   It   follows from these facts, that
in future       the practice      of rendering liquors acid with nitric or hydro
chloric acids,         must be discontinued when sulphates are to be deter
mined, or separated from chromates, phosphates, &c.
                       Influence     of Mass     on Chemical Affinity.
   The     researches        of the author, to illustrate               the    influence which
mass exerts on chemical affinity, are extensive                       ;  a few of the results
arrived at are here given.
   The following table will clearly show the marked influence which
increasing volumes of nitric acid have in preventing the formation of
sulphate of baryta           : —

   Thus in this table               we perceive, that as the bulk of acid increases,
more time is required for a precipitate                              to appear, although there is
a large excess            of substance employed on the quantity necessary to
give an instantaneous precipitate                         ;   and     it is curious to      observe     how
wide is the space of time in each successive                                  jar for    a precipitate to
appear, and in jars numbers                       9 and 10 no           deposits were formed after
twenty-four           hours.       As the quantity of precipitate                     decreased      rapidly
in each successive jar, they were gathered, and their amount deter
mined with due care; and these are the facts observed: —

    The results contained in this table, especially                                   those    in the last
column, clearly show the influence of mass on chemical affinity, for
there is no difference in any of the jars excepting the increasing bulk
of the acid;           and    still   we have in          jar No.        1 onlyO'591 of sulphate of
baryta dissolved per 1000 grs. of acid, whilst                                       we have 2-099 in

    But the relative bulk of acid is not                   the only influence which affects
the affinity of sulphuric acid for baryta, as the relative quantities of
nitrate of baryta and sulphate of potash put in presence also exert
an action.         This fact is illustrated by the following results, taken
from three different tables, in which the same quantities of acid were
used, but different proportions of salts                      : —

  III. " Results    of the Examination of certain Vegetable Products
        from India." — Parti.       By John Stenhouse,LL.DvF.R.S.
        Received November 14, 1855.
                                  (Abstract.)
     Through the kindness of my        esteemed     friend Dr. Royle,    I have
 been permitted to select such vegetable products from the extensive
 collection at the India House as seemed most likely to repay the
 trouble    of investigation.    My attention, during         the last   twelve
 months, has been chiefly directed to three of these vegetable sub
 stances  ;  and the results of their examination       I now take the liberty
 of submitting to the Royal Society, to         be followed    by those of the
 others as they may be completed.
                               Daiisca cannabina.
    The first of    these  substances which      I examined consisted of a
 quantity of the roots of the Daiisca cannabina,          from Lahore, where
 this plant is employed to dye silk of a fast yellow colour.                The
 roots, which had been cut into pieces about 6 or          8 inches long, were
 from  a  half to three-quarters of an inch in thickness.          They had a
 deep  yellow colour.     A decoction of the leaves of the Datisca canna
 bina was examined by Braconnot          in 1816, who discovered in it         a
crystallizable    principle,  to which    he  gave    the name of datiscine.
Braconnot, of course, did not subject this substance to analysis, but
he described its appearance and properties in an exceedingly accu
rate manner*.        The observations of Braconnot had fallen into such
entire oblivion, however, that for many years past, we find in most
of the larger systems of chemistry the term datiscine used            as syno
nymous with inuline.           Thus in Brande's ' Chemistry,'          vol.  ii.
p. 1168, we find it stated that a variety of names had been given to
inuline, such as     " dahline, datiscine," &c.
    The bruised roots were extracted in       a  Mohr's apparatus by long-
continued digestion with wood-spirit.          The liquor obtained, which
had a dark brown colour, was concentrated by distilling off             a  por
tion of the wood-spirit.      The brown syrupy liquid remaining in the
retort, on being poured into open vessels            and standing for some
               * Annates de Chimie et de Physique, 1816, Hi. 277.

                                          537
time, deposited a resinous matter containing merely traces of a cry
stalline substance.         When this syrupy liquid, however, was treated
with about half its bulk of hot water, the greater portion of the
brown resin was rapidly deposited, and the mother-liquor                      having
been    poured off and left to spontaneous evaporation, deposited a
considerable      quantity      of an imperfectly        crystallizable   substance
resembling grape-sugar.            These crystals are datiscine containing a
considerable amount of resinous matter.                  The datiscine, however,
is rendered perfectly pure by treatment with a solution of gelatine,
to remove any trace of tannic acid, and repeated crystallizations out
of weak spirits of wine.
    Properties     of Datiscine. — Datiscine,          when    pure,   is  perfectly
colourless.      It  is very soluble     in alcohol,   even   in the cold, boiling
alcohol dissolving any amount of it.             By slow spontaneous       evapora
tion, its alcoholic        solutions yield small silky needles arranged in
groups.     Cold water      does not dissolve much        of it, but it is tolerably
soluble in boiling water, the hot solutions on cooling depositing it
in shining scales.
    Datiscine    is not very soluble in ether        ;  but an ethereal solution,
 when evaporated, yielded larger crystals than were obtained by any
 other method.        On adding water to an alcoholic solution of datis
cine, no precipitate is immediately obtained, unless the solution is
 greatly   concentrated       ; but on standing,        very pure, pale yellow-
 coloured crystals of datiscine separate.
    When datiscine is heated to about             180°   C,   it melts, and    if the
 heat be increased, it burns, evolving an odour of caramel, and leaves
 a voluminous       charcoal.       If  datiscine be heated in a close vessel
 while a stream of dry air is slowly passed over it, a small quantity
 of  a crystalline   substance sublimes.        Datiscine and its solutions have
 a very bitter taste     ;  and though it does not produce any change on
 test-paper,   I think there is reason to regard it          as a feebly acid body.
    It dissolves in solutions of the fixed alkalies         and ammonia, also      in
lime- and baryta-water.            The addition of an acid to        these solutions
 causes the precipitation        of  the datiscine.
    The   aqueous     solution of datiscine is precipitated          by neutral and
 basic acetates of lead, and chloride of tin.             These precipitates have
 a  bright yellow colour.            Salts of copper produce greenish, and
 those of peroxide of iron brownish-green precipitates.                      In con

                                         538
 sequence    of  the lead salts forming such gelatinous precipitates, they
 could not be employed for determining the equivalent of datiscine.
    Action    of dilute Sulphuric Acid        on Datiscine.  — When     an aqueous
 solution of datiscine is boiled for a few minutes with very dilute sul
phuric acid, it deposits a crystalline           substance.    On examining the
solution    filtered from the crystals, very distinct            evidences    of the
presence     of sugar were obtained.           These experiments show there
fore that datiscine, like salicine and similar bodies, belongs to the
class   of glucosides, and is        a  copulated      compound      of sugar and
another substance which I shall call " datiscetine."
   Datiscetine.    —Datiscetine      in   its   general   appearance and pro
perties closely      resembles     datiscine, but on a closer          examination
these   two substances are found to differ essentially both in com
position and properties.          Datiscetine when pure assumes           the form
of fine needles which are nearly colourless.              It is easily soluble in
alcohol, a hot alcoholic solution, on cooling, depositing the greater
portion in crystalline groups.          It  is almost insoluble     in water, con
sequently datiscetine is precipitated           from its alcoholic    solutions   by
the addition of water.         It dissolves in ether in almost any quantity,
and is deposited on the evaporation of that liquid in needles. These
properties of datiscetine enable         us to obtain     it in  a tolerably pure
state,  even     when very impure datiscine            is employed in its pre
paration.
   Properties      of Datiscetine. — Datiscetine         has   no taste.     When
heated   it melts like datiscine, but the heat required is much higher
than for that body.        It recrystallizes     on cooling.   By operating very
cautiously, a portion of the datiscetine may be             sublimed. The sub
limate, however, appears to be altered datiscetine.                     Datiscetine
when burned does not emit the odour of caramel.                        Datiscetine,
like datiscine, dissolves in alkaline          solutions, and is reprecipitated
by the addition of an acid.          An alcoholic solution of      acetate of lead
added to an alcoholic solution         of datiscetine produces      a deep   yellow
precipitate, which can be easily washed both by alcohol and water.
This precipitate therefore was subjected to analysis, and from the
results obtained,       the formula      C.w H8    0M+ 2PbO was calculated,
which    agrees     with the formula         (C^ H10 012)      derived from      the
analysis of datiscetine.
   Analysis    of Datiscine. — It is difficult to calculate         a formula for

                                          539
  datiscine,    the numbers of which shall agree with those               found by
  analysis.     When, however,         the decomposition       of datiscine     into
  datiscetine and sugar is taken into consideration, it seems probable
  that the formula for datiscine is
                     Datiscetine +      sugar     = datiscine
                     C30 H10  012-f  C12 H12 0,2=0,2    Hjj 02r
     If  the formula        H22 024 be correct, the decomposition          of datis
  cine by dilute sulphuric acid would be analogous to that of salicine
  when treated in the same way.
     Dilute hydrochloric       acid, like dilute   sulphuric   acid, decomposes
  datiscine, converting it into datiscetine and sugar.             On boiling an
  aqueous     solution   of pure datiscine for    some hours, traces      of sugar
  could be detected, thus showing that        a  small portion of the datiscine
 had been decomposed.
     It  has been already shown that datiscine           dissolves in cold so
 lutions of potash without decomposition.             When boiled, however,
 with a strong solution of potash for some time, decomposition takes
 place, and the precipitate, thrown down by the addition of an acid,
 has    all the properties of datiscetine.        In this respect, therefore,
 datiscine agrees with tannin and similar glucosides, which yield the
 same products when acted upon by acids and alkalies.                   Yeast and
 emulsine appeared to exert no action on solutions of datiscine.
    Action    of Nitric Acid    on Datiscine   and Datiscetine.   — Cold nitric
 acid of the ordinary strength acts violently upon datiscetine, brown
 vapours are disengaged, and a resinous               substance     is  produced,
 which     is ultimately    dissolved, forming     a dark red liquid,       which,
 when evaporated,       yields crystals of nitropicric   acid.
    Datiscine     treated in the same way yields nitropicric           and oxalic
acids.
    When datiscine is boiled with dilute nitric acid it dissolves, and
the solution obtained, when cooled, deposits pale yellow crystals,
which agree in every way with the properties ascribed to nitrosali-
cylic acid.
    On allowing datiscine to stand in contact with dilute nitric acid
in the cold it gradually dissolves, the solution, when left to eva
porate     in vacuo,    depositing    a mixture    of oxalic    and    nitropicric
acids.

                                    540
   Action   of Potash  on Datiscine and Dutiscetine. — It was stated     in  a
previous part of this paper that datiscine and datiscetine dissolve in
cold solutions of the alkalies without decomposition, and that datis
cine, when boiled with potash, is decomposed with the formation of
datiscetine.    It only remained, therefore, to try     the action of fused
hydrate of potash.       Datiscetine,  when added in small successive
portions to fused hydrate of potash, assumed a deep orange colour,
and then dissolved     with the evolution of hydrogen      gas.   When the
disengagement of hydrogen had ceased, the mass was dissolved in
water and supersaturated with hydrochloric        acid.   A partly resinous
substance separated, which, by sublimation, yielded perfectly colour
less, long crystals closely resembling     benzoic acid.      Their solution
in water on the addition of perchloride of iron gave that deep violet
tint which disappears on the addition of hydrochloric acid, and is          so
characteristic of salicylic acid.
   Action   of Chromic Acid    on Datiscetine. — On distilling datiscetine
with bichromate of potash and sulphuric acid a liquid came over,
containing no oily drops, but having the smell of salicylous acid,
and which, when tested        with a persalt of iron,    formed a purple-
coloured solution characteristic of that acid.
    It follows therefore, I think, from the experiments already de
tailed, that datiscine, like salicine, phloridzine, &c, is a glucoside,
and that it approaches nearer to salicine than any other glucoside,
with   the exception of populine, yet known.
    I will conclude this account of datiscine by proposing the follow
ing practical application.      As is well known, the colouring matter
of madder, when boiled with dilute sulphuric acid, is changed into
 sugar and garancine, a new dye-stuff, which, for many purposes, is
found superior to that originally present in the madder.             Within
 the last twelve months       Mr. Lieshing, by treating the colouring
 matters in weld and quercitron bark with dilute sulphuric acid, has
 resolved them into new colouring        matters, which     are  but slightly
 soluble in water, and are found nearly three times more powerful as
 dye-stuffs than the original colouring     matters from which they had
 been produced.
    As datiscine, when boiled with dilute sulphuric          acid, undergoes
 a perfectly   similar  transformation,  being resolved into sugar        and
 datiscetine, which     has  a much   higher   colouring    power than the

                                      541
datiscine which has produced it,       I  have not the least doubt that       silk
 dyers, who may hereafter employ solutions of datisca cannabina,             will
find it highly advantageous to convert their datiscine into datiscetine
by boiling it with dilute sulphuric acid.
                       Oil of  the Ptychotis    Ajowan.
    The Ptychotis Ajowan is        an  umbelliferous      plant well known in
 India for its aromatic and carminative properties.             When its    seeds
are distilled with water they readily yield between five and six per
cent, of an essential oil resembling in smell that of oil of thyme.
When this oil is left in shallow         vessels to spontaneous evaporation
at low temperatures, it deposits a large quantity of beautiful crystals,
which are identical with the stearopten brought from India by the
late Dr. Stocks, and described by me in a short notice in the De
                          '
cember Number of the        Pharmaceutical       Journal' for    1854.
    The crude oil was rectified, and the portion which               came    over
between 160° C. and 164° C. was collected separately and carefully
rectified over sodium.      Its boiling-point was found to be           172° C.,
and its composition isomeric      with oil of turpentine, namely
                             C10 H8   or       H16.
    The stearopten obtained from the less volatile portion of the oil
was purified, and formed large flat rhombohedral crystals, which have
been carefully measured      by Professor Miller of Cambridge.             When
subjected to analysis it gave the formula
                      CjoH1402 or CjoH1,              HO.
   In the notice of the stearopten of this oil which           appeared   in the
'
  Pharmaceutical    Journal,'     from     the   examination      of the small
quantity    then at my disposal, a different           formula was deduced,
which     I  now withdraw,      and   substitute     the preceding      formula,
C.x H14 02, in its stead.
    When the crystalline      stearopten is digested for eight or nine
days with the strongest nitric acid, it is gradually converted into              a
crystallizable  acid, apparently containing         no nitrogen.      This acid
is but slightly soluble even in boiling water, but is deposited                 in
needles on the cooling of the solution.          It is very soluble in alcohol
and ether, from which it is deposited in crystals.               Both its silver
and its baryta salts are crystallizable, and appear very stable.                It
                                                                 3 b 2

                                          542
 seems to me to be a new acid, and               this  I   hope   soon to be able to
 ascertain.
     When the stearopten is gently warmed with oil of vitriol it
 dissolves, and, on cooling, solidifies into a crystalline mass.                   This
 new compound, which is a copulated acid, dissolves                     readily in hot
 water, and,       on cooling, is deposited in large scaly crystals, of               a
 mother-of-pearl       lustre.     It forms both      a     crystallizable   lead and
 baryta salt.
    When       the  stearopten is distilled with a mixture of peroxide of
 manganese        and  sulphuric    acid, it yields a substance           exceedingly
analogous in almost every respect to the thymoil obtained by Lalle-
 mande      by subjecting      the stearopten of oil of thyme              to   similar
treatment.         As the details of Lallemande's experiments have not
yet been      published, it would be premature to pronounce with abso
lute confidence on the identity of the stearoptens from the Ptychotis
and oil of thyme        ; but  if not identical,    as   I  rather apprehend they
are, they are certainly extremely similar bodies*.
  Gum     of  the Gardenia lucida, Roxb. (the Decamalee             Gumof Scinde).
    The specimen of this gum             on which     I    operated    was  evidently
very old.        It formed   a hard, dry mass,        of    a dark brown       colour,
with numerous patches of a greenish-yellow matter disseminated
through it. It had but a faint odour, unless freshly fractured or
gently heated, when it smelt like the urine of the cat.
    A comparatively recent specimen of this gum, which I saw in the
hands of the late Dr. Stocks, had merely the consistence of candied
honey, and an exceedingly offensive              odour.       Dr. Stocks informed
me that the fresh gum was employed as a dressing for wounds, as
it kept off the flies.         The resin was digested in strong spirit of

Ptychotis oil, by Dr. Haines, of the Bombay College, was read before the last
meeting of the Chemical Society.       Dr. Haines has generally arrived at similar
conclusions to my own.      He regards, however, the carbohydrogen portion of the
oil not  as isomeric with oil of turpentine, but as C,o

   His formula for the stearopten is the same as that given in this paper ; and he
regards it as identical with Lallemande's thymole.
   Dr. Haines, however, appears not to have observed the crystalline acid pro
duced by the action of nitric acid on the stearopten.

 wine, till  a  saturated solution was obtained.           This, on cooling, im
 mediately deposited some yellow amorphous                  flocks.   These were
separated by filtration,         and the clear liquid      slowly evaporated     in
vacuo.     On standing a few days, it deposited             a quantity   of golden
yellow slender crystals, about half an inch in length.                The crystals
had considerable lustre, and were very brittle.               To this crystalline
substance      I purpose giving the provisional            name     of Gardenine.
Gardenine is nearly insoluble both in cold and hot water.                   It dis
solves    pretty readily in alcohol, but much less readily in ether;
ether yielding      bright yellow solutions, out of which it crystallizes
on cooling.       Alkalies, such as ammonia, do not appear to increase
its solubility.     It is more soluble in hot hydrochloric and sulphuric
acids than in water, and is precipitated, apparently unchanged, on
the addition of water.           Its alcoholic solutions give no precipitate
with    ammonio-nitrate         of silver, or with basic acetate of lead.
When gardenine is digested with concentrated nitric acid, it is
rapidly decomposed        ;  nitropicric acid, but apparently no oxalic acid,
being produced.
   Unfortunately,     from the very small quantity of resin at my dis
posal,   I was unable to prepare        a  sufficient amount of the gardenine
either to subject it to analysis or to examine it more particularly.
Dr. Royle     has, however, commissioned a large quantity             of the resin
from India, which       I  trust will ere long enable me to complete its
examination.       Gardenine appears to belong to the tolerably nume
rous class of indifferent crystallizable         resins, of which it is certainly
one of the most beautiful.
IV. "On        the   Representation         of Polyhedra."        By the Rev.
       Thomas P.       Kirk     max,    A.M.      Communicated by Arthur
      Cayley, Esq., F.R.S.              Received August 6, 1855.
   This paper constituted an addition to the paper by                   the  same
author read June 21, 1855.
   The author     observes    that to every p-acral q-edron corresponds a
p-edral q-acron, the summits and faces of either having the same order
and rank as to the number of edges with the faces and summits of the

                                     544
other.    When p— q, the corresponding pair will sometimes be iden
tical figures, as to the number, rank, and arrangement of faces and
summits    ; and at other times, as is always the case    if p be not equal
to q, the two figures will differ.       When they differ they may        be
called  a sympolar pair, both being heteropolar; when they form one and
the same figure it may be styled an autopolar polyhedron.        An elegant
way of representing a sympolar pair is deduced from the two follow
ing theorems : —
   A. The q summits of      a q-acron are the angles of a closed polygon
of } sides,  all edges of the q-acron.
   B. A closed polygon of p       sides can   be traced on the    p faces of
every p-edron, having a side in every face, and passing through no
 summit.

 I. "  On the Action of Sulphuric Acid on the Nitriles and on
       the Amides."       By G. B. Buckton and A. W. Hofmann,
        Ph.D., F.R.S.       Communicated by Dr. Hofmann.                 Re
       ceived December      1, 1855.
    Although the identity of     the nitriles with the hydrocyanic ethers
 has been established by the    experiments of M. Dumas, who obtained
 them by the action of anhydrous phosphoric acid upon certain am-
 moniacal salts, chemists have hitherto in vain sought for a method
 by which a passage might be effected from the nitriles to the general
 alcohol derivatives.
    Our attention    has been directed likewise to the same subject, but

                                       545
our exertions, like those        of our   predecessors,    have   not yet been
crowned      with success.     The   researches     on which we have been
engaged, have, however, furnished some results which appear to us
worthy of the interest of chemists, the reactions being at the same
time remarkable        for their neatness      and susceptibility     of general
application.
    Acetonitrile   may be considered as the type        of its class, both from
the importance of the group to which it belongs, and the facility of
its preparation.      It is, in fact, the nitrile with which we        have been
specially engaged.       This body when mixed with its own volume of
fuming      sulphuric   acid, evolves a considerable amount of heat,
accompanied by a very energetic reaction.
    If care be taken to add the acid in small quantities, and to cool
the mixture after each addition, scarcely any change of colour is to
be observed.       By the addition of water, and subsequent saturation
with carbonate of barium,       a crystalline salt is produced in consider
able quantity, which possesses        all the characters and composition of
the sulphacetate of barium,
                           C4  (H,  Ba2) 04 2 SOg,
discovered some time ago by         M. Melsens in the mutual reaction of
 anhydrous sulphuric acid upon glacial acetic acid.
    If, on the contrary, the mixture of acetonitrile and fuming sulphuric
 acid be made rapidly, and the liquid be rather strongly heated, an
 abundant evolution of carbonic acid indicates a more profound
 reaction.     The residuary    mass, which      is tough and of a resinous
 consistency, when treated with water, and boiled with excess of
 carbonate of barium, yields a magnificent crystallization of a salt
 represented by the formula
                          C2  (H, Ba,) 4 SO3 + 4aq.
     It is a substance   of remarkable stability.      It does not    lose weight
 at a temperature of 100°      C., but four equivalents of water of crystal
 lization are disengaged at 170° C.          It is not further     affected  by a
 temperature of 220° C.         A strong heat resolves it into water, sul
                                    acid, free sulphur, and carbonic oxide.

 It may be boiled for hours with fuming nitric acid without the
 slightest decomposition.
    We     have  also made analyses of the ammonia and silver salts.
 The former crystallizes with great facility in colourless oblique

                                       546
prisms, which may be readily obtained upwards of an inch in length.
They are anhydrous, and perfectly stable at a temperature of 190° C.
   The composition of this salt is represented by the formula
                          C2 [H2 (NHJ,] 4 S 08.
   The silver salt is obtained by digesting oxide of silver with an
aqueous solution of the new acid.               It forms large crystals, which
are easily soluble in water, but insoluble           in alcohol or      ether.   They
contain
                             C2(H2Ag2)4S03.
   The acid may      be obtained by decomposing either the lead or silver
salt by hydrosulphuric      acid, or perhaps more conveniently, by care
fully precipitating    a solution of the barium salt           with sulphuric acid.
It is an exceedingly soluble and deliquescent substance, crystallizing
in long needles. It has        a   sharp acid taste, with somewhat of the
flavour of tartaric acid.
   For want of      a more convenient name, we propose for this acid
the appellation of Methylo-tetra-sulphuric              acid.      Without wishing
to decide at present upon its constitution, its composition allows us
to consider it as formed by the association of marsh gas with four
equivalents of anhydrous sulphuric acid.
    In the reaction of sulphuric acid upon acetonitrile, two distinct
phases may be traced.        In the first, the nascent acetic acid simply
combines with two equivalents of sulphuric                    acid   ; in the second
phase, the acetic molecule undergoes a more                  thorough transforma
tion  ; faithful  to its tradition it splits into carbonic acid and marsh
gas, which remains combined with four equivalents                  of sulphuric acid.
The new substance also may           be regarded as sulphacetic acid, which,
losing carbonic acid, has assimilated an equal number of equivalents
of sulphuric acid.
   The two reactions          may      be     represented       by     the  following
equations    :  —

                                   sulphuric acid.
   The action, then, of    bases and of acids upon acetic acid presents a
remarkable analogy.

                                      547
   The nature of     the change which the acetic molecule suffers,       is in
fact identical.    Under    the influence of both agents, it splits into
marsh gas and carbonic acid, but in the former case it is the car
bonic acid which      is fixed, whilst in the latter it is the marsh gas
that remains in combination.
   The production of methylo-tetra-sulphuric         acid calls to mind the
interesting substance, sulphate of carbyl, discovered by         M. Magnus,
by combining olefiant gas with the vapour of anhydrous sulphuric
acid.    Our new acid is however easily distinguishable             from this
body, as well by its different composition as by its extreme stability        ;
sulphate of carbyl, as is well known, being decomposed by water
into isethionic acid.
   As acetamide differs from acetonitrile only in containing two
additional equivalents of water, it undergoes with Nordhausen sul
phuric acid a strictly analogous transformation.
   From the comparative facility of its preparation it        offers peculiar
advantages     for procuring     the  methylo-tetra-sulphates.      The only
difference to be noted is, that in this case the ammonia salt is gene
rally eliminated instead of the free acid.
   M. Melsens, in his researches upon the sulphacetates, appears in
some sort to have anticipated the existence of the methylo-tetra-
sulphates.    He remarks that        he once found    in the mother liquor
obtained from the preparation of sulphacetate of silver, a crystalline
salt, the composition of which he represents by the formula
                             C2 H2 A& S4 °12-
   It  is evident that these crystals contain the same elements             as
methylo-tetra-sulphate      of silver, but M. Melsens    does not appear to
have investigated the subject further than by showing the existence
of this silver salt.
   A detailed description of        the methylo-tetra-sulphates,      and the
study of the corresponding         bodies of other series, will be on our
part the subject of a special memoir.

        cellulosae, as found       in the Pig."        By George Rainey,
        Esq., Lecturer, and Demonstrator of Practical and Micro
        scopical    Anatomy at St. Thomas's Hospital.                  Communi
        cated by     Robert D. Thomson, M.D., F.R.S.                      Received
        June 27, 1855.
                                     (Abstract.)
    The Cysticercus      cellulosae,   in its mature state, consists of two
 parts  :  one a small oval cyst, composed of           a very thin     membrane,
 rendered uneven on its external surface by minute rounded projec
 tions, and containing in its interior, granular            matter, particles of
 oil, and   a colourless fluid.     This may     be called its ventral portion.
 The other is folded inwards, occupying the centre of the cyst just
 described, but by pressure it may be made to protrude.                   This part
 is sometimes called the neck.            Its length varies very much in dif
 ferent cysticerci, depending         upon their age.       It is hollow, having
 strong membranous parietes, wrinkled transversely, and composed
 both of circular and longitudinal fibres.           The cavity has no visible
 communication        with that of the ventral portion.            It contains     a
 multitude     of small oval laminated calcareous bodies, which, when
 acted    upon by acids, effervesce      briskly, and     become     partially dis
 solved, leaving only a small residue of animal matter.                 When the
 neck is protruded, the extremity farthest from the cyst is seen to
 present an enlargement, sometimes called the head,                   on the free
 surface    of which     there    is   a  quadrangular       area,   occupied    by
 four circular disks and a ring of hooklets.            Each angle contains a
 disk, and the hooklets are placed in a circle around the centre of
this space.       The suctorial disks       are  traversed each by       a passage
 taking rather a spiral course, and terminating in the cavity of the
neck.      The membrane composing a disk presents two orders of
fibres, circular and radiating.         The hooklets are generally twenty-
six in number, thirteen long and as many short, arranged alter
nately a long and a short one.           Each consists of      a curved portion
like   a bird's   claw, and a straight portion or handle            ;  and at the
junction of     these  two parts there are tubercles, two in the short
hooklets, and only one in the long ones.             The hooklets      are crossed
by    two   zones    of circular    fibres.    They   are  also connected       by

                                       549
radiating    fibres, which    occupy the spaces       between each        adjacent
pair, like the interosseous muscles situated between the metacarpal
bones and phalanges.          The hooklets     are disposed      like radii, with
their points turned outwards and the extremities of their handles
inwards, which,      not meeting, circumscribe a circular space whose
centre corresponds to that of the quadrangular                area   before men
tioned.     At this part there is no perforation answering to               an oral
orifice, but here the membrane is simply depressed so as to present
a conical hollow.       By pressure upon the neck, this membrane can
be made to      protrude in the form of a tongue-like process, to which
the handles of all the hooklets are connected, so that when this
part in the living animal is made to move, the handles of the hook
lets will be drawn in with it, and their points carried from the
entozoon, and thus made to penetrate the part to which it attaches
 itself.   These entozoa are chiefly found in the cellular intervals
 between     the muscular      fibres, contained     in an adventitious        cyst
 formed by the condensation of the surrounding               tissues.     No  more
 than one entozoon is ever met with in one cyst.
                   Development    of the Cysticercus cellulosa.
     The earliest   appearance    of the incipient     stage   of  the cysticercus
  celluloste is a fusiform collection of small cells and molecules in the
  substance of a primary muscular fasciculus, or immediately beneath
  its sarcolemma.      These cells, in this condition          of the entozoon,
  have only an imperfect         or partial   covering;    however, they soon
  become completely enclosed in a well-defined             membrane which          is
  at first  homogeneous,        but which      afterwards     sends    out    short,
  slender, projecting     fibres, resembling     short hairs or cilia.        These
  hair-like fibres, though resembling in          some    respects     cilia,  differ
  from them in being much less sharply defined                 and less pointed      ;
  however,     for convenience sake,      I  shall   speak    of them as cilia.
  Their direction is remarkable.        At either extremity of the fusiform
   animal they are reflected backwards at a very acute angle, like the
   barbs of a feather, their direction being of course            opposite at the
   two ends.     They  become less and less inclined as they approach the
   middle of the body, where they stand out at right angles to the sur
   face.   The apparatus of cilia- like     processes   above    described is evi

                                                                          1
                                        550
 dently designed to give to the entozoon, whilst in this stage of its
 existence, the power of penetrating between the ultimate muscular
 fibrillar, and thus to enable it to force its way from the interior of a
 primary fasciculus into the spaces between the muscular fibres.             This
 will be the effect of the friction of the fibrillae against the cilia, which
will allow of motion in one direction only. And as its two ends
 must move in opposite directions, the cilia will also serve to aid the
entozoon in its development longitudinally.                That such is their
office will be apparent on examining            a sufficient number of speci
mens     ;  in some of which the primary fasciculi will be seen to have
been completely split up by these animals.              But  the correctness   of
this inference is more        strikingly proved by the influence which the
size and arrangement of the primary               bundles of muscular      fibres
have upon the form and dimensions of the entozoa.                  Thus in the
muscular parietes of the heart, where the primary fasciculi are smaller,
and, from their frequent interlacing, shorter than in other parts, the
cysticerci are, in this stage of their development, also very short and
of   a  different form to those found in other muscles, composed of
striped fibre, although in other respects perfectly similar         ; and, when
completely formed, those taken from the heart cannot be distinguished
from those formed in other muscles. The cells which have been
alluded to as forming the principal part of the cysticercus thus far
developed, and contained in the investment first described, are all of
the same character, differing only in their form and size, according to
their age and situation.         Those situated about the centre, and form
ing the chief part of its bulk, are collected together into rounded
masses,      giving  to many of the animalcules an obscurely annulose
appearance.         They  are  of  an elliptical,  or rather reniform figure.
This form, however, is not essential to            these cells, but merely re
sults from the circular shape of the masses into which they enter,
the convexity         of each    cell being a part of the        outline  of its
respective mass.         These cells contain minute granules, or rather
molecules, which are variously disposed            in different cells, so as to
present a variety        of  appearances,    such as circular    spaces,  which
might      be mistaken     for nuclei, but which seem rather to be pro
duced by a deficiency        of the cell's contents at    these parts, than by
any distinct nucleus.         The  mode   of formation of   these cells must be
examined in the growing parts of the animal, and for this purpose its

                                          551
 extreme ends are best adapted.               When    one of these ends is about
 to have an addition          made    to its length, the investing membrane
 at this part becomes          at first very thin, and then disappears.               A
 clear space is next seen, having in some specimens the form of the
 part which is about to be added to the extremity of the entozoon                        ;
 in others it       has  no defined limit.       This   space   contains,     in some
 cases,     nothing      but   extremely      minute    molecules,       of different
 shapes   ;   in others, these      molecules are mixed with granules                 of
 various     sizes, which     have   every appearance of having             been pro
 duced by the coalescence of the molecules               ; and lastly, with these
 molecules and granules, there are in other examples very distinct
 globular      cells, of  a  bright   aspect,   looking    more   like nuclei than
perfect cells     ;  these soon become      flattened oval, and ultimately take
 the elliptical form before described.            All the time these changes are
taking place in the molecules and cells, the membrane has been in
progress of formation, so that when the molecules have disappeared,
and their place has become occupied by perfect cells, the end of the
animal is completed.           The cilia   are    soon afterwards added.           The
lateral growth of these animals takes place in the same manner: the
first indication is a separation of the cilia, which, it must be observed,
are larger at the sides of an entozoon than at the extreme ends                        ;
and then a thinning of the membrane supporting them                    ;  and, lastly,
the formation of globular cells, as before noticed.             After the animals
have become of a considerable size, and forced their way from the
interior     of the primary fasciculi into the cellular spaces between
the larger muscular fibres, they still continue to grow, especially
in breadth ; but they lose their cilia, and gradually acquire those
parts which have been described as belonging                  to the neck.         The
first evidence of this addition is the appearance             of inversion of the
middle part of the cyst, forming a small hollow, the sides of which
look as     if thrown into folds containing granular matter, and                    the
bottom presents a circular space in which are granular particles of
various forms and sizes, but those in the centre are darker than the
rest.    It   is from these particles that the suctorial disks, the hook-
lets, and the first of the laminated bodies are about to be formed,
but as yet none of these parts are recognizable.                At   a stage a   little
more advanced, this apparent inversion of the cyst has increased,
the neck has become longer, and the appearance of disks, hook-

                                     552
lets, and laminated       bodies is sufficiently   distinct   to be perfectly
recognizable.     The  process of development is particularly apparent          in
the hooklets, and perhaps there is no other instance of the growth of
an animal tissue which presents such facilities for the examination
of the manner in which it is effected.           First,  because     the part of
the entozoon on which these organs are formed, is sufficiently trans
parent to admit of examination by the highest magnifying powers
without    any previous dissection.       Secondly, because       the material
of which they      are composed is so characteristic, and so dissimilar
to the surrounding       parts, that it can be detected in the minutest
possible quantities.      And, thirdly,   as only a few     of  these hooklets
are  in progress of development       at one time, and as these are         in all
stages of formation, every step       in the progress of their growth can
be  traced from the merest molecule to a perfect hooklet.                 This is
important     in reference to the general theory of development,             as  it
furnishes an example of the formation of a complete set of organs,
on a plan more simple,         and   at variance   with   the cell-theory       of
 Schwann and others.         Before   one of these     hooklets      takes on a
recognizable form, it exists as        a  group of exceedingly         refractive
particles,   all apparently of the same composition, and of            a  more or
less globular form, but of very different sizes, some being so minute
as scarcely     to be visible by one-eighth      of   an   inch    lens,   others
being almost as large as the handle of a perfect hooklet, while
 the rest are of all dimensions between these extremes.                The next
 condition    of a  hooklet is the apparent fusion        or coalescence        of
 some  of  these   particles into the hooked part of the organ.              Then
 the handle and tubercles are added, these          having been previously
 formed by the fusion of the smaller particles, and these latter by
 the coalescence     of the minutest     and   the minuter      ones.      Before
 the several   parts are perfectly consolidated, their points of junction
 can be    distinguished,    and in other groups the fragments corre
 sponding to those      recently united can be recognized.            Directly    a
 hooklet is found, it is of its full dimension     ;  and some of its parts
 are even    larger and more clumsy-looking         than in older hooklets.
 The substance of the particles         entering into these       organs, after
 they are once formed, undergoes no change in its microscopical
 characters, but is the same after as before their union.               It is im
 possible to single out any one particle from the rest, which can be

                                                '
                                        553
taken for the nucleus of a cell, or for what physiologists would call
a nucleated      cell ; and thus there is nothing which indicates that
these    organs have been formed by transformation of previously ex
isting cells, but, on the contrary, there is every appearance that
their formation is due to the simple coalescence of homogeneous
molecules.
     Up to the present point,       the facts which           I  have   stated are so
obvious, that their accuracy will,          I  think, not be questioned           ; also
the interpretation        of  them   is  not only that which               appears     to
me     the   most natural, but is almost self-evident.                There    remain,
however, some considerations of a more                  theoretical kind, though
 not of less importance.        It will be asked, how the entozoon, in                its
 earliest condition, such as      I have described it, finds access to               the
 interior of a primary fasciculus.          Before attempting to answer this
 question,    I  must observe     that my description            commences      from a
 condition of this entozoon so complete, that no one, on examining
 it in this   state  with  the microscope,        will deny its perfect similarity
 to those of the higher form.         But there are other links in the chain
 which     I must now consider, and which so far have been omitted
 only because      I wished to keep that which is certain distinct from
 that which is probable.          Before the cells and molecules already
 described accumulate         in sufficient quantity            to present    the    un
  doubted character above mentioned, they are found aggregated in
 smaller groups, and even occurring             individually      in all the primary
 fasciculi of the diseased       muscle   ;   their quantity, and the size and
  form of these groups, present the greatest possible irregularity in
  the different fasciculi.     In some the molecular deposit looks like an
  early stage of fatty degeneration, but it has characters very different ;
  one is the shape of the molecules, which resemble in all respects
  those in the growing ends of an entozoon                  ;  and another is, their
  situation, which seems to be between the primary fibrillae, tending
  to separate     them longitudinally     ;   however that may be, it is an
  abnormal condition, and always co-existent with the higher forms
 of the cysticercus     ; and as the entozoon, as         I   have first described it,
 could not possibly have taken on that form all at once, these groups
  of molecules must therefore be looked upon as its antecedent
  stage, or as portions of cysticerci in progress of development.                    But
  I also find in the specimens of muscle infested                with  these  entozoa.

                                           554
many of the capillaries and smaller blood-vessels filled with organic
molecules, which, so far as           I am able to judge from the comparison
of such extremely minute bodies, seem to resemble those molecules
which are found in the primary fasciculi.                   The vessels filled with
these molecules have their coats              so thin as to be inappreciable, and
some     of   the capillaries appear        to be partially destroyed, and their
molecular contents diffused among the sarcous elements.                          As this
is an abnormal condition of the contents of these vessels, as well as
of their     coats, and, so far as my experience goes, is not found ex
cepting in conjunction with the earliest stages of the cysticerci,                      I
am inclined        to believe that the molecules in question are the same
as those     in  the primary fasciculi, and that        it is by their coalescence
in    these    fasciculi   that the      formation-cells     of the cysticerci       are
formed.
          Addition to the foregoing communication, received
                                 December       6, 1855.
    After an entozoon           has left the    interior of a primary fasciculus,
and arrived at the space between the muscular fibres, it loses its
ciliated     investment,        and   begins     to  increase      in breadth.       Its
margin now seems             to be formed entirely          by the convexities        of
the globular masses of cells of which its body appears to be made
up, causing it to present           a crenate form similar to that of the ven
tral portion of the perfect animalcule,                with this difference only,
that these cells are compressed.               The next change which is visible
is the formation         of folds, which become          more      perceptible as the
animal      increases in breadth,          and which       remain      in the perfect
entozoon        so   long   as   it is confined to       a   small space, but       dis
appear when          it gets   to the space between the surface of a muscle
and the fascia covering it.               The unfolding       in this last situation
seems to be produced by the imbibition               of fluid, and the consequent
distension of the ventral part.              These more advanced stages of the
worm -form are best found in those specimens of diseased                         muscle
in which      the perfectly developed cysticerci           abound.       Their number
in proportion to that of the perfect animalcules varies considerably
in different specimens.
    I  have    always succeeded        in finding    some   of    those  of  the worm-
form along with the perfectly developed ones                    ;  and  in  some cases

                                          555
   there are as many of one kind as the                other.     After they   have
  acquired a   certain breadth — about one-twelfth, or the one-eighth of
  an inch, — the central part      of the cyst    appears   to be drawn inwards,
  forming   a  hollow   ;  at the bottom of which, the granular            material
  is deposited from which           the   suckers,   hooklets,     and calcareous
  granules are formed, as above described.

       The   LORD WROTTESLEY, President, in                       the Chair.
     The President     stated   that Robert William Sievier, Esq., who by
 reason   of non-payment of his annual contribution ceased to be a
 Fellow of the Society at the late Anniversary, had applied for re-
 admission   ;  and an extract of his letter to the Council was read                ,
 explaining    the  circumstances      under which, during         his absence  on
 the continent, the omission of payment had taken place.                    Notice
 was    accordingly     given,   that   the question       of Mr. Sievier's re-
 admission would be put to the ballot at next meeting.
     The following communication was read               : —
"    Further    Researches       on    the   Polarity of       the   Diatnagnetic
        Force,"     By John Tyndall, Ph.D., F.R.S.                       Received
        November 27, 1855.
     The author commences by referring to              the    results recorded in
the Bakerian Lecture         for 1855.     The fact of diamagnetic polarity
was there established, by permitting            fixed magnets to act upon         a
moveable     bar of bismuth,       encircled by an electric current;          and,
from the deflections of the bar, the character of the force acting
upon it was inferred.           The experiments recorded in the present
paper may be regarded as complementary to the above.                    Here dia
magnetic     bars, suitably      excited,   are   permitted     to act upon     an
astatic system     of steel    magnets, and from the deflections of the
system,   the polarity of the bodies acting upon it is inferred.               An
experiment of the nature here indicated was made, three years ago,
    VOl. Vii.                                                          3 c

                                     556
by Professor    W. Weber; but, notwithstanding            his known skill and
accuracy as an experimenter, his results did not command general
conviction.     The author sketches the arguments that              have  been
urged against the inferences which           M. Weber     has drawn from his
experiments, and the conditions           laid down by those       who urged
these     arguments, for the rigorous        demonstration     of diamagnetic
polarity.     In the present paper      these    conditions are accepted and
fulfilled.
    To arrive at  an exact notion     of the value of M. Weber's experi
ments, the author thought it best to operate with an instrument
similar to that used by M. Weber himself.                He has to thank the
latter philosopher    for the plan of an apparatus more delicate than
any which has been hitherto used, which plan was carried out in an
efficient    manner   by that    able mechanician,        Leyser   of Leipzig.
The instrument consists essentially of two spirals of covered copper
wire, about eighteen inches long, firmly attached to a massive slab
of mahogany.        The slab is attached by brass bolts to the solid
 masonry of the     Royal Institution, so as to have the spirals in a
vertical position.     Above    the spirals is     a  wooden wheel, with a
 grooved periphery, and below them a similar one.              The wheels   are
 united by an endless string, which communicates              motion from one
 of them to the other.      To this string the cylinders submitted to
 examination are attached    ;  and by turning the lower wheel with            a
 suitable key, the cylinders      can   be caused to move        up and down
 within the spirals.    Two   steel bar magnets are arranged astatically,
 connected by a rigid brass junction, and so suspended that the
 magnets are in a horizontal      plane.     The two magnets      have the two
 spirals between them, and have         their poles opposite the centres of
 the spirals.    When therefore      a current is sent through the spirals,
 it exerts no more action upon the magnets than the central, or neu
 tral point of    a magnet would do.          If the bars within the spirals
 be perfectly central, they also     will present    these   neutral points to
 the    suspended   magnets, and hence exert no action upon them.
 But if the key be so turned that the two ends of the diamagnetic
 bars shall act upon the magnets, then, if these bars be polar, the
 intensity and character of their polarity          will  be indicated   by the
 deflections of the magnets.          Here, then, we have not only the
 action of the earth neutralized, but a turning force is brought to

                                            557
bear upon the suspended system                four times that which would come
into play   if only     a single spiral and a single pole were made use of.
The   mode     of observation is        the   same     as that applied     by Gauss to
his magnetometer.            The instrument         is enclosed on all sides from
external air-currents        ; the magnets have a mirror attached to them
which moves          as they move, and which            is observed     by means of     a
telescope   and scale       placed at    a  distance of about ten feet from the
 instrument.
    When cylinders of bismuth              are   submitted to experiment, a very
marked deflection is produced, indicating, on the part of the bis
muth, a polarity opposed to that of iron.                      This is the only sub
stance which has hitherto been examined                   ;  and against   M. Weber's
results, obtained with this metal, it has been urged that the de
flection observed        by him was due to induced currents, aroused in
the bismuth by its mechanical motion                     up and down         within the
spiral.    With regard to this objection,             as bearing upon the author's
experiments, he remarks, first, that the deflection produced is per
manent,    which       could not be the case            if the effect were due to
induced     currents,       which vanish instantaneously.                 Secondly, if
 the  effect were due to induction,              it would     be shown     in the most
exalted degree          by the best       conductors.         Now antimony is        less
diamagnetic         than   bismuth,      but    it is a better       conductor.      The
deflection produced by it, however, shows that it is its                     diamagnetic
quality,   and not its         conductive      quality,     which   is effective   ;  the
deflection is less than that of bismuth.                     Copper is fifty times      a
better conductor          than bismuth,        but its      diamagnetic      capacity is
nearly nil   ;   it produces no sensible action upon              the magnets, which
could not possibly be the case were the result due to induction.
    Again,     a   quantity    of bismuth        was   powdered, and the powder
suffered to become           so tarnished that it was unable to conduct vol
taic electricity.        Tubes    filled with this powder produced effects
almost as striking as those              produced by the massive            cylinders of
bismuth.
    But the experiments have been extended to a great number of
insulators, with the same result.                Heavy-glass, sulphur, calcareous
spar, statuary marble, nitre,             phosphorus, wax, and other insula
tors, have been        examined, and proved polar.                Both   paramagnetic
and diamagnetic liquids have also                 been   embraced     in the examina

                                558
tion, and the polarity of both established.    Thus every objection
that has been   raised against the polarity of the diamagnetic force
has been    removed, and an amount of evidence accumulated in its
favour, which places   it amongst the most firmly established truths
of science.
    The Society then adjourned over the Christmas recess, to the
 10th of January, 1856.

    The President then     addressed    the Society as follows    : —
       Gentlemen,
 In  addressing you for the first time, it is perhaps to be regretted that
 the course of events during the last year should have imposed on me
 the obligation of alluding to subjects which cannot be approached
 with too much caution, and which involve considerations of            no ordi
 nary difficulty.
    One of the subjects may be described most generally as the            " Re
 lation of Science to the supreme authorities in the State          ;" and this
 is chiefly important   as   it affects    the extent to which the claims of
 Science are recognized and regard paid to its interests by the ruling
 powers.    For  example,   it has often     been more than doubted whether
 the opinions of eminent men of science, even when expressed in the

                                                  561
most formal and deliberate manner, do, as things are now constituted,
exercise     sufficient influence over the deliberations of Government and
 Parliament when they are called upon to decide upon questions for
the proper determination of which scientific knowledge must be con
sidered as a valuable, and sometimes                      an indispensable qualification.
Among the various causes to which this may be ascribed, it seemed
to some that        a     want of representation of Science                in the Legislature
was possibly one ; that              is,   that there was no one in either House of
 Parliament who was entitled to consider                        it    his peculiar province to
watch over the interests of Science                     and defend them, when, amidst
the heterogeneous             mass    of subjects to which the attention of our
Government          and legislators          is   directed,    it     appeared       probable that
those    interests would suffer,             or receive        less    of that attention than
their importance deserved.
   With the          of remedying this defect, the Parliamentary Com
                   view
mittee     of the British Association for the Advancement of Science
was formed     ;   it     consists of seven members of the House of Lords and
six of the House of Commons, who are                           " requested       to act as       a   per
manent Committee to watch over                       the interests         of    Science,        and to
inspect the various measures                 from time to time introduced into Par
liament likely to affect such interests."
   My excellent           predecessor       in this Chair, who            is   himself      a    distin
guished member of this Committee, thinks there                            is   something in this
arrangement "forced and awkward."                         It   may be so, for          it   is   neces
sarily   a   makeshift,       a   substitute for a more formal and recognized
representation of Science in Parliament                  ;     but perhaps the more mate
rial question       is,   How     has this arrangement hitherto worked                      ?        Has
this Committee already done some good                          service    to Science        or not     ?
The following     short statement of what has been done.
                    is    a
  1st. The Parliamentary Committee, in conjunction with your
Council, favoured by the zealous cooperation of the present Chair
man of the Board of Customs, succeeded                         in   carrying out      a   very bene
ficial arrangement at the Custom House,                         by    which the international
communication of scientific publications has been greatly facilitated                                  ;
and with the same view they have represented                              to the Postmaster-
General the importance to science of prevailing on foreign countries
to permit the extension to themselves of our excellent system of book-
postage.      A    correspondence has been had with                            the    Postmaster
                                                                            3    d   2

                                        G62
 General and      Mr. Rowland Hill, and interviews          have been solicited
 and obtained.      There is   a great desire on the part of the Post Office
 authorities to carry out this object       ; and the only obstacle to success
 seems to be the reluctance       of  some foreign countries to consent to a
 perfectly free admission of publications.
    2ndly. The subject of pensions to men of science has been brought
 before successive Governments, with the view of obtaining for Science
its fair share in the distribution of the Parliamentary Grant, and im
pugning that principle of selection which implies that absolute poverty
in the recipient ought to be an indispensable qualification for the
receipt, — a principle of which the adoption appears to have originated
in the smallness of the sum placed at the disposal of the Government
for the recompense      and encouragement of civil services.
    3rdly. The Committee supported, and with success,             a  representa
tion which      had been    already made        to the Government       by your
Council, urging them to establish an office in this country to coope
 rate with   Lieut. Maury in America,             in collecting  and reducing
meteorological      and hydrographical        observations made     at sea,   and
embodying the results in improved charts and sailing directions.
    4thly. The Parliamentary Committee             has supported the memorial
 addressed    to Government,        requesting     them   to appropriate    some
buildings in a central situation in this metropolis to the accommoda
tion of the principal scientific societies.
    5thly, and lastly. The Committee has, in          a Report lately presented
to the British Association at Glasgow, collected and embodied the
opinions of eminent cultivators           of  Science   on a question of great
importance, viz. Whether          any measures       could be adopted by the
 Government or Parliament that would improve the position of Science
or its cultivators in this country      ?
    The  absence    of a representation in Parliament has been mentioned
as being possibly one      of the  causes   of the supposed want of    deference
to the interests of Science       ;  but there are others which may well
exercise   some    influence in bringing        about a result, which,     if  its
existence   be admitted,      must be a subject of regret to all whose
opinions are deserving of respect.
    It may be that there is something in the constitution                of our
Scientific Societies which may deprive them of their due weight and
influence.     In some foreign countries there are Institutes,          or other

                                       563
analogous bodies,     recognized by their governments as part of the
 civil organization, and consulted on almost all occasions when scien
tific questions   are under the consideration      of executive or legislative
bodies.
    There seems ground for the belief, that any plan for the establish
ment of an Institute, properly so called, in this country, and certainly
 for organizing any direct dependence of Science on the Government,
 would meetwith little favour     ; nor does there seem to be any desire that
the aid now afforded by contributions from the public purse should
be much increased      ; in truth, there is nothing that would inflict         a
more serious blow on Science and its cultivators, than that an idea
should prevail     that the latter had obtained from those           entrusted
with the conduct of public affairs        a greater share   of national pecu
niary support than the well-considered interests of the community at
large rendered desirable     ;  there is nothing     that ought to be more
 deprecated,   for there is nothing that would be more fatal to the suc
cess   of that which must always be our primary object, the object to
which the interests of all societies, and of their members, must
always be a secondary consideration,          viz. the diffusion of Science
itself, and the increase of our knowledge of the laws and phrenomena
 of the universe. -
    At the same time, no       one who has watched the course        of  recent
events can fail to suspect that the influence         of those who represent
Science    is rather less than greater than it ought to be.           For   ex
ample    :—
    Some applications for assistance addressed to the Government, and
alluded to by your late President, were unsuccessful         ; and if disposed
to speculate     upon the cause of failure, we may possibly adopt the
conclusion, that our Scientific Societies (not excluding even this, the
most ancient and influential of all), owing to defects in their consti
tution or other causes, do not inspire the Government with sufficient
confidence in their recommendations         ; and we adopt this conclusion
the rather that we perceive no distaste for, or depreciation of, Science
in the abstract among those whose influence is powerful in the State           ;
on the contrary, we recognize       among the members of successive ad
ministrations many known to be sincere          friends to its advancement,
and perceive also that great deference is sometimes paid to the indi
vidual opinions of men enjoying high scientific celebrity, and to those

                                                 564
of public                         of Visitors of the Royal Observa
               bodies, such as the Board
tory and the Trustees of the British Museum, which are invested
with a more official character.                      Can it be possible then that the
distrust of the recommendations of Scientific Societies                    pro            as such,
ceeds from        some         apprehension that in making them they are in
fluenced by views               of advantage to their own individual interests,
which are opposed                  to the interests       of   the community at large                 ?      I
should be reluctant so to                think   ;   but all will agree, that everything
that can by possibility exercise any injurious                             influence deserves             to
be attentively considered and,                if practicable,         corrected.
      Those     who entertain that opinion will perhaps be disposed                                       to
receive      with favour           a scheme      propounded for remedying the evil,
which meets with the approval of some on whose judgment reliance
may be placed        ;     I   mean     the proposal to revive                the late Board              of
Longitude        under         a   new form,         that      is, to constitute a Board or
Committee, composed                  partly of men holding high official situations,
and partly of men of distinguished eminence in Science,                                       to perform
for its whole domain the functions which the                                 late    Board fulfilled
for Navigation and Astronomy alone.
      My distinguished             predecessor       in this Chair, while admitting the
evils to which allusion has been                         made,    has      suggested          a   different
remedy, that         is,   an augmentation in the number of your Council,
and that the additional members shall be selected from such of our
Fellows       as, to use       his own words,        "   have high general education, and
are men        of the world and of influence."                        It   may well be doubted
whether any change in the internal constitution of this Society, and
least      of all that    will inspire the Government with greater
                           change,
confidence in its recommendations in truth, the prestige of antiquity,
                                                     ;
and the belief in the scientific qualifications of your Council, are pro
bably the chief grounds on which such confidence                              as    is   now extended
to suggestions       emanating from us                   is   based   ;   that confidence,           there
fore, might be still further impaired by changes in our constitution,
and by admitting to our Council                      a    larger proportion              of   men,    who,
however eminent in other departments of knowledge,                                  have never made
physical science their especial study or pursuit.                             However this may
be,   it   cannot be otherwise than beneficial that these suggested reme
dies,   which are now fairly before the scientific world,                                     should be
thoroughly canvassed                and discussed           in conjunction with any other

                                           565
schemes      which may be hereafter proposed for effecting                    a   like object.
It    would be unreasonable to expect               that any very general                  assent
should be immediately given to any plan which has sufficient novelty
to prevent its ready acceptance           by some Fellows of this Society and
others, who seem to have an instinctive dread of any Government
interference with the independence of societies, and take                         a   just pride
in discharging,       in this country, by their own gratuitous                          services,
those functions which       in other countries are performed by                         men ap
pointed and paid by the State.
     The    views which     have been put forward may seem to be in some
degree      confirmed     by the recent correspondence and discussions
respecting the a61000 entrusted to this Society for the promotion
of scientific objects.       It   would be improper to go into any detail on
a subject which        has already been more than sufficiently discussed,
and on some occasions             in a spirit    which was hardly called for or
justified    by the facts.        Whilst the    reasons assigned        for withholding
the grant seemed doubtless to imply                 a   misapprehension as to the
purpose for which it was originally conferred, and the part fulfilled
by the Society in the administration              of    it,   at the same time            it   was
the duty of the Government to require                    a    statement    of the          mode
in which the public money had been expended,                           and also           of the
grounds on which        a   renewal    of the grant      was solicited    ;       and     it   is   to
be regretted that any remarks should have been           publicly                     made on
the withholding        of the grant until that information had been pre
pared and laid before the Executive, and they had had an oppor
tunity afforded them of considering               it,   and deciding on their future
course.
     The Government,         we may presume,            are now satisfied             with our
distribution of the grant, and convinced of its utility, and they have
decided in favour of its continuance.             The whole matter has                also been
placed on     a   more satisfactory basis, by the resolution which has been
adopted of making the grant for the future the subject of                             a   special
annual application to Parliament, to be made                    by   the Government.
 I    allude however to this subject, because                 if it   be not an example
of misapprehension on the part of the Executive of that kind to which
reference     has been made,   I      would at least direct your attention to the
account which has been recently published in our Proceedings of the
manner in which the 365000 already granted by the Government has

                                       566
 been disposed of.       You   are aware that a Committee,           consisting of
 about forty in number, and composed          of men well known in science,
 have   been the distributors     of that fund   ; and   I  think that on care
 fully looking over the list of the various    researches    of interest to which
 it has been devoted, and weighing the paramount utility of the inves
 tigations and the value of the results, every one will join me in the
 expression of congratulation, that      a  grant so productive of advantage
 to the best interests of our country and mankind has not been with
 held.    At the   same time it has been a subject      of regret     to the Com
 mittee of Recommendations, that either owing to the existence               of the
 grant not having become generally known, or to some other cause,
 the number of applications of an eligible character to share                 in its
 distribution   has not increased as much as might have been antici
 pated.    It is possible that some modification of the stringent rules
 under which the money is now distributed may tend materially to
 enlarge the sphere of its usefulness.        It is very much to be wished,
 that young men who have received         a regular scientific education, and
 are anxious to devote      themselves   to researches     for which their own
 pecuniary resources      are inadequate,    should be encouraged          to avail
 themselves of this Government Grant.
    I cannot take leave of the subject of the temporary withdrawal                of
 this fund, without recalling to your memory the zeal with which
 Lord John Russell (to whom we owe the original proposal of the
grant) and Lord Brougham then advocated the interests of Science,
both unwearied promoters of the intellectual progress of the human
race, and both have thus augmented their claims to the honours with
which an impartial posterity will doubtless reward their services.
    H.R.H.    Prince Albert, on the occasion of laying the first stone
of the Birmingham and Midland Institute, set forth the                 advantages
of the study of Science in language calculated to make                 a powerful
impression on the numerous auditory             to which     it  was addressed.
Lord Ashburton       also showed, that, for want        of   a better scientific
education in our artisans, we were likely to be outstripped                 in the
race  of commerce.      May   we view these events as examples          of a grow
ing desire to encourage     scientific study and research, and diffuse their
benefits more widely     !
    The question of the removal of the Society          to   Burlington House
has received    the anxious consideration      of your officers.        An inter

                                             567
view with      Lord Palmerston, in the month of June last, had given
us ground to hope that we should                  ere now have received        some offi
cial notification        of the intentions of Government on this subject.
In   this we have been unhappily disappointed                    ; but all the informa
tion which has been received                during the recess would lead to the
conclusion that it has been determined to place Burlington                     House, or
buildings erected on or near its site, at the disposition of the prin
cipal Scientific Societies of this Metropolis.                  No situation could      be
selected     more favourable       ;  and one cannot but anticipate that very
important advantages           will  accrue to Science from their          joint occupa
tion of such      a site.     Among the most important of the benefits likely
to flow from this change              of our     abode,    I would   specify, — 1st, the
facilities which it will afford to men engaged                 in common pursuits to
meet and interchange their thoughts                     and views on subjects deeply
interesting to all of them            ;   2ndly, the economical advantages            that
will result from          a joint occupation        ;  3rdly, the benefits which will
accrue     to all the societies        by the approximation          of their libraries   ;
and 4thly, the great increase of weight and dignity arising from so
public a recognition of the claims of Science to national regard.                       At
 the same time we may purchase these advantages                        too dearly ; and
all the circumstances of the exchange                   must be well weighed before
 we finally agree to abandon our present location.
    Since my acceptance           of this   office,   I can  truly say I have received
 the most unvaried kindness from all.                    The best understanding has
 always subsisted,         and  I trust will ever continue to subsist, between
your     officers   ;   and the various matters of business which arise in
the intervals between successive              meetings      of Council   have been dis
 cussed by them at meetings held prior to each Council ; by which
 arrangement, the officers bring to the Council                  a better knowledge of
 the principal subjects about to be deliberated upon.
    In the Report of the Parliamentary Committee, to which allusion
 has been already made,            various other matters of great importance
 have been mooted, which may be classed under two heads:                            — 1st,
 those    which       respect  the extension of scientific knowledge              ;   and,
 2ndly, those which have relation to rewards and encouragements                          to
 be bestowed       on proficients       in that department of learning.             Under
 the first division, the most important questions,                  doubtless,  that can
 be agitated are those         of the     means     to be adopted for improving the

                                           568
elementary instruction          given in our schools, and for rendering the
teaching of physical         science    more    general     at our Universities    ;  but
on these, time will not permit me now to enlarge.                         The difficult
consideration of the extent to which public aid ought to be afforded
to popular lectures, has been raised.                 I am not disposed to agree
either with those who altogether condemn this mode of imparting
instruction, or with those who anticipate great advantages                     as likely
to accrue to the cultivation           and diffusion     of    Science from its exten
sion.     There can be no doubt that latent talent has been sometimes
called into existence by superficial teaching             ;  and, on the other hand,
that superficial teaching will never confer sound knowledge.                         Dili
gent and earnest private study alone can put the seal of authenticity
on information acquired in the lecture-room.                    But when   we consider
what a large proportion             of our fellow-subjects have neither the
means     nor the opportunity of studying at the Universities, or of
otherwise acquiring the knowledge referred to, and the great advan
tages that would result to the middle classes and the higher grade                      of
artisans,    from acquaintance with at least the elementary truths                      of
 Science,     it  is worthy     of  serious    consideration whether          a  certain
 amount of support by the State should not be conceded                         to popu
 lar lectures and also         to   educational establishments, at which              the
 elements     of the physical      sciences    may be taught on a more general
 and systematic plan to students, who shall be invited and expected
 to enter on their study with          a serious    intention of learning, so far       as
 their means and opportunities extend.
     In connexion with this subject, of the scientific instruction of                 the
 masses,    it is impossible to overlook the effects which may be pro
 duced by the publication, within the last few years, of works written,
 it may    be,   in  a somewhat unphilosophical               spirit, and propounding
 theories which       rest  on unsubstantial         foundations,      but written with
 great ability, and calculated powerfully to excite the imagination of
  those by whom the truths           of natural    science have been little studied.
  Some students may perhaps require to have their attention aroused
  by the announcement of startling novelties,                and these works may be
  to them the honey with which the bitter cup of abstract science must
  be anointed to attract their palates          : —
                        " Ut  puerorum   actas improvida    ludificetur,
                          Labrorum tenus."

                                      569
    Under   the second    division   of rewards and        encouragements    to
those   who are proficients in Science,         the difficult   subject of the
utility of  medals, decorations, and other stimulants of that kind, is
discussed.     As to   medals,  I agree   with those who consider it      expe
dient that some should be given      ;  but care should be taken that such
distinctions are not unduly multiplied.          The subject of decorations,
titles, and orders of merit, considered as incentives to the application
to scientific research,   is full of difficulty.    On the one hand, it is
doubtless an anomaly, in this country, that while these honours are
now somewhat lavishly bestowed           for military   services,  a very high
degree    of merit in any civil line is seldom rewarded by any such
distinctions.    On the other hand, it is clear that rewards which were
not approved by public opinion would confer little honour, and that
there are many eminent cultivators of Science            in this country who
would set little value on distinctions        awarded by the Government,
which would rarely be in a condition to form an accurate estimate of
the claims of rival candidates.
    That the emoluments of Professors should          be increased,  and more
prizes provided at the Universities         for scientific merit, is generally
admitted.
    There is one point on which the Report in question is silent, but
that involves so serious      a grievance, and is calculated so much to
discourage the devotion of high mental endowments to physical re
search,   that it would be improper        to omit all mention of it here,
when something like        a cursory review of the present position           of
Science in this country has been attempted.
    It has somehow or other become almost an established practice            in
 this country, that no amount of labour, however arduous, performed
for the benefit of the community by men of science, is considered,
as such, entitled to pecuniary reward.          I could enumerate     many in
 stances   which have fallen within my own personal experience,               in
 which a very great amount of anxious and harassing toil, wearisome
 alike to both body and mind, and calculated to exhaust the energies
 of both,   has been performed      for the State gratuitously by men of
 great eminence in their various walks of science, with a zeal and de
 votion worthy of all praise.
    It is unnecessary,  and it would be improper, to instance cases of
 services performed by persons now living ; they are well known, and

                                                    570
some  of them will occur to the great majority of my auditors ; but
there is one very remarkable and recent example, in which he to
whom          my observations relate is unhappily                         no more, and whose
labours have been alluded to in our biographical notices, — mean that                         I
of the late Mr. Sheepshanks,                            a name       which       I    cannot mention
without        recalling, with affectionate                regret, the various occasions                    on
which he has kindly assisted                       with his     advice and stimulated by his
encouragement my humble labours                               in    science     *.     As an original
member of the Astronomical                         Society, and thus associated                     more or
less with its Fellows                  for more        than thirty-five         years,       I     have   wit
nessed the dawn, progress and final close of the honourable career
of its most distinguished ornaments, many of whom I had the plea
sure of numbering among my friends ; and I can truly say, that men
more      disinterested, more ardent lovers of science and human pro
gress,    and more enlightened members                     of society, it was never my
lot to meet        ;   and when a              more advanced stage of civilization shall
be   attained, — a period              I fear long       distant, — the labours of such men
will     be appreciated as they deserve to be, and they                                will       be cited as
bright examples              of    a    life spent in fulfilling one of the noblest of
tasks, that        is,   enhancing the dignity of man, by showing of what
things the human mind                    is   capable.
    Your partial suffrages having placed me, however unworthy, to
fill that distinguished post at the head of the most ancient and
venerable       of our British Scientific                    Institutions,    I       have       thought    it
right    to   avail myself of this, the first opportunity afforded                                  to me   of
addressing you, to take                 a    review, necessarily hasty and imperfect, of
some     of the desiderata of             Science   ;    and having been so     highly honoured
above my deserts,         I       only desire that         it   may be    said of me with truth,
that I    laboured diligently to induce my fellow-countrymen to regard
with favour and respect,                      to cherish and foster,                 to appreciate and
reward the labours of the cultivators of Science.
 *     Since the above was written,            I   have been informed that            the late Sir Robert
Peel offered £500        a   year as     a    remuneration     for scientific    services        in connexion
with the restoration         of the National Standards,            and that both Mr. Baily and Mr.
Sheepshanks       preferred       serving the nation gratuitously to the acceptance of what
may have been considered                an inadequate      reward.     The remarks          in the text do
not depend for their justification on              a   single example.

   The Copley Medal          for the present year has been awarded to
M. Foucault, of Paris.
    M. Foucault     has been engaged in various remarkable              researches
during    the last ten or twelve years.        His    earliest  labours were de
voted to photography.         In the year    1844,    he published, along with
M. Fizeau,    an investigation    of the comparative intensity, both           che
mical and optical, of three of the most brilliant sources of light of
which we can avail ourselves,        — the sun, the voltaic       arc, and incan
descent    lime*.    The investigations       of  these    philosophers      led to
numerical results, from which the vast inferiority             of the lime-light
came out in a very     striking manner. While the voltaic arc with coke
poles gave a    light of which the intrinsic intensity was nearly -|ths of
that of the sun, the intensity of the oxy-hydrogen                 lime-light   was
found to be only about -g^th of that of the poles of the voltaic arc.
    Shortly afterwards, M. Foucault was engaged, in conjunction with
M. Fizeau, in     a series of important    researches     on the interference of
light produced by      a considerable difference     of path in the interfering
streamsf.      In ordinary cases, all signs of interference cease when the
difference of path amounts to a few undulations, though inter
ferences   of a  high order had    been observed     with the light of     a spirit-
lamp with a salted wick, and also in certain peculiar phenomena
exhibited in a pure spectrum.         But the prism does not seem to have
been   employed in the investigation         of interference, except for the
sake  of analysing the tints produced by           means    of polarized light      ;
and theorists even     doubted whether the vibrations of the body emit
ting the light in the first instance      were   sufficiently regular to render
interference possible in the case of great differences            of path.      But
by subjecting a narrow band of interfering light to prismatic analysis,
the authors were able to detect perfectly distinct interference pro
duced by great retardations, amounting in one case to no less than
7394 undulations, proving that the undulations are regular in a very
high  degree.      A similar method of research enabled the authors to
study the modifications of polarized light with great advantage.

      In September    1847,   MM. Foucault and Fizeau         read    to the Aca
  demy an account of their researches on the interference             of the calo
  rific rays.   By the    use  of very small spirit thermometers of great
  delicacy, they were enabled to detect alternations of intensity corre
 sponding to those of illumination in the fringes produced by the
 mirrors of Fresnel.        By the   same means     they detected alternations
 of temperature, corresponding to         and coincident with those     of illumi
 nation, in the interrupted         interference-spectrum     obtained by the
 methods employed in their last-mentioned researches          ; but the alterna
 tions of temperature were not confined to the region of the visible
 rays   ; they extended into the region of the invisible heat-rays of Sir
 William Herschel, situated beyond the extreme red. The authors
 established also the diffraction of heat, having succeeded in showing
 that the heat at a point a little outside the geometrical shadow of an
 opaque body with a straight edge, was greater than at such a distance
 from the shadow that the influence         of the body   was insensible.
      On the 6th of May, 1 850, M. Foucault communicated to the French
 Academy an account of a highly ingenious and striking experiment
 relating to the velocity of light*.         The reflexion and refraction of
 light had long before been explained, both on the theory of emissions
 and on that of undulations. According to both theories, the velocity
 of light within    a refracting medium is different from the velocity in
 air  ; but according to the theory of emissions it is greater, in the
 ratio of the refractive index to unity,       while according to the theory
of undulations it     is less in the inverse ratio.     The progress of opti
cal science    had since been       such, that the theory of emissions was
almost abandoned, while the theory of                undulations      continually
gained fresh support from new phenomena.                 The   effect  of the in
terposition of    a thin transparent plate in the path          of  one   of two
interfering streams, which had been deemed a crucial experiment,
was wholly in favour       of the theory of undulations.         Still, the con
clusion was only an optical inference from the observed result               ; the
time of transit of the light did not intervene mechanically in the
experiment.     M. Arago had proposed to employ the revolving mirror
of Mr. Wheatstone to        decide the question mechanically,      in  a manner
closely resembling that employed by           Mr. Wheatstone in measuring
    * Comptes Rendus, tom. xxx.

the velocity of electricity, and had shown by numerical calculation
that with a high velocity of rotation the result would be sensible to
observation.  But the experiment proposed by M. Arago, though
the execution of it might not have been impossible, would at any
rate have been highly inconvenient                      for observation,           because     the
result depended            on the aspect      of       a momentary image appearing
casually at an unknown              instant in an unknown part of the field of
view, and it was never carried out.                The velocity of light had recently
been measured          directly for the first time by           M. Fizeau      ;    but in this
case the observed           time was that which light took to travel some
miles in air.   But by a highly ingenious contrivance, in which, by
the introduction of a concave mirror, he was able to produce a fixed
image    of                M. Foucault actually solved experiment
              a revolving image,
ally the question proposed for solution by M. Arago, though in a
manner totally different from that suggested                      by that distinguished
astronomer, and thus proved, for the first time by direct experiment,
that light is propagated more quickly in air than in water.
      On the 3rd of February,            1851,     M. Foucault communicated to the
French Academy*             an experiment which            has attracted more public
attention than perhaps any other of modern times,                        namely his cele
brated experiment of the pendulum.    The phenomena of astronomy
have long since proved the rotation of the earth ; but we, living on
it,are not sensible of that rotation.  In one experiment only had
the effect of the rotation been manifested, namely in the easterly
deflection of      a   body let fall from          a   great height.         But in this       case
the experiment could only be attempted in particular places, and the
result was only        a   small deflection, which was liable to be interfered
with by       a   variety of disturbing          causes.    But M. Foucault showed
that    a   pendulum       suspended so as to oscillate in all vertical planes
alike, withdrawn from the vertical, and then left to itself, became by
the very fact of its motion in some sense                  a   celestial body      ;   and while
the plane of motion tended to remain parallel to itself, and would
actually do so at either pole, the earth turned round under                              it,   and
thus the plane of motion was affected with an apparent rotation in
the direction, in our hemisphere, of the hands of                        a   watch, the velo
city of rotation decreasing from one turn in twenty-four hours at the
pole to zero at the equator, in proportion to the sine of the latitude,

                                        574
  and changing sign in passing into the southern hemisphere.                 This
 experiment, as is well known,           had actually been carried out by
 M. Foucault,      and has since been repeated by numbers          of others.
    More recently still, M. Foucault        has invented another instrument,
 which he calls a gyroscope, for the experimental demonstration of
 the earth's rotation.        The action of the instrument       depends on the
 fixity of the plane of rotation of a disk made to revolve with great
 rapidity about its axis. The instrument is quite small, and may be
 used   on a table, but requires great nicety of construction.                By
 availing himself of the precessional motion of the axis when the disk
 is acted on by     a  force tending to turn it about an equatorial axis,
 M. Foucault     is able, in consequence     of the construction of the instru
 ment, not only to exhibit the earth's rotation,          but also to determine
 experimentally the plane of the meridian and the latitude of the
 place.

    Your Council      have awarded one    of the Royal Medals for this year
to Mr. John Russell Hind, Superintendent of the Nautical Almanac,
for his researches and discoveries       in Astronomy      ; an award, which    I
feel sure  will  meet the warm concurrence         of the Society.
    Mr. Hind commenced his astronomical labours              as assistant to the
Astronomer      Royal,     to which office he was appointed in November
 1840.
    Mr. Hind held that situation during four            years, and was distin
guished by his punctuality, attention and zeal; moreover, he devoted
his leisure hours        to the careful    reading up of astronomy, both
practical   and theoretical     ; thereby familiarizing      himself   with the
various methods of observation and reduction, as well as the calculation
of orbits for   comets and double stars.         His first attempt   at positive
computation was an ephemeris of Bremicker's comet for 1840, which
Mr. Airy printed in the Greenwich Observations of that year. In
1844, on being applied to by Mr. George Bishop, —a Fellow of this

                                                 575
 Society, so well known for his attachment to science, and his muni
 ficence in furthering          it,  — the Astronomer Royal recommended Mr.
Hind for the practical charge of that gentleman's private observatory
in Regent's Park. It      for the observations made for Mr. Bishop,
                                    is
that the Council have made their award; and                     I     beg to enumerate          the
 principal.
     Mr. Hind        has     discovered        no fewer than ten            new    planets, and
computed the elements                 of their orbits — first from his own                 observa
tions, and again from those of other astronomers                        ;   and he has greatly
improved our knowledge of the motions of the other members of the
planetoid     al   group, by similar discussions,             in each case, of all avail
able data.
     He   has also discovered three new comets,                     and assisted       greatly in
procuring multiplied observations of them and of others, by his rapid
calculation and speedy publication                    of   successive       approximations       to
the elements of their orbits               ;   having thereby enabled              many comets
to be followed up through important portions of their paths, which
would       otherwise have been lost, — as witness the momentous and
then unique case of his comet of 1847, which was observed                                    at its
perihelion         passage     at noonday,        and in the immediate                 proximity
of the    sun, in consequence            of the accuracy of Mr. Hind's computed
places.
     With the powerful and efficient                  means     thus furnished             by Mr.
Bishop, this assiduous observer has, moreover, discovered two ellip
tical nebulae, and         a   remarkable variable star in Ophiuchus,                      which,
when first seen        in   April     1848, was    of   the fourth magnitude, and has
now diminished to the twelfth.                   He    has also noted the variability            of
other stars, including           the very remarkable changes                  in   S   Cancri, of
which he published an ephemeris.                        He    has   strengthened the evi
dence     of the    existence    of    a   physical connexion between the consti
tuents of binary stars           ;    and — with      Mr. Bishop — he has accurately
mapped and published, for the advantage                    of astronomers in general,
all the stars in      a   large part of the       ecliptic region of the sky, down to
and including        the eleventh          magnitude.        These maps cannot fail to
be of great utility in promoting the future discovery of planets and
asteroids in fact, of gleaning the heavens in that very interesting
            ;
department.          The     dates and names           of Mr. Hind's own discoveries

      Mr. Hind,
   Accept this Medal, which the Royal Society presents to you, by an
award which every astronomer will heartily confirm ; and I may add
our best wishes that length of years and renovated health may enable
your    enthusiastic zeal   and high talents to render further           aid to
science, to discharge,    with ever-augmenting     fame, the duties     of  the
responsible office which you occupy, and to reap additional honours
for yourself and country.
      Mr. Westwood,
   I have    the pleasure to inform you that the Council of the Royal
Society have awarded to you one       of the Royal Medals,       on account   of
your valuable and long-continued       researches    in Entomology.        The
Council have been led to this decision from the fact that you have
not confined your attention to any one region of the world, or to any
one   class   of insects, — extensive  as  these   classes    are, — but   have
grappled with the whole subject.       Besides  a large amount of system
atic work, you have particularly attended to the general principles
of classification, and to the various kinds of affinity by which all
organic beings are so curiously connected together ; and in your
study of different groups of insects you have carefully observed their
habits, economy, metamorphoses and geographical distribution.
   It is now nearly thirty years since you commenced the long series
of  papers    which are    well known to naturalists,      not only of this
country, but abroad     ; and that your writings have been appreciated
on the Continent has been shown by their frequent translation.
   Among your earlier labours, it is enough to refer to your well

                                     577
 known ' Modern Classification of Insects,' in which the whole subject
 is treated in a masterly manner, as has been acknowledged by many
 most competent judges who have since profited by your labours.            Of
 your more recent memoirs, which we have especially in view on this
 occasion,  I may specify as particularly    deserving of attention, those
 on the Cleridse, Lucanidee and Paussidae,      published in the Transac
 tions of the Linnean, Entomological       and Zoological Societies, your
                                                             *
 monographs on several Carabidous genera in Guerin's            Revue Zoolo-
 gique,' your contributions    to Fossil  Entomology     in the Journal of
 the Geological Society, and the completion      of the great work in folio
 commenced     by Mr. Doubleday on the genera of the Diurnal Lepi-
 doptera. Nor can I quite pass over your archaeological researches,
though these are not connected with the objects of this Society.
    Mr. Westwood, —This          Medal is presented to you in token of
the interest which we take in your entomological researches,          which
reflect so much honour on your talents and zeal.
                    Obituary notices  of deceased Fellows.
    Da. Martin Barry was born at Fratton, in Hampshire, on the 28th
of March, 1802. Though originally designed for a mercantile career,
his strong bent for scientific pursuits led to his embracing the medical
profession, for which he studied in the Universities         of Edinburgh,
Paris, Erlangen,     Heidelberg,  and Berlin, as well as    in some of the
medical schools of London.         He became     a member      of the Royal
College of Surgeons of Edinburgh,         and graduated as       M.D. in the
University of that city in 1833.       During the period of his student
ship he took an active part in the Medical,           Royal Physical, and
Wernerian     Societies of Edinburgh, of which he was a member, and
he was subsequently elected a      Fellow of  the  Royal Society of Edin
burgh.     His love of fine natural scenery, and pursuit of botany and
geology, led him to devote       his college vacations usually to excur
sions in the mountain and lake districts of Scotland           ; and, after a
session of study at Heidelberg     in 1834, he spent the autumn of that
year in a pedestrian tour through part of Switzerland.
    In the course of these wanderings     he arrived at Chamouni on the
                                                             3 b 2

                                            578
 15th of September, and, although it was then later in the season than
 any successful ascent of Mont Blanc had been achieved, Dr. Barry
 resolved upon the enterprise, and accomplished it with safety to him
 self and his guides.          His    was   the sixteenth    ascent that had been
 made   :  it occupied three days, owing to the unusual obstacles which
 the snow at that season presented              ; but the Doctor was rewarded by
 a magnificent view from the summit, and by weather so remarkably
 fine that   " during the whole time          he did not see a single cloud."     In
 March 1836, Dr. Barry published an account of this ascent, which
 formed the subject of two Lectures delivered by him in Edinburgh,
 the proceeds of which he presented to the Royal Infirmary of that city.
 Baron Humboldt so highly esteemed the narrative and its author, that
 he personally requested           Dr. Barry to translate from the German his
                  " Two attempts to           ascend Chimborazo."      This transla
 (the Baron's)
 tion appeared     in the Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal, 1837.
    The difficult and recondite subject of animal development                    and
 embryology early attracted the young physician's attention, and he
 made     himself intimately acquainted not only with the literature of
that department of physiology, but with the eminent authors of the
most valued works and treatises on those subjects.                 In the museums
 and laboratories        of Professors Wagner, Purkinje, Valentin, and
 Schwann,      Dr. Barry acquired that skill in microscopical investiga
tions of which he subsequently made such excellent use.
    He published      a translation       of the first part of 'Valentin's Manual
of the History of Development,' in the Edinburgh Medical and Sur
gical Journal for 1836.            From that period to 1840       he devoted him
self exclusively      to original       researches    on the development of the
mammalian ovum and embryo, which                    at the time when he took up
the subject was the           darkest part of embryological          science.   The
results of these researches           were communicated to the Royal Society
of London       in three successive memoirs, entitled " Researches in
                            '                   '
Embryology."          The     First Series        was printed in the Philosophical
                                       '
Transactions for 1838          ;  the    Second Series' in the volume for 1839      ;
the   '
        Third Series,' entitled " A Contribution             to the Physiology     of
Cells," in that for 1840.            In the   same year   Dr. Barry communicated
a  memoir " On       the  Corpuscles of the Blood," printed in the Philo
sophical Transactions            for   1840.      The Philosophical    Transactions
for 1841 contain his memoirs              " On the Formation of the Chorion,"

                                      579
" On   the Chorda dorsalis," and two supplementary              memoirs    " On
the Corpuscles of the Blood."           The volume of       the   Transactions
for 1842 contains his memoir " On Fibre," and that for 1843 his
capital discovery of the
                             " Spermatozoa found within the Ovum."
   These Researches in Embryology         contain a comprehensive, well-
selected and well-conducted series of original experiments and obser
vations on the formation and earlier stages           of development of the
ovum in the Rabbit and Dog, and in examples of the oviparous verte
brate classes from the bird to the fish.       In  the first series the author
determined the order of formation of the different parts of the ovum,
and the nature and mode           of development of the vesicle called
' ovisac,' in which those                                He made known the
                             processes take place.
nature and traced the development of the so-called
                                                               "  disc of Von
Baer," and detected in it       a peculiar mechanism (retinacula)        which
he supposed     mainly to regulate the transit of the ovum into the
Fallopian    tube.    In   the    second   series    Dr.   Barry    traced the
changes which the ovum undergoes in its passage through                the  Fal
lopian tube   ; the earliest and most interesting stages of mammalian
development being for the first time described in this memoir.              The
important discovery of the segmentation of the yelk of the mamma
lian ovum is communicated in this memoir (1839), in which he first
extended to that class the observation of a phenomenon which had
previously been known only in the Batrachia.            Dr. Barry's discovery
made on the ovum of the Rabbit, was subsequently confirmed by
Prof. Bischoff, in  the ovum of the Dog and Guinea- pig.
   Another most important observation, communicated by Dr. Barry
to the Royal Society, in his Third Series, 1840, of the penetration
by the spermatozoon of the ovum in the Rabbit, by an aperture in
the zona pellucida, was of so minute and difficult a kind that it did
not at once command assent.           In  1843,   Dr. Barry, however, pub
lished a confirmatory       observation, which      he   had then made,       of
spermatozoa within the ovum of the Rabbit, taken from the Fallo
pian tube and in process of segmentation.
   These    statements at first met with positive denial by Professor
Bischoff, who had failed in his attempts to repeat Dr. Barry's obser
vations  : and it was not until nine years afterwards that the observa
tions of Dr. Nelson, on the impregnation           of the Ascaris mystax*,
                      * Philosophical Transactions,  1851.

                                       580
 gave a corroboration of the fact     of the penetration of   the ovum by the
 spermatozoa.       Mr. Newport next discovered the spermatozoa within
 the ovum of the     Frog.    Meissner soon after confirmed the fact that
 the spermatozoon penetrates the        interior of the ovum    of  the Rabbit;
 and, finally, Prof. Bischoff satisfied himself of the truth of Dr. Barry's
 discovery, which he had been the first to call in question.
    Dr. Martin Barry was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of
 London on the 13th of February, 1840, and so highly were his com
 munications    esteemed     by the Society,    that the Royal Medal was
 awarded to him, November 30th, 1839.
    Dr. Barry's embryological       researches   were followed     by observa
 tions on the formation and changes of the primitive               cells in the
 origin and growth of the tissues of the animal body, and he arrived
at new and important        conclusions on the importance and functions
 of the cell-nucleus.
    In his memoir " On Fibre," Dr. Barry first promulgated his views
 as to the ultimate      spiral structure of the muscular fibre       ; and he
 subsequently extended the same views to most of the tissues of orga
nized bodies.       These opinions have not been confirmed or accepted
by histologists   ;  although   Dr. Barry    had  latterly the satisfaction of
citing  a few microscopical      observations of eminent botanists which
seemed to lend support to certain applications          of his favourite   idea.
" Now     that he is no more,"        writes an eminent physiologist,        " it
will  be more pleasing to endeavour to extract that which was good
and true in his works, rather than discuss their doubtful and con
tested points."      And Professor Allen Thomson, in        the same biogra
phical sketch, writes,
                             " It cannot     be doubted    that Dr.     Barry's
researches    as a whole    gave   a  decided  impulse to the progress of
knowledge     in the departments of which          they treat, partly by the
actual contribution      of new and valuable facts, and partly by the
ingenuity of his speculative views, the vigour with which they were
supported, and the discussions to which they gave rise."
    Dr. Barry's latest contributions        to science   were chiefly notices
and comments on the observations          of other histologists   and physio
logists, which appeared to confirm or countenance his views of the
cell-nucleus,   the primitive    fibre, and the penetration of the zona
pellucida by the spermatozoon.
                                        " The  last few months of his life
were employed in a review of his microscopic observations, and in

                                       581
forming,   at the request of foreign          physiologists,     an abstract of
them, to be published       in Germany.         Some portion of this work
occupied his last hours, and he appeared to have a satisfaction in
having done with it, as one leaving the world           *."
   The private circumstances of Dr. Martin Barry were such                   as
enabled him to dispense with the pursuit               of the practice of his
profession  as a means     of support.       The proportion of his time so
saved was devoted to the poor, and chiefly in connexion with some
public institution.    In the year 1844, after the publication of his
most original   and important       observations, and after receiving       the
high testimonial    of the Royal Medal from the Royal Society of
London, he   accepted the office of House-surgeon to the Royal Ma
 ternity Hospital in Edinburgh; and Professor Simpson, the director
of the institution,   speaks      of Dr. M. Barry         as   " our invaluable
house-surgeon,    and a gentleman to whose talents, zeal,              and hu
manity the hospital is deeply indebted for its prosperity."             Dr. M.
Barry reared up diligent students, notwithstanding the harassing
nature of the duties of a midwifery pupil ; and his kindness,
promptness, and unweariedness           in rendering aid to the poor dis
tressed parturient females in Edinburgh have made his name still
gratefully remembered amongst them.
   From 1849 to 1853, Dr. Barry's health, and especially his eye
sight, having become      affected    by his close and persevering studies,
he was induced to return to the continent, and resided successively
at Gottingen,   Giessen, Breslau, and Prague.            At the latter city he
resumed his microscopic         studies of muscular        fibre, with the co
operation of his friend Professor Purkinje          ; and the result of their
combined researches    is given in Miiller's Archives for 1850, and in
a translated abstract   in the Philosophical       Journal for August 1852.
   In that year    he revisited     Scotland,    and resided occasionally in
Arran, Rothesay,     and Edinburgh.          His friends deeply grieved to
witness, in his emaciated     frame, the evidence of progressive malady.
He suffered much from neuralgic pains, being deprived, therefrom,
of rest for nights in succession. In the autumn of 1853 he finally
took up his abode      at Beccles,       Suffolk,    near his brother-in-law.
Dr. Dashwood, who married Dr. Barry's only sister. Soothed and
sustained by the devoted attention of his affectionate relatives, he

  lingered, with intellect       unimpaired,     and    power of labour little
  abated,   until the 27th of April, 1855.          On that day, in the imme

                                        " All  is peace   ;

  now   ;"  and soon afterwards passed away, full of a Christian's            hope.
      Sin Henry Thomas De           la Bechb,     C.B., F.R.S., F.G.S., Corr.
 Memb. of the Academy of Sciences of Paris, &c.                  &c, was born in
 London, February       10, 1796,     married in 1818,      received knighthood
 in   1842,  was nominated       C.B.  in 1848, and died          April  13,  1855.
 His education was conducted partly at home, partly at Keynsham and
 Ottery St. Mary, till in 1810 or 181 1 he went to the Military College
 at Marlow.       In 1817 he became       F.G.S., and was admitted F.R.S.
 in 1819.      From this   epoch    the prevalent bias       of his mind toward
 Natural Science was manifested in         a long series    of valuable contribu
 tions to Geology, for the most part founded on personal research in
 districts to which he was ever partial, attached by early associations
 or allured by the instincts of an artist.
     The southern    coasts of   England and Wales          offered to the young
 and zealous student      a series  of interesting phenomena, at that time
 little explored, — rocks of sedimentary origin, exhibited in unusual
 circumstances     ; an   uncommon       variety of     granites,     greenstones,
 porphyries,     and other rocks of fusion       ;   singular complications      of
 mineral veins,      modern land- slips,      ancient upheavings         of strata,
 and undescribed organic remains.              To all of     these   De la Beche
 brought a mind prepared       ;  they became for him the main object of
 his observation and meditation         ;  he returned to them again and
 again, fortified by the experience gathered in other parts of the
 world, and supported by the scientific alliance and strong personal
regard of Buckland        and Conybeare.        Here was the centre of his
field of inquiry, here his scientific life began, here he earned his fame,
and it was while         meditating    and directing      new     labours in this
favourite region, that he sunk to his long repose.

    The natural history of the same region had other charms for the
enterprising spirit of De la Beche. To dredge the sea, to gather
the living wonders of the deep, suited the bold swimmer and skilful
boatman      ;  to examine the structure and habits of marine creatures
was not less congenial to the microscopic observer and the accurate
and forcible artist. The        " Notes on the Habits of a Caryophyllia from
             "                                   "
Torquay         (Zool. Journ. 1828), and the Catalogue of the Birds and
Mollusca in the vicinity of Geneva," are indeed all that remain to
mark the strong interest felt by De la Beche in recent Natural
History    ;   but they who have accompanied him over miles of land
and sea know well the untiring delight with which,                 even   in later
life, he would scrutinize the isochronous movements of Rhizostoma,—
the varying hues of Octopus,         — the sensibility to light of the Bryozoa,
— how sharp his attention to the peculiar instincts of the animal
creation.
    To such      a mind came       easily and naturally the inquiry      into the
 osteological relations of the huge fossil reptilia, so long known, but
 so  little understood by the collectors of fossils at Bath, Glastonbury

                                         584
and Lyme Regis, — an inquiry which in the hands of Conybeare and
De la Beche gave us the Plesiosaurus, that singular                " link between
Ichthyosaurus      and Crocodile." (Geol. Trans. 1823, 1 ser. v.)
   Love of scenery and ill-health induced him to prolonged residence
abroad, and in 1819 and subsequent years we find him mapping
and sounding the lake of Geneva — in            1 823,   tracing the geology of
the north coast of France, examining the fossil plants of the Col de
Balme — in 1824,       1825,     exploring  the geology of Jamaica,         where
lay his paternal estates     — in 1828 and    1830, reporting on the geology
of Nice and the Gulf of La Spezia.
    In the midst of all his pleasant labour, De la Beche found time to
prepare selections from the valuable memoirs in the Ann. des Mines
(1824);      'A Tabular View of the Classification of Rocks' (1827)               ;
                        '
'Geological       Notes    (1830) ; 'Sections and Views of Geological
                '                                      '
Phenomena ( 1 830) ; 'A Geological Manual ( 1 83 1 ) ; ' Researches
                              '                                  '
in Theoretical Geology (1834) ; * How to Observe (1835) ; * The
Geological      Observer'    (1851).      He officiated as Secretary of the
Geological Society (1831), as Foreign Secretary from 1835 to 1846,
and as President, 1848 and 1849.            He was appointed Corresponding
Member of the Academy of Sciences in 1853.
   But the most important results of the labours of this eminent
observer    are contained       in those valuable Geological         Maps of the
British Isles, which have been prepared partly by his hands, but
entirely by his direction.
   That which      had been vainly solicited      by the interests of agricul
ture in 1805, was conceded to the urgency of geology in 1832                 : the
'
  Ordnance Geological Survey' was begun, with De la Beche for its
head    or rather only officer, in the mining districts of Devon and
Cornwall.       From this    epoch    began a new era of British Geology,
characterized by a minuteness of field surveying previously unknown,
by exact measurements of the thickness and inclination of strata,
by published maps         and sections of unequalled truth            and beauty.
De la Beche's maps of the great western district,            — one of the most
difficult   tracts in Britain for the geological           surveyor, —appeared
with   a valuable explanatory         report in 1839.       In the     map  which
accompanies the volume, the older strata of North and South Devon
              '
are called      Grauwacke.'       Their true relation to      the old red sand
stone   groups, suggested         by Lonsdale,   Murchison,      and Sedgwick,

                                         585
was adopted in 1840 by the Director of the Survey, and made the
subject of   a separate   volume drawn up by one of his friends.
    From Cornwall and Devon the ' Ordnance Geological Survey'
 was transferred to South Wales, and before the close of 1841, the
 Director, with his staff of geologists, had measured               the Palaeozoic
 strata in all the cliffs of Pembrokeshire, and constructed maps ex
tending from St. Bride's Bay to the sources                  of the Usk.     In this
large area the problem of the succession of strata has a different
 aspect from that which         is presented in the eastern and northern
 parts of the Principality, and the distribution             of ancient life offers
 many points for inquiry.         These phenomena were discussed in the
early memoirs of the Geological            Survey,     after an opportunity had
been afforded of comparing them in detail              with   the typical   Silurian
tracts of Malvern       and Ludlow,         rendered      famous by the earlier
labours of Murchison.
    Those who at this time shared the society of Sir Henry De la
Beche in the field, experienced an enjoyment                   of no common de
scription.     Ill-health, the    cares    of office,   anxieties of every kind,
were   swept away by the mountain wind,                or forgotten      amidst the
glancing waves      ; every day brought new facts to an indefatigable
observer, new scenes of beauty to an enthusiast in art, new occa
sions   for   profound reflection, sagacious           inference,    and   practical
instruction    to his young companions.              In after-years the Survey
became too extended to admit          of the    same personal superintendence
                                              '
in every part.      Separated from the          Ordnance Survey'        in 1845, it
assumed     the shape of a department,            received local Directors        for
England and Ireland,       an augmented staff, laboratory,           lecture-room,
and museum in London.
    Over all this large establishment, the realization of his own plan.
Sir H. T. De la Beche presided with           the unflagging resolution which
had brought it into being, — presided, indeed, too long.              The strength
which grew under the        hammer, and rejoiced in long days of wan
dering over rocky hills, faded away among the official niceties and
impediments of his great office        ;  but he clung to his self-destroying
work, and had before         his death the satisfaction of seeing in full
operation that Mining School,            that Palaeontological Museum, that
systematic field geology,          and professional        teaching    in practical
science  which he had kept steadily in prospect for twenty years.

                                        586
     In Sir Henry De la Beche, an active, prudent, and successful
  administrator     has been withdrawn      from the public service   ; but   a
 far heavier loss is deplored in that branch of science           in which he
 won his renown, and whose foremost cultivators were his friends,
 fellow-labourers,      and disciples.
    Mr. Bryan Donkin            was born at Sandoe, Northumberland,        on
 the 22nd of March,       1 768.   His taste for science and mechanics soon
 showed    itself ;   and he was, almost as a child, continually        to be
 found in his little workshop, making          thermometers and ingenious
 contrivances connected with machinery of all kinds.           This mechani
 cal turn of mind was ultimately encouraged by his father, who was
 agent for the Errington and other estates, and who had formed the
 acquaintance of       John Smeaton, the eminent engineer, from having
 frequent    occasion     to consult   him   on questions   relating  to the
 bridges and other works on the Tyne.
     On leaving home, the son began life in the same business as his
 father, being engaged for a year or two as Land Agent to the
Duke of Dorset at Knowle Park, Kent.             Soon, however, the bent of
his genius showed itself, by his leaving the Duke's             agency, and
going to consult Mr. Smeaton as to the best course to pursue to
become     an   engineer.        By Smeaton's recommendation, he ap
prenticed himself to Mr. Hall, of Dartford, and was soon able to
take an active part in Mr. Hall's works; so that, in 1801-2, he
was entrusted principally         with the construction of   a model   of the
first machine for making paper, the execution of which had been
put into  Mr. Hall's hands by the Messrs. Fourdrinier.
    The idea of this machine originated with Mr. Roberts, and formed
the subject of a patent obtained by Mr. Gamble, which was assigned
to Messrs.     Bloxam       and  Fourdrinier.   After  some  time had been
spent and considerable expense incurred, many attempts were made
to set the model to work, but in none of these trials was any paper
produced fit for sale.
    The model remained at Mr. Hall's works until 1802, when Mr.
Donkin agreed with Messrs. Bloxam and Fourdrinier to take the
matter in hand       ;  and, having taken premises at Bermondsey (still
occupied by his sons), he made a machine, and erected it, in 1804,
at Frogmore,    Herts.       On putting this machine   to work, it was found

                                         587
 successful, but yet far from perfect.           A second machine was       made
 by Mr. Donkin, and       erected,   in 1805, atTwowaters, Herts, in which
 he introduced further         improvements, although much still remained
 to be done. However, in 1810, eighteen of these complex machines
 had been erected at various mills, some of which are even now at
 work  ;   and, at this period, having overcome the practical difficulties,
 Mr. Donkin erected in this, and various foreign countries, many si
 milar machines, which rapidly superseded the method of making paper
 by hand.       Thus for eight years Mr. Donkin          gave his time and   skill
almost wholly to this one object          ;  and his perseverance   was crowned
 with signal success ; for, although the original idea was not his,
 the credit of its entire practical development is due to Mr. Donkin.
    The paper machine, of which at this time about two hundred
 have been made and erected by Mr. Donkin and his sons, ranks
 amongst      the most     useful    and complete       of mechanical     contri
 vances  ;  carrying    the process     uninterruptedly    from the liquid pulp
 to the perfect sheet of paper, ready for writing or printing.               The
 merit of these and of the later improvements introduced                  by the
 Messrs. Donkin was recognized by the award of the Council Medal
at the Great Exhibition of 1851.
    Mr. Donkin was        also   one  of the earliest to introduce improve
 ments   in printing machinery.             In 1813, he, in conjunction with
 Mr. Bacon,      secured   a patent for his Polygonal        printing machine    ;
and one was erected for the Cambridge             University. It was then    also
he invented and first used the composition printing-rollers,            by which
some   of   the greatest difficulties hitherto experienced in        printing by
machines were overcome.
   Mr. Koenig and Mr. Cowper both used these rollers in their
patent printing-machines,           with Mr. Donkin's permission, which
must be considered an act of the greatest liberality,             since without
these rollers no such machine can work.               With the Polygonal ma
chine, from 800 to 1000 impressions were produced per hour; but it
never came into extensive use, as the construction was expensive,
while the work produced was of               a quality beyond that required    in
machine printing.
   Mr. Donkin was        also much engaged        with Sir William Congreve,
in 1820, in contriving        a  method of printing stamps in two colours,
with compound plates, for the prevention of forgery             ; and, with the

                                        588
  aid of  Mr. Wilks, who       was then his partner, he produced the beau
  tiful machine now      used at the Excise and Stamp Offices, and by the
  East India Company at Calcutta.
      Amongst the many inventions and ingenious processes in the pro
  motion of which Mr. Donkin materially assisted, was the method of
  preserving meats and vegetables         in air-tight     cases.   His attention
  was called to this subject in the year 1812, when he established                 a
  considerable manufactory for this purpose in Bermondsey.                  The in
  troduction of this process has been of great public benefit             ;  and on
  long sea voyages meat preserved        in this way     has become a necessary
 part of the stores of every well-appointed           vessel.
      Mr. Donkin was        an   early member of the Society           of Arts, of
 which he was one of the Vice-Presidents             ;  and   as Chairman of the
 Committee       of Mechanics,      an office   he held for many years, the
 soundness of his judgment           and the urbanity of his manners made
 him much esteemed           and beloved.      He received two gold          medals
 from    the Society     ;   one  for  his invention      of an instrument       to
 measure     the velocity of rotation       of machinery,       the other for his
 admirable counting engine.
     Although our     space   will not allow   us to notice the various other
 inventions and improvements in machinery due to                  Mr. Donkin, we
 cannot pass over in silence his exquisite dividing and screw- cutting
 engine.
     Mr. Donkin was much engaged during the last forty years of his
 life as a civil engineer, and was one of the originators and a Vice-
 President    of  the  Institution of Civil Engineers, which was founded
by one     of his pupils, Mr. Henry Palmer, with a few other gentle
men    ; and  Mr. Telford with Mr. Donkin obtained the Royal Charter
for that body.         In 1838 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal
 Society,    and repeatedly served        on  the Council.        He was also a
member of the Royal Astronomical              Society,    and was held in such
esteem by that body, that they placed him          in the Chair on the occasion
of receiving their Charter.          He had, moreover,        a small observatory
in his garden, where        he spent much     of his leisure time    ; and it was
to his own transit         that he first applied his novel and beautiful
level.
     For many years Mr. Donkin was a magistrate for the county of
Surrey, and, up to within a short time of his death, was very

                                     589
regular and assiduous in the discharge of his duties.               His life was
one uninterrupted     course  of usefulness and good purpose             ;  and he
died on the 27th of February,          1855, after enjoying          that general
esteem and respect which render old age serene and happy.
   It is now more than sixty years since      Charles Frederic Gauss,              a
young student resident in the city of Brunswick, hit upon an import
ant theorem in the theory of numbers.             His father        was    a brick
layer in very humble circumstances, who was anxious that his son
should follow his own occupation          ; but the extraordinary capacity
of the boy, at that time attending the National School, had attracted
the attention of Bartels, afterwards Professor at Dorpat and the
father-in-law of the great Astronomer Struve          ;   and it was upon his
recommendation that the reigning Duke, in spite of the opposition
of  the father, provided him    with the    means  of   a   good classical edu
cation, by sending him to the Collegium          Carolinum,        and by many
subsequent acts    of kindness and patronage.        The proposition which
he had discovered, appeared       to its author to be one of no ordinary
beauty   ; and as he conjectured that it was connected with others of
still greater value and generality, he applied — as he himself assures
us — all the powers of his mind to find out the principles upon which
it rested and to establish its truth           by a rigid demonstration.
Having fully    succeeded   in this object, he felt himself so completely
fascinated by this class of researches,      that he found it impossible to
abandon them, and he was thus conducted from one truth to another,
until  he had finished the greatest part of the first and most original,           if
not the greatest, of his works, before he had read the writings of any
of his precursors in this department of science, more especially those
of Euler and La Grange. The subsequent study of the arithmetical
researches of these great masters of analysis could hardly fail to expose
him to the mortification which young men of premature and creative
genius have so often experienced, of finding that they have been anti
cipated in some of their finest speculations.         So far, however, from
being repelled by this discovery,
                                     " I became,"  says he,
                                                                 " animated with
fresh ardour, and by treading in their footsteps,         I  felt fortified in my
resolution to push forward the boundaries of this wide department of
science." The crowning result of his labours was, as is well known,
the complete solution of binomial equations, and a most unexpected

                                          590
 extension of the limits within which the geometrical division of the
 circle had hitherto been confined        ; a discovery sufficiently memorable
 to form    a great epoch in the history of the progress of geometry and
 analysis, and to place its author, in the estimation of the few persons
 who would appreciate its value, in the highest rank of the mathe
 maticians of his age.
    In dedicating his       *
                              Disquisitiones    Arithmeticae' to the Duke of
 Brunswick,      he acknowledges        in very touching terms the wise and
liberal patronage which had not only provided for the expenses of
 publishing his work, but also enabled him to exchange permanently
 the humble pursuits of trade for those of science.            The work itself,
as its author assures us, assumed           many changes of form in its pro
 gress to maturity, as new views presented themselves              from time to
 time to his mind      ; but, as is well known, the course which is fol
 lowed in the invention          of new truths is rarely that which is most
favourable to clearness in their exposition, more especially when it
has been pursued in solitude,           with little communication with other
minds    ;  whilst the peculiar terminology which he has employed in
the classification     of numbers and their relations, and which is so
completely embodied        in the enunciation and demonstration of nearly
every proposition that it can never be absent from the mind of the
reader, renders the study of this work so laborious and embarrassing,
that few persons have ever mastered            its contents.    Even Legendre,
who had written so much and so successfully on the same subject,
and who, in the second edition of his ' Theorie des Nombres,' makes
the great discovery which this work contains the occasion not merely
of special investigation but of the most emphatic praise, complains of
the great difficulty of adapting its forms of exposition to his own ;

whilst     the writers   of the        Biographie   des Contemporains,'     in a
notice of the author at        a much later period, when he had established
many other and almost equally unquestionable claims to immortality,
quote an extract from         a  Report of  a Commission     of the Institute of
France, to whom it was referred in 1810, in which it is said,              " that
it was impossible for them to give an idea of this work, inasmuch as
everything in it is new, and surpasses our comprehension even in its
language."        The biographers then proceed to stigmatize the book
as  full of puerilities, and refer to the      success which   it had obtained,
including     its translation     into two languages, as affording grounds

                                       591
  for the presumption that      " charlatanism sometimes extended        even to
  the domain of the mathematics."
      The first day of the present century   was signalized by the discovery
  of the planet Ceres at Palermo, and before the first observations of
 the discoverer — only two in number — had been made known to astro
 nomers, the planet had ceased to be observable from her proximity
 to the sun.     The planet Uranus had       been   discovered twenty years
 before,   when near opposition     ; this was a critical position, which at
 once gave     a near approximation to the elements of his orbit       :  a sta
 tionary elongation of Ceres, though less fertile in its results, was
 sufficient to assign her such    a place between Mars and Jupiter as was
 required to satisfy Bode's singular law, the recent announcement of
 which had already stimulated an enthusiastic band of German astro
 nomers to commence        a systematic search for the planet, which Kepler
 had found wanting for the fulfilment of one of that series of cosmical
 speculations which had guided him to the discovery of his laws.            The
 complete determination, however, of the elements of a planet's orbit
 from three geocentric longitudes and latitudes — or from four of the
 first and two of the second in those cases where the latitudes are
 evanescent or small — was still therefore a new problem which had
 only been completely solved in the case of comets moving in para
 bolic orbits, and which Newton, to whom its first solution was due,
 had pronounced to be problema omnium longe difficillimum.
     It was not until the month of October following the discovery of
 Ceres, that Gauss came into possession of the requisite observations,
and in the course of      a  few weeks he had determined the elements of
her orbit with an accuracy fully commensurate with the observations            ;
so much so, indeed, that the Baron de Zach was enabled to rediscover
the planet at the very first attempt which he made for that purpose
on the 7th of December following.           The elements of Pallas, Juno,
and Vesta, the discovery of which followed that of Ceres at no great
distance of time, were promptly determined by methods substantially
the same, but materially improved by new artifices and adaptations
of  formulae which an enlarged study and application had enabled           him
to give them.
    The " Theoria motuum corporum          coelestium  in conicis sectionibus

these methods and their detailed exemplifications, but a most elabo-

 rate discussion of the various problems which present themselves in
 the determination of the movements of planets and comets from ob
 servations made on them under any circumstances, was not published
 before 1809.      Gauss was not usually very prompt in making public
 his researches,    but retained them in his own hands until, by repeated
 correction and examination, they had assumed a form which satisfied
 his own judgment         of what was equally due to the requirements of
 science and his own honour           ;   and the work of which we are now
 speaking exhibits,      in  a very remarkable      degree, the effects of this
 severe system of revision,       in the skilful adaptation and reduction of
 methods and formulae,        and   in the careful estimate of      the circum
  stances under which they may be most advantageously employed.
  We find in it no evasion of difficulties, and no resort to methods of
 approximation only, when the means of accurate determination are
 at hand.       His aim was in every instance to obtain results of the
 same   order of correctness with the observations upon which they were
 founded   ;   and with a view of securing the full benefit of observations
 which furnish, as is usual in astronomy, data more numerous than
 the unknown elements which they are required to determine, he has
 given in the work which we are now considering the first completely
 developed theory of the method of least squares,            more   especially as
 applicable to astronomy, and of the means of estimating the degree
 or measure of precision which its application affords          ; and though he
  was anticipated    in the publication of this method by Legendre, there
 is every reason to believe that it was with him an original discovery ;
 for he is said to have been in possession of it as early as 1795.            No
 other work in later times has contributed            so much as this to the
 complete and scientific discussion of astronomical observations           ;  and
 its influence is traceable in the form which           those  discussions have
 assumed     in the writings of Bessel, Hansen, Struve, Encke, and other
 eminent astronomers, which have done so much honour to Germany.
     It would be impossible in the brief space allowed for this notice to
 pass in review Gauss's various essays on subjects          of pure and applied
 mathematics — some of them of great importance — which were               gene
 rally communicated to the Royal Society of Gottingen, though most
 of them were separately published : amongst them we find two de
monstrations of the resolvability of equations with rational terms
into simple or quadratic factors        ;  others on magic squares    ; on qua-

                                            593
 dratic residuals    ;   on a new method of determining integrals by ap
proximation founded on Newton's method for that purpose                        ; on the
theory of curve surfaces          ;  on the theory of capillary attraction, and
on various subjects in dioptrics and astronomy               :  there is one memoir
of more than common interest,                devoted   to the demonstration of         a
very remarkable proposition in the planetary theory, which is, that
the secular variations which the elements of the orbit of a planet
would experience from another planet which                      disturbs it, are the
same as   if the mass       of the disturbing planet were distributed into           an
elliptic ring coincident with its orbit, in such               a manner that equal
masses of the    ring would correspond to portions of the orbit described
in equal times.
    It was in  the course        of this last investigation that he arrived at
some elliptic integrals, the evaluation of which he was enabled to
effect by means of a transformation which is included in one of the
series of transformations, the discovery            of which will immortalize       the
name of    Jacobi.       It  has been said — though we do not vouch for the
truth of the anecdote — that this distinguished                analyst was induced
by his knowledge of this fact to seek — after his own discoveries
were completed — an interview with the great mathematician who
had thus intruded, prematurely as               it were, into one of the deepest
recesses   of his own province         : Jacobi submitted his various theorems
to his inspection, and was met, as they successively appeared,                       by
others of corresponding             character and import         produced from his
manuscript     stores, concluding with an intimation                 that there were
still many   more      in reserve.       Such    an anticipation       of discoveries,
which    totally   changed the aspect            of this difficult     department of
analysis, even    if it had     been as complete as      it is  here represented to
have   been,    would       have    been   no derogation       of the rights which
Jacobi   has undeniably secured            by priority of publication        ;  but the
wide circulation which has been given to this story, as well as our
own knowledge of Gauss's habitual delay in the publication of his
researches, have tended not a little to increase our anxiety to be put
in  possession   of    the various scientific treasures which            he is said to
have left behind him.           It is to Lejeune Dirichlet that this task           has
been entrusted, and there are few            living analysts    so  likely to perform
it satisfactorily.
   We now enter upon the last, and perhaps                 the    most considerable
                                                                        3  f 2

  of Gauss's researches, which are contained in his various essays,
  both theoretical and practical, on the magnetism of the earth.
     Of   the three magnetic elements, the declination, the dip, and the
  intensity, the two first were       formerly the almost exclusive objects
  of observation, though        the methods which were employed for that
  purpose were generally too rude for the requirements of accurate
  science    ; but the third, or magnetic intensity, of which no use had
  been made in the business of navigation, was entirely neglected.
     Humboldt      first called the attention of philosophers to the great
 theoretical     importance of this element, and he omitted no oppor
  tunity, in the course of his travels, of determining its value.
     It was during his Arctic voyages that the attention of Colonel
  Sabine had been forcibly called to the consideration of this subject
 by the remarkable magnetical phenomena observed when approach
 ing the magnetic pole       ; and it was principally due to his influence and
 example, and to the labours of Hansteen, Erman, and other eminent
 travellers and navigators, that observations of the intensity            were
 rapidly multiplied       in every part of the globe, and more especially
 in Siberia, which had been generally believed           to be the site of a
 second      northern magnetic pole.       These observations, 753 in num
 ber,   in 670 different localities, were collected, arranged, and dis
 cussed     in an admirable report which was made by Colonel Sabine
 to the   British Association      in 1837 ;  and it is not one of the least
of the many claims of its author upon the gratitude                 of  men  of
science,       more especially in connexion       with magnetic researches,
 that it not only suggested to Gauss       — as he himself declares — his bold
attempt to grapple with the general theory of terrestrial magnetism,
but furnished him with the materials for testing the applicability at
least,    if not for establishing the truth, of the theory which            he
proposed.
    The observations of the terrestrial intensity which had hitherto
been made were comparative only, and it was with a view of con
verting such comparative into absolute measures,            with  reference to
determinate units, that Gauss undertook the series of investigations
which are recorded in his memoir, entitled " Intensitas vis magneticae
terrestris ad mensuram absolutam revocata," which was published in
1832.       He was   assisted  in these experiments, as in all others that he
made, by Weber, a philosopher who is well known by his              " Wellen

                                        595
lehre,"     written in conjunction     with his brother, as well as by many
other works of his own, but who felt that he was honoured by the
privilege of combining his labours with those of so great a master.
The units of      reference   which were chosen by Gauss were the milli
metre in length,          the milligramme      in weight,     and the second in
time   ;   and the horizontal      intensity at Gottingen,        in terms of these
units, was found to be         T7625, which gives, assuming               a     dip of 68°
 1',
 a     total intensity represented by 4-7414.
   It followed,    as another consequence of this inquiry, and which may
serve to give us     a   conception of the vast forces with which we have
to deal, that the magnetism of the earth might be replaced in exter
nal space by the combined action of 8464 trillions of magnet bars,
with parallel axes of the weight of one pouud each or,         we          ;        if
should assume       the    magnetism of the earth to be uniformly distri
buted throughout its substance, the magnetism contained in four cubic
feet of its matter would be nearly equivalent to one such magnet.
   The publication of this memoir,            a model of the union of experi
mental and theoretical         research, produced no ordinary effect                 upon
men of science, particularly         in Germany.       It   was felt that the time
had arrived when the same precision which had thus been found to be
attainable in the absolute determination               of   one    of     the    magnetic
elements, would not only be equally so in the determination of the
others, but also of the changes, whether periodical or occasional,
which      they were known or suspected to undergo.                     Were      the dis
turbances of the needle, which had been observed to be produced at
distant places by the aurora borealis, or other less manifest causes,
absolutely      simultaneous   ;    or were they       not so     ?   A         magnetical
observatory, for the purpose of making                 the observations which
these inquiries     suggested, was established at GOttingen, under the
superintendence       of Gauss and Weber,           by whom also instruments
were designed which were capable of giving results incomparably
more accurate than any which had hitherto been attained.                           Obser
vatories on the same model were formed in various cities in Ger
many, and ultimately at Greenwich             ;   the members also of a widely-
spread magnetical association engaged themselves to make simul
taneous observations on certain term-days and hours                   ;    and the fine
series     of magnetical observatories which           were subsequently esta
blished at the Cape of Good Hope, Hobarton, Toronto, and elsewhere,

                                      590
and   furnished in almost every instance with              a numerous and well-
organized staff of observers, was the final triumph of a system which
had originated     at Gottingen,      and which         has already     sufficiently
pointed out the general laws, as well as the anomalies of magnetic
action, though unhappily        it  has hitherto       left the physical causes
which give rise to them almost entirely untouched.
   We    have already referred to the circumstances which                suggested
the celebrated Memoir       " On the Theory of         the Earth's   Magnetism,"
which was published in 1839.            There     is, properly speaking, only
one    known    physical principle which       can     be assumed     for its basis,
which is the variation of the magnetic forces, according to the in
verse   square   of their distances.       It is this principle which brings
into operation a function, named by later writers the potential func
tion,   which had been      already extensively used            by La Place and
Poisson     in some of their most       difficult   investigations     arising out
of the theory of gravitation.         The differential coefficients of this
function would express the coordinate components which determine
the direction and intensity of the earth's magnetism, and provided
they were known, they would assign the three elements which we
are   in search   of ; but inasmuch       as the law       of the distribution     of
magnetism within the earth is altogether unknown, so likewise                      is
the form of its potential function, and the process              of deduction of
the   conclusions which we are required to draw from it would thus
appear    to be stopped at its origin.          Yet there      are   some    general
properties of the function       itself, and some also which are dedu-
cible from the known         conditions     which     it is required     to satisfy,
which have enabled this great master of his art, with singular saga
city and skill, to make      even   the dumb to speak, and to give re
sponses    which are of the highest philosophical import.
   Such is the clear conception,          which he educes from it, of the
characteristic property of a magnetic pole, and the necessary con
sequence resulting from it, that there can be only one northern and
one southern pole     ; and the consequent effectual dissipation of the
conclusion which so many eminent philosophers had drawn from their
observations, that there were two northern,                and by a natural      in
ference,   therefore, two southern magnetic poles.             Such also was the
remarkable     proposition,   that   if the component of           the   horizontal
magnetic force directed towards the north was given for the whole

                                       597
surface of     the   earth,   then    the   horizontal    component    directed
towards the east or west would follow of itself             ; and not less re
markable was the consequence deducible from this, that the know
ledge of the value of the potential           function which the horizontal
 component, as above        stated,  would furnish      for all points   of the
 earth's surface, would also give its value for all points of external
space.    But of all    the conclusions      which this memoir contained,
 those which    excited the most sanguine hopes of the ultimate and
complete solution of the great problem of the earth's magnetism,
were the successive       theorems in which he showed that the com
ponents of the magnetic force for any point of the earth's surface
may be represented by combining, with given functions of the lati
tude and longitude      of that point, certain constant coefficients — of
which not more than twenty-four were likely to be required — which
 were deducible from     a sufficient number of the observed values of
those components      in different and assigned localities.
    The calculation of these coefficients, a work of no ordinary
labour, was effected by the author of this theory ; and the results
which they afforded were compared with their values, as given by
observation,    at ninety-one      stations.    The discrepancies      between
observation and theory, which           were shown by these results, were
not more considerable than might have               been   expected from the
inadequate extent to which         the   calculations had been carried, and
from    the necessarily imperfect character of the data which              were
made subservient to them.         The calculation of the      same coefficients
was renewed, and greatly extended, by Petersen, under the direc
tion of the younger Erman,           at the request and expense         of the
British Association,     and the     results are    published amongst their
Reports    for 1847.     Some of these results        would    seem,  however,
rather to indicate defects in the theory than errors of the obser
vations, and it seems highly desirable, with a view of further testing
its correctness and applicability,        that   the calculations    should  be
resumed with the aid of more accurate and multiplied observations.
    In a subsequent memoir Gauss enters upon a discussion, which is
at once elementary and profound, of the general properties of the
same    potential function     which    plays so important       a part in the
" Allgemeine Theorie      des Erdmagnetismus,"        ending with a series of
propositions   on the relations of this function for a distribution          of

                                      598
magnetism — whether entirely         upon the surface       of  the  earth, or
within it, or in external   space — which      seem to be the ultimate con
clusions to which this theory has hitherto attained or is capable of
attaining.    This memoir presents a striking illustration of that happy
union of analytical skill with philosophical power for which his later
writings were so remarkable, and which puts them in striking con
trast with the obscurity and extreme compression of some of his
earlier productions.
    Gauss was born on the 30th of April, 1777.           After completing his
education at the Collegium        Carolinum,      he proceeded    to the  Uni
versity of GSttingen in 1795; he graduated at Helmstadt in 1799,
and afterwards resided as     a  private teacher in Brunswick until the
year 1807, when he was appointed Professor in the University of
Gottingen, and Director of the Observatory ; a situation which he
continued to retain for the remainder of his life. He was twice
married, and by his first wife, who died in 1809, he has left one sur
viving son, and by his second, two sons and a daughter, Theresa, to
whom he was tenderly attached, who nursed him, when his health
began to decline, with the greatest affection and care.
    During the last year of his life the decay of old age began to
manifest itself in a disease of the heart, and the usual symptoms
which     accompany it  ;   and he died       in great tranquillity on the
morning     of the 23rd of February        last.    " I assisted," writes the
Baron von Waltershausen,         one    of the most distinguished       of his
pupils, in   a letter communicating these facts, " with others of his
friends and pupils, in placing his body in his coffin, in binding a
laurel crown around his head, and in discharging with filial love and
reverence   the last honours of the great man, whose name is destined
 to take its place with those of Archimedes and Newton in the history
 of  the exacter sciences."   On   the 26th    of February, his body, which
had lain in state in the Rotunda of the Observatory, was followed
 to the grave by the whole University,           and by a vast multitude     of
 friends and admirers.
     George Simon Ohm        was   bora on the 16th of March, 1787, at
Erlangen in Bavaria, where his ancestors had been known as pros
perous and skilful locksmiths       for several generations.       His father's
intention    was, that he,   as well     as his    younger   brother,   Martin

                                      599
Ohm, should learn the family craft          ; but having himself acquired
an amount of knowledge         — especially   of mathematics — unusual in
his station of life, which he had found useful to him in his business,
he resolved that his boys should have the advantage of a superior
education before entering on their future calling, and accordingly,
after they had passed through the Elementary           School, he sent them
to the Gymnasium.         With such opportunities and the example of
their father, it is not to be wondered at that the talents of the two
brothers were rapidly developed.         A new    career opened   to them in
 1 804, when the celebrated mathematician Langsdorf having become
acquainted with their extraordinary progress, pronounced the judg
ment that some day they would            emulate the brothers Bernouilli.
He prepared     a certificate to this effect, which induced their father to
relinquish his intention of bringing       them up to his business, and to
allow them thenceforward to pursue a scientific career.
    George Simon Ohm entered          the University of Erlangen     when he
had completed       his sixteenth    year, but    he remained     there    only
eighteen months, leaving it to give instructions in mathematics in
Switzerland.      In August    1806 he became      a mathematical     tutor in
the Institute of Gottstadt near Nidau, in the Canton of Berne           ;  after
remaining     here two years and a half, he went to Neufchatel,           where
he spent the next two years and a        half  as a teacher of mathematics.
Towards the end of 1811 he returned to Erlangen, and, after taking
his degree,     entered on an academical course of life as          a  Privat-
 docent there.     This position, however, was merely temporary,              as
 well  as a tutorship which he    subsequently held at the
                                                              " Realschule "
 of Bamberg, which was soon dissolved.
    Ohm attained in 1817, for the first time, a suitable and permanent
 position as teacher of mathematics in the Great          (Jesuits') Gymna
 sium at Cologne, where the peculiar faculty he          possessed of repre
 senting the theory of mathematics in a comprehensive and attractive
 manner to the youthful understanding was soon recognized.                Ohm,
 however, had an ambition        higher than that of remaining         a mere
 mathematical teacher      ; his genius led him on to travel into the less
 trodden regions     of science, and to try his powers as an original
 inquirer.    It was not long before        he found a congenial     sphere   of
 action, and was led to discover the true explanation of the hitherto
 enigmatical phaenomena of the voltaic current.

                                         GOO
    In 1826   he obtained a long leave of absence         in order to proceed
to Berlin to perfect and publish his new theory, which appeared              in
1827 under the title       "The    Galvanic Circuit mathematically treated,
by Dr. G. S. Ohm."          When this work first     appeared,  it had not the
fortune to attract notice from the leading scientific men of the day,
nor did it gain for its author consideration or favour from the au-
rities then at the head of the affairs of education and learning            in
Prussia,   by whom,        indeed, he was received in        a manner which
showed an entire misapprehension of his scientific activity and of his
great merits.     His susceptibilities thus wounded,        he did not delay a
moment to declare that, after such a reception, it was impossible for
him to retain the appointment he held at Cologne.            With the  deepest
feelings of mortification       and grief, he left the place, thrown back
into private life with most precarious means           of existence, and de
prived of all the requisite resources for pursuing his investigations.
Seven of the best years of his life were in this way lost to science           ;
but from these      adverse    circumstances he was at last withdrawn        in
1833, when the Bavarian government appointed him Professor in the
Polytechnic    School at Nuremberg.
    Whilst Ohm was usefully employed in this new sphere, his theory
of the voltaic circuit began to be appreciated both at home and
abroad, and in 1841 the Royal Society of London awarded to him
the Copley Medal,       the highest honour in its power to bestow        ; and
to mark still more        its high estimation of the eminent services he
had rendered to science, he was elected, in 1842, a Foreign Member
of  the Society.     This judgment, it is acknowledged by his country
men,   had the effect of entirely removing the obstacles which had
hitherto  impeded his way         ; the conclusions    of his theory became
known as     " Ohm's laws
                               " in all
                                          elementary works on physics, and
throughout Europe his position was recognized             as among the most
eminent philosophers of Germany.
    Amidst his active duties        as  Rector of the Polytechnic School at
Nuremberg,      and    Professor      of Physics,   he found   time to make
advances    in  the  scientific    career which his theory of the voltaic
circuit had opened       to him.       Physicists have  long been convinced
that the various forces to which we ascribe the phenomena of Light,
Heat, Electricity and Magnetism,            must all have a common origin      ;
transformations of one series of phenomena to another have even been

                                        601
shown experimentally without            the    known   facts having     led to the
discovery of their intimate connexion.             To this important investi
gation    Ohm determined to devote            the remainder of his life. The
peculiar views which he had adopted             in his researches     in electricity
respecting the interior constitution of bodies and of the molecules of
which they consist, appeared       to him to throw        a   new light on the na
ture and co-relations of the forces referred to.              Following out    these
ideas, he established the general properties, form, and arrangement
of the molecules;   he attributed to them simple and polar powers; he
determined their relations to the various external actions, and thus
gradually formed    a   complete system, from which he saw the pheno
mena of light, heat, electricity and magnetism evolve themselves.
                                    '
  Of this projected work on             Molecular Physics,' only       one volume
has appeared,   which was published in 1849 under the general title of
" Contributions to Molecular Physics," vol.             i.,
                                            and with the special
title of  " Elements of Analytical Geometry of three dimensions
according to the system of oblique-angled co-ordinates."                   This in
troduction he thought necessary, because the ordinary mathematical
methods did not appear to him to apply themselves                to his ideas with
sufficient simplicity    and conciseness.          He dedicated this work to
the     Royal Society    of    London,        " whose approbation,"       he     says,
" tempered his courage, which had previously                   been    softened by
disheartening treatment, to renewed efforts in the field of science."
  Whilst Ohm      was,   with incessant industry, carrying out his great
undertaking, he was, towards the end of the year 1849, unexpectedly
called to fill the vacant place of Conservator of the Physical Collec
tion at Munich.     Agreeable as this appointment must have been to
him, and in accordance with the new scientific direction he had
taken, still the event    is   to be regretted, as the arrangement of the
Museum      and the construction          of new instruments          withdrew     his
attention from continuing and completing               his great work.      During
this time he published    a    memoir of great interest on the phenomena
of interference in uniaxal crystals.
   In    1852 changes occurred which           induced Ohm to relinquish the
official position he had gained in Munich and to become Professor
of Experimental Physics in        the   High School of that city.         Not con
tented to restrict himself to the customary demonstrations and ex
planations,   which would have cost him but little exertion, he pre

                                           602
 pared for his lectures a text-book on Physics, in which many                 of the
 subjects were treated         in a very original       manner.     This work was
 published in 1854.
    To complete, within       the limited time he saw before him, the labours
 he had undertaken, required unusual exertions, which his feeble con
 stitution did not enable him to support.              His friends remarked with
regret the gradual sinking of his forces from the beginning of 1854;
 he however continued his lectures until a renewed attack of apoplexy
suddenly terminated his life            on the      7th of July, 1854.       "Thus
ended,"      says   his biographer,      "  the noiseless life of a simple and
easily contented, but highly gifted man, who lived solely for science,
and who had neither sought nor found social advantages, honours,
wealth,     or what the world is accustomed to                consider as chiefly
contributing       to happiness."       About     a year before    his death, how
ever, the Cross of the Order          of Merit of St. Michael        was conferred
upon him, and he was also made                 a  member of the newly-founded
order of Maximilian.
    Ohm was a man of small stature.                   His countenance, although
usually earnest,       expressed his good nature and modesty.               He was
little inclined to conversation, but what            he spoke was the expression
of his soul, always full of matter, and frequently enlivened with wit
and sprightly humour.            In his life and habits        he   was extremely
simple, contented         and temperate.         He was fond of solitude, and
to this feeling, as well as to the unfavourable                circumstances with
which he was surrounded at the commencement of his career, was
it perhaps owing that           he never      sought to establish his domestic
happiness by marriage.
    Besides the works alluded to in this notice, he contributed twelve
papers    to   the   Journals of Schweigger and Poggendorff.                Two of
these relate to Acoustics, one to Physical             Optics, and the remainder
are on Electrical       subjects.    The latter consist principally of experi
mental verifications of his theory, some published before and some
after the appearance        of his mathematical treatise.
    The particulars      above   stated   are    derived almost entirely from a
detailed memoir on the life and writings of this eminent philosopher
communicated to the Royal Academy of Sciences of Munich by Dr.
J.  Lamont.

                                       603
    Rear-Admiral Sir William Edward Parry (Knight) was the
fourth son of the late Dr. Caleb Hillier Parry, F.R.S., an eminent
physician of Bath, who married Miss Rigby, sister of the late Dr.
Rigby of Norwich, and grand-daughter of Dr. Taylor, author of the
Hebrew Concordance.          He was born at Bath, Dec. 19th, 1790, and
received his education at the Grammar School of that city.             At the
age   of twelve    he entered the     Royal Navy under the patronage of
Admiral Lord Cornwallis, who commanded the Channel                 Fleet, and
                               '
had his flag flying in the       Ville  de Paris.'
    Intelligent,  active and ambitious, Parry soon introduced          himself
to notice, and we find the Admiral making this early mention of
him in    a letter to a friend.    " It is a  pity," he writes, " that Mr.
Parry had not gone to sea sooner, for he will be fit for promotion
long before his time is out."          In 1806 Mr. Parry joined the 'Tri
                                                                '              '
bune,' Captain      Thomas Baker,       and  subsequently the     Vanguard
 under the command of the same officer, with whom he served the
remainder of his time as midshipman.           On the 6th of January,    1810,
 he was promoted to the rank          of lieutenant, and appointed to the
 '
   Alexandria,'    Captain Quilliam, employed in protecting the Spitz-
bergen Whale Fishery,        and thus became first acquainted with that
 vast icy element with which in after years he was destined to con
 tend.     He subsequently     served   in the ' Hogue,' ' Maidstone,' and
             '
lastly the Niger,' Captain Samuel Jackson, C.B.               While in the
 '
   Hogue,' he accompanied a detachment of boats, and assisted in
the destruction of twenty-seven of the enemy's vessels, three of
 which were heavy privateers.         This and   some sharp skirmishes with
the gunboats of Denmark, are the only actions with the enemy that
fell to the lot of the subject of our memoir, as the peace of 1815
happily put an end to all such exploits.
    In  1817 the dangerous state of his father's health obliged him to
proceed to England on leave, an event of a momentous character in
the career of Parry, for it was at this period that Sir John Barrow
brought to the notice of the Admiralty the           extraordinary    changes
which had been reported to have occurred in the state of the Polar
ice, and the remarkable       advance    to a high northern    latitude that
had been made        by Captain    Scoresby in a whale-ship,      and   urged
upon the Government the project of renewing the attempts which
had been formerly made to reach Behring's            Strait by way of      the

                                        604
 Polar sea.      Hence the commencement of that series of northern
 voyages, which have         so much redounded        to the honour       of this
 country, and which afforded to the subject of our memoir an oppor
 tunity for the exercise of those high qualifications          for the conduct
 of  an   arduous and difficult       undertaking,   which so conspicuously
 marked his character.
    The Admiralty having determined upon sending out two                    expe
 ditions to the Arctic seas, one in the direction of Spitzbergen              and
 the other through      Baffin's   Bay, Lieutenant     Parry was    selected   for
 this service, and on the 14th of January, 1818, he was appointed to
                         ' Alexander,' a hired vessel commissioned for the
 the command of the
 purpose of accompanying           Captain, afterwards Sir John, Ross on         a
 voyage for the discovery of a north-west         passage by way      of Davis's
 Strait.
    The Expedition quitted England in April 1818, and although un
 successful in the accomplishment of the great object of the under
taking, succeeded in circumnavigating          Baffin's Bay, and in restoring
to that arm of the sea its outline       — which had     been erased from our
charts — nearly    as it had    been   drawn by the early navigator whose
honoured name it so deservedly commemorates.
    The examination, however, of the various sounds which broke
the outline    of that inland    sea had not been made by the        Expedition
with that    care which was necessary to satisfy the        inquiring spirit of
Parry, more especially with regard to a wide opening in the coast,
to which Baffin had assigned the name of Sir John                   Lancaster's
Sound.      This opening, which        when discovered by our navigators
had excited the brightest expectations, and from which                Parry and
his associates    had been compelled to return with the utmost regret,
Parry    on his arrival in    England found to his astonishment repre
sented as closed by a      lofty range of mountains bearing the name of
the first Secretary    of  the  Admiralty, Mr. Croker, barring all progress
to further discovery in that direction.
    The indignation     of Parry at this extraordinary misrepresentation
may be imagined, and he did not flinch from the responsibility of dis
closing his sentiments to the Admiralty, who immediately determined
upon sending another expedition to the same quarter to decide the ques
                                                       '        '      '         '
tion.    Accordingly   in the spring of    1819  the     Hecla    and    Griper
were fitted for the purpose, and the command entrusted to Lieu

                                      605
tenant Parry.       The Expedition quitted England        in May 1819, and
reached Davis's Strait early in        July.     The progress of the ships
being arrested by the ice, which         at the early part of the summer
was known to the whalers to occupy the upper part of Baffin's Bay,
the character of Parry at once showed itself, by a prompt deter
mination to attempt a passage through the opposing boundary.              He
accordingly     dashed into the ice with both his ships with a boldness
which deserved       success, and accomplished a passage        through this
great barrier, till then considered impenetrable.
    The Expedition reached Lancaster's Sound on the 1st of August,
and found     it entirely free from ice. " We were now," says Parry,
" about to explore that great inlet which had obtained a celebrity
beyond what it might otherwise have been considered entitled to
possess, from the opposite opinions which had been held          with regard
to it, and it will be readily conceived how anxious we were to ad
vance."     His   suspense   was not of long duration, for in a very few
days he had the high gratification to be able         to clear up all doubt,
by the advance of the ships over that imaginary chain of mountains
which had been drawn across          the Sound as     if purposely to disarm
inquiry, and by the discovery of a wide and magnificent strait open
 ing out into the Polar     sea, to which was given the name      of Barrow,
 as a well- deserved   compliment to the second Secretary of the Admi
 ralty as the strenuous promoter of Arctic discovery.
    Hour after hour rolled away, and the ships continued their unin
 terrupted progress upon a direct course for Behring's Strait. Who
but Parry himself could know the feelings which filled his anxious
 mind at that time       !   His  associates,   as they witnessed the   clear
 open sea rise in the horizon mile after mile, might be elated at the
 brilliant prospect before them ; but with Parry the enjoyment was
 heightened by the full realization of his hopes in this part of his
 voyage, and by the reflection that the serious responsibility        he had
 incurred before leaving England would now redound to his honour.
    Our limited    space   will not permit    us to dwell  upon the eventful
progress of this, one of the most memorable of the Polar voyages.
 Suffice it to observe, that it was upon this occasion our navigators
discovered the great opening into the Polar sea on the west, Prince
Regent's Inlet on the south, Wellington Channel on the north, cele
brated in after years        as the   supposed route of the gallant       and

                                       606
  unfortunate   Franklin,   and   farther west the islands known        as the
  Parry Group, beyond which no subsequent expedition, with all the
  modern improvements and appliances of steam,             has been    able to
 proceed   ; and lastly, they discovered Banks's Land in the south-west,
  memorable as the furthest point afterwards reached by M'Clure
 from the opposite direction    ;   an achievement which rendered certain
 the existence of the long-sought north-west passage.           Between this
 land and the Parry Group          there was stretched      an  impenetrable
 barrier of ice, which from that time to the present has baffled         every
 effort of our ships, and is the only small tract remaining              to be
 navigated to render evident the practicability       of the passage.
    But although the endeavours of Parry were not crowned with
 success, as regarded the main object of the Expedition, yet it will
 always remain as a bright feature in his distinguished           career, that
 he   achieved the discovery of those two          remarkable terminating
 points — the
                " ultima  Thule
                                "
                                    of the navigation   both from the east
 and from the west, which no ship from either quarter has yet been
 able to pass.
    Parry in his route towards this terminating point of his disco
 veries had passed the meridian of 1 10° west, and the Expedition be
 came entitled to the reward of £5000,         which had been offered by
 the Government as an encouragement to           Arctic enterprize.
    After an anxious and    unavailing suspense in the hope of a favour
able change    in the ice,  Parry put into port, to pass the first dreary
winter ever encountered by a Government expedition              in so high a
latitude  :  and here the qualities of Parry, which among others so
peculiarly fitted him for the conduct of such an undertaking, were
displayed in a remarkable manner, in the arrangements of the ship
and the establishment of those wholesome regulations for the health
and comfort of the crew, and for the occupation of the mind, which
he knew so well to be essential to the bodily vigour of the seaman,
and to the prevention      of that fatal   disease the scurvy, which had
almost invariably attended previous attempts to brave a winter in
the Arctic regions.
   Aware of the influence of personal example, he took an active
part in the theatrical entertainments which were got up for the di
version of the crew, and being an excellent actor, he contributed in
no small degree to their success.        On the other hand,    he was inde

                                             607
fatigable    in all astronomical observations, which were carried on
night after night upon the snow, with the thermometer frequently
30° below zero, when it was necessary to keep the chronometer in hot
sand to prevent its stopping, and to case the telescope               in soft leather
to prevent its destroying the skin of the face of the observer.                   We
mention these facts once for all, as they serve to illustrate the zeal
and determination which marked his character, and how by force of
example he stimulated those who had the happiness to serve under
his command.          In this case the effect was the         establishment of the
geographical position of his winter quarters with a degree of accu
racy probably never attained by any Expedition in the same time,
even   in a milder latitude      ;  the lunar observations         alone amounting
to nearly 10,000.
   As  the spring advanced         he conducted an overland journey            across
Melville Island, and discovered the                sea on the   north and Liddon
Gulf on the west, where            he left his broken cart, which served            to
mark indisputably his position to M'Clintock, who visited the spot
thirty years afterwards and found the precious relic.
   The summer of 1820 had well-nigh passed away before there was
any possibility of liberating the ships from their winter quarters,
and there being no prospect of a change in the great barrier of ice
which    covered     the sea in every direction,         and which       indeed had
never varied, Parry determined upon returning                  to   England, where
he arrived in October 1820.
   As might      be expected,      his reception by his country was enthu
siastic and most gratifying          to him.       He was immediately promoted
to the rank of Commander.                Bath, his native place, presented him
with the    freedom     of its city    ;  the Bedfordean gold medal         was una
nimously voted to him with            a sum     of 500 guineas   ;  and he was pre
sented with     a  silver vase, bearing ornamental devices             emblematical
of the Polar regions.
   In December of the           same       year it was determined          to follow
up Arctic discovery by another Expedition,                the command of which
was again given to Parry.                  The attempt on this occasion           was
to be made        by way of Hudson's             Strait and Sir Thomas Rowe's
Welcome.          The    Expedition         left  England    in    May    1821,   and
succeeded     in making important            additions to the geography of the
Arctic   seas, in clearing up various doubts respecting the statements
    vol. vir.                                                           3 a

                                     008
of early navigators, and in the discovery of a strait leading from
Sir Thomas Rowe's Welcome          into Prince Regent's Inlet.      But the
undertaking failed in its main object.        The strait, which was named
after the 'Hecla' and 'Fury,' and which proved to be the only outlet,
was found to be impassable, and Parry, after passing two winters
and encountering frequent and imminent perils from the rapid tides
and whirling masses       of ice which beset      the ships and irresistibly
carried   them away      from   their  positions,    returned  to England.
Parry's narrative of this Expedition      is one of  the most interesting  of
the Polar voyages, from     the long and intimate intercourse which was
held with the Esquimaux        tribes, and the exquisite embellishments
from the pencil of his colleague Captain Lyon.
   Immediately on the return of the Expedition, the Admiralty marked
the high estimation in which they held the services of its commander
by promoting him to the rank of Captain, and appointing him Acting
Hydrographer,     and the City of Winchester honoured him with its
freedom.
   A year of    repose  had scarcely elapsed when Captain Parry was
summoned to take command of another Expedition destined to renew
the attempt to reach       Behring's   Strait by way of Prince Regent's
Inlet in connexion      with an overland expedition          under   Captain
Franklin.     Parry left England in 1825 and succeeded        only in reach
ing Port Bowen, where he passed            his fourth dreary winter in the
Arctic regions,    and after experiencing      great peril in the following
summer from the ice and tides, which occasioned the loss of one of
the ships and very nearly that of the other, he returned home.
   This was the last of the Expeditions in a north-western direction
under Captain Parry. The great energy and perseverance which
had been displayed by him on all these occasions left no doubt in
the minds of the Admiralty that further efforts in the same direction
were likely to be fruitless, and for    a  while Arctic exploration had     a
respite.    In these   memorable voyages, under the command of the
subject of our memoir, large acquisitions had been made to the geo
graphy of the Polar seas, and science had been promoted by nume
rous observations of a highly interesting         and   important character,
some   of which formed the subject of papers            in the Transactions
of this Society, by Captain Parry and his distinguished associates,
Colonel Sabine and Lieutenant H. Forster.

                                      609
   It was   seen, that, under able management and proper discipline,
a winter   in the Arctic regions could        be passed,    not only without
those dreadful     ravages   which    characterized the early voyages to
those seas, but with as little     if not  less than the average     mortality
of mankind in civilized countries.
   Captain Parry was now confirmed in his office as Hydrographer,
and he was honoured by the freedom of the Borough of Lynn.                     In
the autumn of this year Parry determined, since no passage could
be found in a north-western      direction, to propose to the Admiralty
to renew the attempt to reach       a high northern latitude by travelling
over the vast expanse of ice which occupied the Spitzbergen                seas.
As early  as 1818 a plan for effecting this object by means             of light
boats drawn by dogs had been submitted to the Admiralty by the
late Sir John Franklin and his       associate   in the ' Trent,' Lieutenant,
now Admiral, Beechey, and Parry now undertook to carry it into
effect by means      of rein-deer.     He accordingly sailed in       1827    for
Hammerfest, and taking on board a sufficient number of               these ani
mals proceeded     to Spitzbergen,    where he quitted his ship and com
menced his perilous journey.
   Those persons only who have seen the Spitzbergen ice and are
acquainted with its rugged surface and the deep pools of water in
its hollows, can judge of the enormous labour and difficulty in tra
velling over it.     Yet Parry overcame        these  difficulties, and had it
not been that the ice at length was found to have a motion to the
southward     nearly as fast as his party could advance to the north
ward, he would certainly       have    accomplished his object.          All his
efforts, however, were frustrated       by this unforeseen circumstance,
and after travelling     660 miles, a distance more than sufficient to
reach the Pole in a direct line from where he set out, he found him
self compelled to return.        With what reluctance         he submitted to
this may be gathered from his journal, in which he observes,            " dreary
and cheerless as were the scenes we were about to leave, we never
turned homewards with so little satisfaction as on this occasion."
His furthest point reached on this journey was 82° 45' N.,            a  parallel
which far exceeded      any well-authenticated       advance    which had ever
been made before.       Had   he been     able   to accomplish fifteen miles
more he would      have   been entitled to the reward of one thousand
pounds offered by the Government so long back           as the days  of Phipps.
                                                                 3 G 2

                                       610
    On his return to England        he resumed his duties as Hydrographer
at the Admiralty,      where he continued until 1829, when he accepted
the office of Commissioner for the management of the affairs of the
Australian      Company.        Before   quitting England the King was
pleased    to mark his approbation of his services by conferring         upon
him the honour of Knighthood.            The University of Oxford bestowed
 upon him the degree         of  D.C.L.,  he was elected a Fellow of this
 Society, and made an Honorary          Member of the St. Petersburg Aca
 demy of Sciences, and also        a Member of the Royal Irish Academy.
     On his arrival in Australia he took up his residence at Port
 Stephen, a beautiful little bay about sixty miles to the north of
 Sydney.      The quiet repose of this delightful spot was quite in uni
 son   with   the   mind of Parry,     and while  zealously discharging    bis
 duties as Commissioner          of the Colony, he managed        to promote
 among the colonists by whom he was surrounded, a spirit of piety
 and devotion to which they had before been           strangers.    He built a
 church, in which, in the absence         of any authorized clergyman, he
 officiated himself.
    After  a residence of five years in Australia he returned to     England,
 and accepted the office of Poor        Law Commissioner in     the  county of
 Norfolk.     The duties of this appointment were, however, by no
 means    congenial to Parry.       He was frequently called upon to adju
dicate in cases in which his judgment            was   at variance with his
feelings, and in about      a year he   resigned his appointment.
    About this time he was selected to organize and conduct          a newly-
created     department of the public service with the title of Comp
troller of Steam Machinery,          and continued to discharge the duties
of this office with zeal and ability for ten years.        During that time
he saw introduced into the        Royal Navy the screw-propeller, now       so
justly regarded     as indispensable in our fleets, and did much to extend
and improve the steam power of this country.
    In   1847,   finding   his health begin to     suffer from the onerous
duties of his office, he accepted       the appointment of Captain Super
intendent of Haslar Hospital,         which he held until his promotion to
his Flag.
    In 1853,      the  Lieutenant-Governorship      of Greenwich      Hospital
 falling vacant, it was offered to Sir Edward Parry, who accepted it,
 greatly to the satisfaction of his friends, who rejoiced in the expec

                                       611
tation that the quiet duties of that appointment would be beneficial
to his general health, for they could not fail to notice the inroads
which a life of so laborious and anxious          a character had made upon
his constitution.     Scarcely, however, had six months elapsed before
symptoms of a dangerous and painful                disease  became     apparent.
The probable fatal tendency of this complaint was well known to
Parry, but he bore up against its painful effects with christian forti
tude, cheerfulness and resignation.
    Towards 1855 the approaching fatal termination of his complaint
became but too evident, and at the recommendation                of his medical
advisers he determined to try the waters of Ems, but his bodily
strength was unequal to the journey.           He was detained for      a time at
Coblentz by exhaustion       ;  and reached Ems, only to end there his
days, for on the 8th of     July, 1855, it     pleased  the Almighty disposer
of   events  to bring to   a close   his long and varied life of usefulness.
Perfectly resigned and full of humble hope he breathed his last, sur
rounded by his mourning family          ;  giving   proof in the closing     mo
ments of his existence of the blessed effects of that spirit of piety
and devotion which he had so ardently cultivated throughout his life.
His remains were conveyed to England             and interred  with honours in
 Greenwich Hospital.
    Thus terminated the      career of one of the most distinguished offi
cers of the age    in which    he lived, a career as varied and eventful as
it was honourable and prosperous           : gifted with talents of a general
character, he performed with credit whatever he undertook                ; but in
none of his appointments          was he more successful than in that of
commander of those expeditions of discovery which have so much
contributed to his own fame and the honour of his country.
    As  a member    of society, no one stood higher in general estima
tion  :  kind,  affectionate,    of high moral and religious         principles,
charitable and humane, his memory will long be cherished in quarters
where good men most desire            to be remembered, more particularly
 in the wards of Haslar Hospital, and in those useful charitable in
stitutions   known    as the Sailor's     Homes, asylums for the humble
members     of his profession, for whose temporal            and   spiritual  im
provement he had always so strenuously laboured.
   Parry left several works behind him.             Besides the narratives of
his voyages, we find his name associated with three papers in the

                                    612
Transactions    of this Society.     A small volume on ' Astronomy
                                                           '
by Night,' published early in life ; a volume on the Parental Cha
                                                               '
racter of God,' now undergoing a fifth edition ; and an Address to
the Sailor.'   His correspondence with the Admiralty, who consulted
him upon all matters connected with the Arctic seas and the search
for Sir John Franklin, is voluminous, and with his journals and ob
servations have    always been     considered   most valuable     ;  and his
voyages will long keep their places       by the side of those of Cook,
Anson, Vancouver, and other great navigators.           The high estima
tion in which Parry was held by the Admiralty is marked by these
frequent appeals to his opinion, as well as by all his appointments,
and by   a good-service pension being bestowed upon him        ; and lastly,
by their reply to the Governor of Greenwich Hospital          on being in
formed of his death, viz. that it was with deep regret they learnt
that Her Majesty's Service had been deprived of so distinguished an
ornament as Sir Edward Parry.
   Sir Edward Parry married in 1827 Isabella Louisa, the fourth
daughter of the late Lord Stanley of Alderley, who died in May
1839;    and secondly, Catherine Edwards, daughter of the Rev. R.
E. Hawkinson,     and widow of Samuel Hoare, Esq., and left several
children.
   Richard Sheepshanks was born at Leeds, July             30, 1794.      His
father was engaged in the cloth manufacture, and destined his son
to the same pursuit.      At the  age  of fifteen, however, and after      an
ordinary school education, the son discovered his own preference
for a learned profession,      and the father accordingly       placed him
under the care of James Tate, head of the school at Richmond in
Yorkshire, well known      as one of the most successful teachers       of his
day.    Here   he  remained until 1812, when he was removed to
Trinity College, Cambridge.        He took his    degree  with honours in
 1816, obtained a fellowship      in the next year, and proceeded to
study for the bar, to which he was called about 1822.          A weakness
of sight, to which    he was always subject, is supposed      to have been
the principal  cause   of his not practising law   : but it must be added
that his share of his father's property placed him in easy circum
stances,   independently of his fellowship,     and  his taste for science
had   become   very decided.     He took orders about 1824,         and  soon

                                      613
 began to devote himself entirely to astronomy.           He   became a   Fel
 low of the Astronomical        Society in 1834, and of this Society in
  1830.    Though often actively engaged in our behalf, and serving
 on the Council in 1832, his pursuits led him towards the Astrono
 mical Society,    of which   he was always    one of the most active       of
 the executive body.      His leisure, and his desire to help       the young
 astronomer     so long  as he    wanted advice and guidance, gave           a
 peculiar value to his services, and a peculiar utility to his career.
    Mr. Sheepshanks resided in London till about 1842, when                he
 removed to Reading, where he died of apoplexy, August 4, 1855.
 There is much reason to suppose       that his life was shortened by his
 laborious exertions in the restoration of the standard scale.
    Though an ardent politician of the school of opinion which had
 to struggle for existence during the first half of his life, but gradu
ally  became victorious in the second, he never took any public part
 in a political question, except that   of the Reform    Bill.   He was   one
 of the Boundary Commissioners appointed in 1831 to fix the boun
 daries of boroughs under the new system of representation.               His
reading in politics and history was extensive, especially in military
matters, with which he was very well acquainted        ;  both ancient and
modern tactics, from the best sources, having formed a portion, and
no inconsiderable     portion,  of his studies.    To this must      be added
literature   and poetry, to which he was much attached            :  he never
abandoned classical reading, and those who knew him best were
often surprised at the extent to which he had cultivated               modern
literature.
    But his subject was astronomy, and his especial part of that sub
ject was the astronomical instrument.       His reputation among astro
nomers on this point, and the articles which he contributed to the
'Penny Cyclopaedia,' may allow us to regret that he did not draw up
a full treatise on a matter which he had so completely fathomed.
    Mr. Sheepshanks was engaged in active efforts on several special
occasions, to which we make brief allusion.           In 1828 he joined
Mr. Airy in the pendulum operations in Cornwall, and suggested
some of the most important plans of operation.           In 1828 and 1829
he was active     in the establishment of the Cambridge Observatory.
In  1832 he    was consulted on the part of the Admiralty, with refer
ence to the edition     then preparing    of Groombridge's      Circumpolar

                                         614
Catalogue     : the result was the appearance             of that work in     a much
more    efficient and more creditable            form than it would otherwise
have appeared      in.    In  1832 he also interfered in a matter to           which,
connected as it is with personal differences, we can only here allude,
as  eliciting much information            on the subject of equatorial instru
ments in general      ;  a result which is entirely due to the part taken
by Mr. Sheepshanks.              In   1838   he was engaged         in the chrono-
metric determination          of the longitudes of Antwerp            and Brussels    :
in 1844    in that of Valentia, Kingstown,              and   Liverpool.     In 1843
and 1844, the subject of the Liverpool Observatory led him into a
controversy, his pamphlets on which will be useful study to those
who are interested in astronomical instruments.                  He was always an
active member       of the Board of Visitors at the Royal Observatory at
Greenwich.
   Mr. Sheepshanks was             a member of both          the  Commissions (of
1838 and 1843) for the restoration of the standards of measure and
weight, destroyed by fire in 1834.               The standard of measure was
placed in the hands of Francis Baily, at whose death                     Mr. Sheep
shanks volunteered (Nov. 30, 1844) to continue the restoration.
This matter occupied him closely during the last eleven years of
his life.    It would   not be possible for us to give any detailed account
of  the operation,      a  full history of which is to       come from the      Astro
nomer Royal.         We     need   only say, that after      a  thorough examina
tion of the process, beginning with the very construction                    of ther
mometers, — a point which              gave   no small trouble, — results were
obtained which were embodied in                a   bill which received the royal
assent    on the day following that on which                Mr. Sheepshanks was
struck by the shock which ended his life.                The number of       recorded
micrometer observations is just five hundred short of ninety thou
sand.
   Mr. Sheepshanks was especially distinguished by                   the integrity  of
his mind, and by his utter renunciation of self in all his pursuits.
He did not court fame           :  it was enough for him that there was a
useful object which could be advanced by the help of his time, his
thought, and his purse.             His consideration for others was made
manifest by his active kindness to those with whom he was engaged,
and no less by his ready appreciation of the merits of those against
whom he had to contend in defence                 of truth and justice,       as they

                                       015
appeared to his mind.            Nor must    we omit to add, while      using a
qualifying expression to save the right of free opinion, and to avoid
implying a decision which is not within our province, that in every
one of his controversies, that which was truth and justice to the
mind of Mr. Sheepshanks was nothing less to the minds of very
many from whom no thinking man would differ without                    cautious
examination.         He was    a devoted  friend and a formidable opponent.
    On the motion of         J.  P Gassiot, Esq.,   seconded   by the Rev. Dr.
Booth, the thanks of the Society were given to the President for his
excellent address, and his Lordship was requested           to permit the same
to be printed.
    Dr. Roget and William Spence, Esq. having, with the consent of
